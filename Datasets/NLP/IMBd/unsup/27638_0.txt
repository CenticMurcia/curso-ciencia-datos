"Texas Tom" isn't particularly one of my favorite Tom & Jerry's cartoons, but still it is great fun. While not one of their finest, it does not disappoint in any way. Besides, this is a different Tom & Jerry's cartoon because it takes us to the old Texas, to the generation of cowboys, which makes this a western. Yet, this has the advantage of being much more pleasant than any live-action western movie. There's no doubt that some things only work in cartoons.<br /><br />The story is generally good, the artwork of high quality and the jokes are typically... Tom & Jerry. Curiously, an excerpt from this cartoon is used in "Cruise Cat", in a funny sequence when Tom and Jerry watch themselves at the cinema, in "Texas Tom" - which is and isn't an amusement for both of them.<br /><br />Lots of funny gags are a reality here. For example, it's hilarious to see Tom pretending to sing "If you're ever down in Texas, look me up" and playing a guitar at the same time (while he hears the record), to seduce the cowgirl (the well known Toodles, Tom's passion), but Jerry makes the whole thing even funnier when he decides to give wings to his own sense of fun: he ruins Tom's plan by changing the speed on the record player, which causes Tom to sing very quickly and then extremely slowly (with a typical cowboy voice). That is so hilarious!<br /><br />I also find very funny when Tom is disguised as a cowboy and walks like one, rolls up a cigarette by using Jerry, a gun to light the cigarette and then smokes it to puff out the word "Howdy". And all of this very much in a style that resembles legendary stars from the 1950's, such as Elvis Presley and James Dean.<br /><br />Soon, we also get to see Tom having some conflicts with a big bull, thanks to Jerry and his sense of fun.<br /><br />Overall, a good cartoon that should not disappoint the fans of Tom & Jerry.
