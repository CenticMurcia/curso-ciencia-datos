all i wanted to comment on was the fact that the creators of this film seemed to do absolutely no visiting of Toledo. wherever it was that they shot this movie looks nothing like Toledo and nothing referenced or shown in the film is in Toledo not even the skyline shown in the film. i mean couldn't they just shoot the film in Toledo for crying out loud or at least try to learn about the city before trying to represent it on film. the movie itself was horrible too but with a great cast. i just was so upset as a Toledo filmmaker myself that they would disrespect my city so much by ignoring it and using the name in its film.
