Interesting film. Weird story, indeed, that makes you think a bit. But I found it quite unforgivable that you simply can't believe in the first part of the movie the main character is a man. Filmed already in these times of CGI and make up professionals, I can't understand why the filmmakers didn't make the actress look more like a man. Or, if this was too much a hard thing to do, why they didn't choose a real man to act in the first minutes. This is too obvious and too much disturbing not to rate the movie as high as it could have been. It leaves you with the feeling that the people who made this really didn't care enough about their work, or didn't think we deserved a clean job.
