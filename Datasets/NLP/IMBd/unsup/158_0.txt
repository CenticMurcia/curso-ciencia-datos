This is a true classic starring Orson Wells in one of his best performances probably only surpassed by his classic "Citizen Kane. The end is a real tear-jerker no matter how many times you watch it and this is one to keep in your permanent.<br /><br />The story is classic (man goes to war and returns later to find his wife re-married)but there are twists and turns leaving you to discuss later what you might have done or wanted.<br /><br />This is a great movie without having to rely on special effects, vulgar language, computer generated whatevers, it has survived all these years on the quality of the actors, story line and the ability to keep the viewer interested through the last scene.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
