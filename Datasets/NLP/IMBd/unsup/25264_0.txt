This is the kind of tribute rat pack fans can do without. I find it insulting that someone with such little talent as RW, feels he can make a record and movie of this nature. <br /><br />One can only hope that this kind of thing does not reappear when the next lucky, totally over rated boy band member attempts the same thing. Be sure it will happen. God help us. <br /><br />The thing that really makes this film annoying is, of course that William's' voice is not up to scratch, some would argue the man sounds bad enough when he churns out his usual brand of soulless pop rubbish, let alone try and match the vocal talents of the the original artist. Do your self a favour, bin this and seek out some footage of the real rat pack.
