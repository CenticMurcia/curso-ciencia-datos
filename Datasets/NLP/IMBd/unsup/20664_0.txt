I thought this was a very good action piece the guys from triton north star have done it again. Bas Rutten makes a great bad guy, and as for Diana Lee Inosanto she can beat me with a police baton any day. All in all this was solid action movie with some well thought out action set pieces. And Paul Logan gives a solid performance. I thing a lot of these straight to video movies good take some lessons form these guys. And watching some of the extras it really seems like everyone had fun making this movie. I can't wait to see what these guys will make next each one of their productions they seem to raise the bar. Once again I think this movie was just a lot of fun and that is what it's all about.
