I had heard superlative comments on this film and it does not disappoint.<br /><br />Paris is the backdrop and what a Paris, A Paris of La Boheme and the Merry Widow. Audrey is brilliant in the role of Amelie, projecting a true joie de vivre.<br /><br />The film is full of surprises in both plot and characters. I left the theatre feeling lighter. It is truly one of a kind, eccentric, unusual and uplifting. I will not say more on it as it would spoil the fun.<br /><br />I gave it a 10 out of 10 for something so completely out of the ordinary and so very unhollywood.
