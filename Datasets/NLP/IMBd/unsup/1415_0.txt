This is one of my all-time favourite horror movies (right up there with Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and EVIL DEAD). Even though it's old and creaky, even though it's mannered and any violence happens discretely off-camera, THE BLACK CAT somehow has the power to make me feel uneasy.<br /><br />Even though it has some weird stuff happening, like Lugosi telling his loyal servant to obey Karloff (does he REALLY switch sides, or is he only pretending as Lugosi told him too?) and Lugosi not just shooting Karloff when he has the chance, the creepiest thing in the whole movie is that after marrying Lugosi's wife, Karloff now sleeps with his step-daughter. Now THAT is messed up!<br /><br />Other highlights are the skin-flaying scene (really nasty) and the oddball black mass (where did all those people come from and how did they get to the mansion when the innocent young couple found it impossible to leave?)<br /><br />THE BLACK CAT is an odd and uneasy treat and if you enjoy it based on this recommendation, try BLACK Friday which can be found in the same Lugosi box set.
