I occasionally get sick of romantic comedies, but the other kind of chick flick--namely, the kind having to do with that pure, gushy family love--I just can't get enough of. Plus, they managed to weave this one into a suspense/thriller, and threw in another one of my favorite fictional concepts for good measure: time travel, in this film represented by the parallel dimension through which a son speaks to his father before his death 30 years ago.<br /><br />In fact, anyone who loves "Back to the Future" for the same reasons I do will gobble up the brain candy in "Frequency." The ways in which the film deals with the thought-provoking concept of changing the past, while certainly blasphemous to the field of physics, sparks some interesting conversation after the credits. <br /><br />The eerie curlicues of smoky clouds shown in the sky at various intervals attest to the fact that the makers of "Frequency" do not pretend to have a logical explanation for how two men can be using the same radio at the same desk in the same house to be speaking to each other over a distance of 30 years. <br /><br />I was so captivated by the secondary plot, an old unsolved murder case that quickly becomes personal when father and son play G-d, that I didn't have a chance to care about the unidimensionality of most of the characters, the flavorless dialogue or the predictability of the action. My jetlagged eyes were glued to the poor reception I have for a screen for the duration of the film. <br /><br />Retrospectively, it was no piece of art! I can safely say that movies like this are much better while you're watching them, but what are movies for? This one was great.
