'Wonderland' is a story about ordinary people told in an extraordinarily beautiful way.<br /><br />The visual style of the film draws you close--you're not watching a movie, but you are an observer, an eavesdropper on the lives of a South London family and their friends. It's almost as if you saw someone on the bus, and then were able to follow them to their home and around where they work, unseen, for a few days. You believe these people exist, in reality--you _recognize_ these characters because you've seen them before.<br /><br />There's an incredible musical score by Michael Nyman. It supports and builds the drama of the story, and illuminates the inner struggles of the characters.<br /><br />It's a beautiful movie. Fans of Wong Kar-Wai's ChungKing Express will enjoy this.<br /><br />I saw this movie at a Saturday midnight showing in Barcelona, with Spanish subtitles. You could feel the emotion run through the audience. Everyone stayed for the credits.<br /><br />
