I have seen this show three times, the first time was because I was flicking through channels and I thought it was a really stupid commercial. I soon realized that it was in fact a TV show, and I could not believe that it was possible to have a show this awful on television. The second time I watched the show was again out of disbelief because I still thought it was an animated short whipped up by the network during a commercial break. The jokes are not funny, too much live acting, and no story makes this show the perfect recipe for failure that any creator/producer would have nightmares about being part of. The third time was because I knew that it was an actual show by now, and I realized that there must be an audience. So, I sat through it to see what was great about it. I didn't laugh once; there was no story, no plot, nothing! Not even any animation! It's like someone just took pictures of each page in a children's book with illustrations, and recorded themselves reading it, and then called it an animated production. However, a children's book has a plot, and effort.<br /><br />I am not exaggerating the slightest bit here, if you don't believe me, watch it for yourself. It was obviously bad enough that I went out of my way to make an account on this website, just so I could comment on how appalling this show is. Watch it for yourself, and if you have any appreciation for animation, you'll make an account on here too.<br /><br />Someone please start a petition to get this show canceled so that real animated productions can take its place!
