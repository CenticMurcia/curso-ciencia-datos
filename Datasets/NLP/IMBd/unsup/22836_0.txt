I'm a real big fan of those animal grows big and kills teenagers movies. What just love the causes why those animals become monster and in this movie, it was one of the most ridiculous I've ever seen. My girlfriend was snoring in my arms after 5 minutes but I laughed a lot that night. Some good SFX adds a point up to 2 from 10 points. This movie really is bad, but as always, great entertainment.
