Terror on Tour starts out very bad. It never improves. It just gets worse and worse until the end and this ending will make your head hurt. No movie has ever caused as much mental anguish for me as Terror On Tour.<br /><br />I want you to think of the worst movie you have ever seen. Terror On Tour is ten times worse. Probably one million times worse. I do not know how this production came about on such a horrible premise. I also can not fathom how they chose such horrible and ugly actors to bring it to life. This kind of cinematic Hell just takes the fun out of movies.<br /><br />Terror on Tour is rot. I really think you should see this if you like bad things. Sometimes movies get so bad that they actually pollute the Earth. I do not know how anything can get worse then this.
