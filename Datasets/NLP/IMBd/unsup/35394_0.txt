I can't imagine why someone didn't remind the people responsible for this film that in order to have a movie, you need a screenplay. The writing was egregiously bad, the story was uncompelling and trite, the direction was lackluster, the editing was atrocious, and although the actors try valiantly none of them come off at all well. Sometimes it's just bad casting - Carol Kane has the ability to lower the overall quality of any film and whoever they cast as that rock star should definitely keep his day job. The snotty popular girl was wooden and looked like a model who just started taking acting classes. Lindsay Lohen, although a talented actress, was dressed like a 9th Avenue hooker and looked about 35 years old.<br /><br />On the Disney channel they hyped the hell out of this film, featuring the director prominently (who looked like the director Peter Sellars' annoying younger sister). I'm glad she had fun making the film, but instead of making home movies during her shoot she might have paid more attention to the complete and utter mess her film was turning out to be. Parents really resent being dragged to this kind of film, especially when there are films around like Finding Nemo, which are actually entertaining for everyone.
