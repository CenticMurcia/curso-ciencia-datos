You know those twilight zone episodes where you are instantly enraptured into the plot and then at the end there is a surprise twist, and all of a sudden the episode come across differently? And you are shocked and awed by what happens.. <br /><br />Well I think the makers of this movie were going for this but instead decided to fire the writer halfway thru and get someone else entirely that could bandage the rest of the plot and jam the contents of their script in with the previous writers story. <br /><br />It reeks of it. The ending is one of the worst I've ever seen. (SPOILER/ It says hey look we took this amount of time to tell this story and since we have no resolution whatsoever with the characters or the story we are just going to kill the lead off. WTF??!!<br /><br />It is extremely sloppy and it completely leaves entire script holes that without resolution or at least acknowledgment become Script sinkholes! <br /><br />Like for instance why is the "dad" shown in the photos at the end the doctor at the beginning? Why does the blackmailing girlfriend have a wound that is freshly bleeding in 2002 from a wound that happened in 2000 In the alternate reality?? /SPOILER)<br /><br />Arghhhh This is just a frustrating movie in which you think the lead is just psychotic then you learn no it's really you, you are the crazy one who bothered to see this Ryan Phillipe movie! I want my 90 minutes back!
