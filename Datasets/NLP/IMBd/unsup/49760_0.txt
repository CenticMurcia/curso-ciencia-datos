Now...can we take any movie seriously, whose awful soundtrack is a boring copy of the HE-MAN cartoons soundtrack? I feel sorry because this movie is NOT one's typical B production...they shot scenes in lavish locations in England, Wales and France, and were thus beyond typical B stuff... However, this is yet another Golan-Globus-Cannon actioner that turns out awful. Barren the barely decent Connery & Cushing, lead actors seem out of a high school rehearsal; O'Keefe stars as not-so-clever low-steroid musclehead. The storyline is interesting, but what you watch on the screen isn't after all... It's supposedly a deeply philosophical quest for the self and what you watch is a Richard Pryor thing. When the second red knight uses the sword, you clearly see it's fake and not a real sword. I won't watch it again.
