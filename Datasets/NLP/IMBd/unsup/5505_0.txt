There was a depressed market for films the last 3 years or so, mainly thanks to the SAG who's 11th hour decision not to strike created a flood of movies on the market. This threw BHA into a tail spin. Also Artisan was in turmoil at the time of delivery and gave Bluehill a very limp release. This is a good movie! I'm not just saying that because I invested in it. I think people need to see it. Allen Payne did a remarkable job. It's a struggle for indie's to begin with, and having things happen like SAG and 911 may have signed the death certificate for this flick. We shall see. As an investor, sorry to say, I have not seen a nickle return on this. Not to say I won't, but it's taking far too long to recoup my coin.<br /><br />Rick
