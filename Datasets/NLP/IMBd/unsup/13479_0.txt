Until this week I hadn't seen this film for 15 years. Back then I wondered (like others) about the title, the plot & what it was all about. Having just watched it again though...<br /><br />I guess it is a little dated and rough around the edges, and of course it's not about a man-eating VW(!) Whether or not it's a study of quirky small town life a la "Twin Peaks" is debatable. It's more a clever allegory of society in general. A society keen to disassociate itself from its primitive origins but being forced into an uneasy alliance with them. One that sees itself as being morally superior but one which tuns fertile land into desert, depletes the ocean of marine life and makes the Earth more uninhabitable (The society that ate itself?) A society which burdens it's youth with strict rules and regulations, while forcing them to take menial 9 to 5 jobs, or go to war in a far away land.<br /><br />Note the Mayor's hypocrisy in his attitude towards the Bruce Spence character for causing an accident, while patting Arthur on the back for ramming one of the hoons (anti-war protesters?) who was using his car to rebel against the repressive society - one that refuses to allow him or anyone else to leave or "drop out". Also the Mayor's forcing the townsfolk to tow the line and make believe that the towns' activities are somehow "legitimate" and "necessary".<br /><br />"Paris" is also a society that depends on newcomers (accident victims/immigrants) for its' survival, but insists they keep quiet about where they came from and denies them any rights in "affairs of state". The final scene of this film could be seen as representative of huge social upheaval (like that of the '50's & 60's) which frees (in theory at least) the people from the bonds which have held them down (conformity) and lets them step out of their humdrum existence and the discover the world. Whew, heavy stuff!<br /><br />Apart from this, "The Cars That Ate Paris" is full of wonderful comic moments for those who like their humour a little black and extra-extra dry. Arthur being ceremoniously ordained as a parking officer then having a showdown with the local hoons (with a spaghetti western-ish soundtrack in the background). John Meillon holding his garden Aboriginal forlornly after having his front garden attacked. The odd facial expressions of Max Gillies, and the incredible gauchness of the annual ball. All in all a very insightful and thought provoking film.
