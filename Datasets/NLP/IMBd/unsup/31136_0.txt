i was expecting this to be one of my favorite games ever because ultimate spider-man and spider-man 2 games are my favorite games ever but this isn't huge let down its just conclusion of the game is bad if you seen the film harry dies he also dies in the game but when its all over they completely forgot about that and story mode is short to atleaset on the ps2 version but swinging around new york is just pure fun so is story mode but its disappointing that it is so short and playing has black suit is fun but its to bad you cant after you beat the game. So overlay this is another great spider-man game but it doesn't compare to ultimate spider-man and spider-man 2 game.And the spider-man 3 game is better then the first spider-man movie game so i recemond this spidey game is very fun.<br /><br />Overall:7/10
