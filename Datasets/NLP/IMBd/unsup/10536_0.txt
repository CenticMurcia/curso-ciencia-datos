"Savior" came to me as a movie half-seen on HBO. What I saw was enough to intrigue me to search for the DVD. The DVD is currently out-of-print. Luckily I was able to find one on an online auction site and I am pleased to say that I am quite happy with my purchase. This movie takes a serious look at war and it's effects on a soldier who has joined the foreign legion, a woman he meets, and an infant who enters their life. The setting is Bosnia and war is brutal. The hero finds himself surrounded by death and destruction. He chose his life as a soldier in the Foreign legion as an act of revenge to purge his anger from losing his family. Soon, war and anger overcomes and all that is left is the "Savior". Who is the savior? I'll leave that up to you the viewer to discover for yourself. Excellent film overall. This is my favorite performance by Dennis Quaid.
