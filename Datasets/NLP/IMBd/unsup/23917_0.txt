What can I say that hasn't been said before? Wow, at least 60 posts to this thread, most of which I haven't yet read.<br /><br />My wife says we saw it when it was in the theaters but I can't say I remember.<br /><br />We are now watching it on DVD taken out from the library.<br /><br />It is so wonderful and well done. It is so vividly colorful; I don't know how much the appearance was enhanced for the DVD but it is great in Wide mode on a flat-screen! Even the sad scene of the attempted rescue of a little girl (who fell down a well?), which turned out tragically, was poignant and realistic, and riveting.<br /><br />The references, the music, the actors and actresses -- aye aye aye!
