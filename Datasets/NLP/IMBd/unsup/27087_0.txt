This movie didn't do well at the box office and was not a commercial success by any means. It was, in my opinion, one of the best comic-book-to-movie films ever done. With such a wealth of material to draw on, I don't know how Richter was able to keep the running time under 3 hours!<br /><br />I caught the Banzi band wagon a little late in the game (first viewed it on tape around 1986) and have seen it about 3 times but never seem to tire of it's subtle (and overt) humor, colorful and well formed characters, clever and original premise and terrific ensemble cast!<br /><br />All I want to know is:<br /><br />WHERE'S THE SEQUEL THEY PROMISED US AT THE END?!!
