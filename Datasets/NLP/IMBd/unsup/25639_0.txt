This inofficial sequel to the "Ã¼ber-boring" Australian wannabe-thriller "Patrick" is one of the sleaziest movies ever made. Hardly surprising if you take a look at the director's name: Mario Landi, the director of the even sleazier "Giallo a Venezia". Landi delivers lots of naked (female) flesh, lots of senseless dialogue and plenty of gratuitous gore-scenes. The dubious highlight: A woman gets impaled from her genitalia upwards through her mouth. Sounds sick, eh? But the effects - the afore mentioned one in particular - are so badly executed that their impact equals zero. All in all a tedious waste of time, even in the rare uncut version. 3 out of 10, though.
