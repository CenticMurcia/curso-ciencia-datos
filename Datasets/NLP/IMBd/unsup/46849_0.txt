I can understand the appeal of a joyous Christmas movie. I can understand the appeal of having a man become Santa Claus. I can understand the appeal of the Christmas magicbeing saved by the unity of the new santa to the new mrs claus.<br /><br />So where was it? They seem to like to just randomly skip from scene to scene without care for letting the audience know why. What happened? Why are things a catastrophe one minute and all fixed the next? I still have no idea.<br /><br />For out of work B-listerers like Steve Guttenberg and Crystal Bernard I can understand this as the next logical career choice. But Mariette Hartley....you used to have so much class.<br /><br />She must have been crying at the end because her agent couldn't get her a better movie to be in.<br /><br />It takes more than a red suit and a forced ho-ho-ho to make Christmas Magic.
