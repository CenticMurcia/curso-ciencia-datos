This film touching the rather trivial (it's the year 2004) theme of coming out, achieves through a fine tune of its elements: plot, dialogs, characters, messages, events storied etc. to offer an exceptional and unique view of it.<br /><br /> From the beginning it is not to compare with "Beautiful Thing" because it addresses somewhat older characters and its humor and dialogs are less general and more mature. It serves a rather specific goal and end which lacks from the rather simple realistic story-telling of "Edge of Seventeen". It does not transmit as much as exaggeration and irony which would put it aside the reality like "But I'm a Cheerleader". <br /><br />However, it reserves some purity by not getting into the charming British gay bourgeoisie like "Like it is". It does not suffer of french lyricism like "Presque Rien". The fluctuation of the feelings and events is more breezy than in "It's in the water". Finally, the plot is more self-composed than in "A cause d'un Garcon" and it is not meant to be seen by clueless straight public like "In and Out".<br /><br />As shortcomings may be considered the lack of "happily ever after..." ending, the somewhat too aggressive, for the spectator, plot development, the discreet appearance of several trivia and the lack of "mouth wide open" laughing humor.
