Absolutely one of the most memorable movies from my teens, only eclipsed by the star wars movies, tron and alien..... I think the line that keeps coming forward into my brain most would be, "Why is there a watermelon there?" - Jeff Goldblum, upon entering the lab....pretty much sums this movie up. What boggles my mind the most about this movie is the fact that if you ask someone if they have seen it, they probably haven't - but say, "Remember, no matter where you go.....", they will most likely finish the quote for you......."there you are." Inconcievable.
