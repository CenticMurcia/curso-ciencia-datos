I'll admit that I can't be the most fair judge of this movie. I'm a fencing instructor and so I'm pre-disposed to enjoy sword fighting movies. But, a movie where the romantic lead becomes a fencing instructor?? OK, you had me at 'hello.'<br /><br />Beyond that, every person who appears on-screen has the best costumes you'll ever see. In re-viewings of this film, my wife and I spend whole scenes saying, "I'd look good in that," or "That outfit would suit you." And we're talking about Renaissance fashion!<br /><br />So, you have sword fights, romance and period drama all at once. If any one of those sounds good you, you'll like this film.
