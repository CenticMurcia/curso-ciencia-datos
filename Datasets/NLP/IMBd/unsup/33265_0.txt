The problem with this movie is not it's message, but the way it delivers. It is hardly an anatomy at all, it is more a smathering of clich√©s and clear cut definitions. No character is complex they are the way they are, to make the plot meaningful. THe main villain is a heartless weasel who hates everyone and is abusive and the movie wants you to believe that everyone who hates gay people is like this jerk off. Also the main character, Michael Sheppard, is portrayed as Christ like as he faces oppression every day ( even from his college professor, which is B.S. because if there ever was a more liberal group of people, It's jackass literature professors). While it is nice to think that every gay person is perfect in every way, and every homophobe is the Antichrist it simply isn't true. The world isn't made up of black and white, but this movie is.
