Factual errors: The film contains several background story scenes which are designed to make the audience care about the characters. However, it is not actually possible to care about any of these characters.<br /><br />Continuity: David Carradine appeared in several movies which were good. Then, inexplicably, he's in this movie.<br /><br />Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): After being identified by multiple witnesses during a blatant murder in a small town filled with vigilantes, the main characters return the next day to rob the bank. This idea is, in fact, completely f**king retarded.<br /><br />Anachronisms: Sequined chaps did not actually exist in the old west.<br /><br />Miscellaneous: The credits for this film list a director and several actors. However, acting and directing do not appear in the film.<br /><br />Audio/visual mismatch: Good western soundtrack was apparently accidentally replaced with generic hip-hop garbage.<br /><br />Revealing mistakes: Movie exists.
