Like you, I would love to find this movie on video. I never got to see the movie, myself, but I fell in love with the song the Cliff de Young released from it and searched for it for many years. I wanted to see this movie! One day I was thumbing through the cut-outs bin in my favorite record store and found an album that had been made from the movie. The album contained exerpts from the film as well as all the music from it. If there is a place where I can go and request this film, please tell me so I can add my voice to yours because I agree this is a story worth hearing and Cristina Raines is one of my favorite actresses.
