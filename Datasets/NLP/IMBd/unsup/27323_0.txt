This movie offers extremely poignant perspectives on the human condition.<br /><br />We follow the prostitute (played by Wendy Highes), as she works to supply drugs to her brother (very codependent relationship).<br /><br />Within the self-sacrificing martyr's life that she has chosen (mostly, it appears, as a heroic loyalty for her family) we sympathize with her position because of the way the movie is portrayed.<br /><br />We are shown the fear of letting her brother go, that she endures.<br /><br />Enough of that though. The movie is hilarious. The beginning scene in a parlor-car carriage of a train at night, features dialogue between two fascinating characters in almost Quentin Tarantino'esqe pulp.<br /><br />Upon first watch of this movie, the shades of moderate pathological narcissism (of the woman whoring herself) are unidentifiable in this scene.<br /><br />Then as the movie gradually moves, we begin to see her ploys adapted to manipulate men. Whats more, the movie progresses in such a way so that because we are being gradually introduced more and more into her daily reality (caring for her brother, teaching, etc); the culmination of her expressing her opinion (that she is actually providing male clients with a worthwhile and much- needed service) never seems audacious.<br /><br />I am not sure whether the intentions of the producers were to portray this girl in such a light, but her sociopathic rationale never seems sociopathic because of it. Indeed we see that it would take someone with her problems to behave in that way. <br /><br />From the moments of communion in church; being binded from a long-term emotionally supportive romantic partner (as opposed to just sex); the effort she puts into 'rescuing' her emotionally and physically crippled brother; being a beautiful woman - more often-than-not in the sack with wrinkly, sweaty, drunken and sometimes obnoxious old men - who gets abandoned and used by one of if not the only 'handsome' man in the movie.<br /><br />Not only is this a very human movie, but it is done in a way that people young and old can absorb and understand it's symbolic eulogies of human doings and happenings (maybe this is due to Peter Sullivan's exquisitely mellow soundtrack that relaxes the deep substance a little). <br /><br />As an added bonus it is extremely entertaining.<br /><br />I recommend that this movie needs to be watched many times over a lengthy period, to truly absorb its humanity, its message, it's genius.
