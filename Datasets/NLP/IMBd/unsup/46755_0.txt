This is a ridiculous, poorly researched film with an undeservedly good title.<br /><br />This is a ridiculous, poorly researched film with an undeservedly good title.<br /><br />This event occurred in 1966. Will the director please explain why the police are flying around in Apache helicopters and carrying Beretta M9 pistols? I know the film is supposed to be "surreal" but give me a break. A little bit of research could have lent a lot authenticity to this film. Acting was also mediocre at best. The "tactical" team at the end of the film is absolutely ridiculous. This film constituted a complete waste of my time. Don't waste yours!<br /><br />This is a ridiculous, poorly researched film with an undeservedly good title.<br /><br />This event occurred in 1966.
