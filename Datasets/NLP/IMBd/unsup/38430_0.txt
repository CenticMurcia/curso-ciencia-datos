Unbelievable for many reasons:<br /><br />1) For surviving the whole film without ripping my eyes out. 2) For the actors......who risked jeopardizing their careers. 3) The Director- A person who can make this film and appreciate it. 4) The producers, for having the balls to release it. 5) The 'Visual -Effects' - Oh my god!If this guy finds a job after this by anyone except the same director........ it's a miracle 6) The writer- Anyone who can write this, has the total inability to find beauty in anything.<br /><br />This is practically one of the worst movies I have ever seen! There was not a single thing that can be appreciated Everyone one acted miserably, the plot couldn't have been more 'cheezy' for a wanna-be parody! P.S : The only thing believable was Anu Malik's horrible music.
