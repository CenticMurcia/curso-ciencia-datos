This unbelievably bad little piece of $hit, flick pi$$ed me off even though I only paid a dollar to rent it. Trust me when I say, a dollar was too much. This film contained it all.................stupid script, crappy acting, lousy cinematography, and an asinine "surprise" ending that was more laughable than scary! The absolute only reason to watch this trash are Elizabeth Kell's amazing, incredibly beautiful breasts. Otherwise avoid this stinker at all costs. Not sure what normally passes for entertainment with some of these other reviewers, but my guess from their praises of this movie is that it must feature either Teletubbies, Smurfs and any creature repeated being bludgeoned with an over-sized mallet. Wake up guys (and gals). "Direct to DVD" should have been the tip-off (as it should have been for me). However I won't make the same mistake.
