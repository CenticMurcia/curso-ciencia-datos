What on earth was this one?????<br /><br />Apart for 1 (that is ONE) scene (the pink petals that were falling as the hero was walking) this movie was plain horrible. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry with this one. If you want to feel like Beavis and Butt-head when they watch something undescribable on TV, then this is the movie to create this emotion.<br /><br />Thumbs way the f--- down!
