I started watching this with some scepticism, fully expecting it to be another soapy royal saga, but to my astonishment found it sensitively written and surprisingly perceptive. It didn't fall into the trap of being royal "spin" or the equally easy trap of being cheaply sensationalist - it just tried to understand what happened between the young Charles and Camilla without making glib judgements. As a result it was touching and funny and wholly absorbing, and in the end extremely moving.<br /><br />The actors playing Charles and Camilla were excellent, helped by some of the best dialogue I've heard in ages - effortlessly witty at one moment, direct and emotional the next. And never ever falsely sentimental. Many congratulations to all concerned.
