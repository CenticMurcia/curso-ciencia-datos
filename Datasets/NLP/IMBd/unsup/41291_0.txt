Leaving you with a feeling as if you've just gone through a spontaneous lobotomy, "Contagion" directed by John Murlowski gives off the token aura of a made-for-TV movie. A plot shallower than a kiddie-pool and character development mirroring that of a bed-time story combine to make the perfect recipe of mediocrity. The cast starring Bruce Boxleitner and Megan Gallagher give little depth other than an awkward "chemistry" which leaves you rolling your eyes. The most notable appearance is Lin Shaye who most recently starred in Snakes on a Plane (2006) but other than this exception, the cast have seldom seen the big stage and understandably so. The most prominent feature of this movie is unarguably the low-budget feel which it gives off which one can't help but notice. While watching the movie you'll find yourself in a constant state of deja-vu. "Every breath you take could be your last." sounds like a welcoming fate as the 93 minutes pass by before you.
