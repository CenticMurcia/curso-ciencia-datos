Despite being lifted from a Hollywood flick Derailed (which wasn't exactly a huge hit), The Train was far from entertaining and so predictable that you didn't even have to be of average intelligence to figure out who is bad & who is good although I've not seen Derailed. The film was supposed to be a thriller but wasn't even a jot thrilling, then what is left? The only good scene was the song Woh Ajnabee with its excellent cinematography. The Music is good and the song Woh Ajnabee is one of the best songs of 2007 but what is the use of good music in a bad film? The story was so simple about Vishal Dixit (Emraan Hashmi), a regular middle-class guy, is settled in Bangkok with his wife Anjali (Sayali Bhagat) and their five-year old daughter Nikki. Anjali & Vishal are trying to gather together their deteriorating marriage. One day, on his way to work, Vishal meets Roma (Geeta Basra), a beautiful woman and that is where his miserable life begins. Overall The Train chugged to a slow pace before it ran out of steam. Neither The Train nor its passengers (viewers) reached their destination. In fact, many of them wanted to pull the chain and jump out of the running train.
