Golden Sun has to be one of the largest, most extensive Game Boy games ever created. It provides excellent graphics, super CPU intelligence, a load of spells with a complete magic system, and really cool little guys called "Djinn".<br /><br />The battle system has to be one of the coolest, and most unique, ever. One can "Set" Djinn, connecting them to the character's body to perform helpful tasks. After they've been set, they can be used to summon great beings to aid in the destruction of evil-doers everywhere!<br /><br />The plot is unusually very interesting. Four lighthouses control the power of the world, and some evil-doers plan to light them. In order to stop them, you, playing as Isaac and his gang, must track them down and rescue each village from imminent disaster along the way.<br /><br />The music is pretty nice. It's only Game Boy Advance, but that's no reason to have pitiful music. Ambient sounds, the battle music, and a very nice main theme mix to create an intense, dramatic blend of Nintendo music.<br /><br />The Djinn, much like Final Fantasy VIII's Guardian Forces, are really neat. It takes a while to understand them and how they work, but once you figure them out, the possibilities are practically limitless. Special items and weaponry only add to the effect, as they produce powers like none ever seen in fantasy games.<br /><br />Golden Sun (I'm not sure what it is with Broken Seal; I've got the U.S. version, so it is only called Golden Sun) is a very challenging game. More than once I found myself literally slaughtered by countless enemies. The bosses are merciless and can sometimes be very frustrating, but I suggest leveling up as much as possible before meeting any of them! This will not only help you, but will make the game a much more enjoyable experience.<br /><br />My ultimate advice: get Golden Sun! It's a marvelous depiction of the GBA's superior performance.
