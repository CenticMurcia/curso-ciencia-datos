Sure, it's hokey, brash, and fairly simple. It's a living *cartoon*! The songs and jokes are very dated ... which is fantastic! Li'l Abner is actually a fabulous political satire from the 50's. Not only that, but thankfully Michael Kidd's original athletic choreography from Broadway has been captured for posterity. And, hey. Any film that features Valerie Harper, Beth Howland, and Julie Newmar before they were stars ... plus Leslie Parrish (author Richard Bach's wife!) as Daisy Mae ... jeesh. It's a national treasure!
