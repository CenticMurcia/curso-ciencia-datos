Version: Cantonese, with English subtitles (by SBS)<br /><br />When watching movies on SBS, I'm prepared for nearly anything. Obviously my definition of 'anything' didn't include an action/horror movie from Hong Kong that was essentially 'Ghostbusters' if it were a kung-fu movie. SBS rules.<br /><br />'2002' follows a police-unit dealing with the supernatural. Each team is comprised of a human / ghost partnership. When Tide's (Nicholas Tse) partner is re-incarnated, Tide finds a new partner in Fung (Stephen Fung). Fung doesn't know about the human / ghost rule, nor does he realize that anyone close to Tide is doomed to die. Meanwhile, some nasty demons are running around Hong Kong, and they're pretty angry.<br /><br />The story of '2002' is pretty good. The characters are likable, and the movie was well written. Some things weren't explained very well, but that shouldn't be a problem for anyone interested in these movies or the general subject (Chinese mythology).<br /><br />Action-wise, '2002' kicks arse. There is a lot of wire-work and CGI. I normally don't like CGI, but I'll forgive it here as the fight scenes were pretty damn-cool. Be warned though, the fight-scenes in this exist to serve to explain the story, and not for the sake of action. Some of these fights are broken up by flashbacks, etc and may drag-on for those not keen on the plot.<br /><br />8/10 - Check it out if like HK action movies.
