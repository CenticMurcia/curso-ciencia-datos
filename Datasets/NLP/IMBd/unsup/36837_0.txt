I have never seen a children's movie that was so poorly acted. The 10 yr old's dad was someone who I would not have wanted to have custody of my child either. He was more than eccentric...The child actor was not very good either but that really seemed due to the script and dialog challenges he encountered. Also, the little girl's character was too terse for her age. The three dummies that they used in the boat scene who were supposedly hanging on for dear life at the end of the movie were so obviously dummies which really annoyed me. Also, there were no law enforcement officers who were actually any good at their jobs so I suppose the bad guys were going to just hang around like dummies (oun intended) forever!! Terrible. I would not recommend this movie even for the youngest of children.
