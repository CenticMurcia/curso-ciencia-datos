I thought this film was nearly flawless.<br /><br />First of all, the acting was incredible. I had only known Patrick Warburton as Putty from Seinfeld, so I was expecting him to have the same dufusy air about him. However, Patrick really gave the character of Max Bright a great deal of dimension, and I was impressed by his ability to convey subtler feelings later in the film. Marie Matiko, who portrays the female protaginist, was sublime; she played her role perfectly. The supporting cast was not outstanding, but generally each actor gave a convincing performance.<br /><br />The story was borderline sensational but also captivating. I enjoyed the mild plot twists. The writer/director spoke after the screening I attended, and he said that he had no outline for the script; the story just told itself along the way. This approach shows a little bit, but the movie never seems aimless.<br /><br />And finally, I laughed a lot. I really came to like the characters, which certainly helped.
