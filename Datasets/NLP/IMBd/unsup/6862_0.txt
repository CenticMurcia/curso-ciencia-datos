This is one stunning game. One of the most beautiful, original and amazing experiences i've ever had the pleasure of playing in my entire life. And that's an understatement. Forget everything you've played before- this is a unique experience altogether. <br /><br />If your'e expecting something like "The Legend of Zelda", then forget it.This is a different type of game than an average adventure game, and if you've the slightest interest in alternative gaming you must give it a go. Granted not everyone will like it, but you have to experience it for yourself- and once your under it's graceful spell it won't let you go. There's no tedious dungeons, no side quests, no missions other than to revive your loved one by defeating some 15 or so giant colossi. Thats it. <br /><br />There's no rules, no time, no enemies except the ones your'e supposed to face in a world your'e free to explore at your own pace. It's a visual force unlike anything gone before. <br /><br />Graphics- some of the most beautiful you've ever seen on the PS2. It pushes the hardware to it's limits. Amazing environments.<br /><br />Gameplay- simple and effective. Straight to the point if you want to progress in the plot, otherwise a virtual world free to roam to your heart's content. And you will be doing this a lot, as the landscapes are are so stunningly rendered- natural beauty unlike anything you've seen before. (Though Ocarina of Time was the pinnacle, SotC turns it up to 11).<br /><br />Controls- easy to pick up, Simple to master. Does the job.<br /><br />Colossi- original oddities, unlike anything else. Architecture, animal and landscape environment fused together to make a completely organic creature. Beautifully animated, as is the horse Agro. Oh, and they are HUGE.<br /><br />Great story and amazing music; epic, tragic, romantic, melancholy, beautiful.<br /><br />Downsides- the frame rate drops a lot, and it's understandable, the PS2 hardware just can't keep up. But a small price to pay, you get used to it and it doesn't really detract from the game play unless you make it a big issue. I dealt with it and didn't care afterwards.<br /><br />Other than that small issue, the game is a masterpiece. Art in it's purest sense. I give it 11/10. Period. <br /><br />You may want to play ICO first as it adds that extra icing that makes SotC experience slightly better, and it ties the games together quite well.
