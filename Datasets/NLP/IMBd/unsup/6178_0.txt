I have to admit that i was always in to Transformers and He-man more than Thundercats but it didn't stop me from enjoying it every week after school on TV. Never bought any of the toys but i think it was because i was just slightly too old for it when the toys and TV show came out in the UK. One of the stupid things i noticed in it though was the mutants. They were the most useless bunch of bad guys ever, they always messed everything up from start to finish instead of just messing it up at the end (like most other villains do) and thank god for Mumm-ra who is a pretty decent bad guy. Thundercats is not as preachy as He-man either but it has its similarities with it. A great cartoon which is my 3rd best cartoon show from the 80's. Nice.
