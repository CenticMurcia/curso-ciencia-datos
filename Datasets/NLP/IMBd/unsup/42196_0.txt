Not even the grand cast of star power could save this.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson's narration doesn't even save it, and he had quite a lot of lines.<br /><br />You can certainly tell that this movie is written by Bob Saget. His jokes were never that funny and he certainly shows that he tries to hard.<br /><br />The majority of the jokes come from penis references and fart jokes. They aren't clever and they aren't original. I can't see why anyone would find this movie funny or enjoyable.<br /><br />The editing was crazily poor. The musical numbers were performed terribly, and at times they tried to hard to be something special.<br /><br />Christina Applegate plays Melissa and she is looking for a nice guy. Carl (played by Saget) is looking for a girl who gets him - which just so happens to be Melissa.<br /><br />When they do finally meet after a long 55 minutes or so, they fall in love in a matter of 5 minutes. Then they have the clich√©d storyline of best friends hating each other over a girl.<br /><br />I can't believe that Dane Cook, Norm Macdonald, Jason Alexander, Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Applegate, Woopi Goldberg, and Lewis Black even agreed to do this film.<br /><br />Do I even have to call it a film? It's far from being something entertaining.<br /><br />Anyone out there who thought "looks alright" take this review under consideration and change your minds. If you watch this movie, you will definitely want your 75 minutes back trust me.<br /><br />A movie about Penguins you might want to see is March of the Penguins, narrated by Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />Don't waste time or money on Farce of the Penguins. If you do watch this movie you'll only like the line by Dane Cook's character.
