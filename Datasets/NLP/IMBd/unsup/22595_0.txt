Charlotte Sometimes was very well-done. I saw this film at a Washington, DC screening. It deals with people's need of love and companionship, but unlike many dramas, the storyline is unpredictable. The acting was superb. I definitely recommend this to those who want to see something innovative. Go out and watch this film!
