This is my first review ever, please be gentle....<br /><br />This movie gives hope to a new generation of music lovers, real music, not the crap the monopolizes the radio stations today. Paul Green, while some of his antics aren't typical of music teachers, really gets through to the kids. I really enjoyed how the movie was well rounded, not just focusing on the best highlights, but also showed how he used positive and negative criticism to motivate the students, as well as their reactions to it. I enjoyed how it followed the students, those with exceptional talent and those who really enjoyed music (but lacked in the natural talent department). The culmination of the film (seeing how the film doesn't thrive on a what could happen type ending, I don't think this is a spoiler, if anything I would think it would make people want to see the movie), a performance of the most talented students at a Frank Zappa tribute festival. Wow, what talent! They really brought people to their knees. CJ will make your jaw drop. Overall I would say this movie really made me want to dive back into music. The movie is inspiring and optimistic. With talent like this, they really make you believe that Rock and Roll will live forever.
