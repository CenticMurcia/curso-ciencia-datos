This unfunny comedy establishes a weak premise - an astronomer's lonely wife takes up astrology - then largely abandons it, turning to a variety of creaky devices that just don't work. William Powell, solid professional that he was, gives it the old college try but is defeated by the silly situations and poor script. Hedy Lamarr is beautiful but otherwise does not come across well, comedy apparently not being her strong suit. The usually watchable Fay Bainter is given a thankless role as the smug, supercilious astrologer. The remaining interest in this film lies in the historical/cultural themes: The war (referenced only in regard to minor plot points - the characters seem scarcely affected except that they're scolded for leaving their lights on after curfew), and the role of astrology in American society (it seems to be have been perceived as a way for idle, reasonably well-off women to be parted from their money).
