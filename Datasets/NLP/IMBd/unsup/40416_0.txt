I actually watched this all the way through and I am really surprised I made it. Many times I wanted to turn it off but kept watching out of curiosity to see if it could possibly get any worse. Do not watch this for the "gore" as there is little and it's very poorly done. Do not watch it for the "plot", there is none. Whatever you do, do not watch it for the "acting" as that is far too generous a word to use for what these people were doing. This is apparently a vanity project for someone who wanted to dress up and play actor/director. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities. Do yourself a favor, Just don't watch it.
