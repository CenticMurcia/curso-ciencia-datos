Why did I rent this DVD? Well, I was driving down the road a couple months ago and decided to Google up my childhood best friend from when I was 11-12.... Eric Byler. I had tried to find him a few years back to no avail. You'll notice in the movie that Cody Chestnutt has a Little League patch on one shoulder and Lori (I believe) wears a baseball shirt at one point. That's no accident, as Eric was our #1 pitcher and we may have made it to the world series if he had not broken his finger in practice after we won the VA state title. To think that our team picture was on the cover of a phone book back in 1984... crazy! I visited him in Hawaii in 1986 and lost touch afterwords and remember his discussions of how the locals there treated him differently as a 'Hapa' (Eric's mother is full blood Asian, although she grew up in the same neighborhood with his father in the U.S.) Anyway, it is no surprise to me that Eric went into writing and directing. He was a very interesting and creative kid and I still have some of his cartoons and a fond memory of the Purple Flower Joke.<br /><br />As for the film, I can't give it extremely high marks, but it is very well made. See it if you want a different type of love story. My favorite low budget film is probably Blood Simple, which had both a love triangle and murder theme. The background music was really well done in that film and I give Eric very high marks for his scoring of CS.
