My 1 year old is obsessed with this movie. We have watched it at least 20 times and my son wants to watch it everyday. He loves the trains and the silliness of the whole movie. I must say that I do not get sick of it like most movies you watch over and over. My 2 other sons (ages 4 and 8) also enjoy it, especially the character Mr. C. Jr. (Michael E. Rodgers is hilarious). This is one of the few movies that my children enjoy and I don't go crazy watching. I think it is also good for the kids to watch since it contains very little violence. It also has the added bonus of being filmed at the Strasburg Railroad using the very same train that we ride on every year.
