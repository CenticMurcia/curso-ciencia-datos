Somehow, this is the worst alien invasion film from 1996. Though both Independence Day and Mars Attacks! have their fair share of flaws, this film is nothing but flaws. To start off, it's got some of the worst acting by an entire cast in a major motion picture. Some of this is due to the wretched dialogue, but most of it is due to what seem like first-take scenes. Charlie Sheen is overacting incredibly, and everyone else is just plain wooden. The story would be interesting if it were not botched completely with unbelievable situations and silly action sequences. The direction is entirely unremarkable, and the special effects are wholly un-amazing. Plus, it's got a kid in it - a sure flaw in any film for adults. Truly terrible.
