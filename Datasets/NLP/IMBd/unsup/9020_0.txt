In the end of mankind on Earth, the scientists build a self-sufficient underground city for a few people to preserve the human race for two hundred years. They leave also instructions for the future generations to return the surface of the planet in a steel box that should be kept by the mayors through the generations. However, the instructions are lost and the inhabitants stay in the city that is completely deteriorated. The power generator has problems and the blackouts are longer and more frequent and the city is running out of food that needs to be rationed. On the Assignment Day, the teenagers Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) and Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) are assigned to work with the pipework and as messenger, but they swap their job positions. Lina, who is the descendant of the seventh mayor, finds the box of instructions in the house of her grandmother and shows it to her friend Doon. They decide to explore the way out of the city and they discover that the corrupt major and his henchmen are stealing food of the population. When they are hunted by the major's hoodlums, they have to find the way out of Ember to survive and save the populations from the imminent darkness and end of the city.<br /><br />"City of Ember" is an original and engaging adventure and it was a great surprise for me. The dark city is a sort of combination of the environment of "Brazil, the Movie" and "Metropolis". The cast has names like Martin Landau, Tim Robbins and a hilarious Bill Murray that performs the typical politician, corrupt, selfish and manipulative. Unfortunately the fate of politicians in real world is not the same of his character. However, the unknown Saoirse Ronan steals the movie with a great performance. It is irritating the repetitive type of review that tells the obvious ("the book was better and better"). My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Cidade das Sombras" ("City of the Shadows")
