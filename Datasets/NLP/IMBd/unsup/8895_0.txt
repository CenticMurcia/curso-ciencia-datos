Slimly-plotted but handsomely-produced second-biller about an escaped leopard in a small dirt town in New Mexico apparently the cause behind several deaths...or is it? Intriguing premise given stylish film-noir treatment. Performances are solid, and Jacques Tourneur's crafty direction lets you see just enough before fading to black. Val Lewton produced, and he gives the proceedings his customary spooky polish. Film tails off near the end, but is still a minor gem. Fantastically atmospheric and fun. Based on the book "Black Alibi" by Cornell Woolrich. <br /><br />*** from ****
