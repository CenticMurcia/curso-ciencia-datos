...perhaps in a first year film school nightmare??... I'm not really sure where to start with this one. Perhaps I should talk about why I think this 90 min+ miracle of Canadian cinema could have easily been condensed to a 10 min (that's even pushing it) mediocre short film. Or, perhaps I should talk about the the character of Emerson and my fascination as to why people think this kid gave a great performance. Yes, that'll do. This was a TV movie, a lesser episode of Degrassi Junior High (sorry Degrassi for making this comparison, I still love you), an After School Special. This was not fresh , this was not original, and this in no way gave me confidence in my Defending Canadian Cinema argument I sometimes bring out when there's an awkward silence at parties. All I can say is don't see it, don't waste your time, and strive to expect more from us Canadian filmmakers. We need less praise for our mediocre achievements (Sarah Polly anyone?) and more accountability for our government funded mistakes. Enough said. ps. Daniel MacIvor, you did your best and played your role with heart, for this I thank you...but then again you also wrote it, so I'm still upset.
