I gave this movie a 3 out of 10, and I thought I was being charitable.<br /><br />I'm normally one who likes con movies. I only have 2 rules. The movie should have a twist that I don't see coming 80 miles away (either the con itself or how the con was pulled off) and that the twist should make sense (you should be able to watch it a 2nd time with a completely different perspective). This one succeeded in the first but only because it failed in the second.<br /><br />Why throw in a twist without an explanation? May be it was because I hadn't seen "9 Queens," but I really wish they had explained why the twist had occurred by throwing in some more background at the end or something instead of just abruptly ending it with me feeling like I stepped out during the part of the movie that would have a) let me see this coming at all and b) me care enough that it did any more than just the feeling that I had been taken for a confused ride.
