I read where the producers of this show originally told the families that they were doing a show called, "Bravo Kids", and that they would focus on the kids and treat the families with respect. Now the families are all p***ed off because they have portrayed them so badly. <br /><br />I know that these parents can act pretty badly, push their children too hard, and just generally act like a bunch of jerks, but it still raises the question of whether it is right to dupe people in top something they are not aware of - especially something that they will be judged the rest of their lives for by millions of people. <br /><br />I know that some people will say that they never would have gotten access to the families if they had told the truth, but is the story really that important? It is not like it is some 60 minutes news investigation or something. And any of you who think that Bravo or the producers of this show had any higher calling other than getting ratings or looking at "these freaks" are deluding yourselves. <br /><br />In the end, the way everyone on these boards and elsewhere rags on these kids lack of ability surely is more harmful to their self-image than their parents forcing them into the spotlight. Right? <br /><br />It reminds me of the way they used to treat Chelsea Clinton during her most awkward stage.
