I'll totally exclude the fact that they raped the book. The book is delightful, enchanting and enthralling.<br /><br />The movie is the total opposite of all these things. The acting is awful on all fronts. Terrible directing from Frank Oz, terrible casting, terrible everything. I only revisited this disaster to put myself to sleep last night. <br /><br />There are only a few circumstances for anyone to be seeing this.<br /><br />Dodge at all costs unless you're curious about the book comparison or if you have a kid that you need to distract for 90 minutes or so. Horrendous adaptation, horrendous film-making.
