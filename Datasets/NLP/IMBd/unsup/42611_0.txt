If I were ever allowed to ask Jesus Franco one question it would be, how did you manage to convince well-known actors like Helbert Lom ("The Pink Panther"), Mercedes McCambridge ("Johnny Guitar"), Luciana Paluzzi ("Thunderball") and Maria Schell ("The Hanging Tree") to participate in this movie? The film looks like it cost two cents to make, so I'm sure they did not get a lot of money for their work here. This very low-budget production is simply awful. Not that I expected a quality production from someone like Franco but I did think this was going to be one of those films that is 'so bad it's good.' No such luck! This is plain bad and very dull. The cast goes through numerous boring scenes with little enthusiasm. No sparks whatsoever. It is a pity because I think these actors were capable of turning polyester into silk. If you really want to see how this thing is done the right way watch "Caged Heat" or "The Big Bird Cage" instead. Avoid.
