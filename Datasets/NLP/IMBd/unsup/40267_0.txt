If truth in advertising laws were applied to motion pictures, London By Night would have been titled Backlot By Day, because this is one of the least convincing London-set features made by any American studio. George Murphy barely makes an effort as Michael Denis, an Irish reporter (with an American accent) mixed up in a murder investigation, and most of the rest of the cast deliver their lines in equally unconvincing fashion. Only George Zucco, as a police inspector, makes much of an impression, and the story itself is minor stuff indeed. At least Corky the dog doesn't embarrass himself too much, delivering a convincing portrayal as Jones, Denis' faithful canine pal.
