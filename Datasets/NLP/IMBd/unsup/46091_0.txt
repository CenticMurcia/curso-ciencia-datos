Believe it or not, this film's plot actually ties in various racist/Aryan 'lost civilization' conspiracy theories about prehistoric North American 'Atlanteans'(or Lemurians or the boys from Mu or take your pick) having their plans for world conquest thwarted by an act of (a) god. Hitler's academia were supposedly fond of such stories, obviously baseless... or were they!? Yeah, they were. But the promised pay-off of an ancient ruin rising out of the earth is reason enough to co-op some pseudo mythology for your cheap movie. By the way, any ancient ruins? You don't see much of them. What you do see, among other things, are scores of interchangeable masked goons performing less than impressive gymnastics and making 'special ops' moves with their hands. Plus, a guy named Rowsdower. That was kinda cool. The 'hero' kid... not so much. The deep-voiced villain? Not cool either. Still, this movie has something to it, something I can't quantify... a unique Canuckness... and every idiot clich√© in the book. They've already been listed in triplicate in the above comments, so I'll try to find something new to bring up... how about the obvious allusion to INDIANA JONES with the penultimate 'driving sorta into the sun-set' scene and the unspoken but palpable hunger the filmmakers had for someone to be moved by it, indeed, to hope for a sequel, an elaboration of the continuing adventures of ROWSDOWER AND WONDER GEEK. Or they could drop the kid. That'd be cool, eh.
