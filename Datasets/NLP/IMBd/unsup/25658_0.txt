This is my favorite sci-fi comedy of all-time. The premise is completely outrageous, that a family of extra-terrestrials could be accepted into our society so easily. The humor alternates between being obvious and subtle, leaving some of the funniest bits unnoticed to those devoting less than their full attention. Great performances from the entire cast, with tons of cameos from top comics and past SNL & Second City Television alumni. The climax on the planet Remulak contains special effects worthy of any modern big-budget sci-fi film. There's also some great old-fashioned stop-motion animation of a creature called a Garthok. It's a relatively short film, only 87 minutes and moves at a nice pace. Fans of the original Saturday Night Live of the 1970's, will get the most enjoyment from this movie. Say "Lactate extract of hooved mammal"..."Cheese!"
