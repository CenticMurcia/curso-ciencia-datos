What a mess! Vengeance of the Zombies tries too hard to be everything. The film doesn't devote near enough time to any one element of the plot. Vengeance of the Zombies is all over the place. It's one part Satanism, one part Eastern mysticism, one part Caribbean voodoo, and one part revenge. Throw in some bad acting, a lack of logic, and a twist out of left field and you've got a recipe for disaster. I'm trying real hard to enjoy these Paul Naschy films, but thus far I'm not impressed.<br /><br />My rating would be lower if it weren't for some special effects that work quite nicely. There's one decapitation scene in particular that far exceeds the quality of anything else in Vengeance of the Zombies.
