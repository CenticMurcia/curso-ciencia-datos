Colossus is a super-computer created by Dr. Charles Forbin and his team, designed to protect the United States. Colossus one day announces that it has found another system called Guardian, a super-computer created by the U.S.S.R. for the same purpose. Colossus and Guardian link up and after much communication and exchange of data they reach a common ground, with a common language (known only to these two computer) and hold the world hostage. Sound scary? Yes, it is, a bit. Because of security reasons, the link between Guardian and Colossus is broken, after much discussions between the U.S. & the U.S.S.R., and Colossus gets uppity and launches missiles at the Soviet Union, as does Guardian at the U.S. The missile heading for the U.S. is intercepted but not the one bound for the Soviet Union, and a town and an oil field is destroyed but it's all covered up in the media. Of course there's much alarm between these two countries that they now have these two seemingly out-of-control computers calling the shots, and meetings are held to decide what to do. Dr. Forbin himself is more or less held hostage by Colossus, and tries to work around it by putting dummy warheads in missile silos and overloading the computer with tasks, but alas, nothing seems to get by this super-monster. This is some fairly chilling science fiction, and some decent cold-war scares, as things seem to be getting just a bit out of hand. Not a happy ending to this one either, which makes it all the more chilling. A decent film for science fiction & cold-war movie fans. Lots of familiar faces too (Marion Ross, William Schallert)although at the time it wasn't exactly a big-name cast. 8 out of 10.
