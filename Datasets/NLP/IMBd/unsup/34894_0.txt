Being categorized as science fiction is stretching the theme somewhat as time travel, the technology and theory played little part of the movie. Archaeologists have usually been portrayed as peaceful, enthusiastic scientists. I expected them to be overjoyed with the prospect of visiting an historical period for which they have an interest. However, even before they arrive in the midst of a medieval war they have all had several turns at arguing with each other. Even the scientists who developed the technology cannot agree amongst themselves. I did not seem to miss anything during a coffee break during which I did not pause the movie nor did anything important occur when I fast forwarded for a few minutes. Timeline is a fast paced action movie with a science fiction foundation and seemingly authentic medieval conflict. I would recommend this movie for a rainy day or late night insomnia. Although happy to have watched it, I'll never watch it again primarily due to the unnecessary and continual arguments and, secondly, because I could not understand why the 'bad guys' behaved as they did.
