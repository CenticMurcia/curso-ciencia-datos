A movie that totally blew me away when I first saw it. Somehow I've missed out on anything like it if there is. Why?<br /><br />It contains action, drama and has somewhere I think a conscience, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />Mr Boorman is such a talented filmmaker who every time somethings bordering on getting personal, might it be action or drama or feelings in general, put a little distance between the audience and the camera again. Its not much, hardly noticeable.<br /><br />What is does however is that it render the movie tones of reality, tiny pieces of documentary that somehow also makes it a powerful statement without indulging in pointers. Still its no lame movie. It just has nuances<br /><br />This might be seen as total contrast to many Hollywood action movies, who instead indulge themselves in personal feelings of the protagonists, and even heighten them technically, in order to manipulate the audience to co-feeling. We as an audience are relieved of the responsibility of our feelings, somewhat.<br /><br />Mr Boorman leaves us with a choice.<br /><br />Something about the story then: An American architect works in south America, on the border of the Amazon, One day his young son is kidnapped by indians....cant tell you more. Sorry... :). This is the start off.<br /><br />A must see....
