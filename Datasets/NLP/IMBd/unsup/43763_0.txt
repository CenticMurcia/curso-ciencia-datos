1st watched 2/3/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Andy Tennant): Attempt at light-hearted romantic comedy which just doesn't seem to click. Perry & Hayek are ok and cute at times, but the direction and script is really flat. There are times where I can see a joke working better in my own head than the way it is played out in this film. The presence of these two mini-stars are not enough to make the film work. The filmmakers seem to have been satisfied with just letting them be there and getting it over with. I saw this coming early in the movie. What's really bad is that the best parts happen in the last 15 minutes of the movie. There is a very funny scene with Perry trying to be the husband helping Hayek thru labor during a rain storm on a bridge. When this happened what came in my mind was -- what about the first hour and a half?? Likeable stars, not very likeable movie(better luck next time??).
