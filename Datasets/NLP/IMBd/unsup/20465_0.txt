It's pretty clear that this atrocious movie was largely trying to be an over-the-top dark comedy with plenty of Tarantino-like dialogue and characters. It sprinkled in a touch of disturbing imagry (crappy, pretentious goth art and an alien penis-creature with its eye-lids sewn shut ala "Hellraiser 2: Hellbound"), low-budget camera stock (video), ninja transvestites and tried to pull off a Sam Raimi kinda feel.<br /><br />Boy, did it ever fail.<br /><br />I like dark comedies and I love off-kilter, disturbing fare but -geez- this was just so unprofessional that you had to wonder why anyone watching it even cared! Clearly, the actors were having fun but none of that translated to me, watching it.<br /><br />Heck, I could almost respect it for some of the nice camera angles and filming techniques but just about as I was ready to give credit where credit was due, something appallingly stupid would happen. People get shot for no reason (and I'm talking NO REASON, here ... not even within the context of the four thugs who are the centerpieces of the film), the stereotypical drag queens were -well- kinda offensive (rather than funny), the pacing seemed sporadic, the dialogue -while peppered with realistic jargon and cutesy internally-referential life-comments that made you think these characters were real people- was superficial, and the "monster" of the movie was never given any real build-up before it started messing with people's minds. Worst of all, there was no real explanation for any of it other than the director/writer/star decided to throw so much blood around that "Kill Bill, vol. 1" would look pristine and "white" by comparrison.<br /><br />This is a very bad movie. Extremely bad. "Manos..." and "Invasion from Inner Earth" bad... Not "cult-classic" bad.<br /><br />It's just ... plain ... bad.
