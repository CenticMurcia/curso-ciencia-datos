To render the proper justice of Mallrats genius, it should have started as a novel. As a movie, I saw it get judged and snubbed by the film buffs, but let me disagree here, take Mallrats for what it is, an entertaining portrait of consumerism counter-culture.<br /><br />Petulent formula you might say? Well think about it. Mallrats has been made in 1994 and was portraying the first generation of grown up kids put up face to face with mass capitalism. As the portrait shows kids with mixed up feelings and a sense of confusions towards this abundance, it remains fun.<br /><br />Thats what Mallrats is. Pure fun. Kids forming their identity against all the abundance of stuff pushed down their throat. Crazy situations in a mall, epic story of reconquering your true love...in a mall...are they buying stuff? No. Sometimes you almost forget the thing is in a goddamn mall.<br /><br />I've had fun with this movie. Brodie Bruce is the prime example of the empty criticism towards his generation. Its not what you do that defines who you are, its who you are that defines what you do.<br /><br />Pure non-arrogant fun, killer dialogues and a legacy that lives on. Thanks Kevin Smith
