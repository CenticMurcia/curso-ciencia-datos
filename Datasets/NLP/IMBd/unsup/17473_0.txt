Being in the U.S. Army, I tend to favor military movies. This movie shows what our Veterans went through, and it lets people know what kind of heros we have in the military. Audie Murphy, being the most decorated man in WWII, is a military idol. I truly enjoyed watching Audie Murphy as himself in this movie.
