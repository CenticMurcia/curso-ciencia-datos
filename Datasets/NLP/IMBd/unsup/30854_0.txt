I never thought the time would come when Adam Sandler would no longer be funny. Unfortunately, this happened in this movie. I was very eager to see this film when I saw the trailer, but damn I was wrong about it. The beginning of the movie was filled with stereotypical lame jokes about Jews that were really offensive and already narrow minded American people will think that every one in Israel is like that. I know it's a comedy, but still, you have to draw the line somewhere. The so called martial arts and special effects done in "Shaolin Soccer" style were very poor and not funny. The plot is the same like in 1000 of others action comedies, but this one is told with in a hairdresser style. The accents were awful, the acting...Oh the acting...Oh my god, what the hell happened to Adam Sandler? What happened to the rage filled cool actor? It all went to hell with this movie. Thank you Dugan for ruining a comedy idol...
