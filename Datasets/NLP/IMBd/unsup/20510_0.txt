This is truly one of the worst events of my life , its painful to watch . Jimmy Fallon is one of the worst comedy actors in films today , I don't know why or how this ever got made but even then it should have gone straight to video . The studio ought to be sued for the hour and a half this took off of my life (although it felt like much longer) . In short if you like your comedy with some actual comedy that isn't covered in cheese and then rolled inside a ball of cheese and dropped into a 1 million gallon vat of cheese then don't watch this as its cheesy. I can't quite explain just how bad this is , it has absolutely no good points whatsoever . I wished through the entire film that Jimmy Fallons first crash in the film had been fatal , that way it could have just ended . I would of had fond memories of such a film , hell i would have paid to see it twice .
