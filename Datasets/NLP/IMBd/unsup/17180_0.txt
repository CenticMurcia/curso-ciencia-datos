(Some Spoilers) More like a home movie then anything else "The Sex Killer" plot is your run of the mill sex pervert film with nothing to recommended it but a number of pretty girls, who for the most part end up getting strangled, and a look at the grimy streets and red light district of Manhattan circa the mid 1960's.<br /><br />Tony who works in a mannequin warehouse in the Garment District of New York City is a bit shy with women having trouble making any connection or striking up any relationship with them. We see at the start of the movie Tony going into a camera store and buying a pair of binoculars that he later uses to spy, from the safety of a high-rise buildings rooftop, on young women sunbathing in the nude. Getting all hot and worked up seeing all these busty young women, who seem to be posing for him, from his porch on top f the high-rise Tony get up enough nerve t go down to Times Square and pick up a hooker.<br /><br />Tony's encounter with the hooker turns out to be a total dud with him not having enough money to have any action with her. All the hooker allows Tony , who only has $10.00 on him, to do is watch her undress and nothing more. It's then that something inside Tony's sick minds snaps and sets him off to stalk down and murder a number of young women, including the hooker whom he picked up, mostly in their apartments that Tony breaks into.<br /><br />The film "The Sex Killer" runs it's predictable course with Tony getting more and more careless every time he gets away with murdering his victims. Tony in order to satisfy his sick sexual urges also rapes and violates the womens after he murders them having him dubbed by the local newspapers and police as the "New York Necrophilia Rapist/Killer".<br /><br />Breaking again into a young woman's apartment in order to satisfy his now out of control and inflamed libido Tony ends up getting caught when she escapes from his clutches. Running out of her apartment and into the hallway ,totally nude, the young woman together with a good neighbor, who gave her a robe to cover up, get a hold of a cop outside the building to arrest the murderous pervert. Chasing Tony up on the roof the cop pulls no punches ,as he pulls out his revolver, blasting Tony and causing him to fall some 20 floors to his death below.<br /><br />Tony for his part was a very sick young man who desperately needed help to control and cure his uncontrollable and dangerous sexual desires. Unfortunately Tony didn't seek help and it was after he crossed that point of no return when he went from watching to murdering the women that turned him on that there was no help that society, other then long stretch behind bars or a cops bullet in his chest, could offer him.
