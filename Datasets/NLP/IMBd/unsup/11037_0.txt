They're probably friends and family of the filmmaker.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in this film. It has all the visual style and production value of an amateur softcore, but there's not one breast to be found...NOT ONE. Corrigan needs to stick to writing, but only after taking a few more classes in story structure. You can't just come out of left field with a crazy twist at the end of a movie and call it a potboiler. You gotta build up to it. The dialog is pretty good, but unfortunately, the people reciting it are not. It's painful to watch some of these performances. The one saving grace is Brandon Howe. Here's a guy<br /><br />just bubbling over with potential. You can see in his face that he's having<br /><br />trouble swallowing the crap this film is offering, but he manages to deliver an impressive performance.<br /><br />I know this film was shot for practically no money, but that doesn't mean the filmmakers deserve a pat on the back. This is a prime example of just because you can, doesn't mean you should.<br /><br />Now, put a couple pairs of boobs in there...maybe some girl on girl action, and you got yourselves a movie my friends.
