I watched this movie on dirty heads, so the picture was continually jumping. This disappointed the people I was watching it with, so they left. This did not stop me, however, from watching and, in turn, loving this beatiful piece of cinematic masterpiece. I am a huge fan of any movie (or thing) that is off-centre, and not-quite-right. "Delicatessen" fits this perfectly with its distorted camera angles and equally distorted characters. Jeunet and Caro have made one of the best movies ever!
