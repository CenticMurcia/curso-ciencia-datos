Ever since I first heard that the book by Erling Jepsen was being put into a movie I have been anticipating its release since I have read the book with much pleasure and since I have actually worked on that mental institution Sanne is committed to.<br /><br />It's a story of a family of five, where the oldest brother has left home to study, who are being manipulated by their father who is a neurotic Patriarch. He is the hysterical type, loaded with feelings of inferiority. This combination makes him go on a constant search for reassurance and comfort in a very egocentric fashion to a point where his wife simply gives up and instead either takes sleeping pills or challenges him to commit suicide. His youngest son, Allan, tries to help his father as he has not yet reached a point of maturity that allows him to see through his father behavior and understand it as manipulative. In doing so he becomes just as manipulative but we symphatize and forgive him as we understand that he does it out of innocence and loyalty to his father. As the story develops so does Allan and finally the alliance between him and his father is broken as he becomes more aware of the consequences of his father's actions.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the 1970's and there has clearly been put a lot of effort into making the environment typical of it's time with great success. The acting is flawless and I think it was a wise choice to let young Allan play his part in a very subtly and restrained way. This also makes the sinister themes more bearable to watch as Allan seems more or less unaffected.<br /><br />I would really recommend this movie; it gives a humorous portrayal of some very important themes without ever betraying them.<br /><br />Mojn Simon
