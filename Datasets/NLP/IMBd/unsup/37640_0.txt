I honestly cannot believe this show actually made it to DVD! Aaaaaagh! What next??? "Hello,Larry?" "Supertrain"? I saw this when I was 11 and even though they say kids will laugh at anything,that's not necessarily true. <br /><br />I watched Pink & Jeff go through their cue card read shtick but I sat there as blank faced & confused as Bart & Lisa Simpson when they don'tunderstand their parents. Un-funny! Those girls could not sing at all but yet,managed to squeak into the bottom American top 40 with,"Kiss In The Dark".<br /><br />The worst thing ever perpetrated on this show...They said Cheap trick was the musical guest one night,so I tune in and guess what? It's nothing more than the video for "Dream Police"!!! What a rip-off! Cool that I saw the video but that's just false advertising. No stars for this joke! A bad one at that! 5 weeks was 4 too many!
