This movie, "Monster on the Campus" is a very enjoyable, silly movie from Jack Arnold, made in 1958. The basic premise line is that a scientist played with stoic charm by Arthur Franz, is studying evolution and is accidentally bitten by a million year old fish which then causes the good professor to run amok on campus. The movie has some scary moments and some silly moments, the monster in a flannel shirt comes to mind, but overall it is good fun on a rainy night. The lovely leading lady is played by Joanna Moore, Tatum O'Neal's late mother, she showed promise in this movie, but I can't recall seeing her in any thing else. Enjoy this movie in all it's simplicity.
