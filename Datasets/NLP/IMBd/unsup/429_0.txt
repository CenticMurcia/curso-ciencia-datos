This is a cheap and tatty generic sci-fi military paranoia paste-up job, using clich√©s minted in a thousand other movies.<br /><br />It does the best it can on a budget of about ninepence, but that isn't very good. The special effects aren't very special (lots of ordnance expended, and the chameleon effect is interesting), and the alien is poorly executed.<br /><br />The cast (with the exception of Robert Culp, adding a few bucks to the pension fund) is composed of total unknowns, and this movie is not going to change that for any of them.<br /><br />And there is incessant use of the F word to no particular effect. It isn't big and it isn't clever, guys.
