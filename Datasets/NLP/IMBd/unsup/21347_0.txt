Easily a movie with no redeemable qualities to it. The acting was bad if they were even trying, the story was carbon copy: people stumble into evil and must stop it, and the action and horror was FEW and far between. I honestly could not finish what is with out a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen, I made it to 1 hour 16 minutes and I could not stand any more of it. The previews of it mad me so excited, but the actually movie was a let down. Save your self the time and don't watch it. <br /><br />Everything could have been fine if it chose a side. Horror or Suspense: pick one. The few moment of terror were cool, but they happened only a few times. There was a TON of story build up and character development, perfect for a suspense movie.
