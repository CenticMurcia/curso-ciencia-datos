I read some of the comments about that film and really thought i was gonna watch something worth watching, but..... The film in itself is very quiet, there is hardly any talking, which i personally don't like. You get to like the characters through their actions, but even then I was not impressed with it. The ending is very disturbing and fair enough it might happen far in the north but not everybody want to watch a film about a disturbed middle aged woman. My advise watch this if you really and even really bored, but overall the film was not to my liking and I'd say to any of my friends not to bother with it, even though it's got good actors in it.
