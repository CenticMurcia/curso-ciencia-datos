Reading through the reviews of this film, it's clear to me that the general viewing public (the folks who don't get this movie) really does like its action films to be big and dumb, and that they have been fooled by Hollywood into thinking that: a) "science fiction" is the same as "sci fi" (it's not); and b) "science fiction" is now supposed to be analogous to "action flick" (thanks for nothing, James Cameron!).<br /><br />The same people who will not attempt to think about (I don't mean "like," I just mean "think about") the second two movies in "The Matrix" trilogy are going to hate this film, because it is truly a science fiction film and not an action movie or a "sci fi" movie.<br /><br />For people who want to think about their entertainment, this is a great film for you.<br /><br />The things people are missing are because of the fact that they don't want to pay attention.<br /><br />Why are there Strangers in the form of little kids? Because the Strangers inhabit the human dead and, since children can die, the Strangers can inhabit their bodies.<br /><br />Can't the Strangers do anything? No, clearly they can't because, if they could, they wouldn't need the doctor for his work with humans. They clearly have limits to their powers.<br /><br />Why are the characters so wooden? Because they aren't comfortable with themselves. John is comfortable with his power at the end of the movie because he has grown comfortable with himself and who he is. Bumstead and Emma seem distant at first because they are only just introduced to those lives when we first see them. They have memories of being those people, but they are not those people and they are not yet comfortable in their skins.<br /><br />Again, this is a very deeply made film. You have to dig deep to discover what is going on. The Jungian themes, the emotional themes, the questions of self identity and how society, such as a city, can inform our identification of not only ourselves but those around us are set here for us to think about.<br /><br />So, in short, if you want a film to pay attention to and think about, this is your flick.<br /><br />If you want a big, dumb action movie, then go elsewhere - there's noting (for you) to see here.
