I watched this because of the same reason I watched the first three, they were on basically... I love 1, 2, and 3 but did not enjoy much of this at all. I'm not going to go down a list of things i liked and disliked, but will point out a few things. First I thought it was offensive (more because of the acting than the way the disabled were treated). Second, I thought it was a little too much like I thought the first three were going to be like (basically soft porn). Third, Too much of everything except the two things I wanted: Violence and humour. And finally, the fact they said at the beginning this was the true sequel to the first film, even though it pales in comparison to the films that came before.<br /><br />Oh... And what were Lemmy AND Stan Lee thinking!?!?!?
