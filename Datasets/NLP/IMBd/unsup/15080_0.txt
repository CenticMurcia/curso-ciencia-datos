I agree that this is an overlooked hitchcock. i don't really remember how I found it, I think AMC. But, it gripped me. I have seen it numerous times, and can not wait for it to be put on DVD, like Hitch's earlier works...from the 30s. Bankhead, and Gus and Hume do marvelous jobs, as do the other cast members.
