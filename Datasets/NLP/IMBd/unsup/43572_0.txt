This Starsky and Hutch caricature just doesn't work as a comedy (or as a caricature). It is off-kilter a few degrees in all respects. One of the many thoroughly forgettable films being churned out steadily these days. The film probably made money which is a non-tribute to the viewing public. The acting, directing, cinematography and editing are all mediocre at best. In a proper world all profits would be given to charity and the people involved would be horsewhipped for about ten minutes and sent off with a warning that the next time the punishment will be much worse. Being that this is not a proper world they will most likely buy a lot of coke and backpat each other around swimming pools.
