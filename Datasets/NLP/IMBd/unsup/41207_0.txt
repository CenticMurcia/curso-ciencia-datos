... but then, what else would you expect from Michael Winner?? You'll usually find that regular use of voice-over as a narrative device is the last refuge of a director incapable of being economical; alien to visual or nuanced storytelling. The trend isn't bucked, such is the case here.<br /><br />The world of he who orchestrates everything is colourless and grimy, with creeps populating every suburb. My word, he must have met some reprobates in his alternate lifestyles to have such a ceaselessly nihilistic outlook! Answers on a postcard gratefully received please, as to why the soundtrack apparently contains a didgeridoo. It's obvious that the person who composed it has no idea why...<br /><br />A female version of "Death Wish" with even more specious motivations. Just what the '90's needed to teach us how to be civilised, and - this is more important - hopefully make better films for the new millennium!
