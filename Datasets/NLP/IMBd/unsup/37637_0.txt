I am so sorry I wasted 6.00 dollars for this DVD. The selling and promotional materials seemed to indicate it was something of an artful classic. Beware, its a dog. I guess it was about 20 minutes in something said, it doesn't click. This is either bad acting, bad script, but in fact it was both.<br /><br />I cannot waste the kilowatt hours to see this sad flick again. Ron Howard did himself no favors by attaching his name to this dog.<br /><br />I mean from the get go, the script was so simplistic and hollow. At times Cate Blanchett changed her phony drawl and driveled moronic script lines, while he uneducated Indian father sounded as if he held a PhD. " I think they were abused"... what you say?<br /><br />Bad bad bad.<br /><br />and more bad !
