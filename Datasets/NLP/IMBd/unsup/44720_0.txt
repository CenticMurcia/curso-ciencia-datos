The good news: So much talent: 1. An Agatha Christie novel as basis for the plot. 2. Angela Lansbury playing Miss Marple 3. Elizabeth Taylor, a really beautiful woman over her prime, playing a really beautiful woman over her prime 4. Edward Fox a very good actor. 5. Kim Novak, another beautiful woman. 6. Rock Hudson was always good to look at. 7. Even Tony Curtis thrown in for good measure. Talk about an all star cast. The bad news: I'm not completely sure if it is the screenplay, the directing, or the acting but this movie was horrible. How in the world could so many good actors do such a terrible job. The two beautiful women, Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak played parodies of over age prima donnas. There is zero chemistry between Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor and it is not because they are older than they were in Giant, it is because they do not seem to care, certainly the audience does not. Do not judge Agatha Christie by this boiler.
