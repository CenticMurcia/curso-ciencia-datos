I liked the acting. There were no top class actors and I really missed Mark Hamill and Malcom McDowell. But there were a lot of actors I like.<br /><br />As a fan of the original games, especially part 3, this movie could've been a bit more than the games, casting the original actors and such. And instead of the fighting more story development would've been quite nice. I remember the ending of WC3 as being gloomy, with the Kilrathi home world being destroyed by mankind. A story like that... ah, this movie would be great. Instead we have a cheesy standard action plot. We are at war, the enemy stole a plot device and is threatening our whole race. Yawn.<br /><br />Well, the potential was out there, the movie didn't catch it. Sad, sad. But they still managed to make a decent SF movie. There are definitely worse movies than WC.
