And I mean that literally! Jana and Leslie decide to head up to Jana's father's cabin in order to get Leslie away from her extremely possessive jerk of a boyfriend. Mysterious murders begin plaguing the town, and Leslie and Jana become the next targets! As good as that may sound, TERROR AT TENKILLER has one major problem - It's way too talky! Not a lot really happens until the final act when Leslie faces off with the killer.<br /><br />The acting is pretty atrocious, and borders on bad soap opera acting (Port Charles, anyone?) Also, there is a scene with Jana when she is changing clothes that shows a different actress in her spot with bigger boobs doing the nude scene! I'm not kidding. Ed Wood would've been proud.<br /><br />Despite everything I just mentioned, TERROR AT TENKILLER still retains some 80s trash charm. It's good for one watch, but that's it. A true cure for insomniacs everywhere.
