Hysterical movie. Officer Scar is one of the best villains I have seen in any film. The way he gets his Scar is so ridiculous! The scene when he works out was really funny as well. The characters are so interesting and developed. I love the comedy in the dynamic between Montag and Scar. Caleb's performance I found to be a little dull, but the other characters more then made up for him. Paul Gleason as the George Washinton was great in his final role. It's really sad he passed away. When I went to see this film I wasn't so sure, because I didn't know anybody in it. I can't wait for this film to come out. When is it coming out?
