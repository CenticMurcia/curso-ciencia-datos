Sometimes I have this strange fascination where I have to watch stuff I know I'll hate. I like Jerry O'Connell as a TV actor, but can't think of a film he's been in since Stand By Me that I've liked. I tried watching Tomcats recently and it was(unsurprisingly) awful- very stereotypical and sexist. Then I saw "Buying the Cow" on (of all places!) the Oxygen channel and that Jerry O'Connell was in it. I thought, hey, if Oxygen is playing it, it can't be that demeaning to women or perpetuate tired gender stereotypes! Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />There are probably less than 5 films that I have never finished watching to the end- this is one of them. I usually don't review films without watching the whole thing, but this was just too bad.<br /><br />I couldn't make it past the homophobic terror scene when the guy thinks he got drunk and slept with a guy -folowing by a pedophilia joke. It could have been a funny scene, but they had to push the envelope from a funny misunderstanding to sheer homophobic panic - he has to be shown vomiting and almost kill himself just to leave - and then if that wasn't tasteless enough, they added a scene where he's mistaken for a pedophile!<br /><br />Sexism, homophobia & pedophilia jokes do NOT make for a good movie! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
