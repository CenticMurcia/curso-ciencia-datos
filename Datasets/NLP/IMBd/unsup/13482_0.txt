A 1970's Australian angst-crash apocalyptic pre-"Mad Max" delight, highlighting the dangers of insularity and resistance to outsiders (even the U.S-style corporation cabriolet kids at the beginning) in the midst of economic low times. Starting Peter Weir's central theme of "closed" or alienated sections of society ( see later "Witness","Mosquito Coast", "Dead Poets Society", "The Truman Show"), the Parisiens resorting to darkly humourous lengths in protecting their perceived ideal pioneer township is handled in typical Weir dreamlike fashion. Weird cars (and you thought the new VW Beetle was different!), great eclectic soundtrack, an underlying sense of menace, and a key early movie in the creation of a recognisable Australian film movement.<br /><br />
