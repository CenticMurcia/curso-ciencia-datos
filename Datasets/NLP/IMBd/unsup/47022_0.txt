I've always been a fan of Gothic horror/mystery movies. I love them, LOVE them! I was ready to sit down with my dad and watch a new movie which I thought I would love. I was....disappointed to say the least. So many questions were left unanswered...Why did the John have a limp? Why did Stephan say Marjorie was going to have a baby? Why were there random curtains hanging in the hallway? Why was this film so bad??? The staging just made me mad....horrible! The script made me want to rewrite it! The acting made me want to puke! Ed Wood could have done a spectacular job on this movie! I'm angry at Fritz Lang for not doing a good job, I'm angry at the writer for writing horrible lines that make the actors sound like idiots! Don't watch this film it will make you mad....
