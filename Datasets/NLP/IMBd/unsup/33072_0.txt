My brother and I rented this as a joke and out of curiosity. I mean, how do you make a movie about a couple floating around in shark infested water for 2 hours? Well we find out, and its every bit as boring as you'd imagine. This movie doesn't mess around, within 10 minutes of the start of the movie they are in the water and lost. The movie then goes on to show them floating there, and trying to make it seem suspenseful at times. But when it comes down to it, they are just floating there, often times doing absolutely nothing, not talking or anything. A lot of sleeping.<br /><br />It was unbearably boring. I've seen bad movies, but none that leave me squirming praying to a God I don't believe in for it to end.<br /><br />This is all not to mention how stupid it is to make a film that is "based on a true story" that no one can prove. For all they know they both dived in, bumped their heads on a propeller blade, and sank unconsciously to the bottom of the ocean, where they died peacefully in their sleep. They only call it a true story to reel in the people with true story fetishes (such as I) to the theaters.<br /><br />How they made a sequel I do not know, and I'm sure as hell not making the mistake of renting it just for s's and g's this time around.<br /><br />Terrible God-Awful Movie. Run away (and hide).
