Firstly, I want to say I went into this film not expecting a boring drama. What I got was completely the opposite. An exciting, powerful, drama. It was excellent. The acting was great, the direction was great, and the soundtrack was absoutley the best score I have heared in a long time.<br /><br />IF I do have any problems with the film, it would have been the length. It was a little too long, and one or two of the scenes that made it long were not really needed, but the rest of it was great.<br /><br />It was also a challenge to watch in some places. Like a book is considered a hard read, this was a hard watch in some places, and you really have to concentrate to enjoy it, but the rewards of doing so are huge. Definitley, if you are a fan of good cinema, see it! If you don't really like these films, then it still may be worth a look!<br /><br />Highly Recommended! 5 out of 5.
