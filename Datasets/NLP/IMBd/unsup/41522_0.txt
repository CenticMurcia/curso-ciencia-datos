How this junk ever got onto rental shelves I will probably never know. Reign In Darkness is not just horrid, it's REALLY BAD! We are talking bad direction, bad lighting, poor acting, et cetera. I cannot think of one positive trait for this flick. I am going to give my 7-year old Nephew a camcorder and see if he can make a better effort. It could not be any worse.
