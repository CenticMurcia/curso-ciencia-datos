I saw this movie on Star Movies yesterday. I liked this movie a lot. The underlying message of the movie was in spite of all odds things still work in India. Whoever is willing to take the risk of setting shop in such emerging economies like India can be assured of profits if he absorbs and shares the cultural diversities. For eg:The incident where Todd transfers the entire office to the terrace when water gushes in. Also the Holi festival & arse washing incidennts were unique<br /><br />But the girl was slightly too.despo & forward for a Indian small town girl. All the actors did their part well. Can anybody suggest me more movies with this theme ?
