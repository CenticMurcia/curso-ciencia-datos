This was a great movie really enjoy the viewing of it. It is fun but yet has some very real meaning. The movie has a real light side that makes it very enjoyable. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The actor and actress do a very good job in their roles. The movie really make you think about relationships and how they could turn in many different direction. I also liked the back drop for the movie it was easy to follow and enjoy. I also like the way the plot was carried out throughout the movie. There was a nice even follow in the movie. The character in the movie were just right but not over bearing. All the character seem to flow together and match each other perfectly.
