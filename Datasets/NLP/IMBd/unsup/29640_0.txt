I am stunned to see the low rating that this movie is getting here. I saw "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?", and I found it rather stereotyped and one-dimensional. (And "Adam's Rib" is my favourite movie of all time, so it's not like I don't appreciate Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.) "Guess Who," on the other hand, is fresh, touching, funny, and honest. The idea of switching the races from the earlier movie -- a white guy being introduced to a black family -- is a good one, and the movie tackles racial issues much more head-on and with an immediacy that affected me. The scene in which the white boyfriend tells jokes that has the family roaring with laughter but then suddenly frigid when one joke goes too far is highly symptomatic of the confusing problems behind the race issue: namely, that there are identifiable differences culturally between (most) blacks and (most) whites, but that some differences are more sensitive (on both sides), and that, in the end, we all wish they would go away.<br /><br />"Guess Who" always deals with serious relationship issues in a way that had my wife in tears. Yet, in spite of its seriousness, it was still basically a comedy that made me laugh out loud repeatedly. Unless racial issues are too serious for you to laugh at or too sensitive for you to want to think about, or if you don't like Bernie Mac's style of humor, this is a terrific movie that hits on all cylinders.
