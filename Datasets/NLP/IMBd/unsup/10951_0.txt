Being a Rosario Dawson fan it was only a matter of time before I would get around to seeing this film. After being disappointed with "Down With Love," more so with the script than with her character development I was not expecting much from this movie. I got a lot more than I bargined for. This is an excellet film with and excellent cast that really is a joy to watch.<br /><br />Although this is a great movie, there were a couple of things that I would have changed. The subject matter can get a bit redundant and and also the interviews can to. But that is just nit-picking. This is a great film that is worth renting whether you are a girl or a guy. This film really sparked my interest and even though I did not agree with some choices that were made in the end, I really liked this movie.
