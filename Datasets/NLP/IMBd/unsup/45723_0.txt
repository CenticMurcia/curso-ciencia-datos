The good points - beautiful scenery, and some viewers might appreciate the insight into mountain climbing in the 1930's.<br /><br />Bad points - the flashbacks are tedious, the ending obvious (to this viewer anyway)and - apart from Connery, who plays himself, as always - the acting uninvolving. And personally I don't care much about mountaineering in the 1930's, and this film didn't do anything to quicken my interest.<br /><br />There are some surprises, but I feel the movie really lacks from characters whom one can care about: in particular Betsy Brantley, who plays Kate, seems desperately out of her depth here.<br /><br />I found it to be pretentious and glacially slow. I'd rather have that ninety minutes of my life back.
