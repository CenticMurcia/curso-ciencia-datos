What's the difference between Space Balls and Scary Movie 2, 3 and a lot of the first one. Well Space Balls is funny all the way through. It does somewhat of a story not just a showcase for jokes. And thus the jokes and the story(spoof) are given a chance at humor.<br /><br />This spoof on Alias starts out funny then the stale joke gets quick fast. Yes, i do watch Alias. Think it's a good show. This spoof with hammered into your skull "jokes" and its "slapstick" humor was anything but. These directors definitely did a good job editing and getting locations but if that's the best you can say about something then is it really worth mentioning to others? Yes, to tell them to watch something better. <br /><br />So do yourself a favor and watch something better.
