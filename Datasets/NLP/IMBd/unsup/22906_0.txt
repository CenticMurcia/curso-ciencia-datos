Lloyd Kaufman personally recommended this film to me because I said that my favorite filmmaker was Jodorowsky -- and while this isn't really anything like Jodorowsky, it is still absolutely genius and is essential viewing for anyone interested at all in "avant-garde cinema".<br /><br />First and foremost, you will hate this first 10 minutes or so of this film. Everyone I've showed this to has agreed with me on this: This film looks like crap when you first turn it on. And the odd pacing and questionable plot points make it that much harder to love. However, as the film goes on, you find yourself actually enjoying the look of the film and the weird pacing. And you might even find yourself laughing a bit....<br /><br />Honestly, this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. At the same time, there is a quiet darkness at work here. Though it's easy to laugh at a senile old man shoving pork rinds in his rectum and having sex with an imaginary porn star, eventually you realize that we could very well be that same 90-year-old man one day; alone in a hotel room and having no idea what is happening inside our minds. That's the brilliance of this film: Nothing here seems to necessarily be played for laughs or drama or anything like that; the film simply presents a few unconnected stories and lets you interpret them how you like. It helps that every story is extremely interesting and absurd.<br /><br />Something no other reviewer has noted on here yet is how well-done the whole thing is. It's easy to make shot-on-video stuff look and sound like complete garbage, but everything is well-lit and in focus. All the actor's lines are clearly audible, and the music is fitting and well-made (I love the slide guitar theme every time the Frenchman comes on screen).<br /><br />Talking tater tots with toothpick penises, full-frontal nudity from 90-year-old men, sex with teddy bears, smoking dead pigs, munching on raw hamburger meat -- it's all here. An absolutely uncompromising gem of a film that I give my highest recommendation to. As much as I hate Harmony Korine's films, I always respected the ideas behind them -- this film pushes those ideas even further and actually makes compelling cinema out of it. A must-watch for fans of absurd cinema.
