This little movie has become one of our family's all time favorites. Honestly, we watch it over and over again, quote it to each other, show it to other people. No, it's not a great movie; but it is a funny movie. You just have to have a taste for silliness, a childlike taste.<br /><br />When the nefarious Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) kidnaps his legendary father (James Brolin), Pistachio Disguisey (Dana Carvey) has to learn the ways of "Energico" and go to the rescue -- not just of his parents but of numerous national treasures besides. Ably helped by an assistant Jennifer (Jennifer Esposito) and his mystical grandfather (Harold Gould), Pistachio slowly becomes the Master of Disguise.<br /><br />Carvey, who has always cracked me up anyway, whirls through an army of loopy characters -- Granny Num-Nums, Mr. Peru, Terry Suave, Constable Muller, Cherry Pie Man ("Look! It's Cherry Pie Man!," like everybody knows him), and the great Turtle Man. There are also Robert Shaw from Jaws and even President George W. Bush at a crucial moment.<br /><br />The DVD (yes, we own it) special features show those weren't all he had in mind -- Mayor Maynot is so well done, but was cut out completely, for instance.<br /><br />Special kudos to Spiner, who was evil, and Esposito, who played along hilariously. And the guy offering hors d'oeuvres to Mr. Peru, just for keeping a straight face.<br /><br />The Italian accents are uniformly awful, I'll admit, and the gags are sometimes dopey. But they're funny dopey, not painful dopey. If you're not too sophisticated to enjoy a simply enjoyable movie, rent this movie or pick it up for $5 at Half Price Books like we did. Watch it with some kids, about 10 years old. It will be difficult for you to stop laughing.
