I would agree with most of the reviewers that this is overall one of the best adaptations of "Jane Eyre" ever. It is one of my favorite British novels -- I bought my house because of Jane Eyre's love of window seats. Rochester is most aptly portrayed herein, even though I love Ciaran Hinds! However, I think Miss Cusack is and looks too old to play plain but not wholly unattractive "Jane Eyre". The long periods of verbal jousting may be too much for some but I enjoyed it. The production values are uneven. One one hand using what seemed to be actual houses; yet on the other, staged set pieces. While talking, the two main characters are in a beautiful outdoor setting then go onto what see obviously a staged outdoor setting. Very jarring!
