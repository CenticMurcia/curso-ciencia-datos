OK, there are a few cute scenes with Pandas, but apart from that... Shooting the people who made this isn't good enough! But you know, I actually thought this was part 3, because they released it on VHS under that title (since 3 and 4 were never released here). Maybe if I saw the two movies in the middle it might have helped, but as I'm just watching the real part 3 (and I saw the N'Xau imitating Bruce Lee) I somehow doubt.<br /><br />They should have stopped after part 2 - no more craziness. Make it good or don't make it at all!<br /><br />I mean come on!<br /><br />This was about a culture shock of "civilized" people not being able to survive in the desert, not about Panda preservation and running all over the Chineese Wall!
