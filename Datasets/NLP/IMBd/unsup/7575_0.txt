This is not at all what I expected and I have to say that I squirmed through the whole thing hoping it would get better but alas, it never did. Captain Invincible (as played by Alan Arkin) is a faded super-hero, who was the victim of McCarthy-ism and took up residence in Australia to drink himself into a stupor. But as circumstances would have it he's accidentally discovered to have super-powers by a lady cop who takes an interest in him, and them when Mr. Midnight (Christopher Lee) is threatening death and destruction, the U.S. Government puts out an APB on Captain Invincible to the world, so that he can be found to come to their rescue. That all doesn't sound too bad, huh? Yeah, well wait until they start to sing. Not that Christopher Lee singing and dancing with a deadpan look on his face isn't somewhat amusing, but this is chock full of songs and after a while I just wanted to stop the DVD before the end, although I somehow managed to get through it all. This may appeal to some, and it's not without its amusing parts, but I didn't in any way expect that this was a musical and that left me very disappointed. Just one more of those "what were they thinking?" kind of films, 4 out of 10.
