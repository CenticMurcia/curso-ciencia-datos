This film is about a silly man who gets to represent America on a space mission to land on Mars.<br /><br />The plot is really silly. The acting is so over the top. The punchline 'It wasn't me" is used to many times that it became so annoying. The jokes are not funny. The worst is that the props looks so fake. It can easily be seen that the space helmets are made of soft plastic. In one scene on Mars, the space helmets don't even have a glass shield on. I am sure the production budget of this film is even less than a typical B movie. I know this movie is aimed at young kids, but that is not an excuse for the movie being bad. This movie is an unfortunate embarrassment to the film studio's collection.
