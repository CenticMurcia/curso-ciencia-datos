Why We Had to Kill Bitch is the funniest film I have ever seen at a festival.<br /><br />The plot is well paced. Comedy is spaced evenly throughout and springs from the story instead of from canned laughter. Shot in first person, the difficult mechanics of POV and storytelling are well executed. Slick pulp fiction dialogue ties scene to scene and refuses to stoop to trite. <br /><br />Finally, the jewel of WWHtKB is the unique characters. I have met these people before in another life. Some I wish I still knew. Some I wish I could forget. The film is like Napoleon Dynamite... only different... sexier... more disparate.<br /><br />If I had three thumbs, they would all be up.
