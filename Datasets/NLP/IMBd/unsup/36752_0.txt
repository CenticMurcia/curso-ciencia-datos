Minor spoiler.<br /><br />In one of the early episodes (maybe the first episode), Oral and his family are on their way to church, listening to some kind of supposedly Christian radio station. They're kind of singing along to some song that goes something like "Reason is the enemy of faith, my friends."<br /><br />But, that's not really the Christian position. At least, it wasn't G.K. Chesterton's position, and he was a Christian. (Well, okay, he was an adult convert to Catholicism.)<br /><br />"When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises. I dressed up as a bishop. I read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets, in Superstition the Vampire and Priests of Prey. I certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind. I was misinformed. When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder, 'Down! down! presumptuous human reason!' they found out in some way that I was not a bishop at all. I was nabbed at once." -- G.K. Chesterton, _The Man Who Was Thursday_, Chapter II<br /><br />See also:<br /><br />Chesterton fans will probably remember when Chesterton's priest-detective, Father Brown, first interacts with the great criminal Flambeau, who was disguised as a priest. After he's been unmasked, he asked Father Brown how he penetrated his disguise. How did Father Brown know that the criminal wasn't really a priest? "You attacked reason," Father Brown answers. "It's bad theology." <br /><br />Ozy
