This is Gene Wilder at his best! It is one of my all time favorite films. If you ever wanted to be a movie star this film is for you. It shows the struggles of a new actor trying to break into film; at least as it was in the early days of Hollywood. As always Gene keeps you laughing until your sides hurt but what really makes this film different from his others are the love scenes. Their tenderness and passion will touch your heart and bring you to tears no matter how many times you watch the film. Although the only well known supporting actor in the film is Dom De Louise the rest of the cast are wonderful in their role portrayals. If you like Gene Wilder and you spend the hour and a half watching this film I know it will be one of your favorites as well. Let's all make a plea to the studio to put this one out on DVD. As for me it is a MUST HAVE in my collection.
