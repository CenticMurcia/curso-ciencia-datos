Mike Aguayo(Lamas) is a strange combination of naive friend and ex-cop,ex-con. He's got a good heart but he's a little weak on the moral issues. There is the friend(ex-partner) who is setting him up for the second time. There is the girl who loves him and the woman he is being paid to seduce but who he would willingly follow on his own without any kind of encouragement. In fact, the harder time she gives him the more he has to have her. But she is the one who has him just where she wants him. Thank God for a fair minded police detective with even better instincts who is willing to put himself on the line to find the truth! It would be wrong not to mention bedroom scenes with both women. I'm still trying to figure what it is they are doing in the first one!
