Just to clarify the above statement quote"Michael Knight's evil twin brother Garth" <br /><br />Michael Knight is in no way related to Garth because Michael Knight is an alias created by Garths father(cant remember full name) for Michael Long. <br /><br />A cop who is nearly killed by a scandal that is outlined in the pilot and as well in later episodes. <br /><br />I saw the movie as well and i thought it was mildly entertaining although i have to agree that it was overall a bad attempt to milk the TV series.
