I was privileged to watch this film days before its final run in Singapore at The Picturehouse. And what a treat it was. Taxidermia, from start to finish, is outrageous and carnal, but never vulgar in its approach and execution. The word "Taxidermia" in itself refers to the stuffing and preserving of living things, in a bid to achieve "temporary immortality".<br /><br />The cinematography of the film stays true to the different eras the three generations of men experienced individually. The bizarre, off-the-wall characteristics of the three underscore their hunger for the very same ambitions  to gain acceptance and fulfillment.<br /><br />The scurrilous and brutal imagery in the film are certainly not without meaning; this redeeming feature alone sets it apart from the far too common gross-out functions we've come to accept from bigger titles.<br /><br />Besides being blemished by the handful of niggling inconsistencies in its character portrayal and plot, my biggest beef with this film is that the representation of the three men is sometimes too distinct; you get a feeling that you're watching three separate films, mashed together into one. But of course, I'm nitpicking here.<br /><br />Taxidermia is a stellar effort that is definitely worth your money. The world has not seen enough of the brilliance that is György Pálfi. Just remember to leave all food at the door!
