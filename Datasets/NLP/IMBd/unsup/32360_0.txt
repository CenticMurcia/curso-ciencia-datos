This movie was absolutely pathetic. They obviously spent so much money on special effects they forget to hire some half decent writers for the script. If your a fan of nothing but explosions, shooting, and almost no plot whatsoever, this is the movie for you. The wife being kidnapped is so over used. The jewel thieves were good, but John Cena, you suck at acting in a movie, save the acting for the WWE. People who think this was a good movie are obviously philistines. If there were negative ratings, I would choose them. The Marine is fun if your in the mood for guns and big booms, but the acting was appalling, and the script was absolute crap. 1/10
