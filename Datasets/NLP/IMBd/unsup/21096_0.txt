The story has... well... huge holes! But the relationship between father and son made this movie worth watching!! <br /><br />The young actor, Jesse, has alot of natural talent and is surprisingly believable in his role as this self-assured young man.<br /><br />So, set aside reality, get out a large dose of salt and enjoy.
