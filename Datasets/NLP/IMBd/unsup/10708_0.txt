I originally wasn't going to compare this to "Fame", but it's kinda inevitable. Don't get me wrong...I love "Fame" and will always love it, but "Camp" just had something about it that stuck with me. I guess it's just more relatable for me. In my high school plays I was the "honest to God straight boy" among the fag hags and the gay guys. I wasn't always as lucky as Vlad...but that's a story for another time. Anyways...the songs in the movie (original and broadway showtunes)were hella rad. The cast just completely blew me away, especially the girl who played Dee, my favorite character in the movie. All around awesome movie...these kids have very promising futures with their talent. "Camp" is definitely my new favorite movie.
