This is truly one of THE worst countdowns I have ever seen. These "comedians" couldn't make a funny wisecrack, even if it flew out their butts. Also, the people ripping apart these songs are being some of the most pretentious buttholes I have ever seen on a countdown. To add insult to the injury they make "funny" comments on some rather good songs, such as "Broken Wings" and "I Will Do Anything For Love". They even pick apart songs that actually have a great message, such as that Bette Midler song "Watching Over Us". With such crap mainstream music out today I wonder if they actually listened to some of these songs or just decided to say "hey guys, let's just pick songs at random to build an entire 2 hours by making unfunny comments and trying to say something smart". If you want people picking apart things by actually being funny watch "I Love the 80s", "I Love the 70s", "I Love the 80s Strikes Back", the upcoming "I Love the 90s", or better yet, "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Otherwise skip this piece of crap countdown.
