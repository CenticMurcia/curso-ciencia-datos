Like other Canadian horror movies, this one too, is rather mild and benevolent and opposed to the recent wave of mean-spirited American productions. The story involves female aliens disguised as "hot" college girls looking to procreate. I use quotations marks because the supposedly super hot sorority chicks aren't particularly attractive. Some even look well past college age. With one exception: Kim Poirier who absolutely steals the show. What an adorable and sexy woman. She just sets the screen on fire. Why haven't we seen more of her, she can easily carry a movie and deserves more work. The movie has a soft look and there's quite a bit of focus on relationships and friendships, unlike ordinary horror flicks that are more like loosely connected gore segments. Overall the tone is refreshing and enjoyable. The script is standard with one exception, the surprise twist at the end, which I didn't expect at all, given that everything seemed standard. Movies like these should really be offered also in unrated editions, so there's more nudity and sexual situations, given the theme of this movie. I'm looking forward to seeing part II.
