I don't really need to say anything about the excellence in Emily's performance as Brigitte, do i, Katherine is also great as ever, in her best role, only rivaled by her little part in Freddy vs. Jason.<br /><br />but i wanted to talk a little about 'Ghost', played by 'young' Tatiana Maslany, i have written young in lines because when i watched the movie i thought, about 11 up to 14, not older, no way, but she was 19 at the time, unbelievable!!! but she was so very good as the little innocent girl ghost pretended to be and she kinda really looks like a little cute teenage girl, the kind you normally call friend of your little sister or some sort of that.<br /><br />and the twist at the end with ghost was just brilliant, because you always believed Tatiana her role, but there are a lot of clues earlier.<br /><br />There are some nice Gore effects in the werewolf victims, but it's never on a 'Braindead' level, so it always looks realistic, while Bridgets transformation is as great as Gingers in the first 1, kinda reminding of The Fly, not the original but the gory remake.<br /><br />overall together with the first one my favorite part, i mean normally i'm not a fan of little girls in movies, and i hate it most if the director wants to force you into still liking her after she killed humanity or some sort of that, like the children in 28 Weeks later who have just wiped out our world and humanity, hated them right from the beginning, while i even liked Ghost after we learned about her, i mean it's quite a feat playing at the end a little murder girl and still appearing genuinely innocent, but i think it's the way her illness makes her into believing what she does.<br /><br />overall a great horror movie, with just enough suspense and gore to never get into the way of the story, at the beginning i thought, not a movie like Halloween 2 (great movie)again, were they just systematically wipe out some sort of hospital, but then she escapes and the story goes on and on, just good old story-telling like it should be.<br /><br />TAKE THAT Saw 3-5 (part 1 and 2 had good stories, but from part 3 onwards only Gore because they hadn't really much of a story to tell.
