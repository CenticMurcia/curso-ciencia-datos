Oh my god what rubbish some people say about some crap films<br /><br />The film is a remake of ANGELS WITH A DIRTY FACES and is so bad it makes you cringe<br /><br />Srk plays a Bachchan type of goon role and tries hard but his weird voice and his utterances at every sentence gets to the nerves<br /><br />The goons to even the cop are cartoons<br /><br />The film shows RAM JAANE as a big hero praised by Bhasti Vale Like Bachchan in AGNEEPATH, SARKAR<br /><br />Rajiv Verma direction is bad Music is okay<br /><br />SRK as said before tries hard but his weird voice and also expressions at places are a give away Juhi is okay Vivek Mushran is okay the rest ham even the talented Pankuj Kapoor
