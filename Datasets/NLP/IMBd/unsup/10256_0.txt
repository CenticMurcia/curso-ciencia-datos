I've never seen any movie like this where people represent dogs about to be put down and their characters. The movie keeps switching back and forth between the actors and the animals. The actors talk and you get a feeling for the animals.<br /><br />It's sad and yet funny.<br /><br />One animal starts to have a baby and another tries to have sex with another dog and the viewer gets to understand by watching the actors represent these dogs.<br /><br />One dog is about to be put down and you see how nervous he gets.<br /><br />One gets a different feeling for one's pet after watching this movie.
