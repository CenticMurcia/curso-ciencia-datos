This seemed to be an action packed movie as stated in the comments that I read.I am a fan of Lou Diamond Phillips so thought it would be a good one to watch,but according to the review it was to contain violence and language,but about 15 minutes into the movie it had female nudity which I prefer not to watch in mix company,I felt let down since I rely on the ratings and that they did not state that and so we did not complete the movie. I Realize that IMDb have way to many movies to watch them all ,but i thought one of the comments would have stated the the ratings missed one,for the ones who watch for it. anyway thank for trying.
