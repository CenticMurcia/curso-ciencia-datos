I picked this up as a twofer but the comparison the Blair Witch was thankfully nowhere near as bad as that one-the Blair Witch is ins a category of its own as sheer unadulterated BADNESS.Nothing is or ever will be as bad as that film. This movie isn't bad but so much of it was unnecessary. For a start the scenes of a blazing house and the firemen had little to do with anything which followed. Also the reason the 2 firemen are supposed to dig up what they thought was a body-as there were a number of unaccounted for disappearances-again not needed as part of the plot-was really where it began after all the faffing about with another sub plot connected with the fireman's wife who objects to his drinking-yet it never showed him sloppy drunk he'd just had a few drinks.So what everybody drinks. We then get a story moving into total fantasy as the bones and skull of what looked like a rhinoceros come to life and start leaving parts of bodies all over the town.Naturally the police don't believe the theory that the remains of the bodies have been killed by a creature who chewed them to death!. And it gets sillier as it goes on-after the fireman's wife is attacked and left for dead she later makes a complete recovery in the hospital! But thats about where it ends-no doubt the budget ran out!
