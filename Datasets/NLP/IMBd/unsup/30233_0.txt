With all due respect to the other reviewers here, I feel compelled to disagree completely & whole heartedly on their view of this movie. I'd also love to have some of whatever they were smoking which made this movie so stellar for them. I would point out to those considering watching it that the average is 5.3 stars and in my opinion, that is generous. The script is slow, the dialogue juvenile & tacky and, while the actors do their best with it, the performances are most definitely lacking. <br /><br />If you want a "realistic" feeling movie about infidelity, try "Unfaithful" with Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez. Well written, spectacularly acted & far closer to real than "Nina Takes a Lover."
