If you liked the first two Dundee's you're guaranteed to like this one.<br /><br />There are a steady flow of chuckles and a few laugh out loud moments in this entertaining installment. Hogan and newcomer Cockburn have good chemistry and for once a child actor is not an annoying brat. Equally good is Alec Wilson as Jacko, Mick's outback mate who comes to LA as a baby sitter.<br /><br />There are a few jokes that only Americans would get, a few that are corny and a few that fall flat. It is almost a cross between Crocodile Dundee and "Crocodile" Dundee II in its writing. The action sequence at the end of this one is far more comical than the second and doesn't take itself as serious. One factor that may be missing is the loss of the character Wally (deceased actor John Mellion)<br /><br />All in all Hogan's charisma takes this beyond just an average family film, and a worthy sequel to a great franchise. I did wonder once it had finished, if this film would be more successful if it had been released closer to the first two and sadly I'd say yes. Still, it is a good reason to head down to the cinema for a light family film.
