On the cover of Scary Movie i got it had an Ape on it ,what was that all about.I watched the movie expecting to see King Kong was disappointed when there wasn't.I like the movie otherwise.Another comment is why do they keep bringing back some of the characters that was killed off in the first 1??This is just a question not a spoiler.I am a huge fan of Scary Movies as well as any other Spoof movies.Scary movie makes you want to laugh out loud and have a great time and even makes me come up with some good ideas for the next scary movie if i could hopefully someday there will be a contest for the best plan for next scary movie.if so i have many ideas.
