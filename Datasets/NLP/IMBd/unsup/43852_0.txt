As most films made in Hollywood are, this film had a certain degree of fiction attached to it. Even so, I did enjoy the acting and the scenes moved along very nicely. <br /><br />However, as much as I enjoyed Holly Hunter's acting, I really don't enjoy seeing her on screen considering her extreme left-wing views and hate of anti-communists. She was one of a handful of actors that refused to honor the great Director, Elia Kazan, when he was honored by the Academy. What did Kazan do wrong in her mind? He identified known communists in the film industry when ordered to do so by not only the film companies but also under penalty of perjury by Congress. Kazan did his Constitutional duty by identifying those that were acting in the capacity as agents of the Soviet Union. So, Holly Hunter protested Kazan for something that happened 50 years ago. <br /><br />I think there are many fine actresses that could have played Hunter's role and because of her anti-American positions, I think the role should have been given to someone else. Otherwise, I would have rated the film higher.<br /><br />Lastly, the closing epilogue states that only half of coal miners are Unionized, as if that was a crime in of itself. The reality is that non-unionized coal workers prosper as well if not better and clearly the film makers were trying to suggest otherwise inspite of this fact. So, yes, the film was made as partly a piece of propaganda. The fact is that since the 1950's the UMWA (the Union in the film) has been steadily losing ground in a very quiet war against non-union coal producers. By 1980 the industry of coal production amounted to more than fifty percent of non-union workers.<br /><br />However, even with the little propaganda and Holly Hunter's inclusion in the film, I still recommend this film.<br /><br />
