It doesn't destroy the memory of what was once a wonderful horror movie franchise, but Candyman 3: Day of the Dead is certainly an immense embarrassment to its predecessors. The first two films in the series  Candyman and Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh  were creepy, well-acted and sublimely scary. This third iteration is a bland, horribly acted, complete waste of time. Speaking of the acting, the most entertaining aspect of the film is watching Donna D'Errico (from television's Baywatch) try as hard as she can, in hilarious futility, to act. She fails so miserably at acting that you almost feel bad for her. The most offensive aspect of the film, though, is its storyline, recycled from bits and pieces of the first two films to the point of idiocy. In fact, there are parts of the Candyman myth that the film even gets wrong. It's a really bad sign when a sequel doesn't even get its own background story correct. I'd fill you in on what the film is (trying) to be about, but there's really no point. If you're interested in a film that got it right, instead of horribly wrong like Candyman 3: Day of the Dead, pick up a copy of the original Candyman instead. At least then you'll be entertained.
