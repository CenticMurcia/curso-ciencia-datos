I grew up in queens in the mid seventies and it's not much different. Look, the film works. It works on so many levels, I can't begin to catalog them all. But for me, it works because, at the end of the day and looking back over thirty years, I knew a few of those guys. Everone has a dream, and the dream has a way of changing as you grow up. But is is rarely the same one you started with.<br /><br />You want to be happy? find a girl you can climb to the top of a building with and howl. Howl your heart and soul out and don't ask why. Or find a woman who "is Queens" and don't let her go. And, after all is said and done, it's not always about climbing a bridge. Acting in a movie or painting a masterpiece. What it's about dear readers, is what this movie is about. Friendship that lasts.
