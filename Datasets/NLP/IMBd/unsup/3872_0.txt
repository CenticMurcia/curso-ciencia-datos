Great music, yes, okay there was something good about this movie. Okay, fine, thinking about it, i'll admit one more thing: What's Her Name was great, the redhead Goethals Bridge, black bra chick. Yummy! Other than that THIS MOVIE WAS HORRIBLE. Were those dorms those kids were living in? Seniors and they live in dorms? In my world we call those people LOSERS! Also in my world this movie was not that funny, it really had very few laughs in it. I'm gonna overlook the celebration of pornography and disco, make no comment on the pot smoking, but when it comes to the promotion of homosexuality, well, that's where I puke. This movie had been humming along at a lame pace and finished on a slightly more upbeat lame pace but there around the middle was the deciding factor, what turned this from *maybe* a D or D- movie into a 1 out of 10, a pure Grade F movie: the acceptance of a man kissing another man. AHHHHHHHHH no no no no no no that should not be. F F F F F F F. F for Forget this movie. F for Find all copies of this and burn them. F for Freakin' sick. Wait. One more thing that was good about this movie: the fact that it's now over and I can get on with my life. Unfortunately I'll probably have a nightmare tonight after watching this but I'll recover... I hope.
