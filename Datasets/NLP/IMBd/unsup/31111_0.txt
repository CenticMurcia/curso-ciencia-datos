One of Jeff Wincott's better films. Lot's of karate and a** kicking in this movie. It's been awhile since I've seen it but Jeff Wincott and Gary Hudson are brothers. Jeff's the good cop and Gary is the not-so-good cop. They end up butting head's later on but I won't go there. Jeff is ripped and Gary's not-so-ripped. Gary's taking drug money and using it to better his quality of life.(At least I think that's how it goes). They both get fatherly advice from their Dad played by character actor everyman Richard Jaeckel. Incidentally this was his last movie, he died of cancer in 1997. Seeing how withdrawn and sick he looked here suggests he wasn't doing too well at the time of filming. God rest his soul.
