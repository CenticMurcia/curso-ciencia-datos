This is an excellent movie. Well written, directed and acted. One of the few movies well worth the price of admission. See it, and enjoy... I have no idea how a movie such as this could receive ratings of 1. Which account for 10% of the total votes, obviously these people did not actually see the movie, and must have a hidden motive behind such a rating.
