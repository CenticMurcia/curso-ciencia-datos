I saw it and I loved it! I think this could be one of the best films of Nicolaescu's! Great directing, a great script and great acting are the high points of this movie. I also love the filming locations: those places are fascinating! There is nothing wrong with this movie. Of course it could have been better. But, in this case, "better" means "the best!". I'm so proud because "Orient Express" is great! It makes me feel so good being a Romanian. :) <br /><br />I recommend this to all: it's a romance/drama very, very deep and cool! You'll love this picture!<br /><br />9/10
