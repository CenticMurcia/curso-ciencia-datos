Ina Garden rocks her cooking is simple,tasty,and fun to make. I love making her deserts it's really easy. She talks the talks and walks the walks. I mean some other cooking shows the ingredients are really hard to find. But Ina recipes are easy and great. I mean her famous roast chicken are really tasty. I bought her book about 2 weeks ago and the recipes are easy. In her show I sometimes like to cook along with her. And I love cooking, Ina's show makes a big difference for new people who are trying to cook. Watch this show and love it. It has great ideas of cooking and you might learn something new. Like I learned a new way of how to set the table..................laugh out loud. But the point is she is a great host a chef and her cooking is of the hook.
