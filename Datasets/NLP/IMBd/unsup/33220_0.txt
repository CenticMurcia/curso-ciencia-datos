Im in one in two minds- so Ill do two reviews!<br /><br />Why the hell make a movie? Why, why, why make a movie? This is like saying "ill go out in the rain with my best outfit on" Were they all blind when the animators were making this? It was better making a series! Also this film just wants to make me laugh! A TEN year old - discovering his destiny and sacrificing his life for the sake of Pokémon. EXCUSE ME?? hello earth to planet "real life" a ten year old would not be doing that. They would be playing football. Also, this scared my little cousin to death and was crying- do you think thats how you score "good movie points"?? make half your audience cry while half are laughing their heads off?<br /><br />A fun adventure for a die hard nine year old Pokémon fan! If you are completely NUTS about Pokémon then this is SO for you! Feel the rush of excitement as you watch the trainers try to defeat mew two. The most powerful Pokémon on earth. And realise the true meaning of "master" and "Pokémon". Then feel your heart burn as you see young hero ash sacrifice his life for the sake of Pokémon. A heart warming story.
