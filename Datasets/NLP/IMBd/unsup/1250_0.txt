This was a very heartbreaking story of human beings, Children of God, being tortured on a daily basis by people without any souls and heartless beasts, called Nazi's. It is easy for the Nazi soldiers to say," Hitler told me to do it," but deep down in their own hearts they all knew it was wrong to treat any race or religion in this fashion. Kirsten Dunst, (Hannah Stern), "Elizabethtown",'05 played the role of a Jewish gal who had a mind of her own and wound up in a concentration camp in Poland and was placed in a camp for women only. Unfortunately, there is a baby born in this horrible place and the women did everything in the world to save the child's life. There is a scene which really shows how the Nazi's killed innocent beaten down human souls. A film you must tell the younger generation about and NEVER FORGET and never let anyone tell you it NEVER HAPPENED ! It sure DID !
