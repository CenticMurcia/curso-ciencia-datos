It seems the writer and/or director was going for something prophetic in the name of modern relationships, but got horribly lost along the way by throwing in cliche after cliche plus a disjointed meaningless script that went absolutely nowhere. I strongly suggest that those who love Freddie Prinze, Jr. should stare at his picture for 90 minutes rather than paying $8 to endure this torturous abomination. There is no softness in Julia Stiles' performance to make you like her or believe that FP would fall so head over heels in love with her. I kept asking myself throughout (in between many glimpses of my watch) "What is going on here?" The supporting characters seemed to be included for "American Pie" type humor that wasn't even funny. It really makes you wonder who got paid off to get this wretched film made.
