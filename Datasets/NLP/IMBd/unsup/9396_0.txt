Boris Karloff gives a good performance as General Feredes,one of several people he quarantines on a small island where his wife is buried. Suspense builds as each person is struck-down and the superstition of Feredes begins to grow,fuelled by the malevolent housekeeper. An interesting sub-plot is that one of the victims suffers from catatonic trances,and is mistakenly buried alive. Claustrophobic and atmospheric,guaranteed to send a shiver down your spine.
