As an old rock&roll road dog who played for years and later went into production and management of younger rock bands, I think this movie has a lot to say on many levels. <br /><br />I'm not going to comment on a review as such BUT the internet TV view listing I saw when I went to see if it was going to play again said that these kids had gotten good "dispite" the way the teacher had gone about doing it...<br /><br />To me it's funny how a little rough language towards the kids says somehow the teaching method was a failure.<br /><br />Without giving away anything about the movie I will say this: I remember going to a school as a young child where I was in a talent show. I rehearsed for weeks and won!...After it was over I realized that EVERYONE had won something.....all 50 kids!<br /><br />I was placated into thinking that was how life worked, then wham, the reality of musical life hit me when I went on the road in the real world.<br /><br />Let's face it, people as a rule (and young people in particular) are basic under-achievers. Sometimes all it takes is a little bit of "frustration love" to make it all click. <br /><br />Music itself is a passion, not a method, and rock music even more so than most.<br /><br />As a parent myself I would suggest this movie to anyone who has a musically inclined child not matter what genre' they wish to pursue.<br /><br />Competition is within ones self, not against everyone else. If the fire of music is in a child it will come out if handled right, if not, then thats OK also, but don't let it just die as a faint ember of creativity...fan it into a full flame of artistic expression.
