I haven't seen this video, but I did see Julie Harris perform this role on stage in London many years ago. It is a fond and treasured memory. I'd love to own the video but can't seem to find it here in the UK. I became a Julie Harris fan after seeing her in East of Eden when I was a very young man. I love Emily Dickinson too so the combination of ED and JH is irresistible. I also saw her in Terence Rattigan's In Praise of Love, co starring with Rex Harrison, in New York in 1974. And I think her performance of Sally Bowles in the film of I Am A Camera is by far the best performance of that role. Although Judi Dench was pretty good in the musical Cabaret on stage in 1968 or thereabouts.
