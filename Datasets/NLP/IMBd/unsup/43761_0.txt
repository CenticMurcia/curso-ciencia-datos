I have been extremely surprised at the good reviews this movie has received at this site, given the high level of criticism that I have observed of other movies at this same site. I guess many people wouldn't even bother to say anything about this bland, unemotional,anticlimactic and pseudo sentimentalist film which would only please secretaries, school teachers, nurses, construction workers, college students studying business degrees and the so called nice people of this planet. Lack of substance, and predictable mannerisms make this film an event only greater than a fly landing on my popcorn. I will give this film 0.2 to counterbalance the other comments.
