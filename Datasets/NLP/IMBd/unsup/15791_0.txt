I liked this documentary because it didn't take one side. It looked at both sides from both perspectives and let the viewer decide on what they wanted to believe. I think that it's pretty sad that people discriminate based on an ancient book that was written thousands of years ago. I like that the concept that gay is wrong wasn't the only thing pointed out although it was the point of the documentary. There were things such as not being able to eat shrimp or pork. It made me pretty sad to know that people are mean to gay people just because of some lines written in a book. People who take that seriously don't understand or perhaps never met a gay person. It's the twenty first century, man. I'm moving on with my life.
