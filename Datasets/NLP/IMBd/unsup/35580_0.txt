Symphony of Evil is a slow moving film with a few nice touches. The opening scene is quite good, as we see a woman pushed from a window and her blood spilling onto a rose. Following this the pace gets a little slow, until eventually a bit of stalk-and-slash kicks in. The mask is really cool, very similar to the Michael Myers mask, yet unique in its own way. There are a few scenes that almost seem stolen from Halloween, such as when the killer is behind a washing line. The music is also rather similar. <br /><br />The music and scenery in this film is great, and the chase scenes at the end are quite good too. What spoils the film however is the slow pace and the fact that you know who the killer is all the way through.<br /><br />I wouldn't particularly recommend this film as it's nothing special.
