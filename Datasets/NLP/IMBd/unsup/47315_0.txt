OK I'm 15 and i saw this movie one night after band.................i thought it was the worst possible thing ever i mean i have seen SO....many movies because my family are movie freaks so ya.......There was no music thats was it sounded like all together, the scenes were god awful and the whole movie was all together fake looking and u can tell it basically looks like a slide show thats animated and was photo shopped it was a disaster. After i had seen this movie i compared it in my head with the first and how the first one was based off the book i can see that it was extremely better in my eyes but to all you people that like it can you tell me what was going through your head when you saw this movie. Im not trying to be mean its just i don't get it.
