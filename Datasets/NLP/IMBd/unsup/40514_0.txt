Don't know what all the hype was about. All in all I cried about wasting my time watching this over-hyped film. Did absolutely nothing for me.<br /><br />As for the big surprise, it certainly was not a secret to me. It was telegraphed way ahead of time, so that my reaction at the fateful moment was "is that all there is?". I actually kept watching the rest of the movie since I was expecting something bigger or more shocking.<br /><br />Nothing at all special about this movie.
