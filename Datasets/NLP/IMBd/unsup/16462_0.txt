"Explorers", in its exploration of space through the eyes of three young boys, shows the wonder of discovery, the thrill of flight and, unfortunately, the limits of imagination.<br /><br />There is imagination to spare in this film, up to a point. Until that point comes, however, we are treated to a parade of funny special effects, some humorous and some painful slices of life from those who grew up not fitting in and, most importantly, how friendship can grow into something special. <br /><br />The three boys (especially Phoenix) make the most of their situation when they discover a way to create their own spaceship and decide to take it for a spin. They end up in outer space and land inside the jaws of a waiting spaceship. ...it's about here that the steam starts to wear off and, aside from a few old vaudeville routines and some surprising alien exchanges, it doesn't really end up as much of an encounter. <br /><br />But still, "Explorers" is a lot of fun on many levels, especially if you're a Joe Dante fan. <br /><br />TIDBIT - When one of the aliens does the whole line about "Space Pirates" near the end, rating that movie PG-13, it's fitting to remember that Dante's "Gremlins" was the very film that inspired the entire PG-13 debate.<br /><br />Seven stars. Way to go, kids.
