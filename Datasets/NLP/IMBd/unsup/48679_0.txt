I came into this expecting it to be bad. I had no idea how bad it was. The title suggested it might be in the Naked Gun/Airplane style of humor, which when it works is good, when it doesn't can be mildly amusing. I don't know what it was. <br /><br />It makes me wonder if the director had actually even seen a movie in his life. Perhaps it was an experiment to see what would happen if you took someone who had lived his whole life in a dark mildewy closet with only half a moldy, mildewy rat for a playmate, and set him loose behind a movie camera.<br /><br />Actually, 90 minutes of watching someone sitting in a dark mildewy closet, playing with a dismembered moldy mildewy rat would be more entertaining than this piece of garbage.
