See John Wayne playing Genghis Khan like a cowboy. Listen to Oscar Millards' ridiculous dialogue and Waynes' struggles to enunciate it. Listen to the whole cast struggle. Watch Susan Hayward sulk and pout. I think she was meant to smoulder but it is quite likely she was doing all she could do to stop laughing at her co-star.See and listen to John Hoyt giving the worst-ever impersonation of a scheming Oriental. Look at great tough-guy actors Ted de Corsia, Lee Van Cleef and Leo Gordon dress up in funny clothes. See a world in which " plunder and rapine were a way of life and no-one trusted their brother" but do not expect to see any rapine, just the plunder. Enjoy some spectacular horse-riding and stunt work, and the Utah Valley scenery ,for that is about all their is to enjoy. The rest is just funny in an open-mouthed head-shaking they-could-not-be-serious kind of way. To think that so many of the cast might have died during the years that followed as a direct result of the locations used for this film adds a more serious undertone to it all.They really need not have bothered making this tosh.
