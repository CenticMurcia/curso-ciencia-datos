Saw this on Sky Movies a while back and I have to say this is a total mess of a film. Maybe it was because I was tired, but hardly anything in this film made any sense at all, and wasn't one of those "teenagers" the demonology expert from 'Night of the Demons 2'?<br /><br />There are two plotlines shambolically merged together in this film, both centering around Kerry (Suzanne Davis). In one plot we have a group of teenagers on a field trip being attacked by bigfoot-type creatures, in the other we have Kerry seeing a psychiatrist due to depression and nightmares (one assumes that Kerry is seeing the psychiatrist after the events of the field trip). A story about Kerry's childhood eventually unfolds but it would be quite easy to lose track, especially with the completely nonsensical ending.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to fully understand what is going on due to the directors decision to flash back and forth constantly between the two storylines, and also showing images and visions that appear to have no place in the film at all. Even some of the characters seemed to have no place in the film like a Native American who, as far as I remember, says and does next to nothing. The acting was also atrocious, even from more accomplished actors like Billy Dee Williams and Stacey Keach. Why they got involved in this disaster-piece I will never know.<br /><br />The direction and screenplay are pitiful, full of pointless "filler" such as snowball fights and some half-assed attempt at a love story. I suppose, as far as the main stories go, the director was trying to make a film that required thought to fully immerse yourself in the world he created, unfortunately he failed. There is nothing, in my opinion, that redeems this film. To me this ranks alongside disasterous films like 'Killjoy' and 'Camp Blood'.<br /><br />I'd avoid this movie, it's not worth the 90 mins of your life. I actually switched it off at one point, but realising there were only 15 minutes left I thought I may as well watch the rest, I'd got that far after all. If you do watch it, expect nothing.<br /><br />2/10
