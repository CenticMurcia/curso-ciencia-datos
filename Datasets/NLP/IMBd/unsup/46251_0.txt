I approached this film with an open mind and was looking forward to it. As the film progressed and passed the one-hour mark, I honestly have to say that this is one of the most boring, uninteresting and slow moving films I've ever seen. For the last 20 minutes I was just praying for it to end.<br /><br />Tom Selleck is bland and completely uninteresting, and his character speaks entirely in "clever quips", ALL the time, which really grinds after a while. Although Selleck is bad, he still delivers the best performance in this film, because the other actors are so incredibly bad -- perhaps with the exception of Nigel Bennet who plays Harrison Pendelton who's good, but unfortunately only on screen for about a minute throughout the whole film.<br /><br />The story is not exactly predictable, but written to a safe recipe of "crime mysteries" which stirs up no real interest - in me, anyway. Overall I found this an exceptionally drab experience and I wish I had spent the hour and a half doing something else.
