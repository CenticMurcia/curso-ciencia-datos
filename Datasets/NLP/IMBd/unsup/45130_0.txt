1st watched 1/9/2009 (Dir-Peter Gerretsen): OK media-like account of the Christian belief of Apocalypse and what that will be like, supposedly. The movie centers around a couple who head a news anchor team for "World Wide News" and the movie uses this format to display the events. The cameras used for the movie make the movie look like a soap opera and this isn't very appealing. Also, the acting and production values are so-so, but I guess I shouldn't expect much from an evangelist(since it was produced by one). But anyway, Leigh Lewis does a good job in her role of the women anchorperson who sees the light after losing her grandmother with the believers going back to heaven during the worldwide disappearance of souls that happens right before nuclear bombs are supposed to explode in all areas of the world. Then a foreign leader calls himself the new messiah and stops the bombs. He, of course, is really the anti-Christ but at first brings peace to the world. All of this is probably foreign to those who haven't read the Bible, but this movie is just one man's interpretation of what he's read and the movie is definitely trying to sell his point of view as him and his wife are also in the movie. This all makes for a kind of cheesy movie that doesn't accomplish much because of it's obvious intended purpose  to save all us poor lost souls. Well, I think the reverend should go back to what he apparently does best and it's not making movies.
