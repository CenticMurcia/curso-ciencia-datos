Nearly every review of a movie contains a so called spoiler, because otherwise it will be very hard to write about a movie beside the fact you have seen a movie. But anyway: this movie spoils itself in the very first minutes and show a hunter killing a deer, oops, a naked woman. Exactly this is the message of the movie: hunting humans like animals. Nasty premise. After this we follow a really nice girl on her way to become a prostitute to become at least the victim of the deranged hunter from the beginning. What will sound like a terrible exploitation movie is in fact a very clever handled mixture of drama and thriller, sometimes creepy, sometimes entertaining in the way of a self-parody. To make a personal commentary: the only reason for me as a film critic person since 30 years to write here for no money is the fact I want to push movies I like. End of Spoilers - have an entertaining and haunting evening with this not "important", but (in all departments from acting, writing to directing) very well executed chiller.
