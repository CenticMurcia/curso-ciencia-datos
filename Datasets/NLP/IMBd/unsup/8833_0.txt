Finally a replacement for sex and the city!!!!!!! ever since that show finished there's been a much need of something that measures even halfway. The shows these days are either too melodramatic,have too many characters without much depth or are a terrible attempt at comedy. Lipstick jungle is funny, casual, scandalous and non complicated. what i love about this show is that aside from its theme of power and relationships, there is depth to all the characters. The script is engaging and even if you can't relate to the characters, you can feel for them. I would highly recommend this show to everyone. Great acting, script and direction.bravo to the team!!!
