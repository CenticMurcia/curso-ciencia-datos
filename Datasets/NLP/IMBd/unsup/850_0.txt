Life holds much promise as Victoria (Ginger Rogers) stands beautifully gowned in her wedding dress next to her chosen mate for the big moment of saying "I do." But to her dismay the words just never do come out and she runs off down the aisle leaving mayhem behind her. This disaster occurs three times, a year apart, in the end leaving her and everyone else exasperated.<br /><br />Enter prospective groom No. 4 named Oliver and she's determined to see it through this time no matter what. However, Fate steps in with a most peculiar fantasy figure (of her imagination it seems) she names George (Cornel Wilde), who creates compromising situations in her life yet gradually points the way out for her bewilderment.<br /><br />When she recalls an old sweetheart from childhood days, Johnny, who is now a fireman (also played by Cornel Wilde), she realizes he's the one for her but there are many tangled threads to set aright.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie is amusing but picks up momentum as it progresses and becomes downright hilarious. I found it very funny where Victoria bursts out in confusion, "But I'm going to marry Oliver," (or words to that effect) as if trying to convince herself. It reminds me of that saying, "The heart has reasons that reason does not understand."<br /><br />It's an enjoyable movie with a surprising twist to the ending. I too wish the video was available; was lucky to see it on tv.
