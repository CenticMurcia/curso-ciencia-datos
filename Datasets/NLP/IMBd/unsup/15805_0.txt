Chuck Jones's "No Barking" has two factors that make it very unique: aside from being Jones's only cartoon that features Tweety (albeit in a bit part), all the animation was done by one person. Usually, they would have different people animate different scenes, but Ken Harris did it all here.<br /><br />Anyway, the cartoon opens with the sun rising over what looks like an idyllic pastoral setting...and it turns out to be the city dump. From there, laconic Claude the Cat and not-so-laconic Frisky Puppy - who resembles Charlie Dog very closely - come up with every possible way to battle over turf. Specifically, FP's yapping makes Claude jump, and just when he looks safe, there's more in store. It's a little bit like the Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote cartoons in that respect, but I think that it's safe to say that nothing will ever top the latter for these kinds of plot lines.<br /><br />So, I guess that this was mostly a placeholder (I've seen Claude in many cartoons with wise-guy mice Hubie and Bertie, but I've only seen Frisky Puppy in one other cartoon). Mostly, it's a hoot to see what happens to Claude here. Not Jones's best, but OK.
