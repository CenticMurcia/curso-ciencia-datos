Laura Gemser sits out this time, but Rosemarie Lindt is here and ready, willing and able to disrobe at any given opportunity. She's Emanuelle, a successful fashion model with one problem...she has just been raped by a vile behemoth (big guy George Eastman). To get revenge, she seduces, drugs and then chains her attacker up in a secret room behind a one-way mirror where he must watch in sexual frustration as she taunts and teases him with a parade of men and women she brings home to play with.<br /><br />Not surprisingly for a D'Amato movie, this is not your standard sex film. Despite lots of flesh baring, it's far from being erotic. There's violence, gore, full frontal nudity, warped dream sequences, rape, hardcore dinner table masturbation scenes (in the uncut version anyway) and much more that you may not expect. Memorable bits include a sick-o nightmare sequence with Lindt being pinned down by four women and raped with a wine bottle and the finale, where someone in the cast ends up a gory mess after being chopped up with a meat cleaver.<br /><br />And no, none of this is as entertaining as it sounds. Low production values, bad dubbing, crummy plotting, bad acting and time padding make it a chore to sit through. On video this was available in both R or Unrated versions (Unrated is the one I saw).<br /><br />View at your own risk!
