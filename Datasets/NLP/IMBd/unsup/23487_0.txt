The acting was terrible. Presumably John Schneider was once talented, but he left it all in the dressing room this round. Sarah Lafleur, another of those attractive Canadian women, isn't too bad, but she plays too bland. Cloris Leachman is, pardon my opinion, too old. Lillian Gish could pull it off at this age, but not Miss Leachman, I'm afraid. Everyone else seems to have escaped from middle school drama class. Maybe it was the directing....<br /><br />The CGI gators are mediocre. I mean, they don't look "real", but they do look mean. And the script. Ah, the script. It seems they run out of stuff to say/do, so they invent another gator. Even their "keeper" thought there were only three.<br /><br />But, the action never stops. The sheriff's son, after a bad false start, turns out to have major cojones. There is never a need to fast forward through the ennui. And, although I don't think they really meant it to be, this flick is really funny. It is a hoot. With a little more panache and pizazz, Schneider could have really hopped it up. Maybe it was the directing...
