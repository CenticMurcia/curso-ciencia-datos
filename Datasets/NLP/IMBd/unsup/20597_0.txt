Its a shame that the previous comments seem to have focused on so much negative and missed the positive of what was always intended to be a very lighthearted comedy in the style of the Carry On films.<br /><br />Sets, budget and production are certainly low priority but the script is classic British humour from the 70's and to me is easily as funny as the best Carry On's .. and some parts still make me laugh out loud despite having viewed the film many times to cheer myself up on a rainy day. The best of which has to be the wonderful Ray Kinnear's encounter with the stripper/love interest in the bushes outside the house.<br /><br />As for the 'self referential marxist theme'comment (??!) I can only say lighten up! This is a silly piece of comedy, not a Chekov play. In a world where CGI is beginning to replace any semblance of a script, its refreshing to see something so simple and intended purely for entertainment.
