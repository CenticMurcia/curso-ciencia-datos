One got the feeling throughout there was nothing here but people going through the motions to collect a paycheck. There are some talented people working here (John Woo, John Travolta, Christian Slater, Samantha Mathis) and they're all decent, but they are merely working in service of a standard story, and don't do anything to elevate it above standard. It says something that the only one who makes an impression is Frank Whaley, who's not on screen that long. But it must be said that without this film doing so well, Woo wouldn't have been able to make FACE/OFF, so that's in its favor.
