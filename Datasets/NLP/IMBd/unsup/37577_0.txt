considering the talent that was on hand, (John Dye, Morgan Fairchild, Miles O'Keefe, Kim DeLaney, etc ) the director Ron Casden, kinda sorta fell into a comedic hole! This was a local Arizona shot film, which is kind of cool seeing some of the old places, businesses, apartments, resorts restaurants, bars etc, but this story is kind funny but the main character John Dye is a nice, annoying guy. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like John no doubt, so it's got to be Casden that missed the marks here. Steve Lyons was pretty much a loss as a bad actor on top. Considering that he was a major supporting role in Campus Man. I remember the posters from the theater from 1987, and it cracks me up. Everything about this ' flick' seemed to just kind of go ah-rye. The acting was gone right after the directing and then the story, etc. I laugh, because I own the DVD and I don't intend to sell this one anytime soon. The funniest part of this movie is, that I would rather watch this, over Brosnan in "Die Another Day" (2002). Probably because it's Arizona, back in the great eighties!<br /><br />I recommend this for college type, sitting around on laundry day type comedy , I rated it a 2, because of the classic old scenery. It's still fun to pass the time with though. In small edition there was a couple great song tracks in the movie by the Robert Cray band, that set off a cool and rude mood, although there was a lack of good scoring through out the whole story.
