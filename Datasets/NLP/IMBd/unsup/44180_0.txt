There isn't anything here that you haven't seen in some other action movie before. I like Lou Gossett Jr., but he must willingly continue to appear in these Iron Eagle films for a paycheck because god knows they certainly aren't good movies. At least, not in my book.<br /><br />Anyhow this Iron Eagle sequel finds Gossett putting together a bunch of no-name Canadian actors, some who play Americans and some who play Russians who when they splice in the 'we can't get along together because of nationality' clich√© story element, you have this movie in a nutshell. A movie that I find myself surprised to say I've seen twice on late night during bouts of boredom. Do yourself a favor, don't see this even once.
