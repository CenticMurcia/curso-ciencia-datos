Would not recommend letting children watch a movie that, despite it's unbelievable Harlequin plot line, still could implicitly condone maladaptive behavior. Note the lead character has not only actively stolen from others over a long period of time (how many other children's' Christmases were ruined by this character's thievery?), but used an orphan to assist her. The rewards? A lovely apartment, gorgeous clothes, a cozy family Christmas and a blossoming romance. I didn't see any consequences that would lead one to think that this character was apt to change or make any retribution to her victims. All I saw was a selfish user portrayed as a "cool" smooth talking role model. She is so self-righteous that she will not relent to forgiving her male accomplice for crimes identical to hers! Besides stealing, gender prejudice, coercion of minors and a gross manipulation of justice, I can't see how this Christmas story could inspire any better moral qualities. Sorry, not my idea of a heart warming story.
