Bride Wars is a movie, that has thankfully been erased from my memory, for the most part. How are we supposed to care for the two leads in Anne or Katie, when they act like spoiled little brats, to see who can get there wedding jammed in 1st?. Katie's character is so self centered, that it completely ruined a lot of the movie, and it disgusted me when Anne started stooping to her level. I didn't find this payback revenge funny, in fact I found it overly cruel. Romantic Comedies are supposed to be light hearted, with a sense of seriousness to it, but this goes far beyond mean spirited, I ended up hating both of them, when all was said and done!. The male love interests I didn't care for either.<br /><br />Performances. Kate Hudson is an actress I like a lot of the time, but here she is too unlikable, for her own good. Her chemistry with Hathaway was OK, but nothing overly memorable. Anne Hathaway is her usual charming self, but becomes increasingly dis likable, once she starts stooping to Kate's level. Candice Bergen adds some classy support, but that's about it. Kristen Johnson's character I did not find amusing. Her whiny, it's all about me performance, often grated my nerves, I know that was the point, but still.<br /><br />Bottom line. Bride Wars often tortured me, and I was glad when it was all said and done. This is not the way to make a Romantic Comedy. Some people might find this funny, but it's not for me. I'll most likely get a non useful for this review, but I don't care.<br /><br />4/10
