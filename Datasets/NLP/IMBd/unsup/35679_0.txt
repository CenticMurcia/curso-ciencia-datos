This is a terrible film. It is not funny at all and is both boring and irritating. It is supposed to be a frothy romantic comedy, but it has about as much froth as a glass of beer that has been standing in a cupboard for two weeks. Carole Lombard was unable to save it on her own, despite her talents, and she flails around like a lost parakeet who cannot find her perch. The appalling leading man, Preston Foster, is simply offensive and revolting. If you are looking for a complete failure in this genre, this is it. A basic premise of this film is that it is OK for a pompous man to persecute a girl and try to force his attentions on her to satisfy his lusts and his male vanity. This is supposed to be amusing. The man's self regard is nauseating, and the very concept of this film is utterly loathsome.
