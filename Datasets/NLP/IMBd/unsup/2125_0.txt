Unbelievable. I have never had an animated movie take me on a breathtaking ride like that before. I didn't even realize I was watching a "cartoon". This is a movie for all ages. The Moses/Ramses relationship was unique and made you wonder what their relationship might have really been. The animation was absolutely fantastic. I was deeply moved in about 3 or 4 scenes. That never has happened to me before. When Moses split the Red Sea I just sat in awe. I can't say enough great things about this movie. I was not expecting it to be that good. It deserves a 10 without a doubt.
