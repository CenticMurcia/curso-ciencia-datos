this is just another movie about the evil Colombian guerrillas and the brave American heroes. bloody as it can be the movie only portraits the "bad" part of a beautiful country. I don't think it is well done as a movie or that it shows in anyway the reality of a country like Colombia which, constantly improves and shows to be winning the fight against terrorism and drug dealers. I also find it extremely utopic and epic, yet it is your choice to watch it or not. The whole movie revolves around friendship, but it shows a lot more than that. Just know that Hollywood is not showing the reality of those third world countries and that those kind of movies offend many people around the world.
