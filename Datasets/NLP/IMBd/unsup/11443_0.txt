I don't usually write reviews but this film is an exception. No storyline, no character development, no facts, and virtually no sound: This film is purged of everything, leaving only a simplicity which is as beautiful as it is tedious. This film is an empty canvas and allows the viewer to fill in the details and meanings. If the viewer doesn't do that, he's just staring at the blank canvas; if he does, he may discover something very profound.<br /><br />It took me three sittings to finish this film. If you are planning on watching it, clear your mind of any preoccupations and focus on the movie. The experience will probably be well worth the three hours.
