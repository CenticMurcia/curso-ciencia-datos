I played Little League way back when, and this movie is pretty true to my experience. The parents are all into it, and their competitiveness rubs off on the kids. <br /><br />If a kid isn't good, he gets beat up by other kids. <br /><br />Hey, this is what makes America great, right? It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, and hitting that home run is basically no different than selling that house, getting that raise, or getting into that country club.<br /><br />Those considerations aside, baseball is a wonderful sport (much better, in my opinion, than football and basketball.) It has a grace and honor all of its own. And the lessons you learn playing as a team are what really count.<br /><br />A highlight of this movie is the team manager's insistence on risking the championship by letting the "bad" kids play.<br /><br />Another highlight is a kid deliberately letting the opposing team get a home run after his father/coach loses it and hits him on the field.<br /><br />The juvenile delinquent kid trying to pick up the ballerina was a classic scene.<br /><br />One of the charms of this movie is that the kids -- many of whom look so innocent and angelic -- are foul mouthed, talking back to the adults and making racist and sexist comments.<br /><br />Why is this not offensive? Why is it refreshing? <br /><br />Because we live in a politically correct (read: dumbed down and hateful) age in which the ultimate sin is to offend anyone -- even those who have it coming. But only because of that.<br /><br />Walter Matthau is perfect as the alcoholic coach who finally cleans up his act a little bit and gets back in the spirit of winning.<br /><br />The classical music that goes along with movie is wonderful, even though that might seem to be an odd choice of music for a movie like this.<br /><br />There is really no way to convey the delight of this movie through words. You just have to see it. <br /><br />Would I show it to my kids? Mmm. Don't know about that. But it sure is fun viewing for adults!
