I was drawn into this unusual independent film on cable. I call it unusual because how often are men really truthful about their actions and desires? I felt the man who made this wanted to be understood.<br /><br />If you like it, make sure to catch the follow-up film called "Manhood". I felt so lucky to stumble across it. The actors who play Jack, Faith, and their son are in this one too. How lucky is that! Jack's relationship with his son is touching, and rings very true.<br /><br />I hope there will be a third installment here, making this a trilogy. Can Jack overcome his inner dog? I believe men are really like this, and am so impressed with the honesty here.<br /><br />Just a note on the music, there is Bruce Springsteen music in both films. I don't think "The Boss" allowed his songs to be used here because he needed the money. Check it out!
