Disney entered the direct-to-video arena for the very first time in 1994 with "The Return of Jafar," the sequel to the 1992 theatrical animated release "Aladdin." In it, we thought in our last movie that Jafar would be gone forever!!!!! But NOOOO, Jafar has returned once again, and he wanted revenge!!!!!<br /><br />This time, Jafar became an evil genie. This was an awesome film, and I especially liked the ending scene where, as the lamp melted, the Jafar Genie was all flashing like static and stuff!!!!! Now THAT was awesome!!!!!<br /><br />And so, after that, all went back to normal. I liked this movie; it was fun and exciting, and don't forget: that short, fat bad guy was caught in the tree, wondering why he didn't get his third wish!!!!! LOL<br /><br />If you liked "Aladdin," then you'll LOVE "The Return of Jafar!!!!!"<br /><br />10 stars
