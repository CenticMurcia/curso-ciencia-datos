Robot Chicken is one of, if not the funniest show on television right now, and yet most people I know have never even heard of it. The show mocks everyone and everything. I think that because of it's relative obscurity on adult swim it's overshadowed by Family Guy and South Park(both of which I also love). Some of the skits are absolutely hysterical, especially the where are they now with Michael Moore and the Unsolved Murder Cases. Maybe these are funny to me because they use characters from my childhood that have all but been forgotten. Aside from the comedy aspect of the show which is actually the only aspect of it, is the staggering list of guest stars this show has. It is on par with the tonight show for the number and the status of the guest stars they produce. In summation do not overlook this show, especially if you can remember TV from the mid-80's to early 90's.
