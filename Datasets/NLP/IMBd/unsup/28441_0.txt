Blood Bill, for what it is, is not a bad little flick. There is lots of gore and the zombie effects are VERY good. The only thing not in this movie is nudity, so there are points knocked off for that.<br /><br />The movie really should have been titled, "Death Valley: The Revenge of Earl" since I think he steals the show with his cocaine-as-supercharger routine.<br /><br />I was actually surprised to learn that Bloody Bill Anderson is a historical figure. From the stuff I've read about him on the internet, raising a posse of zombies to chow down on a bunch of college kids seems almost tame.<br /><br />From the sounds of things on the commentary track, no one took this movie too seriously. You'll find it's much more entertaining if you don't either.<br /><br />Four out of five stars.
