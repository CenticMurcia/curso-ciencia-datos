This movie was all over the place. Frogs, ears, ski masks & bad teeth, kidnapping, plastic surgery, etc. It was hard not to ask "hey, what happened to the frogs?" a few times during the movie. The subject matter is very interesting, but to me the director tried to look at different aspects of the film, and then bring everything together at the end. For me, it didn't work. The connection linking Magrinho and Jader Barbalho appeared thin. There was no "a ha!" moment that I think the director was gunning for. I also did not like at all how the plastic surgeon was portrayed. It appears that he has done some revolutionary work in the field and has greatly helped some people recover from brutal crimes. To show him enjoying himself at his fazenda with his dog frolicking in the pool implies that he is taking advantage of the system and crushing the little guy for his own benefit. This man works hard. The evil is Jader Barbalho, not the doctor. Overall, this movie could have been split in two, one covering the kidnappings of SÃ£o Paulo, the other the corruption of Jader. Combining them was a mistake.
