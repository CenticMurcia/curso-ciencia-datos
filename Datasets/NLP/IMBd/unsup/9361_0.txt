This is one of the few remakes that actually surpasses the original. Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, a scientist who created two teleportation pods (or telepods) in his apartment. He then meets a journalist whom he shows his experiment to in action. They end up falling in love and he goes through the teleportation successfully--sort of. Unbeknownst to him, a common house fly got into the machine with him, causing their DNA to get spliced together. He then begins the slow transformation into what he calls 'Brundlefly'. His body parts (ears, fingernails, teeth) begin to fall off as he mutates into a fly creature. David Cronenberg directed this awesome remake with some great, memorable makeup effects. Definitely one of the best remakes ever made.
