This movie is funny, exciting, and very close to home. I loved how this movie exposed the lifelike times many years ago. I would certainly recommend this movie because of the wonderful acting which creates characters which are virtually indistinguishable from real people I know. Yet, at the same time, this movie makes me laugh at how foolish we are. Great film. Go see it.
