A film about a young ex-cop and now drug abuser and dealer, Paris Pritchert (Peter Facinelli), washed up just shy of 30, working for his dead father's partner, a hardened, corrupt cop. His fixation about finding a kidnapped boy becomes a reality through happenstance of an unexpected "vacation." Along with Maya Gibbs (Raina-Simone Moore), a prostitute just getting into the game, the story degenerates into a slow pursuit filled with a combination of violence, pornography, and depravity that ends with the inevitable conclusion of the path of self-destruction that is Paris's life.<br /><br />Full of affectation and the embodiment of conceit, not surprising of a first film, especially considering that Gunnerson was the writer, director, editor, and composer. The last is the most amusing, and perhaps intended, as the soundtrack could pass for that of a 1980's porno. It is questionable that this film would even have been released without the success of Peter Facinelli's subsequent effort in Twilight.<br /><br />There seems to be gratuitous camera and visual effect (Gunnerson is co-credited on this). Although I liked the stills in fast rewind at the start of the film, the other odd interjections seem to add nothing to the feel of the film. Most of this film is in black and white and yet it is interspersed with bits of color and sometimes, briefly, in full color and the meaning of the color is unclear.<br /><br />All that said, this film isn't all that bad and Peter Facinelli acted well, but the film in total is more average than good or bad.
