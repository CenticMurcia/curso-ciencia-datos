The title of this comment is how I describe Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Why? It proves that low-brow humor isn't dead, and you don't have to be ashamed of laughing at it. Like "Home Alone," four years earlier it was slammed by the critics,and admired by the fans. Unlike "Home Alone," none of the critics ever changed their minds. When I first saw it, I thought it may have had a few good laughs, but instead, the laughs never stopped. The scene where Ace catches a bullet in his teeth was a bit overblown, but then so was the rest of the movie, and it worked, so I'm not complaining. On the other hand, the sequel wasn't so hot, and the Saturday Morning Cartoon Spin-Off based on this comedy classic suffers from the same problems as most Saturday Morning Cartoons based on successful movies...endless repetition of notable catch-phrases.<br /><br /> Every so often, Citadel Press publishes a series of books compiling notable films of each decade. If the publish a "Films of the Nineties" book, they would be foolish to exclude "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective."
