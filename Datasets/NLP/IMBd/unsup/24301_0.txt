I don't see how anyone not under the age of 10 could find this funny. Some examples of the "humor" in this show are Mr. Rogers being mean and a doll that looks like Napolean Dynamite quoting the movie Napolean Dynamite. Hilarious! I would have enjoyed this when I was in 3rd grade, but I also thought the parody of the Barney theme song was clever and funny (I hate you, you hate me, so lets go out and kill Barney...) Why do you think references to other TV shows and movies are so funny? Does it make you feel special to think you are in on the inside joke? "Wow, it's just like in that movie, only dolls are doing it instead! How clever!"
