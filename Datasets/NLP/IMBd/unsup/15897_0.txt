One of the two best documentaries I have ever seen......Little Dieter Needs to Fly is the other. This has to be the most dysfunctional family ever caught on film. Makes the Osbournes look like pikers! But don't mistake that comment to compare the two. Different worlds completely. Crumb gives you a psycho-view into the twisted minds of a family fruitcake. Truth murders fiction again! 9/10. See it.
