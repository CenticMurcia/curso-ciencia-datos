Screwed is a hilarious comedy about a chauffeur named Willard who has been working for the same rich woman, Miss. Virgina Crock, for over 15 years. When he over hears a conversation about her firing him, he and his best Rusty friend decide to kidnap Crocks lovable dog for ransom. Things go awry and Crock thinks that Willard is the one who is kidnapped. As Rusty and Willard find out, they decide to up the ransom and try to make Crock pay for her bad deeds while the two friends are being pursued by the police, having to pay a crazy mortician Grover to help them in the plan, and make fake notes and videos with the kidnapper saying he'll kill Willard if he doesn't get his five million! Now this film is great! Norm is perfect as Willard and Chapelle always cracks me up with Rusty's one liners. Great jokes from the whole cast Examples: "Well he seemed a lot more ferocious when he was alive." "Feroucious, he's an old midget!", "Sweet Jesus, we kidnapped a turd.", Rusty always hits a man with a desk lamp when he is scared, Aunt Mable, Grover the mortician, "A pair of cracker jack cuff links and one crappy pie!", etc. Examples over. Now do yourself a favor and go out to get a copy of Screwed. Screwed gets the big 8, not perfect but it is a hilarious romp. You'll love it, I did. Enjoy!
