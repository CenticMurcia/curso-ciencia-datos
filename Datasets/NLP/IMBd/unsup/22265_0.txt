It's immensely gratifying to see someone besides me remembers these two shows (including the companion "Hot Wheels")...no one I have ever spoken to does. I particularly liked Skyhawks because most of my immediate family are/were licensed pilots (Dad, Mom, me), and it was near unbelievable to see a kids' show devoted to our passion. 35 years later, the signature songs still rings clearly in my mind. If only cartoon Channel re-ran the REAL old classics...<br /><br />And while we're at it, I'll throw in a comment about "Hot Wheels." Several have commented on that show's page that the makers of the toy saw a marketing opportunity in Saturday morning television. I may well be wrong in this, but I thought the show came before the toys. I certainly don't recall any companion set of toys coming out for "Skyhawks," and according to IMDb, that show stayed on the air longer.
