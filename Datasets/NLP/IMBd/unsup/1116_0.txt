All We Are Saying to me was something I think everyone should see at least once. It had all the great musicians, that had an impact on the music industry, expressing their opinions on how the music has changed. The opinions all seem to stay the same, in thinking that music has lost its flare.. but seeing all those big names from back in the 60's, 70's and 80's to now, makes it all worth it. Not to mention, the in-depth conversations and the words of wisdom. David Crosby said a line, "Britney Spears is being considered for a record over Joni Mitchell, and Britney Spears is about as deep as a bird bath" and to me, is true. If you love, classic rock and new soul music, such as I do, this documentary will inspire you. Talk about better to burn out than fade away, this old timers are going out like a bad-ass firecracker.
