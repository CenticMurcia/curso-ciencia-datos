Superb boxing film--the only one to come close is "Raging Bull". John Garfield (in an excellent performance) plays a poor young man who quickly becomes a world class champ only to find corruption at the top. Film is well-directed by Robert Rossen and contains exquisite cinematography by James Wong Howe. All the acting is good except for Lilli Palmer. She tries, but she seems totally lost in her role. It moves quickly, is never boring and has some very brutal (for 1947) fight scenes. Only main complaint I have is about the ending--MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD. He's supposed to throw a fight, but at the end doesn't and gets out of boxing alive. In real life he probably would have been gunned down. But there was a Production Code to follow in 1947, so it had to have happy ending. Aside from that, it's a great film all around. Don't miss this one!
