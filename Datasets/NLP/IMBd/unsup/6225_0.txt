Like many people I know, I look forward to the weekend as a chance to unwind and escape, especially when there's a new movie to rent - and sometimes, the latest zombie flick or murder mystery just won't do. When you're in the mood for something that will warm your heart, make you laugh, appeal to emotions that we all share, and generally restore your faith in humankind, "Calendar Girls" is just the ticket.<br /><br />"Calendar Girls" is the story of two best friends, Annie and Chris (both expertly cast), who set out to raise money for the local hospital after Annie's husband is stricken with terminal cancer. The snappy and idealistic Chris comes up with the idea of creating a tasteful "nudie" calendar using the middle-aged, seemingly prude members of their local womens' group as models. What happens next is beyond Annie's wildest imagination; their goal to raise money for charity is smashingly successful, and the calendar girls become overnight celebrities in their modest little community.<br /><br />Without the right casting and screenwriting this story could have ended there, in an overly simplistic and predictable manner. However, "Calendar Girls" goes so much further, forcing the girls' attention back to the joys and hardships of their personal lives, as well as facing the tough questions and realities about their original goal and what they have done to accomplish it. It plays on the common emotions that we all have experienced: fear, grief, loss, idealism, success, arrogance, failure and ultimately reflection. You can read the alternating pain and elatement on the faces of every character, and you can't help but feel for them.<br /><br />Critics of this movie have focused mainly on its similarity to "The Full Monty"; however, unless you watch "Calendar Girls" with this idea firmly planted in your mind, you will probably not be bothered by any similarities between the two films. "The Full Monty" was an excellent movie in its own right, but while "Calendar Girls" captures the same humor and realness, it adds a little something more: heart.<br /><br />Life is painful and hard, a fact that "Calendar Girls" addresses with grace and tact. Sometimes it's nice to relax with a beautiful movie that will make you feel good. I could not recommend this movie more highly.
