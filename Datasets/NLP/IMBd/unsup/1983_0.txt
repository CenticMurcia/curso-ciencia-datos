I was rather disappointed with this film, after the high voter rating. My guess is that most of the high votes came from gay viewers, who were happy to see gay love featured so prominently in a mostly unremarkable film. <br /><br />Sure there were some memorable moments. That's why it didn't totally stink. But the film otherwise dragged. If the love had been between a man and a woman, you could say this movie has already been made a thousand times (philandering man with slightly psychotic woman....). <br /><br />The action and intrigue are minimal. If you want to see a gay love story (and sure, good acting) you might enjoy this movie. But don't be fooled into thinking its a thriller or an action movie as I was.
