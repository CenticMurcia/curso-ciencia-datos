At the beginning I would like to say, that I'm a big fun of Seagal and his movies.<br /><br />But not this one. I'm sorry but Seagal is too fat in this movie ! Too fat for an action star. In that shape he can't play super secret agent, but only a Santa Claus. Anyway the worst thing in this movie are fight scenes.Seagal is doubled in fight scenes by another actor. It is very sad for me ,because I practice martial arts and I admire Seagal's Aikido abilities . I think that he is cheating his fans doing something like this. Blacdawn is very boring, small budget B-movie .What else? Bad acting and horrible story. And the finale of this film with helicopter and a bomb....<br /><br />NO COMMENT !!
