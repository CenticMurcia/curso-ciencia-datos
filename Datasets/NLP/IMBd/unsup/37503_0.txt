In the tradition of Ed Wood, this film is so bad that the audience continually cracked up at various sequences. This was especially true when the love Keitel had for Winslet became apparent and he began chasing her up the hill.<br /><br />The comic relief became even more apparent when Keitel had the vision of the three Indian women singing to him. It was like watching high "camp" that had no intention of remaining that way.<br /><br />Further, Ms. Winslet, one of the most talented actresses of her generation should think twice about continuing to take roles like this. She had the capability and opportunity to be a major force in the movie business. Now, she will just be considered another actor.<br /><br />Lastly, I hope Hollywood realizes the wool that Jane Campion has pulled over it's eyes. There are many people within the community that believed "The Piano" was a case of "The Emporer's New Clothes." Now, I'm sure everyone will realize that this women has no talent. Maybe it will be a long time before she makes another piece of trash like this.
