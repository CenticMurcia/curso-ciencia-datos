I believe this is a major accomplishment by Hollywood. The first widely distributed commercial movie directed and written entirely by 12 year olds.<br /><br />The clich√©s are overwhelming, the editing seems to have been done by a lazy slob - especially apparent during a scene where top army brass watch a helicopter goes down on his monitor screen - who the heck was the stupid jerk holding a camera 50 feet from a battle helicopter in a jungle during combat? <br /><br />Last words: if Americans really do act the way they are portrayed in this movie, it is no wonder that many hate them so much.
