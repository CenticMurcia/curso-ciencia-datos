Being the zombie fanatic I am, I found this worthless double feature (comes with Filthy McNasty) and was EXTREMELY disappointed with its atrocity. The babe on the cover isn't the movie (Strike one!). There was no plot and the funny parts were stale (Stee-rike TWO!). The acting wasn't even middle school level(Yer outta there!). Nevermind that the 80's VHS camcorder it was recorded on is insulting to the DVD medium. Ever heard of DV or SVHS?<br /><br />Aside from the few milliseconds of gore, there was nothing to prevent me from wearing out my thumb on the "Chapter Advance" button. At least throw me some random T&A or stuff blowing up, huh?<br /><br />I don't care how many of you feel the need to praise and protect this putrid sub-public access Chris Seaver production. Do you owe him money or something? This hack perpetually drops names of TALENTED horror folk (Tom Savini, Lucio Fulci) and throws in five million GOOD MOVIE references to swindle the viewer into believing it's good, fresh writing. Sorry pal, ain't buyin' it.<br /><br />Is mentioning Egon Spengler supposed to be funny? Anyone? Anyone? Beuller? Frye?<br /><br />Anyway, there are two things about this "movie" that irritated me:<br /><br />1. There's a guy in blackface doing a stereotypical Bill Cosby impression. Good one, Chris Seaver. Minstrel show humor = real classy. How about having him eat watermelon and fried chicken too? I'm far from uptight but I don't see what's funny about over-the-top-down-again-and-back-for-seconds blatant racism, do you?<br /><br />2. Lloyd Kaufman and Toxie make a cameo. DEAR GOD, WHY??? Are you thereby condoning this waste of video by appearing in it? Sure, Troma isn't known for highbrow entertainment, but Terror Firmer is Anne of Green Gables compared to this. And Terror Firmer had hot chicks - a staple of any horror exploitation flick, no matter how minuscule the budget. I know Lloyd is encouraging young filmmakers, but abysmal dreck like this needs to be condemned. There are PEOPLE WITH TALENT out there who deserve the shot this Chris Seaver loser squandered.<br /><br />Shame on Netflix for peddling it and shame on me for thinking it worthy of my time. Consider yourself warned.
