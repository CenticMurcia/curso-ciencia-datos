This may well be the worst film ever made! There really is nothing more embarrassing than having a central character in a semi-violent film, spilling forth a monologue about violence in cinema and how good it is and then topping it off with bad scripting to have another character actually say: "Mmm, interesting. Go on." No! It isn't interesting at all! It's boring! No thought for character, thematic premise, continuity (we actually have the guy walk into an empty bookstore and pick up his own book with interest - as if he's never read it before! Who is he trying to fool?).<br /><br />Worst of all is that the film has been heavily promoted as 'shocking'. Well, it is shocking, but not in the way they meant. Shockingly BAD is what it is!
