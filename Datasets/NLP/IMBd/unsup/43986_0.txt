You've heard the phrase "so bad it's good!" Well, most of the time it isn't true. It's so bad, it's just bad.<br /><br />But this movie truly IS so bad it's good. The dialog is horrendous and sometimes nonsensical. And they really did try to be clever with it, for instance, there's a scene where the hero is giving a presentation on his robot to some scientists - each scientist's last name, along with the name of the place they work, is the name of a Beach Boy, and the dialog in the scene is full of really labored Beach Boys song references.<br /><br />Once the robot starts following one woman and she calls the police, none of the decisions made by the hero make any sense at all.<br /><br />Truly a prize turkey.
