This is by far one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. After seeing less than 3 episodes, I was addicted. Sadly, I didn't recognize this great show until earlier this week, only to hear it was canceled with only 5 seasons? I heard about this show being on TV years ago, but never got around watching it.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Sci-Fi, but with this show, you really don't have to be. It's the amazing writing and comedy gold that makes this show what it is. AWESOME! Not only are the characters hilarious in each of their own ways, but they never cease to become annoying.<br /><br />Why did Futurama have to have such a short run? Because that's what FOX does. They cancel great underrated shows, (Including the ever so great Arrested Development) and replace it with awful shows such as "The Simple Life." DAMN YOU FOX!
