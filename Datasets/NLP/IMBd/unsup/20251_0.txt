Alright first off if you have seen and liked any of the movie trilogy these games are a must. This is the third game that THQ came out with and it is pretty sweet. The game retails for about $19.95 and has playing capability on X-box, PS2 etc. You Got That!? The game, although rather short, is still butt loads of fun to play. It has all the deadite killing, chainsaw swinging action of the movies but you control Ash. As usual Ash has great one liners, and so does his half deadite half human sidekick Sam. Although the aray of weapons is not as great as the previous titles, there is more along the lines of combos with the chainsaws and boomstick. The graphics are pretty sweet, and the game play is great. It's fun to see how many ways you can just sever limbs off of the deadites. Also the story that goes along with it isn't bad. And the short clips are pretty funny. Shop Smart. Shop S-Mart.
