I remember when television was wallpapered with such wonderful game shows such as 'Big Break', 'Bullseye', 'The Generation Game', 'Family Fortunes' and 'Supermarket Sweep'. Everything seemed to be going along beautifully, then came 'The Weakest Link'.<br /><br />'Link' is hosted by 'Watchdog' presenter Anne Robinson, a woman who makes T.V critic Nina Myskow seem polite. The contestants are no better though! I remember one occasion where a man who got all his questions answered correctly was declared the weakest link, purely for the fact that none of the other contestants liked him! I personally don't see the entertainment value in a show where members of the public are being tested on their general knowledge by a woman who is so sharp-tongued that its a wonder her mouth hasn't been cut to shreds. The main prize is practically sweeties.<br /><br />IMDb user 'AdamFontaine' says he has a big chip on his shoulder when it comes to Anne. Well, let me tell you that when it comes to Anne, I have got a whole fish supper on my shoulder!
