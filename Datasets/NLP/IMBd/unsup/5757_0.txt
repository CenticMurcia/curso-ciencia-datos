I loved City of God it was a classic and when i first heard this was coming out i was overjoyed. but when i finally saw it i felt it needed more spice to it if you know what i mean. the gang violence was too quick for me i wanted to see more violence i guess you can say and the end with the 2 friends just walking away and leaving town. i guess i wanted a bit more of a dramatic ending than that but all in all a good film. I enjoyed the characters, and the cinematography was awesome. the storyline is very well done as well i guess if there was just a bit more violence or at least just to prolong their quick violent scenes i would have enjoyed it a hell of a lot more. all in all a 7.9 out of 10 if you enjoyed city of god or if you like gang films and you don't mind subtitles this is the movie for you.
