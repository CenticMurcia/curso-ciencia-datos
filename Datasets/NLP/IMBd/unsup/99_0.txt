The movie was incredible, ever since I saw it in 1977 I told my wife she had to see it, it was really funny. Right up there with the "In-Laws." As soon as it came out on video we would watch it. Well, 20 years later, and every time I ask in a video store they give me a funny look. Does anyone have any clue how this classic can be viewed??? "PLEASE HELP"
