Imagine watching a movie parodying the "hood" made by people who have never been to, met anyone from, or had any contact with the hood. That is this movie. I'm not just talking about Jamie Kennedy's character, who is supposed to be fake, I'm talking about the whole d**n thing. It was difficult to distinguish the actors who were supposed to be actors and the actors who were supposed to be "real gangstas", because all of the acting in this movie sucks. The first time I watched this movie I thought it was hilarious but the second time it just really rubbed me the wrong way... I don't know, maybe this just isn't my type of humor. The only reason I gave this three stars was because of the fight scenes, especially the Scarface-looking one where he was on the car screaming "AHHHHHAHAHAHAHA" like a nut... the one with all the gang members in the house facing that crew of Malibu people holding a f*****g whale harpoon and a rocket launcher was the only funny part of the movie IMO.
