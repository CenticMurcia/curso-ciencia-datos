Someone else in here mentioned how naive the movie is about the North-South Korea relations.... Forget that. How about "How naive the whole movie is" ??? The idea the whole movie is based on is cute, and thats the only reason I wanted to watch it anyway, but besides that, it doesn't deliver at any point. Predictable story, childish lines, uninspired digital effects, boring characters, ridiculous foreign actors and so it goes. I see here its director's debut film, so I hope next time, he will find a better way to express himself and spend the production's money.<br /><br />I love Korean Cinema, but this one is a bad movie. Really!
