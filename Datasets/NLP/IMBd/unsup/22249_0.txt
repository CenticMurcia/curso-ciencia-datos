Almost nobody's seen this movie, but it's secretly a great film. Funny all the way through. One of Jason Priestly's early films and he's great as in everything he does. (No not all of his films are good, but he's good in all of them). It's a movie you don't think you'll want to watch and 15 minutes in, you want to watch the whole thing. Enjoyable, very quotable, and about what every man dreams of-meeting Marilyn Monroe.
