The best understanding and best feeling of this movie are hard to quantify. The element that caused me to rate it highly is the sense of the return to an old life, as well as the connection to the ocean and the islands. I've always wanted to renovate my mother's bulldozed home in Kansas, the old stone house that was bulldozed when fire raged through the area and consumed the beams. This is a story of young folks cleaning up the old abandoned spaces and convincing the old folks to come back. That always finds a place in my heart. Further, this story tells of a link between the ocean creatures and humans, and that speaks of goodness as well. This is an extremely satisfying movie if you love family and beautiful, simple older ways of life. The touch of the supernatural heals and suggests that we don't know or predict everything that can happen in the natural world.
