I think this is the first time that I've given an anime anything below a 6. As most others I had thought Ninja Resurrection was a sequel to Ninja Scroll, until ADV's openning showed up. About 70% of the running time is taken by bloody fight/horror scenes. The producers obviously thought that they can get away with a hit by borrowing the title and the character's name of Ninja Scroll while adding heaps of excessively disgusting scenes to the film. What they made was distasteful and the ending leaves me unsatisfied. I consider Ninja Scroll as the best anime film ever, Ninja Resurrection is an insult to that name. What is good about the film? Perhaps one sequence where Jubei was actually relaxing with his friends, a little break before we are punished with another barrage of gore.
