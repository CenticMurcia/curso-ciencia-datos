I rented this film under the title of 'The Nightmare Never Ends'. On the surface this film appears to be pure amateur. The acting is quite horrendous on many occasions. The character of Weiss played Marc Lawrence is a Nazi hunter, who mumbles throughout the picture (that's until he's bumped off). Cameron Mitchell plays a detective who investigates Weiss's death. He starts to follow a rich playboy, played eerily by Richard Bristol. He begins to suspect that Olivier is responsible. Another subplot involves Charles Moll who plays a professor. He writes a book called 'God is Dead', which starts a controversy. Rich playboy, Olivier, approaches him. Bristol is basically the devil's representative on earth. A crazy monk approaches Moll's wife, played by Faith Clift (who could not act if her life depended on it). He warns her that her husband is being seduced by satan. People start dying left and right as they attempt to stop Olivier and his minions. Even though the film suffers from poor dubbing, synching (it feels like you're watching an old Hong Kong Kung Fu flick), the film has a sense of dread from beginning to end that grabbed me. It doesn't have a happy ending. And that's the way I like it.
