*I Still Know What You Did Last Summer... I read The SPOILERS* <br /><br />Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt, who is as one-expressioned and scenery-chewer in this as she is in 'Ghost Whisperer') has changed college from the first movie, and is still obsessed with The Fisherman (Muse Watson, who has been given way better material in 'Prison Break' and 'NCIS'), who pays her a visit in the Campus' Disco (hey, Fishermen just wanna have fun!). In the meanwhile her Match-Made-In-Heaven Ray (Freddy Prinze Jr., whose status as the best actor of the bunch says much about the other thespians involved) is not going to be with her for whatever reason, and her friend Karla (Brandi Norwood, who is as insipid an actress as she is a singer) wins a trip to Bahamas for four people by answering a question which asked her which was the capital of Brazil (Brazilia) WRONG, and she does not see anything wrong with that, nor does she understand she gave the wrong answer.<br /><br />Karla brings her boyfriend (Mekhi Phifer, who plays basically the same character he will play on 'ER' a few years later, and just as annoyingly), and Julie brings friend Will Benson (Benson - Ben's Son, geddit?) (Matthew Settle, who really did his best in a thankless role), since Ray is unaccounted.<br /><br />But when they get on the island, it's rain season, and as the killer murders... people we don't give a darn about (which could very well mean any character), including a scary rastafarian Mary Jane smoker (Jack Black?), our core four begin to find out they should have paid attention in First Grade Geography Class, and begin to act stupid (if they ever stopped), which leads to the most stupid scary movie I ever had the displeasure to watch, and to a good thing; Mekhi Phifer's and Jennifer Esposito's characters' death.<br /><br />Then the killer gets Julie, and she has the most unbelievable fight ever - Miss Fraily Girl managing to overpower two strong men? Big no no...<br /><br />By the way, why take the characters out to Bahamas to kill them? Why not murdering them on the spot? And why did The Fisherman not kill Ray? One more question: why did Mandalay greenly this script? It has been written by someone who didn't know anything about writing stories, much less screenplays.<br /><br />In short, this movie deserves completely the title it has been given in Italy: 'Incubo Finale' ('Final Nightmare'), because it IS a nightmare of a movie, and to use a pun, it's not a horror movie, but a horror of a movie.<br /><br />The Fisherman is cool, though. I was rooting for him in this movie.<br /><br />I Still Know What You Did Last Summer: 1/10.
