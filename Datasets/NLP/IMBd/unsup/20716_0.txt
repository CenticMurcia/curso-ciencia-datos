Boy! This was worse than what I expected! I expected a light film with good acting and a happy ending (Rob Reiner NEVER has a depressing ending). What did I get? Well it was light...TOO LIGHT!! So light that I didn't give a damn about the characters or their situations! These people do not talk or act like real people at all (Pfieffer's speech at the end is particularly horrible--give her credit for saying it without gagging!), the kids are WAY too goody-goody, their friends are annoying, and not one person in the theatre laughed for the entire movie (there were a few smirks when Willis broke down--it isn't supposed to be funny). The acting was as good as can be expected with such a lousy script and you know a film is in deep trouble when there are THREE occasions where we have voice overs of something we had just heard 10 minutes ago! It wasn't good the first time around...it's unbearable the second. As for the climax...well, without giving anything away, it comes out of NOWHERE and (as I've said before) Pfeiffer gives a speech that will have you bolting for the exits. Avoid at all costs!!!!!!
