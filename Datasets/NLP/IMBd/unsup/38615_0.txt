OK, I have officially given up on Adult Swim! If the execs over there are idiotic enough to run this, then they obviously hate their viewers. When Tom Goes To The Mayor (the first Tim and Eric project) first aired, I gave it chance. Really I did. I kept thinking, "hey maybe they just need to hit their stride." They never did. The show was so universally hated, that it's gone from the Adult Swim schedule.<br /><br />Then came this show. New show, new premise. Maybe they'll be funny this time. Right? Apparently not! This show is nothing but these two talentless nitwits trying to be funny by not being funny. Memo to Tim and Eric (and to the cast of SNL as well): Not being funny doesn't make you funny! This is a show for teenage boys who think it's cool to like a show that everyone else hates, so that they can go around pretending to be "in" on the "joke" (ever notice how these fans can never point out what exactly makes these two talentless hacks funny? They just ridicule you for not "getting it.") Then they run around and act like there's something wrong with normal people who see this crap for what it is: crap.<br /><br />Lots of fans of this program like to say that us haters can just change the channel. So I've done just that. I'm not watching Adult Swim ever again. It's become nothing more than a shell of its former self. This program (and other similar programs) is the reason that scripted comedy is dying and people are being sucked into the vast reality TV wasteland.
