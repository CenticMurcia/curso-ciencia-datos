I hadn't heard very good things, so I didn't go into it with high expectations, and still it managed to disappoint, big time.<br /><br />Where was the over-dramatic "after-school special" music? <br /><br />Where were Jerri's funky pets? <br /><br />Why did they change Derrick, using an actor that isn't butt-ugly? <br /><br />And why, for the love of God, wasn't it funny? Almost every joke felt forced, and half of them were simply recycled from the show.<br /><br />God...DAMN IT!<br /><br />I would much rather they just bring the show back. Probably not gonna happen, now that Colbert is such a big star that he's coining words that dictionaries take seriously. Come to think of it, whoever first said that "Strangers" would make a good movie was speaking nothing but truthiness.
