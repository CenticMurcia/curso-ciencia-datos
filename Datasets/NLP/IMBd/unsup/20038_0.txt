SPOILERS<br /><br />It really is about time for him to win an Academy Award. I mean, he directed Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and Casino, so it is about time for him to win. Anyway, this is a typical Academy Award show that has some very funny moments. There are some movies and actors that deserved to win an Oscar, but some did not. I also like the scene in which Ellen DeGenerous makes Steven Spielberg take a picture of her with Clint Eastwood. Also, the Departed won Best Picture.<br /><br />This is a typical Academy Award show that is hosted by Ellen DeGenerous. The usual awards are given out. You know, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Animated Film, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Art Direction, Best Score, Best Song, Best Costume, Best Makeup, Best Sound, Best Short, Best Visual Effects, Best Foreign Film, and Best Documentary. Wow, that was a mouth full. There are also the usual Oscar surprises, such as Jack Black and Will Ferrell singing. Like always, also, this goes far beyond of how long it is supposed to be.<br /><br />Overall, this is a regular but fun Academy Awards show. Some of the winners totally deserved it, such as Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest definitely deserved to win Best Visual Effects, and it did, but some did not deserve it. Pan's Labyrinth should have won best Foreign Language Film, and not the Lives of Others. I am also glad that Happy Feet won Best Animated Picture. There is one thing I would like to point out. Will Smith should have won Best Actor. I mean, he definitely deserved to win, but he did not! Anyway, some choices are good, some choices are bad, and this is like every other Academy Awards show, but they are always fun to watch.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Recommended Award Shows: The Emmys.
