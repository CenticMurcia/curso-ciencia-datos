Greatly enjoyed the development of the story line, the music and, not least, the acting. Lekin is very good work by done by experienced professionals. Dimple K. completely inhabited the character of Reva, while Vinod Khanna created an image of benevolent intelligence. The use of the first-class rail compartment, a most impressive Rajput<br /><br />Palace and the stark sandy desert provided an appropriate background, supporting the story without overwhelming the mystery. The music was well integrated with the story line, something of a departure (in my limited experience with Bollywood movies). My wife and I have been baffled trying to identify the instrumental- only musical theme which plays whenever Dimple's character Reva appears.
