i watch whatever gay themed thing comes out and i tend to enjoy even the slated ones. This movie is awful, it goes no where and there was absolutely no point in making it or in anyone of us watching it.<br /><br />Don't bother even watching it to check how awful it was, just save the hours of your life for something else. Try, Beautiful Thing if your English or 'O Fantasma' (The Phantom) if your into something that you want to be left thinking about and you don't mind subs.<br /><br />People have suggested that its funny but it really doesn't come across as that in the English bits or the subtitled bits.<br /><br />I imagine that it was written by a gay dutchman who had experience of these most important things going on in his life. He sadly didn't think about the fact that no one would care cause there not important.
