Actually I'd like to say it's a 2 out of 10 but for how upset I am a 7 about covers it. As soon as I saw the two strangers arrive in town I knew this movie was trouble for me. Then watching them work on the weak - I left the theater twice to talk to the presenter, asking if the story would turn around for the better side of humanity, well returning and watching the whole story - Sorry to spoil the end - I am so deeply sad...<br /><br />This is a powerful movie what shows the wicked prey on the weak, a community leaderless and indifferent to protect itself, and a family torn apart.<br /><br />Not entertainment for me, just a story of the wicked wining another battle - hopefully not the war.
