The film is so unoriginal. And the plot has been killed long ago, the endings is anticipated from the beginning. The film shows crappy performance on almost all scales. The marine himself Â– portrayed as an indestructible, bullet proof, fire proof " terminator"- did very badly regarding the acting skills, and the plot is so lame and boring. The editing and screenplay is terrible, and who ever made this film is crazy about blowing things up. I truly regret the time I spent watching this, and I advise you not to see it. I also truly urge all those film makers out there, not to waste all that money on movies like this one, that don't add anything to the empire of the large screen.
