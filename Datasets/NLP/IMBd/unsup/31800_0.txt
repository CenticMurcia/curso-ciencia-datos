I've seen this movie probably over 200 times by now. I used to watch it every week when I was at school and even now it's as much fun as it always was. John Travolta and Olivia Newton John are perfectly cast and the excellent songs like "Grease", "Hopelessly Devoted to you" and "Summer Nights" are extremely well staged and performed. It's also fun to see again in the cinema since its 1998 re-issue.
