This is one of weirdest of film projects Marlon Brando ever got himself involved in. I'm still trying to figure out the point of it all.<br /><br />The Night of the Following Day was shot in France and it involves rich, young, and pretty Pamela Franklin being kidnapped and held for ransom. As is the usual the initial snatch goes off like clockwork, but the plan after that just doesn't come off.<br /><br />Jess Hahn, American expatriate actor, is the leader of the group that includes his sister Rita Moreno, Marlon Brando, and Richard Boone. Moreno is a junkie, a little trip with some nose candy and Brando and Hahn are left waiting at Orly Airport. An obliging POLICEMAN actually gives them a lift.<br /><br />In the meantime Richard Boone who's never bad even in the worst films is getting some lascivious desires about Franklin. Brando's got reason to be concerned about him.<br /><br />Al Lettieri plays a small role as a pilot who's also part of the plan and his work here led Brando to push for him with Francis Ford Coppola to give him a breakthrough role as Virgil Sollozo in The Godfather.<br /><br />I think the American players did this one for a hefty paycheck and a trip to Paris. There have been worse reasons for doing a film.<br /><br />As for its meaning, don't want to give anything away, but think Dallas as you're watching it.
