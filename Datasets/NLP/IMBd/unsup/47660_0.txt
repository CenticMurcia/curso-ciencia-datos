MADMAN is a pretty anemic horror film that copies everything from Friday THE 13th except for suspense and believability. Even if it takes place in a forested area, the movie is extremely claustrophobic. It almost feels like it was shot in a forest that was built inside a studio. The camera is always in tight close-ups. The whole film occurs at night. We never get to see the natural splendors of the area. The forest just serves as a backdrop to the extremely derivative action. So, the camera never sweeps around the area to give us an idea of the place. The camera is very static and dull. MADMAN almost feels like it was shot on video even if it wasn't. The actors are all forgettable, as are the killings. Nothing really works here. There's one word to describe MADMAN: clunky!<br /><br />Even the killer, who was sorta formidable looking from a distance during the first part of the movie, becomes ludicrous when we finally see him up close. He looks like a Morlock from THE TIME MACHINE movie starring Rod Taylor. When the camera remains more than one second on the killer's face we can clearly see the haphazard makeup effects. All in all, MADMAN is pretty much terrible and dull. The only good thing is the title and the original movie poster.
