I loved this! There a dark element to it ,but also a very romantic side. I've read Robert Duvall loves to tango in real life, and his dancing in this is so graceful and talented. The dancing in this is exquisite and the women so lovely and natural. They have the most beautiful legs I've ever seen. I was entranced by the dancing and Robert Duvall's performance was, as usual, without fault. I highly recommend it for Robert Duvall fans. The film makes me want to visit Argentina and see in person their beautiful dancing. I read somewhere that Duvall said that as writer, producer and actor he had trouble getting financing from the major studios, so he did it himself. Most of the scenes were filmed in New York for that reason. In my opinion, the final result is stellar!
