A Perfect Murder has only three primary characters; ruthless Wall Street businessman (Douglas), his beautiful, young, and wealthy wife (Paltrow), and her lover, a penniless painter (Mortensen). Early in the film Douglas discovers his wife's infidelity, and in his confrontation with Mortensen, instead of trying to banish or destroy him, Douglas hires him. Hires him to murder Paltrow for a half million dollars! And he accepts!!<br /><br />A real good start that leaves the mind buzzing. Will he do it? Is it a part of a deeper scam. Is Paltrow in on it?<br /><br />The directing, acting and other cinematic pieces are up to the task with one omission; the story. Plot-holes, and "you've go to be kidding" actions slowly drag the story down from the pinnacle to which it aspired.<br /><br />Down, but not out. It still works, and you won't be wasting your money if you rent it. I give it a B-. Should have been better though.
