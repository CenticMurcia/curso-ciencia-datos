I watched the movie The Flyboys in Mesquite Nv. where part of the film was made. I truly enjoyed the entire movie. The humor, adventure,family settings where wonderful. First movie I have seen for awhile that I didn't get bored by the same plot,same outcome as so many movies and TV series have set themselves in. Wonderful exciting,and down to earth without the sex and horrors of so many movies out there. Get this movie out to the public and you'll see why I think it will be a best sell. The boys show maturity in their relationships with each other as their adventure unfolds, their honesty to each other and their courage to win over their fears was done so well.
