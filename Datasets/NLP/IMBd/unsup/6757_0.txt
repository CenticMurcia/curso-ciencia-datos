I highly recommend this genuinely funny sex farce involving the<br /><br />mishaps that occur when a man talks his wife into having lesbian<br /><br />relationships. Hemingway, Binder, and Cryder do excellent acting<br /><br />jobs with long scenes with no cuts.<br /><br />Hemingway, in my mind, grows more delectable with age.<br /><br />Too bad it's not on VHS or DVD. I taped it from Cinem
