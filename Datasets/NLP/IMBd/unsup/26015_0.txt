Michael Griffin(Christian Slater)wants a serum called "The Buffer" which counteracts the ill-effects of invisibility. The only one with real knowledge on how to create this agent is Dr. Maggie Dalton(Laura Regan, the opening victim in "Dead Silence")whose being guarded by detectives Frank Turner(Peter Facinelli)and Lisa Martinez(Sarah Deakins)thanks to the division head of where the Invisibility project continued, Dr. William Reisner(David McIlwraith). When Lisa is killed by the homicidal Griffin(who is trying to find out the formula of the buffer agent or to kidnap Maggie), Frank wishes to know why his partner died. Reisner had used Maggie as a guinea pig to kill Michael but this plan fails and the doctor wants to know why Michael's superior, Colonel Gavin Bishop(William MacDonald)couldn't catch him when his men had the invisible maniac within their grasp. On the lam, Frank will try to keep Maggie from harm as Reisner has his goons out searching for them while they also try to stay one step ahead of an invisible pursuer who has the upper hand.<br /><br />Okay direct-to-vid B-flick makes the mistake of casting Slater as the lead villain. Let's just be honest, it's not Slater's voice which makes him likable but his overall performance. If you cast an actor for whom you rarely see during a film's duration he needs to have a distinctive believable voice..Slater just doesn't cut the mustard. Facinelli is moderately interesting as the hero but nothing special. Regan as the female being pursued by everyone is adequate if unimpressive. The visual effects are decent..one standout scene has two invisible men duking it out in the rain. Instantly forgettable flick which really does nothing for Slater's sagging career. Definitely inferior to the original, but that's normally the case with a much cheaper sequel that hits DVD shelves pretty quickly.
