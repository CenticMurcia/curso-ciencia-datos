very bad script for so many good actors including Maia Morgenstein. Director should retire after this movie even a foreign director can do a better movie about the Romanian so called revolution. for a Romanian who lived those period the movie is so lame, so many things in the movie seem so unrealistic. The main characters are going by tram at the beginning of the movie surrounded by tanks but no one is making a comment on that. Romania wasn't Iraq at that time so everybody should be surprised. Btw the trains towards Timisoara were stopped in those days by the communist regime, that city was practically closed. My advice watch the movie as an experience but lower your expectations. definitely not a good movie.
