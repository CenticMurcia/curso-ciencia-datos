Lynch's second film is a 4-minute mind-boggling trip into the subconscious. A dream Lynch's niece had while in school inspired it. She had a dream in which she recited the letters of the alphabet. And that pretty much summarizes what this film is about. The filmmaker used that simple idea as the basis of this fascinating short. If you are familiar with Lynch's work, you pretty much know what to expect. Nightmarish images are plentiful, and the film's atmosphere is strangely dense. I did not know what everything meant but it was fun to watch. Something I noticed here was the constant allusion to sex. Is it me or Lynch is a little too preoccupied with sex? The truth is that most of what I saw in the movie struck as being related to sex in one way or the other. It is possible that my mind was simply playing games on me. The fact is that only Lynch can make so much with so little. It is a true delight from beginning to end. If you are remotely interested in the director's work this is mandatory viewing.
