I was lucky to see TROOP 1500 in its full feature length version at the Dallas Video Fest. I hear there is a shorter version which will be broadcast on TV. Quite frankly, I have never seen a documentary which is both artistically innovative and radical in its content. The idea of girls interviewing their own mothers in jail is nothing short of GENIUS and I cannot imagine any other filmmakers telling this story with as much wisdom, heart, soul and depth. Ellen Spiro and Karen Bernstein have presented an eye-opening gift to the world, a film which will make it hard to ignore the children of incarcerated mothers. I see every documentary I possibly can, including the big commercial hits like Fahrenheight 911, but TROOP 1500 is BY FAR the best one I can remember. I wish it would be seen in every cineplex in America, but the next best thing is to see it on DVD or television in its shorter form. Highly recommended from someone who is as critical and cynical as anyone. TROOP 1500 is a fierce, urgently attentive work of art.
