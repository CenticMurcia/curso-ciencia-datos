I almost passed on this movie since it appeared too quirky for my tastes, a romantic comedy about a class of South Korean students and its Australian English teacher. Well, I was right about the quirky part, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. This is a fairly straightforward romantic comedy made exceptional by the performances of the two leads, Na-yeong Lee and Hyuk Jang. Lee plays Yeong-ju, a relatively shy, awkward woman, who immediately falls in love with the young "player", Jang's Moon-su. Yeong-ju tries to win his love through every means possible, from asking outright to teaching a pig English. She is borderline psychotic and she would be considered a stalker in the US, but she's so funny and adorable you want her to win anyway. I must admit, it was also fun watching Lee, a very beautiful actress, turn herself into a clumsy mouse-of-a-girl.<br /><br />The subplot is touching: Moon-su is trying to learn English so he can translate conversations between his mother and his sister, Victoria, who has lived in the United States since she was given up for adoption. Mun-he Na plays Moon-su's mother and also gives an endearing, heartfelt performance. The only discordant note in the entire movie is the young actress playing Victoria, who clearly cannot act, but her poor performance only made me realize how good the other's were.<br /><br />There is also some witty use of animation in some scenes that cleverly supports the story without threatening to overshadow it. A possible exception is the Mortal Kombat parody that does goes on for a bit but it is pretty funny nevertheless, and it occurs early enough in the film so that it fades to the background by the two-thirds mark.<br /><br />As an aside, I have no idea what the picture on the cover of the DVD is portraying as it bears no relationship to the movie itself. Don't attempt to judge the movie by that picture.
