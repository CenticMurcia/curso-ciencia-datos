This movie is so perfect! The story, acting, scenery and general attention to detail are wonderful. Kristin's character is complex, as are the others- there are no flat characters here, no "he's the good guy and he's the bad guy." The plot is also rich and is a refreshing contrast to so many of the predictable, clich√©d flicks playing at the mall theaters.<br /><br />I have to give it a 10. It is flawless and fascinating. If I could, I would give it bonus points for having such unique subject matter, as well. After all, films about medieval Norway don't come out every day- especially not from the perspective of a young, strong, female character.
