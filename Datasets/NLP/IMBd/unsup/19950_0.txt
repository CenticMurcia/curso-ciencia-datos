I wonder what this movie was all about. I failed at grasping the story - assuming there was one. The characters just showed up on some locations, doing hell knows what. The whole movie is so damn incoherent. At the beginning they explain what will happen next. I don't know if the director wanted the following scenes to be as mysterious as the secret agent business is to normal people. Despite from being as unrealistic as I'd expect from a movie like this, it's painfully incoherent. Did I mention this? At one scene the characters are doing their job for whomever at the next they are doing something else. I never knew why they did all this. The only thing I got was the revenge George took in Madrid. Everything else remains a mystery to me. And while I was still looking out for a conclusion that would've given the story any sense the credits started rolling by, leaving me very disappointed.
