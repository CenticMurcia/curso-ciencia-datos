it was this movie, not the sixth sense, that turned me into the huge m. night shyamalan fan i am today. i saw this movie back before i even heard of the sixth sense. i saw it because i saw a trailer for it before another movie i had rented. after viewing just the trailer, my sister and i looked at each other and said, "we have to see that..." so, when i found it at blockbuster a few months later, i jumped to rent it. now i only wish that i had gotten a chance to see this limited release movie in theaters. the story of young Joshua questioning life while everyone, including his best friend, parents, and teachers scoff at him is heartbreaking. while searching for the answers of his initial question he sees life they way it should be seen. the thing i love most about m. night is the "FEELING" you get while watching his movies. there are two moments of heavy realization in this movie, millions of feel good moments, millions of laughing moments, millions of crying moments. i've since taped this movie off of cable and i still cry every time i see it. the only word i can think to describe this movie, and every other movie m. night has done, is beautiful. please go see it. you'll be glad you did.
