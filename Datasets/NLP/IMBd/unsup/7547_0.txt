It is rare to see these days such a true to life film. the director delivers an extraordinary story of the truth of the human character. The depth of passion expelled from each look and each frame is amazing. Never have I seen such truth put on screen.<br /><br />It is the way of the world, It is the truth of the hardship of living. <br /><br />Based on a true Brooklyn story about an Italian family in the middle of some rocky patches.<br /><br />The lines and thoughts stay with you long after the movie has ended. The characters just felt like people that I know. People with real problems nothing melodramatic which was nice to see.
