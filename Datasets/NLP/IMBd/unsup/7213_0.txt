I've seen "My Cousin Vinny" a thousand times, and it always does the trick...it entertains me to no end. I still laugh at the same scenes I laughed at when I first saw the film over fifteen years ago.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei is flat out FANTASTIC as Mona Lisa Vito--the wise cracking, marriage wanting, car fixing, pizza chick who accompanies Vinny (Joe Pesci--also brilliant) to Alabama in order to get his cousin (Ralph Macchio) and his friend (Mitchell Whitfield) off from murder charges when their car matches the suspect's car in a Sac-o-Suds homicide involving the clerk.<br /><br />The comedic exchanges of Pesci and Fred Gwynn (the stuffy, Southern Judge) are gut busting. Tomei and Pesci, on paper, would appear to be the oddest coupling around, but, once you see the film, you quickly become aware that their pairing is a casting triumph.<br /><br />In short, everyone pulls out all the stops to make this a movie you just can't get sick of no matter how many times you watch it (I just saw it AGAIN last night). I, personally, would like to "Thank the Academy" for honoring Tomei with a Best Supporting Actress award for her performance. If you can find a more worthy recipient--that year, or any other, for that matter--I'd like to know who you'd come up with.
