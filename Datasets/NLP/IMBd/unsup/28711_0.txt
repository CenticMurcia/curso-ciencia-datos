"Night of the Scarecrow" is a typical horror movie from 90's.The production is slick and polished,the acting ranks from acceptable to lame and the special effects are mostly cool.There are some graphic gore scenes,so the gore-hounds will not be disappointed.It's a decent movie however I prefer earlier "Scarecrows"(1988,William Wesley),which is not only gory,but also creepy as hell.In conclusion,this is sometimes nonsensical,but quite enjoyable picture so you should give it a chance.
