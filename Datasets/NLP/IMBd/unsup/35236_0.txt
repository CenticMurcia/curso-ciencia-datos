Taste the Blood of Dracula marks a first for H.G. Lewis. He actually made a film that doesn't revolve around his gross-out set pieces. However, this movie is slow and painfully boring. It's a celluloid glacier. In my life I have never experinced such a slow movie (and I've seen many films). I wouldn't recommend this film to my worst enemy. A word of advice to Mr. Lewis, "Don't stray away from a winning formula!"<br /><br />Not recommended. Not even for insomniacs because I'm afraid they'll never wake up.<br /><br />D for effort<br /><br />P.S. I'll give credit to Mr. Lewis. At least he tried to do something different. Others wouldn't even take that risk.
