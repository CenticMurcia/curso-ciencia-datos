Although it is well acted, I found myself squirming after a while with this narrowly focused film. We spend the majority of the time watching a young girl get raped several times in a dumpy small room. The Bad Guy is a bad guy, that is pretty clear but doesn't make me care. For a hard edged movie, it failed to go anywhere, and I got tired of it long before the film ended.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the "Asian Extreme" genre, this will suit you just fine. But for an open minded viewer like me, it still failed to interest. Here we see a pimp who likes to assault other people, and a young college girl with a wimpy boyfriend. The Bad Guy's buddies hang around a brothel and don't do much else. Each episode of the college girl's forced prostitution is similar, the Bad Guy watches through a mirror, she screams and cries.<br /><br />Not my idea of a night at movies.
