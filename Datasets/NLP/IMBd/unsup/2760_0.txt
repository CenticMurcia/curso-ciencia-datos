An excellent film. Reuben(DW) returns from serving two tours abroad fighting and risking his life for his country UK. He is originally from St Louisha, not sure if I have spelt that right. He can't get a job; is consistently, racially harassed by the police and goes back to an area which he tried to escape from by joining the army in the first place, hoping that on his return there would be some improvements. Alas there are none. The action starts when he decides to go on holiday with his new found girlfriend and when he trys to obtain a passport HE IS REFUSED! on the basis that since he had been away at war, his country of origin had gained independence and therefore he was not entitled to a British passport. The film is not slow moving but definitely very provocative and there are some commanding performances from all, including DW, (with the exception of his accent!) Things for people that have served in the British army have changed since and I am sure that this film played a part albeit minor.
