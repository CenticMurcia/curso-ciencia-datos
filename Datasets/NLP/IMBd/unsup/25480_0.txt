This movie was clearly thought out. I haven't seen a movie about giant ants before so i have to give it extra points for being original.<br /><br />This movie was joined by FOX STUDIOS so the budget could be increased and the GIANT Ants sure looked much better then i would think. They are damn scary.<br /><br />The whole movie is very violent and extremely well done. I noticed a few big names in it and the acting was better then most big actors these days. If this movie doesn't win an award for something IL be very upset.<br /><br />Wait until this comes to the big screen because you will get much more of an scary and intense experience but if you missed it then hire the video. Not for people who cant handle extreme violence.<br /><br />Oh and did i mention there are real life vogue models + + +
