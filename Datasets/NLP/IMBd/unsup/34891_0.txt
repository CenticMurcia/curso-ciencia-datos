This is a low-budget slasher flick, hardly worth watching except for the splendid performance from co-star Dale Buckmaster. Outside his brief acting career, Buckmaster is a world-famous accounting professor as well as an excellent amateur golfer. He steals the show from the lead actors with his amazing portrait of a low-life sleaze-ball who gets what he deserves in the end -- a grizzly death. I suspect his accounting students cheered at his demise! But the rest of the cast is just awful. The young girls and the crazy killer. I don't want to spoil the ending, but it is no surprise to learn that there is a killer loose in this summer community besides the lake. Too bad Buckmaster didn't get a sex scene with the young honeys. Instead, they killed him off. Our loss. Now that would have been something to behold!
