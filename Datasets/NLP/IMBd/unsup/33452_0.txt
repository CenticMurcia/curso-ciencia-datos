For years I been hearing about how original and good is this show, but after watch the first 4 Tv movies I just a found just a few pieces of trash with nothing new except there is anything less science. As many other stories of science fiction this saga begins with one prophecy of one warrior who will kill the ultimate evil who destroys his world, then all the classic elements are changed just to put a bunch of laments characters commanding a big space ship of an ancient insect race who manifest in the end of the fourth movie with the form of a human(at least the face). The stories are in the middle of path to the horror and black comedy, showing all the things as it were of a real science fiction but without just a little piece of real science. The special effects are not bad but the acting and the characters are almost unbearable. I been watching reading science fiction for more than twenty years and after watch this I can only say this has nothing original
