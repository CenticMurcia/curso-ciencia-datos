I found this film disappointing and, on the whole, unfunny. I expected it to be full of Noel Coward-type witty lines and it wasn't. The so-called double-entendres in this film were ponderous and far from delicious, in my opinion. Fredric March turns in an adequate performance but Gary Cooper and Miriam Hopkins are embarrassingly bad, in my opinion. Cooper is, as always, a breathtakingly beautiful man but he spends a great deal of this film striking "attitudes" and pursing and pouting his lips in a way I've never seen him do in any other movie. He seemed amateurish and high-school drama star to me. Hopkins also strikes "attitudes" and she often poses dramatically as she stares off into the distance and speaks rather ponderous and unfunny speeches. The best performance in the film is given by Edward Everett Horton as the square successful advertising man. Horton is a favorite of mine and I was pleasantly surprised to see him efface his usual and stock effeminate mannerisms and exaggerated double-takes. He's very believable as a staid middle-aged heterosexual man. I enjoyed his character and performance very much. However, the rest of the actors and the script don't live up to him.
