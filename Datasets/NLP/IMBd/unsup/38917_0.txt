I must say, this is one of the all-time worst sitcoms that I have ever viewed. It ranks right up there with Curb Your Enthusiasm as first rate letdowns. I went into this show really wanting to like it, but it gave me no reason whatsoever to become an avid viewer of the show. I gave it a two episode trial and didn't laugh at a single "joke" that was presented in this lifeless, flat sitcom. This show gives "dry-humor" a whole new meaning.<br /><br />Having sat through the two episodes at my brother's house, since I can't bring myself to pay for USA's Monk - the only watchable show on television today - I can breath easy, knowing that I am not missing anything worthwhile on the tube. Brent Butt, who seems to be lauded as a Canadian Jerry Seinfled, is the most colorless, lifeless lead I've ever seen in a sitcom. The writing for this show is clearly done by people lacking even a working knowledge of the word "funny." The similarities to Seinfeld end with the basis of the plot - both shows being about nothing. Where Seinfeld was witty and had spontaneous jokes, Corner Gas builds up their jokes at such an excessive degree that you see them coming, ruining their value. A joke with an obvious punchline is dead-on-arrival, folks - just like this show.
