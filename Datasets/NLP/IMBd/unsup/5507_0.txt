This was a very good movie pretty realist not to out of character there were some really good actors in this movie and it really shows what the "game" can do to the community, family and friends I love this movie so much and I could watch it over and over again. This movie is exceptional in the way it show the common drug dealer it speaks to me because I live where this happens all the time; people dying because of drug whethe they are friends, or enemies. This movie is a in depth look at what society face today in this world of selling drugs and making a living off of it. It shows us how thin of a line there is between friends, business, and money. It is a true work of art.
