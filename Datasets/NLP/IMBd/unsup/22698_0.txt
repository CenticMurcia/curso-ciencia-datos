My friend got a copy for us to watch and we fell in love with the star Silvio. We're tired of these movie stars who look like boys and he reminded us of a young Stallone with his looks and raw intensity.<br /><br />The whole thing played out unpredictable where we had no idea what would happen like a Lynch film. Joe Cortese was raging as flamboyant producer and his best scene is a fight with Tom Sizemore who plays himself without apologies. Daniel Baldwin steals the show with a character one step away from insanity. From the moment he arrives you know something wild will happen.<br /><br />The best part for us is the music video where he sings. Hot!
