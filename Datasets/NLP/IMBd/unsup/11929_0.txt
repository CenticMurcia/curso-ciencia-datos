If you are collecting Keating this DVD is more than worth buying just to enjoy him in action and looking quite fit. He always seems to really enjoy playing villains. There is a lot more nudity than you get in most SciFi but it really is required to get the plot to work. The whole point is monstrous alien chicks on the prowl after all and not great literary work. Unfortunately it caused what is a major scene for the storyline to get cut for the U.S. TV version. For SciFi the plot is worse than most, but better than some. They missed out on using something about the 'mad scientist' messing with a bit of the alien DNA on himself. In the cut scene at one point it looks as if McGuire's eyes go alien blue. Following along that line would have made the plot a lot more interesting and twisted. A lot less Hollander mooning about would have helped a great deal. Favela makes good use of visual acting getting across the creepy aspect of the alien without having much dialog.
