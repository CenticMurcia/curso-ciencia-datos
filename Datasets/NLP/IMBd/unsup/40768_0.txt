Come on. If you're watching this movie, you can't expect too much. Two words: POLLY SHORE. Watching this movie now, you can see how ridiculously dated it is. It was released in 1995 to capitalize on the world's fascination with the OJ Simpson trial. 10 years from now, is anyone going to know what the one-liner "Say hi to Judge Ito!" means?? It's not the absolute worse thing I've ever seen, and there are some mildly funny bits here and there. 3/10
