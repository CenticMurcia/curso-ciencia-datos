Piece of crap with Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett, 2 people in love and working in space, just the 2 of them on a remote station near Saturn. Into their lives comes Harvey Keitel (His voice was dubbed by Roy Dotrice because his Bronx accent didn't wash) and his friend, a robot named HECTOR. Of course, things take a turn for the worst, when Keitel gets the hots for Farrah. Unfortunately, so does HECTOR.<br /><br />If you really want an example of "What were they thinking?" then this is the perfect film. It was directed by Stanley Donen, Mr. "Singing In The Rain," for goodness sake! Plus, WHY did Kirk Douglas feel the need to show his buns? (Does this run in the family? See his son Michael in "Basic Instinct," or "Fatal Attraction.").<br /><br />If you plan of having a "Bad Sci-Fi Movie Festival," then this would be the film to have for it. Otherwise, save your money. If they show it on cable, skip it.
