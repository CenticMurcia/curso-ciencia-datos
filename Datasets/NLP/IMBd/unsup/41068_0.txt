Yawn.<br /><br />This is yet another painfully boring movie that tries to get by on soft-core pornography and (oh so shocking!) S&M themes to keep the viewer interested. Imagine the worst episode of "Red Shoe Diaries," I mean the absolute worst, with black actors. This movie is worse. Another viewer cleverly equated this to "Eyes Wide Shut." The is much similarity, although the dismal, slow-moving EWS is FAR more interesting than this turkey.<br /><br />The dialog was probably written in less time than the movie spans. Seriously.<br /><br />Actual porn movies have better scripts and less wooden acting. <br /><br />I gave it a "2," only because the opening sequence was pretty well done.<br /><br />Avoid this one like the plague.
