What a wonderful film. Although I first saw this film when I was probably six years old, it has stuck with me as an inspiration, and set a standard that very few movies live up to. The love story between Natty and Harry is so romantic, and the independent spirit of a young girl was rare in movies back then and is still rare now. This is an overlooked film that has always filled me with that feeling of secret magic, that there can be movies and stories like this, and that a young girl can make it on her own. It's interesting to see that it was nominated for an Oscar. Also this was probably the first time I saw John Cusak in anything (although still my favorite film of his is "Better Off Dead"). Meredith Salenger was excellent as Natty.
