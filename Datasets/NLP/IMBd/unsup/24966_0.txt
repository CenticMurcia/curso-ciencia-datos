This is a golf story that begins show a golf course being ruined with divots the size of craters. Of course Tom is the guilty party, hacking away - literally. When he finally sinks a putt, the ball pops back up out of the hole! That signals of arrival of Jerry who is underneath in the hole shoving the ball back out.<br /><br />Once out, Tom captures and for awhile the reverse that usually happens occurs: Jerry takes a beating. He gets roughed up in the ball washer, gets used as a tee and as a ball. <br /><br />Finally Tom is the one that gets physically abuse on the course through various means, including bees and a woodpecker!<br /><br />It's typical Tom-and-Jerry trying to kill each other, usually in clever and humorous ways. Golfers will get a bigger kick out of this than others, but everyone should get a fair share of laughs out of it.
