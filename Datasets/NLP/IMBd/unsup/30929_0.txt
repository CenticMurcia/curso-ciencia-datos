...i was truly disgusted by this piece of blatant, fundamentalist Christian (so-called = since Christ never advocated this end- of- the- world- chosen- ones- get- to- be-saved -the -non-believers -good-or-not -get-to-burn -in- hell-on-Earth apocalyptic poppycock!) masquerading as a regular mystery/thriller. It should be at very least labeled Sci-Fi - that way, there'd at least be some effort to make an accurate representation to those of us who happen NOT to subscribe to fundamentalist doctrine which we can then choose to waste our money & time watching, or not.<br /><br />The script was atrocious - full of loose ends & predictable dialog, the acting all culled from the wide-eyes + dropped jaw school of performing...the angels were weird & scary...the poor 'Cassandra' of this piece tormented & suffering for absolutely no discernibly useful reason (damn poor way to treat one of y'chosen Ones = drive them to a premature death by suicide b/c everyone believes you are mad...including you!)...heck the only cool things were the cute kids & the cool spaceships! That tree-of-life at the end just about sent me over the edge...<br /><br />Repeat; should come with a warning 'Caution; watching this movie WILL expose you to extremist doctrine of a religious nature'. If i'd read that, i' have skipped it - as i'm sure millions of others would (and will, once word gets out).<br /><br />One thing good about it is that it makes Travolta's revolting 'Battlestar Gallactica' look good!!! Hey, at least there i knew ahead of time it was Scientology doctrine = fair's fair!
