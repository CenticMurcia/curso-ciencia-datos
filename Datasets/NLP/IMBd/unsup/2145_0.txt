I watched this because it is part of a collection of 50 horror movies. This package is a hodgepodge of B movies and old classics. The only horror about this film is the fact that it went into distribution. I saw that Roger Corman's name was above the title, so I figured some silly spook show. It's a women's prison movie. How did it get into the collection? Let's see. There is some plot about diamonds that have been hidden away in the Bayou. There are a group of women, some pretty famous actresses. There's Mike Connors (Mannix), and then a lot of gun pointing, and, pardon my sexism, cat fights. Connors' girl friend gets eaten by an alligator. The undercover cop is the hero but she allows innocent people to be killed. She's also not particularly attractive. There's Beverly Garland, the last wife on "My Three Sons." There's more fights. Connors sits with his hands tied behind his back for most of the movie. I don't mind bad movies. Sometimes they have something redeeming. This just pushes the button of stupidity.
