In movie history we have many different styles of movies. Action, adventure, mystery, suspense, and of course children's films. Sadly, Andy and the Airwave Rangers is neither of these. What genre is Andy and the Airwave Rangers? The genre is known simply as "horrible".<br /><br />This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. First of all, the story is about a kid who watches a magic HVS tape and then sets off on an adventure to something called the "colordome" to save someone, or something. Then all hell breaks loose and he's forced to team up with people from different movies and ages, like warriors and princesses and whatnot.<br /><br />The funny thing about this movie, though, is the weird cinematography and sets. In one scene, we see a high quality set, Andy is hiding out on a starship. The film quality is good and we can see the characters, except for Andy's actual face. It's always darkened by shadows and whatnot. Then when we cut to close-ups of Andy's face, we are in a big, extremely fake looking set with a whole different video quality, with Andy sitting behind one metallic prop, with an orange light in the background to make it seem "starshipp-y". It's almost as if the original Andy didn't want to be in the film, and many close-up scenes were re-shot with another person playing Andy.<br /><br />Besides that, there's not much to this movie. Don't show it to your children, lest they kill themselves. AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID.
