Quite frankly, anyone BUT Bookeem Woodbine would have been fine in this role, but his portrayal as Steve Grant left me more than a bit cold. His character is a one-dimensional, whining, cardboard-cutout wannabe gangsta, and he honestly just does not cut it as Grant, which was a serious detriment to this film, as Grant's was a key role. (And what was WITH those short, tiny ties?! Was he wearing a kid's tie?)<br /><br />Additionally, Adrian Paul as Aaron Gray here was reminiscent of a young, uptight Gomez Addams look-alike. There was nothing wrong with his performance, but his costumer should definitely have gone in another direction with his wardrobe. The pencil-drawn-looking mustache did not help, and neither did the liberal abuse of hair goo. All these elements contributed a certain air of detachment between the audience and his character, which seriously brought down the film. His character was one of those principle characters which needed to enjoy a connection with the audience in order for this film to work. <br /><br />However, Ling Bai's performance was very compelling, provocative and professional here. You may remember her as Miss East from Wild, Wild West. <br /><br />Other than that, this was a rather entertaining venture into the future of the vampyric race, in spite of the vastly missed potential. There are certain rules one must follow when in production of a vampire film. Some argue that these rules were created by Universal Studios when they filmed the old 30's, 40's and 50's black and white horrors. Others say these rules come from the legends themselves. Whichever the case, this movie does not seem to be aware of the "vampire rules."<br /><br />The effects were less than they could have been, but were otherwise passable. The flash-backs, however, were just annoying, and the visuals lacked in creativity. <br /><br />The musical score was strong and contributed a nice suspense to the production, and moved between action and suspense quite well, even if it was overly techno at times. <br /><br />There are some good elements, but they seem totally unconnected and even accidental. There is little flow and less continuity. Yet the good elements are enough to keep you watching to the end, which is satisfying. Unfortunately, it's also satisfying that it IS the end.<br /><br />It rates a 4.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
