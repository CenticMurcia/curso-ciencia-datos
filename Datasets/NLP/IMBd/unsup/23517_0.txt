GREAT first effort film. Gets better with each viewing. PLEASE don't let Freddy (I can't act, but my wife can) Prinze scare you away - there's a nifty little jewel here. A unique and poignant story being told here...for anyone that's ever felt like their life lacks the "spark" they've always dreamed of. Very sweet...
