This week is the release of QT's Inglorious Bast(e)erds but i will not be able to see it as the film is an 18 and i am 15 but will see it when it comes out on DVD. So instead i bought the original Inglorious Bastards that QT himself recommends and so do i.<br /><br />The film has a cool premise. Six or so rebellious solders are off to a court Marshall to be sent away for life for their crimes but when their truck that is transporting them is bombed and attacked they escape and try to get to the neutral country of Switzerland. But along the way they are mistaking for another group and have to carry out a deadly mission to get rid of train load of Nazis. I can understand if you find QT's version offencive but this is just pure fun, a film which holds no punches and takes no prisoners.<br /><br />It's a far fetched film which surprised me, a lot. Their guns never run out of bullets and we find that a sub-machine gun is the best gun in the world for accuracy. The films Major or more secretive selling point is that it is a funny take on other films like the dirty dozen and older spaghetti western characters. The film isn't unintentionally funny the film is actually side split-tingly fun at times and pulls of some great one liners like<br /><br />"Do you speak English?" " Em F*ck you F*ck s*it Balls"<br /><br />So if you watch this prepare to laugh <br /><br />The film's action scenes are also very creative, with over the top action and a body count that i lost track of. It's is a lot of fun to watch and even better is there is a mild amount of sympathy to some of the characters especially Gi Bro which was unexpected.<br /><br />The only reason it get's a seven because it just is nothing special. While a lot of fun it just isn't wild enough and doesn't have the a lot mayhem which is what i was expecting. It is also edited a bit funnily. It will skip long periods of time and expect us to know what is happening or going on.<br /><br />While QT's will have the Tarintino flare about it, The original is just pure adrenaline filled fun which makes you think if David Zucker ( Airplane) or John Huges made a war film this is what it would be like .<br /><br />7/10
