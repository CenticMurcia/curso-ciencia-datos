The traditional documentary format can be extremely boring and hard to watch if you don't like the subject matter. Every once in a while you come across a documentary film that is entertaining and dramatic, regardless of whether or not you like the subject matter. While I must say that I don't particularly like beauty pageants this is a film that I found to be engaging. The pacing was great and the use of a visual countdown to the last day really heightened the sense of drama. An incredibly well crafted, visually stunning film with a really subtle yet powerful soundtrack made for one of the better documentary films of the year. As the film progressed i found myself really emotionally connected to the characters and to the outcome.
