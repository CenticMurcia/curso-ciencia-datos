The 4 DVD set, "The Voyage of Charles Darwin", can be purchased through a seller on eBid for a reasonable price (not auction). I despaired of ever seeing this inspiring series again. I had been looking online every few years, but someone recently wrote that it could be found at eBid. After I got mine, I inquired whether the seller could get more, and he replied that he could. What I especially liked about the series was/is the realism: I believe the scenes were shot on location, and the ship certainly looks like how the Beagle must have been (or how I imagined it). Darwin is portrayed by an actor, Malcolm Stoddard, who looks and acts like what I envisioned Darwin would have been like. Enjoy! Finally!
