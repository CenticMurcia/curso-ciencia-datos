This, the final episode, was perhaps one of the biggest disappointments I have seen on-screen to date.<br /><br />The episode's premise was promising: Mulder, on trial for the murder of a man who cannot die, depends upon Skinner and Scully to back him up.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what was a good idea quickly degenerated into a parade of characters from the show's better seasons, throwing in Krycek, Gibson Praise, Marita Covarrubias, etc. for no discernible reason except as a poorly-contrived...what? Plot point? It's like a clip episode only so, so much worse.<br /><br />Then Mulder's on the run, Scully joins him, Krycek throws Smoking Man--who, by the way, has been hiding at an ancient Anasazi village?????--down some stairs and (apparently) kills him, and the episode ends with Mulder and Scully in a motel room, on the lam, with all their allies dead or wanted by the FBI. None of the fans' questions are answered (nor hardly addressed), and the whole thing has a very confused, "I'm-sick-of-this, let's-get-it-over-with" feel to it. There was so much potential, even after the last three seasons of pure garbage, and it was squandered.<br /><br />Le sigh, the fans now must content themselves with watching Seasons 1 through 6 and hoping that, should Chris Carter make another movie, he dismisses Seasons 7, 8 and 9 as a drugged dream sequence. That would be the only honorable thing to do, seeing as how horribly he mangled this would-be happy ending.
