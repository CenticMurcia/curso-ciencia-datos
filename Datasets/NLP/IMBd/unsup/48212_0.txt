Henry B. Walthall (as Charles Randolph) goes off to fight for the Confederacy, during the Civil War. Also joining the ranks are his sister (Agnes Randolph)'s suitors - Joseph Graybill and Charles West. Later, in General Robert E. Lee's tent, soldier Walthall is chosen for an dangerous mission. But, the war, and drink, have turned him into a coward; unable to complete the mission, he runs home to mother (Grace Henderson). To save family honor, Ms. West puts on her brother's uniform to complete the mission. After receiving sad news from General Lee, mother Henderson demands cowardly Walthall hide in "The House with Closed Shutters", so folks will think he died honorably. Her plans are complicated when the sister's suitors return again, and againÂ… and again. The two suitors certainly do persevere! Directed by D.W. Griffith. <br /><br />*** The House with Closed Shutters (8/8/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Dorothy West, Joseph Graybill
