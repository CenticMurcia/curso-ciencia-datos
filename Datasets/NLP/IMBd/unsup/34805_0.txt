And this was supposed to be a blockbuster??? This wasn't even up to par with a half baked 60 minute television crime drama. I had heard that this movie was poor. I'd heard that there were no good performances in the movie. I'd heard that the plot was rushed and that I'd regret wasting spending the time it took to watch it. All of these statements were so incredibly understated and did not remotely allow for how terrible this movie really was. I can't believe that Al Pacino found any reasons to actually make this film. I can't believe a studio funded it. I can't believe that it has a 6 for a rating overall. This is one of the worst developed plots; the most rushed story lines; so many short cuts and just an utter waste of talent and time. HORRIBLE!!! I want my 88 minutes back!!!
