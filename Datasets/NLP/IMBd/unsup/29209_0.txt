I just recently saw this movie because I really was looking for a movie to watch. I had already read he comments for this movie before I saw it. This movie was lacking something. I mean the chemistry was OK between Sara and Miles but the dance movies was horrible. A viewer could tell that the new Sara could not dance hip hop. The way it went with the music was just bad. I did like the plot and the meaning behind the movie. The way Sarah acted and her ballet was excellent though. The funny thing is that you can tell that the actress used to be a ballerina in real life. I did love Miles. He really is why I watched the movie for the second time. He is really cute and his smile does light up the movie. But after everything was said and done, the movie was just missing something that I can put my foot on.
