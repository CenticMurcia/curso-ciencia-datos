The 1st Rocky combined a story about a boxing career and a love story. That combination made the 1st Rocky such a great film. However, Rocky II focuses only on a love story between Rocky and Adrian(i.e. they have a baby). The real action doesn't occur until the end, where Rocky fights Apollo Creed for a 2nd time. After the first Rocky, the producers should have left this series alone.
