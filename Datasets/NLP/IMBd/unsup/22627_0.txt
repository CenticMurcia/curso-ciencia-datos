I have remembered this movie being on TV when I was a child and have never forgotten it. We had the soundtrack that I played often, really enjoyed all the music. In High School we did Brigadoon and I played Tommy. (I was a far cry from Robert Goulet in appearance or voice, but I was the only one in my class who could sing!) As luck would have it a few months ago I connected with someone on the internet who had made a copy of the movie using a movie camera of the TV screen and provided me with a DVD copy. It is not the best recording, but since this is probably the only version I will ever be able to enjoy, it is priceless. Actually, the sound is terrific, the video certainly not DVD quality but passable for someone who had enjoyed it as a child. Great fun to watch and brings back many fond memories.
