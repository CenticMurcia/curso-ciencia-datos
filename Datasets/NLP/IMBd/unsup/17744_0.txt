"I could of joined the NSA but they found out my parents were married!" <br /><br />The DVD box proudly proclaims that the film is one of the most satisfying suspense films ever,! naturally this is hyperbole from the marketing department, but it's stuff like that that can make or break a viewers expectation level being achieved.<br /><br />I opened this write up with a funny line spoken by Robert Redford because having just finished the film I feel all jolly, and that is a priceless thing after watching one of the most suspenseful films ever! {groan}. This film is a multi genre offering, it has pretty much most bases covered, and it has a cast of actors from different eras clearly enjoying the work they are doing. There is no earth shattering twists or performances to match, it's a tightly written 2 hours of pure entertainment. It does have suspense, it does make you think about how technology is an incredible tool, but chiefly the film is a film that you all can watch on a winters night and be safe in the knowledge that your rental or TV time hasn't been wasted.<br /><br />7/10, and the ending is fabulous, I really should go for a higher rating purely for the incredulous looks that James Earl Jones gives as the final reel draws to a close.
