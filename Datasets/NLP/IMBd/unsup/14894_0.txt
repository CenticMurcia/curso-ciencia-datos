I likewise never saw the movie in the Theater. I thought the movie did its best to be as realistic as possible in depicting the plight of the refugees in the World and the starvation and sickness that accompanies their lives. The helplessness of the volunteers came through loud and clear and the way that the rest of the world reacts or doesn't react to the human suffering struck home. It was a very meaningful movie. I wish more movies that are made carry a message just as "Beyond Borders" did. Probably more influential actors may have presented a stronger impact upon the audience. Frankly, I don't know why the movie did not attract a large audience if it was released at all. But there have been some really good whole movies that have likewise failed.
