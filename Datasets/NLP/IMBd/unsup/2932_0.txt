It looks like the movie didn't cause much money, but it did cause the director a lot of thinking to put his thoughts into this comedy. The movie express a nationalism idea in the director's own opinion: unite with the north and go against the foreigners. The comic parts are mostly from the portrayal of south and north (the north officer always stand on the left,north Korean soldiers' arrogance...) I love the ending very much, when Admiral Lee's 13 ships had to face the 300 ships from Japan (a real battle in history which Koreans won), he motivated his sailors: as we are united, there's nothing can stop us. Which is the idea the director wants to tell his country men. Korea is a smaller country compare to any potential opponent, it has to be united.
