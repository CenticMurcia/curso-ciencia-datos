It would be nice if things worked out as they have in this movie, which is why I liked this movie is because movies are aloud to be unrealistic and it's nice to leave the theater or turn of the DVD off after watching the film and feel good (that is if you're not so critical about movies).<br /><br />This movie kept me entertained and glued to the plot. I felt the acting was fine and had the best individuals for this film. But, I felt certain parts could have been changed, for example, the ending. I am not sure if the audience is fully aware if Sam got Lucy back or not. All in all, I give this movie a 8/10.<br /><br />
