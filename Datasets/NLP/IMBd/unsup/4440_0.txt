A love story about two people (James Earl Jones and Lynn Redgrave) who end up in the same boarding house (run by Margot Kidder in one of her best performances ever), after being rejected by society and the people whom they have counted on for support. As they fall in love they have to deal with the unusual ways that each of them have created purpose for themselves--the very reasons society has rejected them--while also facing their prejudices about age, race, and sex.<br /><br />I saw this film at the 2000 USA Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. All the performances are first-rate, as is the cinematography, the script and the music.<br /><br />This film is unlikely to get wide distribution, due to the fact that it does not feature wet teenagers or loud rock-and-roll, but if you do get the opportunity to see it, do. You'll be glad you did.
