I've been forced to watch this so many times that I know it inside and out, and I've hated it from the very first time I saw it! The songs are outright stupid, the acting is terrible, and the only thing that keeps me from writing hate mail to who or whatever is responsible for this movie is the brief appearances of Julie Newmar. Stubby Kaye wasn't so bad, though his character, "Marryin' Sam", became more irritating as time went on. Unless you're *really* bored and you don't have MST3K: The Movie on hand, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!
