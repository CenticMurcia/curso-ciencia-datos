And, I'm referring as much to the movie, itself, as I am to its male lead. Even Kevin Costner's version is only three stars, at best, compared to the four stars I give this one. *Some spoilers ahead.* The dialogue is classic. <br /><br />SIR GUY: "You've come to Nottingham, once too often!"<br /><br />ROBIN: "When this is over, my friend, there'll be no need for me to come again." <br /><br />The cinematography was great; especially the silhouettes of Robin and Sir Guy backlit against that pillar! *Often imitated, but never surpassed.* <br /><br />And, that Erich Wolfgang Korngold music!! What other movie can boast xylophone music that actually makes you tense enough to literally sit on the edge of your seat, no matter how many times you watch it? And, believe me; I will never---repeat; NEVER---tire of watching it. So, in the immortal words of Little John (Alan Hale, Sr.): <br /><br />"LONG LIVE RICHARD THE LION-HEART!"
