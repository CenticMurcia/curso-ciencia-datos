I don't remember when i last laugh this much when i saw a movie (might have been when i saw the first goal movie) there are so many errors in this movie that it's impossible not to laugh at it. for an example they start of by showing the "El Classico" from 2006 then they jump straight to the summer (El Classico was in march or april) then they have the bar called Miguel Angel in madrid and Angel is a Barca Icon so the idea of having a bar in Madrid named after one of their arch rivals is not possible. Only see this movie if u want to laugh at errors and not to take it to serious because European football is nothing at all the way they put it in the movie (And the Champions League is not played like the superbowl playoff there are 2 games in the quarter, semi-finals so it's not enough to win just one game)
