If you're a woman, if you like Lifetime movies, if you're a fan of Alexandra Paul, then you should enjoy this. It is more of mind thriller than a chase "I'm being stalked by someone" movie. I liked the exchanges between the two feuding neighbors and wonder if they needed to keep the whole robbery story going throughout. I guess it added some doubt and some twists, but I think the movie still would've played fine without it. Also, they never explained who EXACTLY killed the cat. Was it Janis or was it the coyotes? Also, was Janis dead in the end as she was put into the ambulance? I wasn't quite sure. All in and all, the movie delivers what it sets out to.
