This 'film' is absolute trash. I've seen amateurs in high school do a much better job then what these guys attempted in "Zombie Night." Shot on what looks like a cheap Circuit City hand camera, the 'actors' portrayed are flat in character, and the acting is so poor it could give people like Hulk Hogan hope for his acting career. The only good quality of this movie was it's gore effects, which were handled with enough care. However, this movie is merely just a vehicle for decent zombie gore, and not much else.<br /><br />A bare bones plot, a script that could bore you to tears, combined with worthless acting and quality leads to a 2/10 in my book. You lose, good day sir!
