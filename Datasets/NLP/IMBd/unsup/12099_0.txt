This movie came on the Western Channel last night after two very good, if not great westerns. The contrast was huge. I couldn't make it half way this one it was so bad. Don't watch this movie unless you have a weird sense of humor. <br /><br />This is one of the worst western movies I have ever seen in my life. I gave it a 2/10 because I save a one for bad and evil. This didn't qualify in the evil category, just bad, bad, bad. Cheap and bad is probably more accurate<br /><br />Sterling Hayden is much better than this. I can't believe his poor performance. I expected much more from this actor. Lee Van Clief was no better.<br /><br />This movie must have been made over a long weekend. The beach scenes didn't work, but they were probably cheap. A surf western?<br /><br />Bad directing.<br /><br />Bad camera.<br /><br />Bad music.<br /><br />Bad bad, bad and cheap surf western movie.
