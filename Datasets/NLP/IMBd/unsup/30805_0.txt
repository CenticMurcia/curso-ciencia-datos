The story can be good but the animation is so bad that makes watch anything but this show. Every character it's very ugly, there no beauty in a single episode. I hope some day Lucas think to make a real animation show with an art good as the greatest scifi animations like Galaxy Rangers (this a real piece of art, no this "Ugly Wars").
