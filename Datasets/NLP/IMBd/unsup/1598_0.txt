Bette Davis is a southern belle whose aunt (Fay Bainter) calls her Jezebel in a moment of supreme disappointment. This is a 1938 film also starring Henry Fonda, George Brent, and Donald Crisp. Bette is Julie Marsden, a brat engaged to Preston Dillard (Fonda). She soon loses him for what appears to be the second time when she wears a red dress to a ball where all the women are in white. Press goes to the north and returns with a wife (Margaret Lindsay). Julie sets out to win him back, with a bad result.<br /><br />"Jezebel" has many similarities to "Gone with the Wind" - the south, the red dress, the manipulative, strong young woman, her obsession with a man and the disapproval by the family of her actions. The period is the 1850s; the place is Louisiana, where there is an outbreak of the dreaded yellow fever.<br /><br />Although the film is similar to "GWTW" it stands on its own. It doesn't have the sweeping scope of GWTW. It's the story of one woman's love for a man and the effect it has on those around her. There are some striking scenes: the dance sequence, when Press and Julia are the only ones on the dance floor due to her being in red; and the end is very striking.<br /><br />Bette Davis is great in the title role. Under William Wyler's direction, it's a restrained performance. It's a good thing because she's appearing opposite the master of underplaying, Henry Fonda. All of the women look stunning in their gowns, Davis in particular. As with Scarlett and Ashley, we don't really know what the attraction is between Julia and Press, and the script doesn't tell us. Fonda seems a little on the dull side for a lively girl like Julia.<br /><br />Donald Crisp turns in a powerful performance as Dr. Livingstone, and George Brent is very good as the elegant Buck Cantrell.<br /><br />Highly recommended. One of Davis' best.
