Father Angel is a priest and a professor at a small university in Spain, and he's discovered that the Antichrist will be born in Madrid on December 25th so he's off to Madrid to commit all the sin he can to get as close to the un-blessed event as possible, to prevent it. Along the way he manages to pick up a a couple of cohorts, one being a rather dim-witted metal-head who works at a record store, the other being a TV talk show host that pretends to predict the future. Now, Father Angel is sincere in his quest but he also seems a bit naive and sees signs that are perhaps other than he thinks they are, but somehow, with his partners along, despite all the bumbling, it certainly does seem like he's on to something. A summoning is done, using available things like white bread instead of hosts and LSD instead of the preferred mushrooms, and a rather hurried search for virgin's blood also ensues. Meanwhile there's also a gang of creeps out to "Clean Up Madrid" by burning bums and all kinds of other festive goings-on. Of course, despite all his bumbling, Father Angel is perhaps correct, but it's a break-neck race to the finish to find the correct location of the birth and plot side-lines and the main story all collide at once to make a rather spectacular ending and then a rather quiet epilogue. This is at times quite hilarious in a dark comedic way, and Santiago Segura is great as the dim-bulb metal-head. If you're a fan of De La Iglesia and you haven't seen this, please get your mitts on it. Unfortunately it's not available in NTSC Region 1 (or 0) format at this time but given that most of his other stuff is, one can only hope for a decent release sometime soon. 9 out of 10.
