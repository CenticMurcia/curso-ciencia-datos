I think that this film is one of the most over-rated films of all time. I would rate it below average - extra points go to the originality and art. I feel that the film lacks coherence, and I had a difficult time actually being interested throughout the film. I am not entirely sure what Kubrick was trying to achieve here, but in my personal opinion, I think this film was over-rated. I think the reason why it is so popular is that it questions life, and it focuses on taboo topics. There's the element of "shock value" and the fact that no one else would have dared to make a film like this.<br /><br />Overall, I have seen much better films and I don't know what all the hype is about.
