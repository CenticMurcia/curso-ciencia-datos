I didn't have to watch very much of this film to see that 70's erotica is just as bad as modern erotica. In fact, this is probably a little worse. Quite simply, this is a dull movie, and no matter how many sex scenes took place, I remained terribly bored throughout. But as dull as the sex was, the dialogue was even worse. I had low expectations for this film, and yet, it was somehow worse than I had expected.
