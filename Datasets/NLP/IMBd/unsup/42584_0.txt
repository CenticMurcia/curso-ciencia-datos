If you're a big fan of neo-satanism, are a satanist, or are fond of muddled thinking in general this is the movie for you. Filled with references glorifying evil, and an annoying soundtrack it's sure to rub hundreds the wrong way. Please don't not voluntarily view this movie. If you have time to kill find another way of burning a few hundred minutes. You might have more fun watching paint dry, or you might delight in watching the grass grow. Hey there's always stargazing, or helping the elderly cross the street. If you like killing this you should seek the same kind of attention as you should if you enjoyed watching this horrifically poor movie.
