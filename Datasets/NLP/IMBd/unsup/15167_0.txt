Just like the first movie under this name that was made,"EATING OUT" this is merely a sequel to the kind of insipid superficial gay movie that gives the gay community a bad name. The total polar opposite of first class writing/directing. If you like all the superficial and unrefined elements of a culture, then this is for you. If you are looking for something more sophisticated and that even attempts to approximate 'art', then look elsewhere. Real Insipid, superficial gay junk movie. Not worth the time or money. I can never understand how this kind of stuff can get made or where these writers or directors heads are when they think this stuff up. It is really the type of movie that has become the bane of existence of the gay community.
