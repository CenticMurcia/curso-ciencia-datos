Marisa and Regina turn is great performances and the the writing itself makes this movie a winner. I was also impressed with Arials direction. <br /><br />This movie is more of a Psycho thriller then a Hooror movie and I cant wait to see what Blue Omega has lined up in the future.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone You will not be disappointed as it is a very good production and overall I give this Movie a 10 considering the budget was not that much and to pull off a masterpiece like this show you what good writing and directing can do for a film like this.<br /><br />I cant say enough about how wild and mind teasing it truly is. I have already bought copies for all my family and friends.
