I'd like to begin by saying that I am one of those people who truly enjoy the recent influx of adult-humoured Disney/Pixar projects like Finding Nemo, Shrek and Monsters Inc. as opposed to traditionalists who prefer Disney to get back to its old classical way of storytelling with damsels in distress and fairytale villains in castles. No not me, I like the new films better because they cater to a wider audience, are satiric, and they demand more intelligence from the viewer because archetypes (like heroes, villains) are not as defined.<br /><br />I thought my endless affection for these modern kinds of animation would mean I would enjoy Chicken Little (2005) - but I was clearly wrong, because this is a barely competent Disney film with very few laughs. Plotwise, I don't mean to be a nitpick but it generally helps if your script makes a tiny bit of logical sense. Imagine you take a shotgun, load it chock-full of story lines and events and fire into a random mess. That is the story of Chicken Little and this chaotic writing makes itself known through every puzzling detour the film takes.<br /><br />The only thing you need to know is that Chicken Little (voiced by funnyman Zach Braff) is someone who people don't take seriously because of his size. He therefore spends the film trying to reaffirm himself and restore his ridiculed reputation. There's also an alien invasion taking place which proves to be a perfect opportunity for the latter. This invasion is a blatant War of the Worls homage and although I hated the film, I appreciate references. Keep a look out, because there are also Finding Nemo (lawn-mower) and Signs (corn crop-circles) references. <br /><br />Some other decent parts to Chicken Little are the dodgeball scene in the beginning of the film and Chicken's fish-friend whose head is enclosed in a bowl-helmet. He is simply called "Fish" and is so endearing that he temporarily elevates the whole film above generic unfunny formula. But the good aspects end here, because the rest is an unfunny overcooked mess. Even the slightest pause for serious situations and dialogue are interrupted by some cheesy pratfall, pee- or fart joke. I'm serious, these cheap-shots are present throughout.<br /><br />The success of Chicken Little was certainly not what Disney had hoped for, nor the funny entertainment I had expected. A pity, because I am the biggest Zach Braff fan there is - I think he is pretty much as funny as you can get, but here he is wasted on a silly overcooked little chicken.<br /><br />4/10
