This show is excellent !!!! I am Greek living in Geneva, Switzerland and everyday, I get together with my Greek and Turkish friends and we are watching it, while drinking a glass of ouzo or raki. We are having so much fun, we have so many things in common ! Congratulations for the show, maybe it will come out on DVD one day, i ll buy it certainly. I hope that maybe there will be enough inspiration or imagination to make a second season. I also hope that the Greek producers will make also a comedy on the subject and not always the drama stories that they usually do. And by the way I find that Nehir is extremely beautiful, my Turkish friends prefer Natalia though. Iyi gunler neighbors !
