I had never seen the Ritz brothers before. If I don't see them again, it will be too soon. Unlike other comedy trios (whom they rob constantly), these guys just don't do anything for me. The problem with this film (and there are many problems, believe me) is that it is set up as a serious film. There are people threatened and people murdered. Throughout the entire thing, one keeps thinking, "Why would anyone hire these guys if their life was at stake." We find out later, but if one took the film seriously, it still would make no sense. There's the usual running in and out of secret passages. "The Gorilla" is not a gorilla, but there is a gorilla. What was the fascination with gorillas in this time period. Maybe there was a closeout on fur coats at Macy's. Anyway, there's hysteria (or historia as one character pronounces it) everywhere. There's the housekeeper who runs through the house howling at everything she sees. Then there is poor Bela Lugosi. He just keeps popping up. The poor man was so badly typecast that he ended up being a comic figure over and over. How sad. The movie ends with this multi-layer conclusion that would take a program to figure out. I have seen this movie listed in film guides my whole life--now I have finally seen it. Good for me.
