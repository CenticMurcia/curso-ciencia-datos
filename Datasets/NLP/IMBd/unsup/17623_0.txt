John and Mike captured it perfectly. I spent hours at the Massachusetts statehouse over the years this battle has been going on, and watching the film brings me right back there--the songs, the instant friends that were made, the love of the supporters---it's still raw and they capture it on film. At the same time they capture the real hate and ignorance which was on the other side of the street from us.<br /><br />The film's value is in it's message of equality and making life better for all citizens. While it's the story of activism, passion, and politics at work---things which are applicable in any state in the country. I hope John and Mike can find a distributor to get the film into the hands of people who can be impacted by its beautiful message---and now that the epilogue will be more grand than the last time I viewed it, I can't wait to see it again!
