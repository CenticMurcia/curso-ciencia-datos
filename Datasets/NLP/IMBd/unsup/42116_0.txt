George Orr (Lukas Haas) tells his psychologist (James Caan) that he once lost someone special. The psychologist immediately refers to the "someone special" as a she. George asks, "How do you know it's a she?" Psychologist: "Because you're a he." The psychologist has never heard of same-sex relationships? Or have all the gay people been killed? George hasn't even indicated that it was a romantic relationship, so evidently the producers of this movie don't even believe in the existence of same-sex friendships! Even if you hate gay people, that's quite an extreme. <br /><br />The rest of the movie is horrible heterosexist garbage with Lisa Bonet and Lucas Haas staring longingly at each other, and then lying in bed congratulating each other for being heterosexual.
