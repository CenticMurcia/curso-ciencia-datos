To watch this film and enjoy it you either have to enjoy the skating shows put on, the disco music, or fancy one of the cast.<br /><br />I watched this film and enjoyed it. I suppose I fancied Linda Blair in it, but other than that the only reason I liked it was because it was simple fun, not to be taken seriously. It's easy on the eyes, and easy on the eyes. Eye candy, if you will. :-)
