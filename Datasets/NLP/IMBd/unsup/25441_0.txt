This has to be one of the sloppiest, most slapstick, dramatic, idiotic movies i have ever been subjected to witness. Not only is the main character sloppy and poorly thought out, but they could not have picked a worse actor to play the character. I've seen so much better. If this director wanted to put comedy, major drama, and racial issues into a movie along with music videos to boot, he should have thought this project out more seriously. god help anyone for sitting through this movie. i am ashamed of myself for being bored at 3 am, and angry with HBO for even airing this stink. There are way too many plot lines within this movie. they should have stuck to a genre, developed the characters with a lot more thought, and...lose the music videos...half of the movie doesn't even make sense because of it. I have to say, i have seen some bad movies, but this might be the worst one. i have never been to Iowa, but i can assume that this is an overly dramatic way to portray life. i would never watch this again. save yourselves from watching it as well.
