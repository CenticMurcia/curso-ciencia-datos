This one of the best effort took by Maniratnam who has highlighted the potential of the Tamil film makers.It's a movie reflected Hindu_Muslim conflict through a strong screenplay. Maniratnam's thought was supported by high technical assistance and the superb music by A.R.Rahman.This film shows how a tragedy arise from a single event made living in such a large city a risk full attempt.Aravinthswamy,Manisha and the two little kids expressed the feelings in a more realistic way. I think the director has been successful to leave the people who watched the movie with a feeling that everyone born just to enjoy every moment they live, not to waste it through horrible hatred feelings.It leaves a message that "HARMONY IS WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS".
