This traditional R rated horror struck a chord with me. After a ton of lame remakes last year, Amityville Horror and Fog, to name a few, you have to scratch your head at decisions being made by the 'suits' in Hollywood. This should not have gone into DVD release without a big screen showing. This is a horror film, the real genre. Not torture. Not watered-down PG-13 crap on a stick.<br /><br />The werewolf genre is so much fun and we have seen so many new interpretations over the years. The schtick of the werewolf lies in not knowing who it is. In this case, you pretty much know from the get-go. The fun lies in how they're going to catch and kill it.<br /><br />The sexy side of Horror has been pushed aside in recent years for torment. Eli Roth can go suck an egg. Tension, shock and screams make a story chilling, and though this movie has its fair share of goopy-gore, it does not dominate the movie. Kinky sex, nudity, lust and some humor along with side-splitting bestiality is what the film is about. This film was made for adults -- not pre-teen, tweens or couch potato sixteen year old boys.<br /><br />Fun! Fun! Fun!<br /><br />Kimberly J. Brown has grown from her Disney efforts into a fine actress, and Trevor Duke does justice to his role. Richard Tyson's delivery of his funnier lines is a hoot. As a bad boy he blends macho sexiness with a sarcastic tone. A real horror film is hard to find these days! So when gems like this come your way, go out of your way to find them.
