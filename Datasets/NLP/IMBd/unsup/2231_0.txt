First time I watched this file was 20 Jan 2006. ( 52 years later - better late than never - smiling) I enjoyed the director's excellent mix of character complexities, the early 1950s icons of cars, dress, and innocent patriotism, the references to post-traumatic syndrome of World War II G.I.'s, and small town reluctance in cooperating with federal authority. Frank Sinatra was excellent in his role as John Baron, a ruthless and psychotic yet street smart hired assassin. Sheriff Shaw, the injured hostage of John Baron, bravely harassed John Baron of past president assassin's failures of escape. John Baron showed keen insight into the past assassin's failure of escape; he made up in his mind he was going to be an exception to the rule. I enjoyed every minute of this drama.
