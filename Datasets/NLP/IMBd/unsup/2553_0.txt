The film starts beautifully with a montage of old pictures and film of the childhood of the characters coinciding with a song by Bill Callahan that really fits the mood of the beginning scene.<br /><br />Paddy plays an incredible cool headed ex-military freak that would stall anyone in their shoes. Great images of terror when he arrives to vandalise in a gas mask.<br /><br />The drug scenes are well done (coming from experience)and the hatred and cruelty in this film are well portrayed. The characters really make you hate them, and you feel good about the revenge that is taken upon them.<br /><br />The revenge plot of the film is a bit heavy sided until you come to understand the actual events of the past through the 8mm black and white scenes ...<br /><br />Great British film. I recommend it highly if you aren't too squeamish about violence.
