This is a movie I switched onto by accident,and then really enjoyed it.OK so the storyline was predictable and provided an excuse for the viewers to feel sad and shed a few tears.It is one of those movies that has no violence or sex and can be enjoyed by the whole family.Maybe I am too sentimental but I gave it 9/10.
