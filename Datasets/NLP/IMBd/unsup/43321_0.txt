Vamps: Deadly Dream Girls (1998?) was a complete waste of film. We normally can get through even the worst of movies but had to put this one on the shelf. We tried on two separate occasions to watch this garbage and failed. It borders between soft-porn and the worst episode of "Full House." This flick has everything, bad acting, bad dialogue and even bad editing. The script could've been made into a watchable movie but sadly these people failed. This nugget is offered by Independent Edge Releasing and we're sure that all of their titles couldn't be this bad. It runs 90 minutes and is unrated. Well worth the watch if you like this kind of "brain-candy" otherwise, stay as far away from this offering as the black plague. This opinion seems to be the minority amongst the underground circuit
