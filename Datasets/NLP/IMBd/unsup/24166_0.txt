Even though this film is EXTREMELY different from the charming book by Dick King Smith, it manages not to insult it (Unlike films such as "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" and "The Jungle Book"). <br /><br />The highlights of this beautiful partly-animated film are: well-developed and interesting characters, good amusing moments and very good acting. Also, the part of the film where the water horse is in the bath is a good point in its own right. The Scottish theme of the film, represented in the setting and the nationality of the main characters, does a good job of interpreting Scotland. The emotion that appears later in the film is yet another good addition to this motion picture, though it may very much upset others.<br /><br />Of course, this film has some flaws too. There are quite a lot of sudden thrills which will not entertain some people, as they are (to put it plainly) scary. Most of the plot and the World War II theme is rather unnecessary, especially as it was not included in the book. It is just one another of those things "that make the film exciting and if we don't put it in the film will be boring". One addition of the film that is not too bothersome is that the water horse is not very cute at all when he is "fully grown".<br /><br />In Scotland, in World War II, a boy goes to a beach by Loch Ness and finds what looks like a stone. He takes it home and finds it is more than just a stone covered in seaweed. It shines like a rainbow and it is quite large. The boy leaves it for a while and when he comes back to it, the "stone" is broken and a strange creature has hatched out...<br /><br />Recommended to people who like the Loch Ness Monster and to people who just like good children's films, enjoy "The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep"! :-)
