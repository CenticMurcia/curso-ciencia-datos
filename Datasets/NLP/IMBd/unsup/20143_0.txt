Nickelodeon has a lot of great shows (which they tend to cancel for no apparent reason) like Hey Arnold, As Told By Ginger, SpongeBob, Danny Phantom, Kappa Mikey, but sadly this one just isn't up to par.<br /><br />I first saw the show in 2001 and even back then, as a kid, I disliked it.<br /><br />The show definitely has what it takes to be a hit: big adventures, girl who can talk with animals, plenty of different characters, yet it keeps throwing sticks in it's spokes.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems and what really kills this show is character development. Whenever a character develops in an episode, all the progress is forgotten once you get to the next one. Eliza gives bird a needle so it could gather insects more efficiently, thus unleashing a domino effect which quickly harms the environment. So, she realizes that she shouldn't go about doing things without thinking of consequences. Lesson learned. No. She proceeds to do something stupid again after that, completely ignoring what she has learned. Also, she's completely arrogant and probably more than half of the situations she gets into wouldn't even occur if the little brat would have bothered to let the person/animal complete their sentence! This point alone makes the show extremely unbearable.<br /><br />Debbie goes through the show as the big, mean and selfish sister. She get's a job in Siberia and learns about being kind to others. But seems to develop amnesia as she returns to her usual whiny-self in the next episode.<br /><br />End of rant. Also, I would like to add that the person responsible for "Rocket Power" should be fired.
