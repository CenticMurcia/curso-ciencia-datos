This remake of a movie is funny! Steve and Goldie are a great on screen couple! They bounce off each other with their comedic timings. The antics that come about are hysterical! I love the car scene with the map - that could happen to anyone and I fear that it would happen to me one day if I rent a car like that! Let's not forget John Cleese! LOVE him! He is quite the "gay" man in this film - what an uproar he makes!!! His scene in the guest room with the fur coat and the high heals - makes you wonder how long it took him to learn how to walk let alone dance. This movie is a GREAT remake. I thought the first one was a little strained but this version is RIGHT ON THE MONEY!
