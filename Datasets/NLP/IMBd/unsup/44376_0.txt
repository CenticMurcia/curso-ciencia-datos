What can i say. There is nothing watchable about this one. Just don't waste your time or money. I mean i can understand that u don't have any money for a decent movie but this ain't even a movie. No story, no acting, no visual effects, no sound effects, no acting, nothing at all. It starts with some alien background, then it just moves to action. I can't even say that you are going to see some good karate moves in it. I might be harsh about this movie. Because i just saw it and i can't believe i spent 90 minutes for this. Yeah the movie is 90 minutes but there is nothing in it. What i recommend to you is never watch a movie without reading at least a couple comments about it at IMDb.com .
