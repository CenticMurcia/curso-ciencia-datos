The Tall Man returns with the original Phantasm cast for Phantasm IV: Oblivion. The fourth and supposedly final chapter in the Phantasm series takes off were Lord Of The Dead (Phantasm III) left off. In this one Reggie continues after Mike as Mike learns about The Tall Man's history. The kid from part 3 who knew everything about guns and fighting is dropped and Rocky who left in the car at the end of part 3 is also out of the picture. This leaves Reggie alone in search of Mike. As the Tall Man's history unfolds in a series of scene's from the original Phantasm, a majority of these scene's were cut from the original release of Phantasm and are being scene for the first time, other scene's are just scene's created specifically for this film. We learn about the Tall Man's history and even what his name is. In the end Reggie and Mike meet up for an unusual ending which leaves the viewer to figure out the rest. The first time I watched this I hated it, the second time I loved it, I don't know why, and now every time I watch it I love it, I guess the first time I just didn't like it. Phantasm 2012 A.D. is a possible release for yet another Phantasm film. ***1/2 out of **** it is a great film for die-hard fans like me, but on the other hand if your just sitting down to watch this you may be extremely confused. Thumbs up again to all the actors who have done an extremely well job with the acting in the series and hopefully will continue to do so in other movies or in the next Phantasm movie. Angus Scrimm did an amazing job playing 2 characters (a "nice tall man" and an "evil tall man"). Make sure you've seen the other 3 before this one, it should help a lot.
