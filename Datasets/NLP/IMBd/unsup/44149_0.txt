This movie misses it's mark in every way. It's tough to tell exactly what this creature is supposed to be. There apparently are no real rules governing it's behavior, as it comes out day or night with no aversion to light which makes you wonder why the characters feel so secure trampsing around during the day. It doesn't like rain but it doesn't hurt it and the creature runs around in it during the movie. Now to the two largest gaffs This creature is strong enough to rip out an engine and overturn a jeep as well as capable of pushing over the Ranger's tower but it cannot move the rocks in front of it's cave, and during one pivotal scene an expert on the monster gives the heroine a book of legends concerning our beast (which incidentally is never referenced again) saying it took shaman 500 years to bury the evil in his cave, must just be because they couldn't catch him home because all that was needed was a baby gate in front of the entrance and he was screwed. Lastly for those of us who also have seen Cabin Fever I'm sure a lot of the draw of this movie was Cerina Vincent. This movie butchers it's only selling point when during the "love scene" the wholly untalented miss Vincent stays covered, unlike in Cabin Fever when she is involved in multiple raunchy scenes. Ah, big stars and no nudity clauses, a shame movie might be worth ten bucks now it's a coaster.
