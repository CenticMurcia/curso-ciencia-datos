The weirdest thing about this very weird film is how naturally it all unfolds on screen. Silliness become sensible and madness maybe not so mad. First, the set design and use of colour is as you have never seen before, lots of primary colours and wild, child like shapes and patterns, bit like a gingerbread house lit with neon. This crazy unreal colour scheme should alienate but instead like some drug pulls you in. Second, the soundtrack is inspired, not knowing enough about the current music scene I don't know whether these were original tracks or inspired retreads but it works a treat. When the family sing along in the car, to the obscene heavy metal track I am open mouthed. Third, the acting, in virtually surreal situations is perfect, Vinnie Jones is a bit of an exception but I think we have to assume that him performing a clich√© of himself and being so rude is a joke itself to the Japanese. I have never and you will have never seen a film like this before and I smiled happily through most of it. Just once or twice where I was wondering just what was happening and the silliness was to the fore I began to wonder whether it was worth the effort but then the fun begins again and the seriousness simmers. It may not prove to be the best film you have ever seen but you really have to see it once, twice or three times.
