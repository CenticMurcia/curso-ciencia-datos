This is a truly terrible film, that frankly doesn't need to exist. The basic premise was reasonably interesting, being set in Britain and about a normal guy, after some sort of nuclear war. Unfortuneatly the entire thing devolves into a putrid mess of clich√©, and a teddy bear that acts everyone else in this pile of drek off the screen. Teds performance is a tour de force compared to all the human actors. I don't want my money back, so much as I would rather pay more money to ensure no one involved in this project ever worked in film again. Quite frankly, insulting. If I had my way, Every copy of this film would be melted down and the plastic used to do something useful, though the aura of fail surrounding the film would doubtless taint whatever product was made with it, possibly compelling all within a hundred feet to use stilted dialogue and be utterly unconvincing-I was very aware I was watching a film at all times, and an awful film at that. I can only hope my words can express even a fraction of the horror that is watching this. Though you may get a giggle out of Ted.
