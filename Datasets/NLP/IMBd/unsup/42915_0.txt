Now I wasn't going into this film expecting something great (like the original starship troopers) and I wasn't expecting something completely garbage (like starship troopers 2); so my feelings were neutral (best when watching a movie for the first time). After the movie It's safe to say that my feelings on it remained neutral, nothing was over the top good, or over the top bad.<br /><br />Now to discuss the movie.<br /><br />The storyline was nothing great, basic, unoriginal, and at times boring. To have a universe such as the one of starship troopers, and not to be able to come up with a better story is disappointing. <br /><br />Acting was regular (I've seen worse, I've seen better), another let-down was that they didn't include some of the other characters from the original starship troopers.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the original starship troopers only for its fast-paced action scenes (which is a good amount of the movie), then you might not like this one. That is to say that not much action occurs through this movie, more talking if anything. The fight/action scenes that do occur throughout the film (2 in total, I believe) are very basic, not very fast-paced, and altogether very mediocre.<br /><br />It's obvious that there was a lower budget on this movie, what I like is that they worked on it and still made it watchable (only if it is average) even on such a budget.<br /><br />As for CGI in the movie, all I had to say was "WHAT?!?!? HUH?!?!". How could CGI be worse than that of a movie created in 1997? I mean, its been 10 years, how could CGI have gotten WORSE in that time?? Well, I have no answers (apart from lack of budget) but it did, the bugs in this movie looked nothing compared to the bugs in the original starship troopers (which was created in 1997). Very bad outcome, especially because a lot of people were to watch this to see the conflict between the bugs and the humans when bugs were only present for around 5 to 10 minutes of the film.<br /><br />In closing, if you'd like to see an EPIC war Sci-fi movie, watch the original starship troopers. Then if you have NOTHING better to do, and you MUST see this film, watch it (dont buy it, best to rent). If you don't watch it, it wont be a loss as this story has nothing to do with starship troopers 1 (apart from the war, however there are no other consistencies).<br /><br />Notice I haven't even mention starship troopers 2 a lot throughout this review, its because it isn't anything in comparison to the original starship troopers (even to this one), and should be AVOIDED.<br /><br />Overall, Good name and franchise, average movie. (Below average if comparing to the original)<br /><br />4/10
