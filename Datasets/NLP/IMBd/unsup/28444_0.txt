there are few zombie films that are very well ... good.<br /><br />i mean i love zombies...in fact (as my friends say) i am obsessed with them. yes its sad to say i agree ... any way i read the synopsis of death valley and thought what the hell it sounded fine. so you know i stayed up to watch it and i have to say i was right to.<br /><br />i thought the acting was pretty cool. the opening scene is a great way to introduce the film, its not confusing (until you've watched the whole scene that is) and the film has the same sort of premise from there on.<br /><br />as i have mentioned the ending is great... it isn't very believable ... at all. why would bloody bill believe that gwen was his sister and the fact that they look XACTLY like each other isn't very plausible either, and it would have been nice to find out what happened to gwen after she left death valley.<br /><br />i hope their isn't a sequel as zombie sequels are never good apart from resident evil of course.<br /><br />all in all, apart from the disappointing ending, death valley is a great film and definitely worth a watch if your like me and love zombie flick
