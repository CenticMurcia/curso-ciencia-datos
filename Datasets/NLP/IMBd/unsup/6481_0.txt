Time of your life a series that stopped airing on the Fox network in 2000 was a show I really enjoyed and thought that it was going to run for at least one more season, but I guess the network thought otherwise, maybe its ratings wasn't high enough I am no sure. I was just a fan of it and watched it every Wednesday on fox for that whole year until they cut it. There were 19 episodes that were done, and was a unique series. I sure do hope they put it on DVD if there is high demand for it. Not that Jennifer Love would go back into it anyways, I mean she is a big movie star now. I am sure if she was interviewed about the show she would say that it was a good show and she enjoyed working on it and what party of five was the time of her life. This show was awesome.
