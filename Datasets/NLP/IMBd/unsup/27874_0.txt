I don't understand why so many (anonymous!) has written that this is a bad movie. Not since "Olsenbanden ser rødt" have a Danish comedy been so funny. But this is a completely different type of humor. All the characters are funny in their own way. Niels Olsen (Niller) who is comparing everything with his kitchen installation. Paprika Steen (Stella) with her fixation on her married name. Sofie Gråbøl (Mulle) constantly reminding us that she has been studying seven years on psychology, and never finishing a sentence. Obviously she needs a shrink herself. But the most funny guy is Lars Kaalund (Knud). He has so many one liners, that are right in the bulls eye. Especially the one over the shrink question theme: "If you were a car, which one would it be." Finally I mustn't forget Sidse Babett Knudsen (Sus). She both plays and looks wonderful. She and Niller fits very nice together.<br /><br />All the fun fits perfectly into this sweat little story, so don't bother to read all these negative comments. Go see it yourself and have a good laugh.
