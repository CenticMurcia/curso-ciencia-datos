Do you love Music? Or Do you love Western? Or Do you love Space fiction? If you love one of these, you will love Cowboy Bebop.<br /><br />This is what an anime fan could get after a month worth of prayers. Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed and Ein (Data Dog) are the lead characters. Its about a group of Bounty hunters looking for money, they *almost* succeed in catching the big fishes but never get the money that they deserve. Spike appears to be the central character with a troubled past who joins hand with Jet, a veteran ISSP Cop. Other characters join in over time. Everyone acts on his own and no one expects others to help them in the acts.<br /><br />There are some episodes that got little to do with the main story but then there are some where the main story eats up even the opening theme. Its a high action and drama anime, Highly recommended for everyone ( including people who quite never loved the "past" and "memory" based anime )<br /><br />Buy it. Rent it, only if you can't buy it!<br /><br />For me the movie also turned out to be above expectations. I would rate that little above the series.
