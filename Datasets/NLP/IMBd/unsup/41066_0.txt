A simply bad movie. A better plot would have been a movie of a person being forced to watch White Noise 2: The Light. How did this travesty make theaters? This movie defines "jump" scares. Typical suspenseful music to get the audience riled up, stop the music, ghost jumps out at you. Hardly scary, more of an attack on the senses than anything substantial. Anyway just put a bunch of these types of scenes together and you've got White Noise 2.<br /><br />It felt as is the movie was made for the most dense audience in the world. Phrases like THE DEVIL'S NUMBER and the use of 666 were blatant throughout. Upside-down crosses? Check. Collection of newspaper articles and diaries in order to explain the story to the audience? Check. Spoon-fed plot that leaves no room for imagination? Double check.<br /><br />The only thing that was decent in this movie was Nathan Fillion's acting. However, even that was visibly stymied by the horrible script and story. Even if this movie had been cast with the greatest actors of our time it would still not be worth watching.<br /><br />What's worse is that all the good comments here on IMDb had me go in hopeful for a change from the first White Noise. I was disappointed. Do not waste your money on this. This film has absolutely no redeemable qualities.
