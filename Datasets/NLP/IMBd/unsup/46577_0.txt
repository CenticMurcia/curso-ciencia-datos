I have never seen a worst movie. We read a review of this, my boyfriend and I, on Somethingawful.com, and laughed so hard.<br /><br />But NOTHING could prepare us! You will NEVER find a more incoherent, absurd, stupid, and mind-numbing movie than this one! Our friend picked it up at a video store, and gave it to us after he watched it. It was like having a root canal for the whole movie, but we sat through it and gave it all we had.<br /><br />We have seen the worst mankind has to offer. The plot makes no sense. It's fragmented and is incoherent at BEST. Though the fake 'D&D' sessions make any real gamer laugh, there's nothing to laugh at in this movie.<br /><br />AvP looks like Hamlet compared to this piece of filth.
