What is it that people think are so funny about nuns? I don't care who is playing the part and why nuns can't in my view be seen as funny. Now ina serious drama like Doubt I can see but not a comedy. Whoopi Goldberg,although a good actress and is funny, is dull in this film as a woman who is again asked to don the nun's drab to teach choir to a bunch ofmis-fit run of the mill clichéd kids at a Catholic school. Clichéd I mean we have seen these types of characters before in other films. For example, The gifted student who doubts himself, the shy kid who can really sign, the white kid who acts like he from the hood, the parent who does not want his/her kid TO perform till they arrive late and see their child performing and change their mind and the run down old school they all belong too.....YAWN!! Oh yeah and the old run down school was also about to be closed till it was saved. Sound familiar?
