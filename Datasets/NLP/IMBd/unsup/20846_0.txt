Little Britain is a hilarious British Comedy that stars Matt Lucas and David Walliams that play several characters each. This has made me laugh in many ways such as Marjorie Dawes (Fat Fighters), Carol "Computer Says No" Beer, Judy and Maggie, Mr Mann, "Bubbles" De Vere etc. <br /><br />Most of it gives me a laugh although it gets repetitive and predictable after a while and it's not so funny. Always watch a couple of episodes at once because of that reason Ignoring that it is a typical British comedy that will lighten you up when you are feeling down. Great show and very funny. 4.5/5
