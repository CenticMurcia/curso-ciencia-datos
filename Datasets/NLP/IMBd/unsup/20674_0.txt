Let me start by saying this is a really, really bad movie. How bad you might ask? Bad enough that the only positive reviews the films got were from the stunt coordinator - and his team. Come on guys you can't go on about how great your movie is while pretending to by just some unbiased fans - that's absolutely pathetic. One of them even had the nerve to compliment the stunt team and say he can't wait to see what they do next - wow! Who's going to write the next rave reviews, the director or producer, or is it going to be left to the caterer staff and grip departments to save the day. Kind of makes you wonder about any future positive reviews doesn't it. <br /><br />CORRECTION - SINCE WRITING THIS REVIEW MOST OF THE CREW PULLED THEIR "UNBIASED" REVIEWS/THE REMAINING ONES JUST CHANGED THEIR IMDb NAMES. ABOUT TIME GUYS!<br /><br />All I've heard from the few defending crew and cast members is that the movie was low budget, shot for around a 100k. Come on that's not going to cut it. We've all seen much better films done for much less. Bas Rutten and Diana Inosanto - run for your live, these kind of films will be the death of your career. The producers and directors of this flick have a lot to own up for, all these crew members, and actors worked their collective tails off for this pile of garbage and for what - nothing, it was a huge waste of their time. This movie was an absolute joke -Terrible, EDITING, DIRECTING, WRITING AND YES IN MOST CASES ACTING. Everything these other negative / genuine reviewers have written is right on the mark - this movie is absolutely pathetic!!!!
