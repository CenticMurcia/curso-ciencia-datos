There are French directors who dare:Fran√ßois Ozon is one of them ,and even when he pushes his art to extreme limits (les amants criminels),both his screenplay ,his directing and his mastery remain powerful.<br /><br />This poor thing has a ghost of a screenplay,and features some of the worst performances that can be seen in a contemporary French movie:to say that the actors overplay would be an euphemism: you should (but you must not if you are wise enough to spare you this turkey)see them scream,grimace (with pain) and look "deep" .Also handicapped by frequent use of a little girl's voice over .Ugly pictures,absurd editing,obscure motives of the characters.<br /><br />HORRIBLE.
