This film is among the worst I've seen in ages--not because it's bad, but just because... well, there's no one to care about. Don't get me wrong--I'm not one of those people who needs likable characters (my favorite American films include Five Easy Pieces and Carnal Knowledge-- movies filled with despicable people), but I do require something or at least someone interesting. This film has neither.<br /><br />There are a few performances which kept me from giving it one star--namely Kim Bassinger and Winona Ryder, both who seem to be getting better at acting as they mature, and someone who I kept thinking was doing a *great* imitation of Brad Renfro. Ha! (I thought this was made after Renfro died.)<br /><br />There's really no reason to see this film. Never has a movie with kidnapping, murder, cocaine, bisexual threesomes, and a rock band--with LA/Hollywood in the 80s as a backdrop--been so dreadfully boring. If you don't want to take my advice and do plan on seeing the film... well, bring a good book. I don't recommend the one this movie's based on.
