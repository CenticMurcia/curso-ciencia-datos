Yes, while the film is an exact copy off of the 1981 film 'Stripes' with Bill Murray, Ivan Reitman and John Candy, just nowhere near as good, it has some funny moments. Aside of Guttenberg's horrible acting rip-off of Murray's character from Stripes, Police Academy has some funny moments, but after the sequel it just got horrible. I mean what, didn't they make 7-8 films? Then a cartoon show? The funniest thing, is watching part of Police Academy- Mission to Moscow, on the local Spanish channel I get. I didn't understand what they were saying, but that made it even more pathetic!<br /><br /> So even though it's basically a rip-off gone bad of Stripes, Police Academy has SOME funny moments, at least enough for a friday night viewing.
