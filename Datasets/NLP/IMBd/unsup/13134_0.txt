I loved Sharpe's Challenge. As usual Sean Bean made every moment of it worth it. I did however notice some things missing. Sharpie's flogging scars had disappeared and the gunshot wound scar on his chest on the left was gone as well as the scar on his right cheek. Hmm... Other than that little trivial thing this Sharpie is worth the watch and I do watch it over and over and over again. Sean just makes every movie he is in worth watching. His acting ability is so fantastic. I gave him a 10 for this Sharpie film. Older Sharpe is better. If you haven't seen it yet. Please do you will love it. There is a lot of action in it for the guys and a lot of Sean Bean for the ladies. It is also good to see Daragh O'Malley again as Harper. The combination of Bean and O'Malley makes for some comedy in spots.
