Dennis the menace only got 4.7. and that is unacceptable. it deserves at least a 16. but you don't give us that option. and that makes you butt faces. Dennis the menace is wonderful. he has a girlfriend named Polly and she is pretty with glasses. there is a scary man. his name is Christopher and he is in back to the future. the story line is glorious. his name is switch blade Sam and he takes apples from little children. we like the movie Dennis the menace, it is fab-u-loud. thank you. sincerely. with greatest concern<br /><br />Joseph Danaher<br /><br />and Erica Eades
