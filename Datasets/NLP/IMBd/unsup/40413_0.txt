Maybe if I was not younger than most of the cast members who are trying to pass themselves off as teenagers then I would not have had a problem with this film. I didn't buy the hype surrounding 'Jaane Tu ya Jaane Na' (a film of similar persuasion) and thankfully this one was not hyped up (at least not in the part of the world where I reside) so it is easier to just watch the film as a time-passer rather try to figure out why I'm not feeling what other people are feeling. High School Musical, it is clearly NOT.<br /><br />I'm guessing I just don't like films like this that try to to be like 'Grease' (which was acted by people who are older than the age they were claiming but so well written and well acted that it did not matter) and 'West Side Story' just to mention a few.<br /><br />All that aside, Ruslaan Mumtaz (Rohan) is very cute and sort of reminds me of Arjun Rampal. And Hazel Croney should be very grateful that with such a think foreign accent, she was still allowed to dub her own lines for the film. Katrina Kaif should be so lucky.
