This animated offering uses similar elements to Schumacher's then fresh-in-the-memory disaster  Robin, Mr. Freeze, Batgirl  and manages to combine them into a movie that isn't a painfully misconceived travesty. The story is a bit simplistic and falls short of the emotional underpinning of 'Mask of the Phantasm', but the classy design and strong voice cast are in place, and the animation ably mixes the traditional and the CG. The action is really where this movie hits the spot, though. An early chase when Batgirl is abducted is superb, but it's the intense finale  an extended sequence on Freeze's oil rig hideout  that will blow you away. The music pounds, the animation astounds, fire rages all around  it's terrific stuff, really exciting. A comic book corker.
