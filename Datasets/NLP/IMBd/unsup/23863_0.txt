"Le Boucher" (The Butcher) is a story of a young headmistress, Helene, at a school in a small village, who strikes up a relationship with the local butcher, Popaul, who seems to be quite a nice man. Helene has had a bad relationship in the past & is somewhat standoffish, and that makes for somewhat of an awkward relationship with her new friend.<br /><br />There have been a lot of murders in and around this small village lately, and that's causing a big stir among the residents. A murder victim is found by Helene when she has her class on a field trip to some caves. Helene finds an object that seems to be the same one she'd given Popaul days before and immediately becomes quite suspicious of him.<br /><br />This is rather a good thriller and perhaps similar in style to Hitchcock, only a bit nastier. The two leads are great & the tension and suspense are too. An excellent film and well worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
