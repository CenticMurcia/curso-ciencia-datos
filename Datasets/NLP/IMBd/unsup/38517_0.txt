This was not a good film , it wasn't even a good horror film. The first Child's Play has scenes of actual suspense, but this one is more jokey than anything else. Some of the characters do die in fairly novel ways, but Chucky doesn't seem to have the zest that he had in the original. There are some good special effects, especially towards the end of the film, and the puppetry being Chucky was excellent, but it seemed a bit of a waste of time. If they were going to put all this money and effort into making sure the special effects were good, then they really should have made sure they had some kind of storyline, and some reason to make the film. As it stands the film seems cold, with as much inspiration in at as a McDonalds commercial. Stick to the first one only, if you are going to watch any of the Chucky films.
