I watched this movie on Sundance with increasing annoyance at the pomposity & pretentiousness of the characters & their vapid pseudo-"thoughts". The movie seems to be the embodiment of every negative quality Francophobes love to throw (unfairly for the most part) at most French movies.<br /><br />Then I discovered that it was directed by none other than Claude Lelouch, the director of A Man and a Woman, the only movie I ever slept through almost entirely (in the theater). Well, at least he's consistent.
