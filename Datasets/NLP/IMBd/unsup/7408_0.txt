This is honestly a cinematic masterpiece composed from pure sincerity and conviction. Plus Hulk Hogan is totally HOT!! OMG!! At the beginning you think that this will be just another low brow dumb-wit comedy with some dumb pro wrestler, but as the movie progresses we as the privileged audience begin to understand the true themes of the work. There is the social commentary on alienation and xenophobia, the metaphorical commando 'armor' and, my favorite, the deconstruction of the business world we live in. Seriously, this movie is brilliant. Watch it. You won't regret it! Oh and did I mention that Hulk Hogan is a beast of a sexy man? Because he is. A large, sexy, sweaty man. I love him. And ice cream.
