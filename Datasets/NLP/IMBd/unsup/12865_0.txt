It was after a long time that I saw a good hindi action film. I was tired of the chick flicks and heros who threw punches but didn't draw out any blood.<br /><br />It takes some time for Sanjay Dutt to rise to the villains. Except for the mujra songs the films does not go into boring time pass scenes. Fortunately there is no hero-heroine love BS except for a short unnecessary sub-plot of the villains daugher falling in love with a commoner.<br /><br />When the violence finally starts it is good. Sanjay Dutt rises up and plans some good moves to carry out his revenge. Jackie Shroff is fantastic as a completely corrupt police officer. I just love the scene where he puts his lathi (staff) into the bullet wound of one of the villain's son and then twists it before taking it out.<br /><br />See this movie if you are tired of watching Sharukh Khan dance and sing around or of Vivek Oberoi beating up a guy 3 times his size and still not being able to draw blood.
