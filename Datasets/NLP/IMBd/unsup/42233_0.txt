this is an obvious case of kevin smith falling in love w/ his own dialogue and letting his words run wild. while at times the scene is funny, overall it's pretty drawn out and boring and the big 'reveal' at the end isn't all that funny and is basically a cop out to end the scene. kevin smith is a talented guy but not all of his dialogue is fantastic and this is an example of that. the delivery also gets real annoying after awhile. there's a reason these 2 guys never found success outside of smith's movies. i guess if you are a huge fan of smith's and clerks then you cant go wrong but there are tons of other comedic short films out there - most relying on dialgoue - that are a helluva lot funnier than this but never get any recognition.
