Alien Evolution is a documentary-maker's dream. It gives you everything you could possibly want to know about your favorite creature feature franchise.<br /><br />It is a 64.21 minute long inside look into the minds of the writers, giving you the story behind the story. Many critics have dogged this work since its release saying it spent to much time with the writers, when in fact, many millions of fans were clamoring for more back story and conceptual histories of these wonderfully Machiavellian Aliens.<br /><br />There are also interviews with the Producers, special effects departments, actors, directors, and more, more, more.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this comprehensive and inspired Supplement which was Disk 9 of the Alien Quadrilogy Collector's Set.<br /><br />Fantastic.<br /><br />It rates a Documentary Scale 10/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
