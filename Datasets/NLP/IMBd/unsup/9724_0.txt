I'm stunned. I just finished watching this movie, and can't believe 1) how incredible it was; 2) that I knew nothing about this film, and that it is a totally hidden forgotten overlooked minor classic. I thought I knew or had heard of every major or almost-major film from the mid 30s through the 50s, but this came as a shock. There's no point comparing it to White Heat, which is in a class all by itself, for some justifiable memorable moments, notably the finale on the oil tank. But removing that legendary scene from the equation, this film is almost as good, with many scenes that stand out. The casting is flawless, and it has its own specialness, not the least (besides an always-brilliant Cagney), are the two love-interests, both pitch-perfect - Barbara Payton as the corrupted blonde, Helene Carter is the rich spoiled debutante. Notably, the script is devoid of clich√©, often surprising, witty and anachronistically violent following the pathological gangster Cagney on a lawless tear as he breaks out of prison and afterwards. Two scenes, among many, jump out from the norm for their style, as often happened in a Hitchcock film: Payton throwing coffee, sugar, etc at Cagney, during a spat; and Cagney pushing Carter's foot further on the pedal in a duel of power while she drives her sportscar. The movie was complete surprise, and quite wonderful.
