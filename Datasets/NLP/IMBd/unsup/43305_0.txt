'Illegal In Blue' is yet another one of those movies where an idiot with connections to law enforcement repeatedly sleeps with the main suspect who we know will probably turn out to be the killer. Yeah, only in the movies. It's a T&A flick through and through with it's flimsy plot and it's not like the movie box told you otherwise. Speaking of such, don't expect to see a female specimen with large breasts. Yay, another misleading box cover.<br /><br />I admit to liking the occasional T&A flick, but I can't stand the setup they use here and like so many others have before (see: Snapdragon). If nothing else it's tired. The guy is always an idiot who never thinks with his brain and this movie is no different. The cast goes through the motions and the directing is on auto-pilot. I don't recommend this to anyone not even fans of T&A flicks. Do yourself a favor - rent something else, something better.
