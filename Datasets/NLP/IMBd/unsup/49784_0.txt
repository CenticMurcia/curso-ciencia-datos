try doing the whole story for real much was left out of Griffith's life,Many parts missing and credit given where none is due.How do you interview a wife who only stayed for 5 months what did she know? Nothing and a grown man trying to get passed off as an adopted son please give me a break wake up and smell the coffee.Is everyone punch drunk?Get the real story thats worth telling.Much was missing from this mans life his mother was the driving force behind him and the only mention she got was did Griffith remember when she died? Emile was in the hospital for one month ask who was with him every day morning and night?When i hear the whole story then I will rate that story and not until then.
