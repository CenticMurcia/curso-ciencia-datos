What has become of the grandeur of Disney?! This is the worst CGI muck I've seen since the Hulk! I can't imagine what the Disney Corporation was thinking in approving this disgusting display of amateurish CGI animation, except to make a buck. And yet, they went on and released it?! <br /><br />I'm virtually in shock that this movie has received a 7.1 (for now) rating here at IMDb, making it the most over-rated piece of detritus in the Disney vaults. I must say it is THE single worst Disney presentation I've ever seen. I'd come to expect bad animation and horribly neglectful illustrations from Disney sequels, but this was no sequel; it was a feature film!<br /><br />We saw what could be done through CGI with Monsters, Inc., A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, etc. This is more the quality I would have expected at the very beginning of the CGI age, not presently. <br /><br />I was very disappointed with this attempt, and would admonish Disney to do better next time!<br /><br />It rates a 1.3/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
