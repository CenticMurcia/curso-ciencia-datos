Most people will wonder why I'm giving this movie a ten out of ten. It's because it is great for what it is. It's a spoof of the Pang brothers' "Eye" films. The best part is that it's being done by the Pang brothers themselves. It's not often that filmmakers so wantonly make fun of themselves. <br /><br />Many people gave this movie a bad review because they thought it was supposed to be scary movie like the first "Eye" and they didn't realize what was going on. It's got plenty of ghosts and creepiness, but it is not a genuine horror movie. It's a silly version of a horror movie.<br /><br />I say that if you liked the first two movies you should see this one, because you'll probably get a chuckle or two. Also, you should see the first two before watching this one, if you haven't already.
