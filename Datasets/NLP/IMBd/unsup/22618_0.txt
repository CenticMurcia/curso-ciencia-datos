I am not Asian, yet I totally identify with the mail lead. It's uncanny how true to life this film is. It is my belief that most of the American public shuns this film because it is too truthful about emotional isolation and social isolation. This movie extends beyond racial boundaries and displays the universal truth for all to see. Charlotte Sometimes is like looking into a mirror, which shows all your foibles. We can then examine these foibles and learn from them. One can experience something very unique when examining films that analyze basic human behavior. All in all, I give this little gem eight out of ten stars. Please go to your local video store and rent it.
