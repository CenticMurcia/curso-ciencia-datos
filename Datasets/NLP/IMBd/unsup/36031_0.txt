Hey stop stabbing me! (2003) really disappointed me, i was looking forward to this after reading some positive reviews on here but i found it to be lame, unfunny and most of the characters are all ugly talentless geeks.......... it was obviously a bunch of nerdy friends who THOUGHT they could make some sort of funny "Scream/Scary Movie" type film and cash in!!! Well sadly for them and us, this "film" SUCKS bigtime, it must have been made over a weekend, certainly no longer than that. There was no "acting" abilities here folks, and as for a script, well i don't think there was one, seemed like they were just making it up as they went along!! These desperate students got together and made it on a camcorder it would seem!! Basically, the plot is about this college graduate called Herman Schumacher who rents a room with a bunch of weird student types, but weird things start to happen to Herman, his nymph girlfriend seems to be having sex with all the roommates, one of the roommates seems to be a serial killer, a monster (guy in a gorilla suit), seems to be stealing all his clothes...... nothing is going right for Herman!!! To be honest i didn't make it to the end, i was so bored with this, i suggest people stick to "proper" comedy/horror films such as Scream, American Pie, Road Trip, Scary Movie etc etc, give this film a miss if you can ever find it, it's rare for a reason you know............. because it's total CRAP!
