A friend of mine had told me that this was funnier than Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks I admit I was skeptical, as too many so-called comedies from the black and white era don't get much more than a smile from me. My skepticism was rewarded with a very funny, fast-paced comedy with the kind of "crackling" dialogue they don't write anymore. Edward G. Robinson is a scream in the lead, and his supporting cast equals him. Don't miss this one. There's never a dull moment!
