An Oscar nominee for it's brilliant cinematography, and a Golden Globe nominee for Best Foreign Language Film (lost to Les mis√©rables), this film is directed by Zhang Yimou and stars Gong Li. They worked previously on five films: Red Sorghum, Ju Dou, Raise the Red Lantern, The Story of Qui Ju and To Live.<br /><br />14-year old Shuisheng (Wang Xiao Xiao) is brought in from the country to serve the Boss' mistress Bijou (Gong Li), who he can't control.<br /><br />Shuisheng soon finds that she is not a nice person, and he gets back at her when he can.<br /><br />I especially liked the bar scenes where Bijou performed. It had the right mix of beautiful costumes and smokiness.<br /><br />But, this was a gangster picture, so things end badly for some.
