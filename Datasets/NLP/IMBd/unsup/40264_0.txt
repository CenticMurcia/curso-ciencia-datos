Let's get straight to the point, this is low budget horror. So at the end, you've probably got what you asked for; below par acting, below par sets, below par directing and below par anything else that you might want to add. Of course you can come across very good low budget movies, and this certainly doesn't rank as one of the worst I've seen by any stretch of the imagination (see scarecrow or the Pumpkin Karver for that accolade for example), but this could have been so much better. The plot is typical slasher horror fair, with young college students trapped in a building, and the first half hour is quite interesting, setting up the situation. But then the film slows right down, and unfortunately it is very clich√©d and never really sparks. There are also a number of very odd situations created that are plain annoying, and as with so many recent movies the attempted 'twist' is just pants. Certainly if the director had cut 20 or even 30 minutes out of this film it would have been a far more enjoyable fair. As it stands its a passable way to waste an evening if you have nothing better to do, and aren't expecting great cinema, but there are far better slasher movies out there.
