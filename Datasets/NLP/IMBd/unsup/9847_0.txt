In St. John College, the freshmen and best friends Luke (Corey Sevier) and Roger (Elias Toufexis) meet the sexy blond cousins Lilly (Stefanie von Pfetten) and Constance (Kim Poirier) in the laundry of their building. They are next-door neighbors, and the experienced girls invite the young men to visit them anytime. Lilly forgets a package of coins in the laundry, and Luke goes to their room to return it. The room is empty, and he sneaks around, when the two girls arrive. Luke hides himself in the wardrobe, and through an opening, he sees Lilly with many tentacles on her breast. Luke tries to convince his friends that the girls are aliens, planning to attack Earth, but nobody believes in him. Meanwhile, some friends of them are found dead, with the internal organs completely frozen. <br /><br />"Decoys" was a great surprise for me. I bought this DVD because of its low price and the beautiful cover, but without any reference. When I saw IMDb Rating, I thought that I might have lost my money. However, although having some flaws in the story, the movie is very funny and attractive. In the end, I found IMDb User Rating very unfair and "Decoys" very underrated. The surprise in the last scene was excellent. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Decoys"
