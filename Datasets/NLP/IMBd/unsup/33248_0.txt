Let me start out by saying that (a) I like the SciFi channel, and fantasy and scifi in general (those reading my other reviews might conclude that I only like French and Japanese films, and that is not the case) and (b) I do not have any bias against TV movies.<br /><br />What I do have a bias against is flimsy and witless hack job rearrangements of classics--including classic myth. There is a point of view that every possible genre of literature was invented by the Greeks and we have just been ringing changes ever since; so there in nothing wrong with re-imagining the classics--Jean Cocteau's films, "Clueless" on Jane Austen, John Gardner's "Grendell", Kurosawa's "Ran" and "Throne of Blood", much of Roger Corman's work,and numerous others.<br /><br />But in this case, bad dialogue, bad acting (this film makes, say, "Conan the Barbarian" look like the Royal Shakespeare Company) and a plot that, charitably, has little to do with the original and everything to do with being a framework for skimpy clothing and a bucket or two of gore, matched with an excessive enthusiasm for point of view camera work, all combine to make this a heap of (as a good friend of mine says) stinking poo.<br /><br />Go watch either Conan movie, or "Red Sonia", or "Hellboy" or a Hammer film. Don't waste your time and effort on this. Guys--recognize a stinker when you see one.
