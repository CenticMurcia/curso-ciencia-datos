I selected this movie having no idea what it was truly about. The ending was a surprise and of course drove me to the internet to do some research to learn more about the details that led to the shootings. It's made it a bit more personal and humanized the strangers and the victims. It's always sad when one's life is cut short. It's sadder when you are brought into that person's life and given a glimpse of how they lived. It's a shame. So young! To die so young! To be cheated of ones future especially when you did everything right, raised your child properly. Our society needs a major makeover. And if this tragedy doesn't teach us a lesson, then Lord knows what will.
