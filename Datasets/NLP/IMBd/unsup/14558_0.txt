First, this is just a movie. A director instructs actors to wear costumes, go on a set, and act their roles, which is recorded on film, edited, and later played in theaters.<br /><br />But then, it's somehow so much more. A storyline woven from very many threads that briefly spans 2000 years. From crucifixion (but more important, the Bees of Israel legend), via Gypsy family life, to terrorism and the 1st Gulf war. And roles that provide so much intensity. Nice simple effects at times, like mixing the images of "back then" with the soundtrack of "now". A long puzzle (3 hrs in the version I saw), but ultimately not feeling too long. An incredible experience. Deeply recommended, if you're ready to invest 3 hours that might change your mind.<br /><br />Regarding the title: "La belle histoire" downplays ironically, just about "quite some story" in English. The German title, "Die schönste Geschichte der Welt" (The most beautiful story of the world) exaggerates very much. But still, shortly after watching it, that title has a point... 10/10.<br /><br />I bought this in Germany (Müller) as part of a Lelouch 4-pack by Black Hill.
