Though a completely different film the plot has elements reminiscent to me of Coppola's Godfather with the move to different methods of obtaining proceeds from crime (proposal of drugs in The Godfather but not in this case..). Also the popping off of your boys by the opposition is a familiar scene.<br /><br />In this film it looks like someone bigger than both our gang boss Bob Hoskins (our Godfather here) and his local rivals has arrived in town!-London town that is...<br /><br />It has everything and like all great films captures a certain mood throughout. This is crucial to holding the film and its audience together throughout. It is unlike many British films: not too wordy and as one other reviewer i've read in past mentions is a gold standard set 16 or so years previous for Guy Rithcie (with his dubious Lock stock, etc.) et al.. to look back in wonder and emulate but never achieve....yet...<br /><br />Afterthought: Please note there are some other Brit greats since though with the likes of "sexy beast" and "Gansgter NO1" providing extremely entertaining viewing! TRIVIA: If you are British it is great fun to spot the Brit soap stars and other more for TV actors such as the wonderful (Prime Suspect fame) Helen Mirren.<br /><br />Of course wherever you are from a young Pierce Brosnan appears in the closing sequence - what a shock to behold the silent killer! Turn the lights right down pour your preferred poison and watch it all unfold and explode at the end! Bon viewing!
