This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. I'm not being prejudiced against the director. this movie just plain sucks. I know some of you like it because it has a lot of blood and gore and mangled bodies and lots of stuff gets blown up. If that's your cup of tea, go for it. But in this movie, this is what is missing: any kind of acting, any possible directing, anything resembling realistic jungle battle, intelligent dialog, story line and plot without holes galore, intelligent soldiers, and I could go on and on. This is not how war is. This is not how it was in Vietnam. This does not show any side of humanity. It's a jumbled up mess. A complete waste of time and money. Do not see this film. Time for the director to retire.
