Now, don't get me wrong, i gave it a chance...<br /><br />I thought the Lord of the Flies type scenario could lead to an interesting plot. I was wrong, not in the traditional, "oh well, at least the cinematography was good", but in the more "OH MY GOD, argh, help, THEY STOLE 2 HOURS OF MY LIFE".<br /><br />I may be overreacting, hang on, i'll check.... No i'm not, this is single-handedly the worst film ever made. The raft scene where the 'baddie' sabotages their escape for his own gain cracks me up, in fact the baddie himself, and the hero and oh god - its wrong. INCLUDING - the shameless attempt to add some plot with the rape pregnancy/suicide attempt part of the plot and even more cringing is the older woman (who only just lost her fella) almost loses her toyboy and falls in love scene - give me strength.<br /><br />I swear - i would LOVE to meet anyone who liked this film and pay for their psychologist, coz it sucks, it just plain sucks, in the worst way...<br /><br />(oh and where does the Spanish girl get swordfighting skills from?) pah!
