Yes........Remembering when there was a time that television at least was making an attempt at being adventurous and exciting. Even if it was on a hokey family level. Now we have been reduced to seeing prime time become infested with the dreadful likes of the reality show revolution. Watching fat people work out and whine about how much being a porker has ruined their lives. Or, licking our chops at seeing the back stabbing behind the back two timing that is the very life breath of shows like "Survivor". Not even the situation comedy seems likely to survive the venomous infection that is realty TV. What chance does an old fashioned family drama have. If its all the same to you, I will catch a rerun of Kodiak. If there ever is one....
