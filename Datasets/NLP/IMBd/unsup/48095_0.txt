There are elements of the plot in this review but I can't see you making it to the end so it might not be a bad idea to just read this and skip the actual movie.<br /><br />Sam has the man of her dreams. He proposes to her and she turns into a crazed bride to be. This drives her fiancé away so what does she do, she kisses someone else (which is, obviously, his fault too). She says her mother only notices her sister and not her but I didn't actually see her mother talk to the sister once. When the engagement is called off, her fiancé comes to see her and, in the most clichéd style of these kinds of films, she let's him go to stop hurting him more which is clearly a self centred act and...<br /><br />It goes on. The key to a movie that people will actually be able to watch to the end is to have a protagonist that has some characteristics that one can empathise with or at least admire. Hannibal ate people but he had immense style and culture. Sam, in this film, has absolutely NO redeeming characteristics at all! When it all falls apart (because of her) she decides to have a go at the guy she wanted before.<br /><br />Does she decide that she has made a mistake because she has been a complete and utter b*tch? No, she only decides when she finds out that the "dream guy" is actually not very nice.<br /><br />What is the future for this couple? At the first sign of any problems she will look somewhere else then, when it all go wrong, she'll go back and the idiot Ben will take her back.<br /><br />I hated Sam. I wanted Ben to leave her and find someone who he deserved. I wanted her to settle with Luke who would treat her like she treated Ben. I wanted her to have a very, very unhappy ever after.<br /><br />On top of hating the main character, the film itself was absolute rubbish too. I assume this was supposed to be a romantic comedy but it wasn't (either romantic - idiot doormat man takes completely self obsessed woman - or comedic).<br /><br />I often wonder at the waste of film used to make garbage like this and I suggest the writers re-familiarise themselves with the concept of a heroine.
