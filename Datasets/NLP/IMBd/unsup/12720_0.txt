Salma Hayek is quirky and delightful in this work, but let me ask you a question: With a title like Breaking Up, did you really expect them to work it out? WHO in their right mind would want to be with a man like Crowe!?! All too often, his characters are rude, crude, abusive, and psychotic. It leads me to believe he plays these roles so often because there is something inside him, which identifies with this type of man. Indeed. News reports would tend to corroborate this opinion.<br /><br />The story is dull and uneventful, and the execution is pretty lame. Again, Hayek was great, but she can't do a "couples" movie alone and have it work. Crowe just plain sucks as an actor.<br /><br />This is a crapfest, and as such, rates a NOTHING from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
