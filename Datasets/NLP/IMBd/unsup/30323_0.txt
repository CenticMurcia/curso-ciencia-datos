Wow! and I really mean WOW. That was my reaction when I first watched the gorgeous Sheeri Rappaport in this B-Witch movie. What a body! what a beautiful, angel face, and those legs; perfectly build... You know were I'm going.<br /><br />Let's be honest people. This movie is mediocre, dull, sometimes boring, but it has hot women. Sheeri steals the show as the hottest, sexiest of them all and delivers some steamy sexy scenes. For example, anytime she wears the college girl uniform (open shirt and skimpy mini mini skirt) she immediately gets naked like in the glorious scene at the confessional, and then while performing a striptease to tease the construction workers. Then she spends the whole movie naked or semi-naked. Thank you Sheeri!<br /><br />Clea Duvall also has her moments and so does the rest of the cast but believe me, Ms. Rappaport is the reason to spend 90 minutes of your life. <br /><br />ALso, the movie has some cheesy moments like when the devil monster "surprises" the naked chicks. That was just a lame excuse to show glorious frontal female nudity. So the rest of the scenes.<br /><br />If you are looking for cheap entertainment then look elsewhere! "Little Witches" it's all about sexiness, hot women, and sex. This is my kind of entertainment for 3:00 a.m.
