I am sorry I have to post this, but I have a deep respect for John and one cannot wonder "Why waste such good actors on crappy stories ?", how on earth can anyone try to make me believe that a human being can stand such drama and do nothing about it ? That is the spirit in South Africa? I honestly don't think so. Even if you don't put much thrust in the police (as they claim in the movie) you still can act on your own, and I am talking here about him as a protector of his daughter and as a protector of his own skin - for God's sake, that kid RAPED HIS DAUGHTER , BROKE HIS HEAD AND SET HIM ON FIRE TO DIE !!! I can ask anyone if he or she were able to find the one responsible, would they let him get away with it ?
