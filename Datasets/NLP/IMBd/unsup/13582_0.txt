It never fails to amaze me, how some people either don't want to or simply do not get what a movie is about. This movie is not about robots, the future, or science fiction. It is about that which is most basic, and yet often, most overlooked by all of us. Life, living, our short time in the scheme of the grander scale of things. It deals with some of the most elemental, and difficult, issues we ultimately most face in our lives. We want to be happy,we want a sense of purpose, we want to feel we belong, we want to feel loved.<br /><br />I have seen A.I. as well, and the it shares many of the same themes laid out in this film. I only hope, and pray, mans' vanity and blind ambition never produce a machine that truly achieves sentient thought. The profound, deep, and inconsolable sadness and grief it would suffer as it deals with seeing all whom it cares about slowly pass away and leave it lonely would surely be a torment beyond any ability to conceive.
