Revisiting one's youth and halcyon days was a familiar theme for Rod Serling. The pressures of Hollywood, TV ratings, deadlines etc. were all part of Serling's anathema for Show Business, in general. Although Serling himself didn't write this particular episode (E. Jack Neuman did), this is one after his own heart, as they say. Brian Aherne plays Booth Templeton, an old-time Broadway actor who's reluctant to continue his career now that most of his peers have passed on. After a heated argument with his young director (Sydney Pollack of all people) Templeton enters the Twilight Zone for some first-hand nostalgia. There he meets the long-ago love of his life (Pippa Scott) and many former friends and associates. Of course, everyone is a ghost and after a brief stay in this netherworld, Templeton finds that he is unwanted. He just doesn't belong there....yet. Templeton discovers that his trouble has been that he's living in the past and it's killing him slowly. When he arrives back in the present, he soon has a new appreciation for the "here and now" and is able to begin his career again in earnest. <br /><br />Veteran actor Aherne is outstanding as Templeton and his performance here is a late career high-water mark for him. Within a few years after the Twilight Zone series ended, Pollack became one of Hollywood's great directors and it's quite ironic that in this episode he actually portrays one. Lately, Pollack has gone back to acting with some good results. As for Pippa Scott, she's the life of the party in this entry and still a working actress today.
