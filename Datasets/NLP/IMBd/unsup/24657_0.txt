Of all the National Lampoon movies this is definitely among the best. Mitch Snider, anesthesiologist, and his rich unappreciative family are in for the surprise of their lives when a letter arrives from long lost cousin Woodrow Snider. Woody invites his family to celebrate Thanksgiving with his family, and Mitch, longing for a true family celebration, is game and drags his reluctant family along with him. Mitch's expectations are far from what he gets when they arrive and find their cousins are hippies with a crazy son and a goth daughter. Their yard is a washing machine graveyard and their meals depend on which animal passes away first, and for Thanksgiving dinner, Woody and his wife Pauline are anxiously awaiting their TB ridden turkey to pass. Mitch and his wife Jill quickly become uncomfortable with many other things on their visit, including having to share a bedroom with a very intimate and freaky Woody and Pauline. Overall a very funny movie that can help you feel grateful at Thanksgiving for the simple fact that you're not related to this crazy family. 10 out of 10 stars.
