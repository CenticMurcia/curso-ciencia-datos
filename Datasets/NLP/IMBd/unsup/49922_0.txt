I can't decide what was the worst thing about this movie. The bad plot, terrible acting, cheesy 1970's Barnaby Jones sets, lack of Bond gadgets, lack of Bond sex, silly Spanish accents or defeating a a guy with a gun to his head by throwing a couple of maggots in his face. The maggots reminded me of what happened when Lieutenant Frank Dreben (Naked Gun) had a pillow thrown at his face, except they were serious about it in this movie! An FBI agent they want dead is fed to a shark, but pulled back up before dead, put into a bag and left back at home to die? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That's the same schtick as the "unnecessarily slow dipping mechanism" gag in Austin Powers, except it was a joke in Austin Powers! This piece of crap has nothing to do with Bond. They just slapped the name on to a bad idea and out into the world it went. I didn't realize this was included in the collector's pack of 7 DVDs. I tried to watch it once, but had to shut it off after an hour. Save yourself the pain.....throw it away now!
