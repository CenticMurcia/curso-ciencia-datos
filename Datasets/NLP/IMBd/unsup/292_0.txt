Matt McCoy stars as Scott,a Navy Seal who is the target of wrath of Shannon (Glenn Plummer) who thinks Scott sold him out, he didn't but that doesn't stop Shannon from abducting Scott's wife, or blowing up various figures in the pentagon, once again absurd plot twists come up and the flick rips off many action sequences to give it a more explosive look in this terrible yet funny movie. Where do I even start with this one? Well for one the whole commentary in which Wynorski keeps referring to the footage stolen as Delta Force 2, but it's actually Delta Force 1! Other such action sequences are from Red Heat,Invasion USA and Navy Seals. Rangers is utterly absurd with acting so wooden, action sequences so obviously lifted and plot angles so over the top ridiculous that you cannot believe they are serious. For instance the guy (footage necessary from Invasion USA) blows up his friend's house, not even knowing that his friend wasn't in on it? Or how the government don't do anything to stop this guy after he blew up the pentagon, jeez how dense are these guys? It gets even funnier if you pretend that McCoy is playing his Police Academy or Seinfeld character. However let me just conclude this is as hilarious as terrible movies get.<br /><br />1/2* Out of 4-(Awful)
