Hey, this game is great! Nice graphics, great sound, good puzzles, etc. The only thing that I did not like that much was, that you sometimes have to move through up to 3 screens without any contents. Well, there are nice graphics but nothing that would do anything. They don't even contain red herrings : But this game was still lot's of fun!
