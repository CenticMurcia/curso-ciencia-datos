Normally, I'm a Studio Ghibli fan. Despite being predisposed towards liking this movie (I stubbornly held out hope until the end credits, despite all rationale,) I consider the time I spent watching it as waste, and here's why: The story wanders around aimlessly, with zero surprises (you can't twist what's not there, I guess) and reaches a conclusion that the viewer basically makes during the first 5-10 minutes of the film.<br /><br />While the movie is supposed to be a "slice of life" type of film, it's too bad the life being sliced is a boring one. There are many missed opportunities where something exciting could have happened, or something could have been revealed to add depth to the main characters (and thus increase the chances of the viewer developing some hint of empathy with them.) <br /><br />Open your window at home, and spend 70 minutes watching passersby instead of this film. You'll be glad you did.
