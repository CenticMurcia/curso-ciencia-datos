Rated PG for Sexual Innuendos,Language and Teen Smoking/Drinking <br /><br />Grease is a musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton John.I must say, im not really a big fan of the musical genre but there are a few that I enjoy.This is one of them.The songs are pretty catchy and the movie has a fairly good plot.Its a teen film set in the 1950's like American Graffiti and Lemon Popsicle only this is not as serious as those movies.The film is about two teenagers who meet and fall in love over the summer but the girl says she has to move back to Austrailia ending their relationship.But their family seems to have a change of plans and she ends up going to the same school.The only thing is, she's a goody goody girl and the boy she fell in love with is a member of a gang.Graese is a fairly entertaining film and even if you don't like musicals, but like teen films then you should check this one out.
