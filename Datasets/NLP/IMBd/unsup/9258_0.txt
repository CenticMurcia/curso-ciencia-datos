I first learned about "Countdown w/Keith Olbermann" when I read a transcript of Keith Olbermann's special comment "Liar in Chief...the president who makes things up", identifying that George W. Bush had claimed that Democrats had made certain claims (which of course they'd never actually made). Ever since then, I've watched his show almost every night. It's just about the best thing out there. Who else would rip at the Bush administration and poke fun at Britney Spears/Paris Hilton/Lindsay Lohan/"American Idol" like this? Not to mention having George Carlin as a guest.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the news show that I recommend above pretty much all others (of course, there's always "The Daily Show" and "The Colbert Report"). In times like these, such a program is what we all need.<br /><br />As for the worst persons in the world: The bronze goes to: me. I said in my IMDb review of "Ed Wood" that it was the first R-rated movie that I'd ever seen in the theaters. I remembered a few months later that "Serial Mom" was the first R-rated movie that I'd seen in the theaters (followed by "Backbeat", and then "Ed Wood"). I apologize for this.<br /><br />The runner-up: Rupert Murdoch. Through his media outlets (namely Fox Noise), he has buried a story about Sibel Edmonds. She has exposed the theft of US nuclear secrets and how they made their way to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia with the help of Turkey and Israel. But according to Murdoch's MSM, this is nowhere near as important as Britney Spears. Tell me, Rupert. If - as Roger Ailes claims - presidential candidates who can't face Faux News can't face al-Qaida, does that mean that Fixed News has practically no interest in stopping al-Qaida. I always knew that the two entities were equally intolerant, but might it go that far? <br /><br />But the winner: no, it's not Bill Orally, but Indonesia's former dictator Suharto. He died today without ever having undergone prosecution for the murder of almost 1 million people in Indonesia and East Timor during his 32 years in power (not to mention letting Nike establish sweatshops throughout his country). And now no one can prosecute him. Oh well, at least he'll spend eternity in Hell.<br /><br />Suharto. Today's...worst...person...in the world! Anyway, Keith Olbermann hosts a great news show.
