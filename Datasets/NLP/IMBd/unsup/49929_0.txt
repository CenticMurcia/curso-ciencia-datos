Did they honestly think that this movie would be good? Did the really think people would like it so much that they'd tell their friends to go see it, and then buy it when released on DVD?<br /><br />I think the people involved with this movie must think you can get away with a loose script and bad comedy as long as it's got lots of explosions and sexy women.
