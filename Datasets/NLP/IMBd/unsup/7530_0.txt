Really enjoyed this film when I saw it at the Sydney film festival. It's message concerning the perils of corporate greed and it's ramifications are very eloquently stated. It features some good Australian actors who all play their roles well. Special mention needs to go to Aden Young, who absolutely rocks in this. What happened to this guy? The way he carries off his arrogant, rich boy character is nothing less than mesmerising. Matt Newton also does very well as the main character who's life bears the brunt of the bet that is referred to in the title. It was good to see an Australin movie which actually made you think whist being entertaining, which is rare as our industry seems to only spew out lame comedies or drug movies. If you see it advertised it's well worth catching.
