Even though "Girl Fever" (other title "100 women") is a fantasy piece at best, the way it's done is so idiotic beyond even the most clich√© rubbish ever done in cinema. In one aspect of the movie we see the politically correct, totally unrealistic fantasy set-up: an American art student has some hot looking trophy chyck fall out of the sky and be all over him. We are supposed to believe this could ever happen? Unless you're an art student who happens to be a rich and famous rock star or movie industry mogul, or coke dealer I suppose. Also, we see the main character treated like crap by a bunch of women to see if he is *worthy*. The kind of men-are-not-worthy-of-women for some reason goes unnoticed in America. With the exception of the various nemesis in the story, everyone is so nice and so genuine it's just too sickening. So unrealistic. This flick is for those who really want like to see men played for suckers by skanks.
