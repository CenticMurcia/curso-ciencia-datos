This was nothing to write home about, and even worse little kids won't care about anything that is happening. Quite an embarrassment and with one of the shortest running times (a little over an hour) which is actually a good thing. This story has been done thousand times over, and just about always done better. Ewan McGregor is wasted, and he tries his best with what he's given. Just a huge mistake on not using your voice cast to their full potential. It's called a script, and even the best actors can't save it. Don't waste your time or your kids time. Stick to the Pixar or even some of the Disney movies to be actually entertained. Anyone that gives this a high score needs to have their heads examined. Even a novice knows this is how not to make a good animated film.
