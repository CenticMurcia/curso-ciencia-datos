'My Super Sweet 16' follows the lives of 15 year old teenagers preparing to celebrate their 'Sweet 16' party. MTV could have made this a very enjoyable and watchable show, had they come up with a suitable pitch for it.<br /><br />Basically, the cameras follow spoilt, rich teens as they prepare for their party, and what the cameras pick up is truly cringe worthy.<br /><br />For starters, these teenagers believe that the world revolves around them, and that they are the best thing since sliced bread. Nothing could be further from the truth. These are people who are annoying beyond belief, because if something doesn't go their way, such as their favourite celebrity won't be showing up because he/she had other plans (like WORKING), or the fact that the parents won't let them buy the $300 dress that makes them look like a whore, then they bitch, whine and moan until they get their way. And what's shocking about the show is that they actually do get their way.<br /><br />None of these teens seem to know how the real world works, as they are living off mommy and daddy's money, and will probably do so for as long as they can.<br /><br />Now, I TRIED to see the good side of this show, I really did. I honestly thought that at least one of the teens featured would actually come across as a decent human being. But to no avail. This show is quite possibly one of the best examples of what is wrong with the rich in today's society. What's more, I can see RICH people, who have worked hard for their money actually watching this show and feeling embarrassed for the families of these spoilt, stuck up teens.<br /><br />Well done MTV for showing off all these disgusting people. At least now most of us know how lucky we are not to be associated with any of them.
