This movie is a wonderful movie. The title doesn't really suggest it but once you begin to watch it it just captivates you and you can't resist the temptation to finish the whole movie. It inspires kids to be who they really are and not worry about others. It inspired to me to be myself and not really care about what others think. I really related to the teens in the movie primarily because most of them were dealing with and going through problems that I had. I really encourage any teen who feels like an outcast or left out to watch this movie. i know it would make you feel better about yourself. Not to mention that the singing was fantastic. The young people in this movie definitely had talent. I know it did for me.
