I am a HUGE fan of classic films and brother, this one just ain't one.<br /><br />This clunker runs on TCM quite often and it gets worse with each viewing. This movie is the 1936 equivalent of an episode of "Three's Company" where a blatant misunderstanding and circumstances that are ridiculous are supposed to make us forget the contrived nature of the plot.<br /><br />I've never understood the attraction to Jean Harlow and Gable is absolutely awful in this. Myrna Loy is the only bright light in this weak tale that limps along for it's 3.5 hour running time (at least that's how long it feels).<br /><br />Even the title to this is bad.<br /><br />This is definitely one of those movies to watch if the doctor gives you six months to live, 'cause you'll wish you were dead.
