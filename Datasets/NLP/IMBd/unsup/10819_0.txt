Typically for me werewolf movies rank right between roots canals and a colonoscopy in terms of desirability. Since they're all based around a centuries-old legend, there's generally not much room for originality without fans crying foul because "that's not what werewolves do!" (like werewolves are real and do anything at all). However I decided to give this a shot as it didn't look like your typical werewolf flick and I'm glad I did. The title alone (which is pathetically mundane) made me think it would be another "so bad it's good" kind of movie. While it does fall prey to some of the cheesy pitfalls of many horror movies, it is surprisingly entertaining and able to hold your attention throughout. It may also be the first time I've ever seen a werewolf that engages in witty banter with his victims, so props for originality. Don't watch it expecting Oscar material, but enjoy it for what it is...a slightly campy but ultimately very enjoyable horror/comedy. Sit back and let you mind go...preferably with liberal amounts of beer to make it just that much funnier.
