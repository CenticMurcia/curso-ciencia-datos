Although very weird and grotesque, the original Lars Von Trier's "Riget" is much better than this "americanized" version. The characters, the plot, the hospital itself... everything is lost in this remake. An I tell you, "Riget" can get really, really spooky. Also, some of the characters' evilness is completely lost in this remake.<br /><br />Sometimes it seems like producers treat the US audience as if they wouldn't understand or enjoy the weirdness of some Europe's film work, and I'm remembering The Office, another TV show originally broad-casted in the UK's BBC: the original series is far more fun, much more real and politically incorrect... <br /><br />Go for the original, it is a masterpiece.
