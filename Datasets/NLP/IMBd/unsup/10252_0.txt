Unlike our American cousins, we here in the UK don't get to see re-runs of Night Gallery - never sure why, as there are plenty of re-runs on the Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits and occasionally Tales from the Darkside albeit on satellite, not the main channels. From my kindred youth, I remember certain episodes from 'Gallery', but the quick, 'fillers' the series put in were sometimes bizarre, but welcome. This one, where a normal 'human' couple if you like, hear their 'baby' or young son crying out for a glass of water. They argue over (From what I can recall)whose turn it is to get him the water etc. Then I think it IS the father, who hands the glass to 'Junior'. Junior replies in toddler fashion 'thank you dadddyyy!' - then we see a baby-ish Frankenstein monster crushing the glass with his hand! Great stuff from the makers! Bring it back over the pond, please!
