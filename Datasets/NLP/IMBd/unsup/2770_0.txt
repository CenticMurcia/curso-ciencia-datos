The final installment of Agatha Christie's Poirot is definitely worth waiting for. Definitely made my top ten. Although criticized heavily by some die-hard fans, Taken is a very enjoyable installment to a rather dull season.<br /><br />The film starts off with Poirot, played to perfection once again by David Suchet, listening to Major James Porter (Nicholas Le Prevost) telling of how he sat outside the London townhouse of Gordon Cloade as it exploded. Out of the rubble steps Gordon's young bride, Rosaleen Cloade (Eva Birthistle) and her brother, David Hunter (Elliot Cowan). Rosaleen has now inherited Gordon's fortune, much to the distaste of his family. Now the family is hitting Rosaleen up for money, but David holds her purse strings. It's a situation ripe for murder.<br /><br />The directing and performances are what really make this episode spectacular. Andy Wilson once again delivers a great product. Elliot Cowan gives a disturbing performance as the evil David. Amanda Douge also does exceptionally well in such a complicated role as Lynn Marchmont. Celia Imrie is spectacular as Kathy Cloade, playing the exaggerated part without overacting. Pip Torrens and Penny Downie are quite enjoyable as Jeremy and Frances. Jenny Agutter does well as Adela, though she doesn't have much to do. Nicholas Le Prevost is pretty good as Major Porter. Patrick Baladi is superb as Rowley. Elizabeth Spriggs and Claire Hackett are delightfully comical. Richard Hope and David Yelland are also very good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Tim Pigott-Smith's talent is totally wasted, dropping him very rarely into only a few scenes. Though, the biggest disappointment of the episode was Eva Birthistle. Rosaleen was described as a stunning brunette, but Eva, though stunning, was frumped down for the role and was blonde. <br /><br />The locations, however, were all exquisitely chosen, including Englefield House, Chilworth Manor, Dorchester-on-Thames and, of course, Florin Court in Charterhouse Square, the set of Poirot's stunning new flat. <br /><br />Guy Andrews' screenplay could have been better. Some of the language and conversation was very uncharacteristic of the time and major liberties were taken. However, this episode doesn't sag in the middle, like some of the others. This is like the Sad Cypress of the season. Liberties were taken, but the performances and direction makes this a lasting treat.
