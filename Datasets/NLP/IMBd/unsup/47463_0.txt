This piece of gay agenda driven drivel went the way of the likes of "Brokeback Mountain" and other such attempts of 10% of the population trying to force its agenda on the other 90%. Thank God Americans still have some semblance of good taste and sent this abomination packing. Also, to any one who thinks Bill Cullen would have liked this hijacking of a classic game show, evidently did not know Mr. Cullen. My family knew Bill almost from the first day he was born to the day he died thanks to the close friendship he had with my parents. Believe me, people, Bill was not what you would call "tolerant" of the gay lifestyle. He would have despised this "modern" version of his beloved "I've Got a Secret".
