DENNIS THE MENACE, in my opinion, is an excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with smashing performances. Also, even though everyone gave an appealing performance, I liked Dennis' (Mason Gamble) the best. In addition, I thought that Mr. Wilson (Walter Matthau) was a very cantankerous guy. However, I thought that Margaret (Amy Sakasitz) was an absolute b****. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did a very good job. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with appealing performances to any fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
