After reading the description for this video and deciding to purchase it two days ago, I felt that it might be a worthy horror film. Unfortunately this movie was a major disappointment. This was definitely a "hack and slash" film, but it was the plot and continuity of the film that were cut to pieces. This movie had no redeeming qualities... The plot was non-existent, the acting was poor, the effects were poor... The worst part of all is that this movie was actually released and that there are people that like it. No offense to these folks, but when the best part of the movie is throwing it in the trash, you really need to reconsider what you're watching. This could have been a decent horror film, but all things considered, this movie ranks a 1 on the rating scale and a 10 on the pain scale.<br /><br />My suggestion is to watch a horror film such as 'The Ring' or John Carpenter's 'The Thing.' Both are edge-of-your-seat thrillers that will show you what horror is meant to be... ;)
