If you take this little gem for what it is: A low budget film by a first time director, with a volunteer cast & crew filmed on location at Celebration II (a Star Wars convention), it's a masterpiece. <br /><br />I had the pleasure of attending a screening with with director Gary Wood and star David Prowse (who plays himself) in attendance. I enjoyed it enough to buy the DVD after the screening, and have enjoyed repeated viewings. The cast is very good and has a lot of fun with this touching and very funny script. Lee Ann Millen makes this film well worth watching. The actor playing Gearge Lucas does a great job. The director gave a copy to Mr. Lucas himself. I would love to read his review of it. <br /><br />Pop some popcorn and sit back and enjoy.
