I have just finished watching this movie, and I can say is WOW, it's definitely one of the best anime movies of all time. The story, music, and animation are great; you just have to see this movie right away. The movie is not out in theater, not in the U.S. anyway, so you should go get the Korean DVD instead, it has English subtitle, so you will be fine.
