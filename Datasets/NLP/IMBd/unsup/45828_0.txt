Absolutely nothing to write home about. Why on earth anyone would hire Stephen Baldwin for anything is a mystery to me. He is obnoxious and he can't even act... Movies like this should use the opportunity and their low budgets to search and try out new faces, young undiscovered talent, and not to finance and sustain a large part of the Baldwin family...<br /><br />And then Kristy Swanson... How on earth do you cast an actress who is so grossly overweight for a lead role in an erotic thriller? It just doesn't make sense, Hollywood is full of young aspiring actresses who would kill to have such a role and look ten times better... So then why? Is it just ignorance, or did somebody simply owe her a part in a movie...?<br /><br />In other, there is not very much to say about this movie, it is simply bad, a waste of everybody's time and money. There isn't a single thing that can be saved from this horrible wreck, the screenplay is bad, the acting is bad, the directing is bad, the soundtrack, the cinematography... you name it. Unfortunately, there are many movies out there that are even worse, hence the three stars I awarded this one, otherwise I was tempted to rate it even lower...
