Although this movie was made 8 years before I was, I saw it for the first time yesterday and I was blown away! I have spent my life missing what has just become one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />The acting was superb, the storyline riveting and the characters were people you could care about. Max was my personal favorite. There was a quiet, tragic dignity to him. I expected something to be revealed about him but was not prepared for the truth.<br /><br />I've always liked William Holden but my experience with Gloria Swanson was limited to her brief role in "Airport 75". I will now look for more movies by her. What an expressive face.<br /><br />It was fun to try to recognize some of the old time actors that were portraying themselves. <br /><br />An all around excellent movie. One I truly regret having waited this long to see. But it is definitely a case of better late than never.
