"The Water Horse" takes place during the turbulent times of World War II in Scotland. Young Angus, who is afraid of water, finds an egg on the shore and takes it home. It hatches into a creature that he's never seen before, but as a doting father he takes in the creature as his own, calling it Crusoe after Robinson Crusoe.<br /><br />Crusoe grows exponentially and at a short rate, so Angus moves Crusoe to the Lock. Meanwhile, a military platoon has taken refuge at his house, and they think that the Germans will send submarines into the Lock, so they protect it with a large net.<br /><br />As Crusoe grows, it becomes harder and harder to not notice, and soon the military thinks he's a threat, and Angus tries to prevent them from killing him.<br /><br />It took me awhile to see this movie, because I thought it would've been stupid, but I was pleasantly surprised about how well everything came together. My only problem is with the child actor who played Angus, because he never pronounced Crusoe's name right (it would sound like Crutoe, Cretos, Cristos, etc.), and when he would yell it was almost ear shattering, but other than that, "The Water Horse" is an excellent family film.
