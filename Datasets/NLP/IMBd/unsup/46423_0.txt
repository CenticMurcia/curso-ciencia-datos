This film has a great soundtrack. My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult was an excellent choice for this film.<br /><br />I wish there was a way to post a comment without rambling on and on about how great or terrible the movie is. If it was a mediocre movie it deserves a mediocre comment. Goodman is great, as he usually is. He always reminded me of Fred Flintstone, so yeah, he was well cast. Rosie O'Donnell sucks, but I can't think of a better Betty Rubble. The cartoons are much better than this movie though. Its just not the same without the cartoon voices, it just isn't the same. If you were or still are a fan of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, this movie probably isn't for you. It's a lot like how Hollywood ruined Scooby-Doo for me, although that didn't happen for another 10 years. Meh, yabba dabba doo! its the Flintstones.
