Not pushy or preachy, just a simple, honest tail of a young man and his struggles. A truly grand film!!! I recommend it to anyone. Anyone who is looking to be uplifted, touched, and inspired, no mater their religious affiliation, this is the film for you. Coming from Idaho Falls, Idaho myself this film has a soft spot for me. The touching moments, the harsh reality of prejudice, and the outcome of honest sacrifice makes this film profound. This film is a true story that shows only a few of his vast adventures, which change his life. He gave up his home, family, love, comforts, and all that was familiar for almost three years to help people he had never met. This truly shows you don't need to die to 'lay down ones life', but better yet, it's the putting aside our worldly desires for things of a better.<br /><br />Have a very critical eye, being a director and writer myself, I say this film is a success.
