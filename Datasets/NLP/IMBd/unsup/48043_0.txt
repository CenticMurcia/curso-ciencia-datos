This is an awfully bad movie. The plot is so, how can I put this, USELESS I really can't understand why they bothered filming it. This is a waste of money, for the producer and the audience. Believe it or not, the plot is not the worst thing about it. This film is in a way educational. If you want to be an actor, see this film and you'll see great examples on horrible acting. But then again you probably don't need to se this mess to understand that.
