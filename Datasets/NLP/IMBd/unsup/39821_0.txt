Robert Young is likable in the romantic thriller. Florence Rice is, too, as the worker in his father's store for whom he falls. A couple murders are committed. The police, including Sidney Toler, investigate. (Almost the whole thing takes place on the premises of the store.) During the period such B-movies in this very overworked genre usually are still turning up clues, this solves the mystery. Very unsatisfactorily, I might add.<br /><br />Julie Haydon plays Rice's sister. She is said to have been wonderful in the original stage production of "The Glass Menagerie." And she's fine here. But, though it has several plots going on at once, to a degree it's more short subject than full-length movie.
