This movie deserves to be #1 on the 100 worst movies ever. Although words are inadequate to describe how bad this movie is: "wretched," "pitiful," and "embarrassingly horrible," all come to mind.<br /><br />I can't imagine that the writer and director were serious when they made this. Either they must have been joking, or they made this from inside their room in the asylum. Actually, that would explain the lack of decent acting and props, too....<br /><br />I used to like roleplaying when I was a kid, and even that couldn't get me to finish watching this movie. I got almost to the end, but I feared that if I watched the whole thing, my brain would explode, I would have to gouge out my eyes, or the universe would end... maybe all three.<br /><br />Avoid this loser of a film at all costs....You've been warned!
