This movie seemed a lot more like an episode of the x-files than anything that would compare to the first film. This film lacks the emotional conflicts of the first and the direction, lighting, and special effects are lacking in comparison and in general. Pumkinhead II is a mediocre movie whose flaws are accentuated by comparing it to the original.
