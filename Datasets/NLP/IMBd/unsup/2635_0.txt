I think this show is Fantastic! From waiting patiently for the very first show to appear, I watched that episode and I have watched and enjoyed each and ever episode since the first one! In fact my husband tapes them for me to watch again later on in the week. I find myself waiting and looking forward to the new show coming up the following week! In this day and age it is wonderful to have this type of show to look forward to watching! So exciting, so wonderful, so real.....family type situations at their best....as well as at their saddest too! It's good for all ages.....little children to older adults! Babies to Grandparents (one of which I am, a Grandmother..not baby! HA! HA!! It's truly refreshing TV at it's best. My Thanks to Animal Planet for another good one! Thank You again Animal Planet and my Thanks also goes to everyone in the cast and crew of The Meerkat Manor show!
