A Few years ago I saw the Snow Queen on Hallmark, I was absolutely blown away with the story and magic of that adaptation. Thinking that it was the same movie I was disappointed to find I had gotten another telling of the story. Yet I was willing to give it a chance, as I usually love anything made by the BBC. I have to say though I agree that the score of this movie was beautiful, I may have to find a copy somewhere. I was terribly unhappy with the CG animation and acting, you could just tell that the actors were filmed on a blue screen. It felt extremely fake.It was just horrible, it hesitated and you knew from the moment you began that it wasn't real snow. It just felt cheep. The BBC didn't have a winner with this film. It felt rushed as well, even though it was quit close to the original story. If you want to really experience the Snow Queen, please by all means read the story. If your interested in seeing a film that is well made and acted, I recommend the one done on Hallmark,which can be found on Amazon. Steer clear of this film, unless you feel the need to waste an hour. However, if you like classical music do get a CD of this movie the music it's self is really the only good thing in this movie.
