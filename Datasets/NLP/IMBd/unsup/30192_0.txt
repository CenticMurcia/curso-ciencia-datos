I have seen this movie four times and each time I view it I learn something new.I wish that this movie was shown in American history classes, to educate our children. I think that the more that people learn the true horrors of slavery they will no longer be able to ignore it. This is the sort of film that will lead people, both Black and White, to really discuss the wrongs that have been done in this country. I hope that others will not be turned away because some have said it was not executed right. What they do not understand is that this movie was made with not a lot of money. Unfortunately, these types of stories are not what Hollywood wants to produce. Although it is not the best quality it should be watched for its important message. Hopefully, if more of us show interest in these type of films Hollywood will make them and they will be of a better quality aesthetically .
