I have to agree that this was not the most technically advanced film I have ever seen, but it was made 5 years ago and we are used to seeing great effects today, but it is a good story. Wes makes for a very interesting lead and the plot leaves clues and questions that only the planned series could have answered. It was unfortunate that the series was not picked up at the time, but it has left the door open for the remake that is currently in production in Canada/Germany. And with todays CGI, and an industry first from VICON, there are only good things destined for this show. I can see Ice Planet (2001) quickly becoming a new classic in sci fi. thefoxcub . ice-planet.TV
