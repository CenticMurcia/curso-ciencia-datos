Fine actors in the service of a sad movie. Frontier warfare as imagined by an 8-year-old. Where to start? Colonial troops who carefully refrain from butchering women and children? A colonial America that had no Africans, even in Indian settlements where many lived as free men? Swamps that run for 150 miles along Lake Champlain? Hundreds of natives who run for it whenever confronted by ten Englishmen? Spencer Tracy's girdle?<br /><br />There is one small, mitigating incident that keeps this from being "1 Star" flick: the young, English woman who despises her rescuer. It never occurs to Rogers that this woman might actually prefer to live in a society that grants women real political and personal power.<br /><br />War has become much more real since "Northwest Passage", both on the screen and off. The movies have grown up and I'm glad they did.
