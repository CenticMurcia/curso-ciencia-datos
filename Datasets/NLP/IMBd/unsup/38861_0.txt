Anyone who has given this movie higher than a 5, has never seen any other DBZ film or are just hardcore fanatics. I have been watching the series for over 10 years and seen only 2 other films besides this one. So Im gonna give you a brief list of whats HORRIBLE about this film.<br /><br />First its pretty short, you got all these elements and different stories colliding with each other and being condensed as much as it possibly could be in a 50 minute film.<br /><br />Its not even live action animation, its friggin cartoony as hell and reminded me of when I was 10 years old being amused by the childish pokemon crap, If you watch any other DBZ they barely do that corny Animee face gesture bs, and if they do it its appropriate. In this film they do it too much it gets on your nerves on how fruity it is.<br /><br />If you seen the series you know how long it would take to wear down Goku or Vegeta, in this movie, Goku and Vegeta give up pretty easily and are left to consider their last resort of fusing very shortly after meeting Janemba. Then they fuse and Gogeta fights for about half as long as Goku and Vegeta tried against Janemba.<br /><br />Janemba, what a cool villain, but jeez you barely get a grasp of his character, you don't learn much about him or have the time to really take him in. I know in the Show you get like 40 episodes to take in a villain, but in other movies you get a real good sense of who Cooler or Brolly was, feel their pain and harbor a little bit of their revenge for the sayains.<br /><br />Janemba is more like, "hey I just came out of nowhere, but since I am a threat to the universe I might as well destroy all natural order, hey who are these guys, woops Im dead" Its such a dumb story! Its a real crappy movie TRUST ME! If you guys liked this garbage you have never seen any other DBZ film because this Movie was a huge let down. I cannot believe how many people actually say this is the best DBZ movie ever.
