More gore, more violence, more melodramatics, more of the Candyman yet everything else remains the same. Typical sequel for a horror, yet there is much more blood and guts than an investigation. Much of the acting is more sillier than the original. So is the dialogue (The Candyman himself steps up his silly one-liners a notch). Everything that there was to like in CANDYMAN stays in its sequel.<br /><br />The Candyman is in New Orleans killing people and an innocent man claims he is the killer. Our innocent guy's sister, an elementary teacher is having none of this and does some investigating of her own to find the real killer.<br /><br />The story of Candyman is taken deeper but that is just about all that FAREWELL TO THE FLESH has going for it. Everything is either boring or silly. It has the same sound track from the original. Learning more about the Candyman does not save this over done sequel from falling flat on its face. FAREWELL TO THE FLESH is for anyone who wanted more gruesome acts than the first. Less mind games and more senseless killing are abound.
