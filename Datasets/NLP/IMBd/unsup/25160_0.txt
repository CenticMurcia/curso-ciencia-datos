It may be useful to explain my frame of mind when I saw this movie.... I finished setting up my home theatre about two months ago... and watched over 60 top world movies... Masterpieces such as Amores Perros, Fargo, The Pianist, The Red Violin, Mullholand Dr. etcÂ… you get the point. Then my wife says let's watch an Egyptian Comedy and we get this movie.... The difference is absolutely shocking. I did manage to complete 75% of the movie, and there were some funny parts which made me laugh, but overall it was horrible. No storyline, exaggerated acting, stereotyping of Egyptians and making fun of other cultures were just few of the points that made watching this thing unbearable... This is unfortunate, because I respect Adel Imam for some of his other cinema & theatre work. I also respect him as a person who stood firm on his political and social views.
