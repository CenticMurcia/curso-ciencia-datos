Enjoyed this film and the great acting by Karl Geary (Marvin), who did a great job of acting like a person who had Strickland Disease and had me completing feeling sorry for him. Marvin's big hobby was being a simple PEEPING TOM, who enjoyed watching all his neighbor's, old, young and in between. I think his favorite window to look into was Carmen, (Rebecca Nader), who seemed to get hot and bothered over Marvin and his great hobby of posting pictures all over the wall and especially hers! Marvin's sister Rosy, (Alexis Dziena) was the person who introduced Marvin to Carmen and this of course started a wonderful relationship. There is plenty of mystery concerning the horrible habits of a Judas Bug that gets so hungry he tries to break into the trunk of a car. This film is entertaining and does not need to be put under a microscope and studied, if you don't like the beginning, Turn it Off !
