For all its B-gradeness "A Better Way To Die" is definitely entertaining. It rolls along at a great pace and has a few nice twists and turns. The section with "Flash", played by Joe Pantoliano (Cypher in "The Matrix"), has got a great Stephen King quirky feel to it that, unfortunately, ends all too soon.<br /><br />The action scenes are well thought out, with some very innovative variations on old themes. Considering various attributes that strike this film as a low budget number, the script is surprisingly good, aiming to examine the motivations of the characters a bit more than usual. The cast isn't exactly stellar, but does a convincing job all the same. Lou Diamond Phillips does a good job and there are a few other familiar faces in there like Andre Braugher (Striking Distance).<br /><br />If you like this movie you will probably like "Thursday" (Woods, 1998) which is one of the most under-rated films of its ilk. Don't expect too much from this one though, just suspend all belief and strap in for a good ride!
