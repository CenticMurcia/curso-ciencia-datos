I loved the beginning titles as well as the ending. The music and costumes were stunning! The mansion and special effects were equally stunning! So much work went into this movie and it really shows. I just wish they would have shown the ballroom (Mardi Gras) scene more. I was really looking forward to that and they only showed it for a few seconds. Overall I recommend seeing this movie, it is dry in a couple of parts, but what movie isn't! Also fans of the ride will notice many more correlations to the ride are in The Haunted Mansion than there were in Pirates of the Caribbean. I especially loved the 'Welcome Foolish Mortals'!
