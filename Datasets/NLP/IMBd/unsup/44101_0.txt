Curious...<br /><br />1) Why would a highly-classified government agency, under military purview and overseen by a four star general, give this degree of access to what are clearly anti-government civilians--including one with a known tie to a conspiracy nut in the media--AND give them unrestricted communication to the outside world? <br /><br />2) Especially since the government is willing to covertly murder civilians to protect the project.<br /><br />3) How can a helicopter fly as fast an an F-16? <br /><br />4) How do you get a team composed of EXACTLY one Asian, one Latino, one African-American, one white woman and one homosexual? <br /><br />...and that's just the first hour. It just doesn't pass the common sense test.
