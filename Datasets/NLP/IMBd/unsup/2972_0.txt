I love Ina! She's kind of a snob, but her food always looks excellent! Her house is fabulous and so is the garden! My family and I have made a few recipes and we weren't disappointed. I wonder why the Food Network never includes her in their specials though. I figure she's too good for them! I love that she's not a stick figure too! You can tell she's enjoying life! Her friends seem like they've known her for quite awhile and are always good sports. Some of the things she makes are not very practical, but that's OK. My sisters and I joke about what the perfect meal would be from her, and we always argue because there are so many to choose from!
