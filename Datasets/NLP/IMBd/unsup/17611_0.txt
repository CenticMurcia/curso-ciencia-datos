It focuses around the ground breaking legislation that has Massachusetts at the forefront of this generation's civil rights movement. Put into three very tight, well organized beats, the story opens with ground breaking legislation which brings hope for the future, but has a huge uphill battle. Spawning a need for more gay political leaders, the legislation fuels a grassroots movement to obtain a larger political influence which in the third beat, may or may not turn out the way the viewer would expect. From open to close, this 90 minute feature flows well giving insight to the emotional, political and judicial struggles surrounding gay marriage. Whether the viewer's interest is political, religious, personal or educational, Saving Marriage is a must see.
