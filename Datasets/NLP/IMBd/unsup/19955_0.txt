Very well made, intense, but probably not for the average American stupid pang bang movie lover. I would love to see this movie again, and not just for Monica. The story is original, and portrays very well the real complicated side of doing illegal business, which again is not always James bond 007. All characters are in a state of depression, which thinking about it, appears quite natural. As so often with french movies you need to live yourself into the characters, and not just watch. Of course it has some minor defects, such as a car crash, which no human would ever survive, but these are only details. Probably this movie will have a later US remake.
