Ahmed Khan is a great choreographer. There were some good dances in Fool and Final. Himmesh Reshammia is a great, though a bit annoying, music director and singer. The songs were good and the music was catchy. But apart from this, there wasn't even a single thing that was good in this s**t of a movie.<br /><br />1) A plethora of disgusting characters including the boy not wanted next door Shahid Kapoor, the horrible, sickly hunk Sunny Deol ( save them, someone!), the bumbling, pathetic Ayesha Takia, who was only good in Dor, the always Punjabi idiot of a father, Om Puri, the wasted Sharmila Tagore, the who-is-she? Sameera Reddy, the no use Sunil Pal, the other wasted Viviek Oberoi ( spelling can be wrong as he keeps changing it all the time for good luck in vain), the same faced, tiring Paresh Rawal, the utterly terrible Cunkey Pandey, the unfunny idiot Johnny Lever and hundreds of other characters.<br /><br />2) No good story. Story stinks. Script was terrible. No good joked in the film. Not at all innovative in thinking.<br /><br />3) Why do they have to call Mike Tyson for the film? The idea stinks like rotten tomatoes.<br /><br />4) Bad starting. Why the emotional twinge in between?<br /><br />In short, I request even completely addled minds not to visit this crap of a film.
