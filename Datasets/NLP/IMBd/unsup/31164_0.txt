'Feast' is one of those horror movies that redefine a certain genre.In this case, 'Feast' redefines the man eating monster genre.The monsters in this film snatch up their victims one by one in grizzly and gory fashions.Even a young boy meets his own brutal fate.The monsters move so fast when they kill someone that you can hardly see them.Maybe you can see glimpses of them, but that's about it.Now that was a problem for me.'The Descent' managed to show the monster's faces and they were pretty ugly.In this movie, You can only see their whole face either near the end of the middle or in the end.I must admit that I had some fun with this movie.I will plan on seeing the sequels even though they did not get as good reviews as this one.
