If there are any remaining doubts about the depravity of Hollywood and the total lack of taste in American "culture" this ghastly film is the definitive proof.(And no, I am neither Christian nor conservative.) Oh, it has the occasional chuckle. But it gives the word "gross" new depth and meaning. The sex scenes, done in the style of the drawings one finds around urinals, are enough to turn you off that pastime. I watched it, wondering why I was doing so when I had an excellent book on the go that I could have picked up and why people make movies like this. The final insult came when I discovered here on IMDb that all the women characters are drag queens! Mon dieu!!! The logic escaped me other than that it likely was an immense bitchy put on and did precisely what it was supposed to do: infuriate straights and insult women. Maybe it was big with the gay crowd. After all, they loved "Le Cage Aux Folles." It was very small with me.
