I really don't want to write too much regarding this film, a. because I believe the twist is so over hyped and that I pretty much figured it out 30 mins into the film ..<br /><br />b. I didn't really believe the acting in the film, I'm not saying it was poor, just that me personally don't think that it was realistic decisions made by the main characters throughout the film given the situation.<br /><br />c. The film is only 90 minutes but I honestly felt like I was in there forever, If it wasn't for the fact I had my girlfriend with me I would of walked out I was so bored.<br /><br />But that's my ten pence worth, I could of been more in-depth however I really don't think this film deserves such attention.
