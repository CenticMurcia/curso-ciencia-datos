I must admit that I rented this movie on the premise that I thought it was an independent film. It may very well be independent, but it also is independent of talent in the writing, production value, and acting. I couldn't last more than probably 1/3 of the way through it before I shut it off and went on to my next DVD. <br /><br />The subject matter was interesting, but, was lost on the production quality. Eban came across as creepy and a pedophile. He's a good moper--I'll give him that. Charley was devoid of emotion and basically played the "Lolita" character with all the aplomb of a third rate community theatre actor. The actors playing these roles were way out of their league. <br /><br />*possible spoilers*<br /><br />Some plot questions to ponder: Upon seeing Charley for the first time in the empty coffee shop, Eban goes over to Charley's table and asks if he can sit there. When Charley says it's OK, he sits, but, says nothing...not even and introduction. How realistic is that? Why would Charley have a guitar if he had no clue how to play it? If Charley's father is such a hard ass, how would he ever find the nerve to bring Eban into his bedroom? Having never been to Eban's home prior, when Charley is kicked out--albeit briefly--how did he know where to run? Better yet, which window to go to? And then, after they take a bike ride, go BACK to his house he had just been kicked out of, and return to the bedroom with Eban? <br /><br />I'm sure there are other "plot holes" in this drivel, but, my sanity couldn't allow me to hang out to find them. To call this entire movie hack film making would be an insult to hack film makers everywhere. It was like bad porn with no porn. I happen to be gay, but, refuse to enjoy something simply because its subject matter contains characters that also happen to be gay. If you want to see a great movie you may not have heard of with gay subject matter, might I suggest "White Lilies."
