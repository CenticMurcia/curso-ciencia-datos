I saw this at a film festival in 1988. There were 3 movies being shown. If you sat through all 3, you would get a tee-shirt.<br /><br />This was the last movie. When the projector stopped, everyone cheered and applauded. Then we learned there was another reel. 40 more minutes.<br /><br />Half the audience walked out after 5 hours of bad movies. They just couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />I have my Tee, but had to go through years of therapy to recover from that movie. OK. the therapy comment is a joke, but it was horrid nonetheless. Mondo Trasho is a perfect name for this movie. It definitely falls in line with the trade description act.
