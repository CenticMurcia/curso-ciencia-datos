A decent movie about the Russian crime structures and gang wars to come in power and take control. It could have been better. What I didn't like was some poorly executed action sequences. Others were quite good though. The music during the fights wasn't very suitable IMO - lack of music would be better... What I like was the acting - over the top for some characters as it should have been as they obviously had some issues) and subtle for others ( considered their positions and need to be in control and carefully reconsider every move they make). The presence of Viktor Sukhorukov (Brat 1 and 2) and Aleksandr Baluyev (Oligarkh) was a pleasant surprise. Vyacheslav Razbegayev is also very good as Metis. I liked how the story was telling itself - no needless explanations offending the audience... I was quite confused myself the first half an hour but later everything came clear. It is a macho film, definitely, each one of the characters is pretty tough and wouldn't bend for anybody. By the way - a very strong beginning - it may be rose up my expectations a bit. Overall pretty good, could have been better though.
