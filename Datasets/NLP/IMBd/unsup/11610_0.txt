With his portrayal of Jack Walsh, Robert De Niro proves that he is one of the most versatile actors of our time, this time in a comedy, not his usual genre. However, it is not all laughs: his excellent performance evokes laughter, pity, and frustration with the ease that we have come to expect from him. This film was brilliantly cast and very entertaining. All of the acting, in addition to De Niro, was superb: Yaphet Kotto, John Ashton, Dennis Farina, Joe Pantoliano, and my two favorite goofs "Tony and Joey." Charles Grodin is unarguably in his best role: it seems as if he is essentially playing himself. Do yourself a favor, and watch the uncut version of this gem and you'll be very glad you did.
