...well, as 'Body Melt' indicates - pretty darn bad.<br /><br />I never expected a good movie when I rented it. In fact that's the whole reason I did rent it. After all, as is reiterated numerous times in 'Vanilla Sky' - "the sweet is never as sweet without the sour."<br /><br />But I should have chosen a less sour movie than this to heighten my experience of the sweet.<br /><br />Sometimes you just have to sit back and wonder why anyone would ever make a movie like this. The plot is ridiculously simple and rather dull. The characters are instantly forgettable. In fact, the only thing saving 'Body Melt' from a score of 1 by me is the ludicrous death scenes. Not very creative offhand, but in how many movies can you see a woman's head literally melt into nothing?<br /><br />Rating: 2/10, but only because of the mildly amusing deaths
