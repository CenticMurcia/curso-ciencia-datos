Cartoons are iconic incomplete images that require the viewer to use their imagination. Why does Hollywood insist on turning cartoons into live action which is much more specific in detail. These types of films like Scooby-Doo not only aren't funny because of this but also completely miss the point of the original. Scooby Doo wasn't Scooby because the ghosts were real and Rocky and Bullwinkle are not R & B because the celebrities gushing all over theses cg shadows are real. A real remake of the show's scatological humor would have been at least interesting. This movie was missing many of my favorite characters like time traveling dogs and dashing mounties as well as the Fractured Fairy Tale schmuck. This version was a bad TV movie with none of the show's wit or style. If given a choice between this movie & root canal, choose the dentist. The dialog will even be better.
