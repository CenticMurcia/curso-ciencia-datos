This dark psychological film noir is one of the best debut feature films I've ever seen. Made impressively for less than ten thousand dollars, writer/director Thomas Ikimi managed to craft a unique gem of a movie filled with deep philosophical aspects held strongly together by an intriguing and eventful story that never stops surprising.<br /><br />Whilst working on a very important case involving mobsters and federal agents, lawyer Adam Moses (Christopher M. Russo) finds himself stuck in Limbo where he is essentially trapped in the same hour of time for an eternity. Although the film is in black and white, which adds to its classic film noir style, Adam interacts with some very colourful characters such as Lasloe The Great (Joe Holt) on his journey to try and find a mysterious assassin known only as Ouroboros.<br /><br />Although the actors do a wonderful job in bringing this incredible story to life, they are aided immensely by Andrew David Daniels's score which perfectly accompanies both the film noir style and the eerie darkness that comes with the protagonist's struggle.<br /><br />As I watched the thought provoking opening sequence of Limbo I knew I was about to watch a film the likes of which I'd never seen before. Limbo is a well made, smart movie that grabs the audience's attention from its opening and manages to hold it throughout. Although on the surface Limbo may appear to share similarities with Groundhog Day, the only real thing they have in common is a plot which sees their protagonists trapped in time and the fact that they are both great movies.
