This is by far the best animated version of the Dickens classic. The renderings and animation are dark and mysteriously sketch-like, with none of the shiny flatness that mars most commercial animation. And the script is amazingly faithful in tone to the original.<br /><br />It's sometimes difficult to find on videotape, but it is well worth the effort.
