James Ellroy fans will probably want to check this out. They especially are the ones who should avoid it.<br /><br />Ellroy writes complex, psychologically damaged characters. James W. Harris's screenplay loses all that. It's watered-down and dumbed-down, making this just another average cop thriller.<br /><br />Stick with L.A. CONFIDENTIAL or BROWN'S REQUIEM instead.
