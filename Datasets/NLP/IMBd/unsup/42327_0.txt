I went into this expecting a film on par with Road Trip or Old School...nothing brilliant, just a solid hilarious movie littered with quotable lines and "remember-that-part-when...?" moments. Well, none found here. This movie was just stupid, and I don't mean stupid-funny slapstick style, I mean just plain dumb. The really funny moments, and they were few and far between, were utterly predictable and played out. The story line was also ridiculously clich√©d, lacking any real original twists. Just a rehash of a million other similar movies. Overall I was really just waiting for it to end.<br /><br />I give it a 4 out of 10, not worth buying a ticket for or renting, but decent enough to catch on HBO if there's nothing else on.
