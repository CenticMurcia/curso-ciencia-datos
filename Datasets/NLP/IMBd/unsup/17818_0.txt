Forget "The Last Ride", just watch the historic GTO video, and then return or throw away the DVD. Dennis Hopper and Fred Ward are totally wasted in this preposterous, convoluted high tech nonsense of a film. Starting with the ultra ridiculous scene at the car show, the movie deteriorates with each passing minute. The entire paper thin script seems to have been wrapped around an 85 minute commercial for the 2004 Pontiac GTO. You can hit the fast forward button until the quarry scene, near the end. Then watch for the second best part of the film crashing off the top of the stone quarry. Immediately following is the best part of the film. It's called the credits. - MERK
