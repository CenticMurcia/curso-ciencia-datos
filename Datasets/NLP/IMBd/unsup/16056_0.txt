The best part of the movie was that i rented it expecting a stinker but the library was shutting and my friends were getting irritated and as last choice i got this movie.<br /><br />Well even though this movie was predictable, lacked the hotties that i come to expect in good teen comedies and most of the jokes were very creative but badly executed i really didn't dislike the movie.<br /><br />The 86 minute or something movie was short and sweet and one never really gets bored nor does one have to much fun.<br /><br />The stereotypical fat and horny guy comes across as the only winner in this otherwise listless film.<br /><br />Don't rent this movie in a hurry but if there's absolutely no choice then rent this one at least none of your friends will insult you.
