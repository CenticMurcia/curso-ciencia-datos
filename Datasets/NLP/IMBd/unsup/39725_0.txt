About a third of the way through this terrible terrible film I started to look for at least one thing that I could identify as not annoying or not just plain stupid. I didn't find even a single thing. It didn't even end in a timely manner. Some of the dialog is so painfully bad it beggars explanation of how an actual human wrote it rather than a life-form or intelligence wholly ignorant of our kind. The scenes often transition using effects that remind me of a stupidly done youtube family vacation video made by the youngest spoiled kid using Windows Moviemaker.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie please. The money spent on this production would have been better used investigating flaming poo bags.<br /><br />Oh and they try to pass of Meg Ryan as The Hottest Milf The World Has Ever Seen. She looks like a mouse with two black eyes and a crack habit. Honestly. They even try to pass her off as artificially buxom. There's nothing there! This is just how dumb they think you, the viewer, is.
