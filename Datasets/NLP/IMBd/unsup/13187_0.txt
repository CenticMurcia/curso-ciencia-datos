Dreamer is a fantastic film for all ages. It has humour and also has the amazing ability to make you cry - you can really feel yourself becoming one with the film. It's storyline is amazing and the quality is amazing. I really recommend this film to everybody, especially horse lovers for it gives you an even stronger love for these creatures. Dreamer is highly inspirational and the feeling you have once the film is over is unique. Its almost as if you can achieve your wildest dreams. This is by far one of my favourite movies. The actors in this film play their parts beautifully, you can really bond with the story as each line is said with extreme emotion. It has everything that one person can ask for. However, a warning, this film WILL make you cry! Glorious, happy ending.
