I laughed out loud through much of this movie. The way this movie captures the gender and cultural divides it portrays is right on target. I must say that it enhanced my appreciation of the movie to discover that Julie Delpy's parents played themselves (and, if I understand correctly, the apartment was genuine as well) and Julie Delpy and Adam Goldberg were also involved at one time, and per one interview with Julie Delpy- monogamy was not exactly her strong suit) Julie Delpy has a deft touch with all this and with numerous details (including the rabbit dish episode which I experienced in almost an identical fashion in Italy once, the tourists seeking to travel the path of the Da Vinci code) I love the ambiguous celebratory ending and I love the way the Da Vinci tourists reappear at the end. This movie is not for everyone. I love Paris but found the irreverent take on an "idyllic" trip to Paris to be great, wicked fun!
