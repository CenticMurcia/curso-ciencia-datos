Though I really can't comment about the 'accuracy' of the story as I'm not a follower of the legend, as an entertainment venue I found "First Knight" to be lacking in most everything .... imagination, suspense, believability, emotion, depth, character/plot development, and any discernible dramatic conviction by the actors. I found myself neither liking nor caring about anyone in the film, though not for lack of trying! I kept watching, waiting for something good to happen/appear to make this film appealing, but salvation was a no-show. When the end credits rolled I gave up . . . but not before having to endure one of the most tepid, uninspired ensemble deathbed scenes 'performed' by name-brand actors I've ever seen. Upside of the movie? ... some pretty scenery and a few gorgeous galloping horses. Sad.
