This is one of those film's that you just have to laugh at. The filmmakers' intentions are in the right place. They really do try to make the proceedings terrifying. It's just that there's not a lot to work with here. The dogs are supposed to be scary and while the scenes where they are on the attack have an urgency to them, its just hard picturing these pups as anything but cute and cuddly. Throw in some glowing eyes and really bad fangs and you have the recipe for disaster. The story revolves around some soldiers who accidentally uncover the tomb of Dracula and unleash his servant and dog upon the world. The pair travel to America to find his last living descendant and serve him. Unlike Salem's Lot, Reggie Nalder plays the servant this time instead of the master. All in all this is just one dog of a film.
