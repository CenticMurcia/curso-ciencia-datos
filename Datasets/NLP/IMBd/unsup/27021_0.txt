Andre Braugher delivers the convincing element to carry this picture with his intensity and involvement as Cleveland. A little bloody but it had to be. The hero (Scott Wiper) gets messed up worse than Bruce Willis in a Die Hard Movie. The film is long on action and direction, and if you like a lot of blood (or can get past it to see the rest of the picture) you will like following two or three fairly similar ways to die in this one.
