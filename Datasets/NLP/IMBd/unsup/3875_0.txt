Disney has been making what they call "original" movies now for some time. Seems like the craze has caught on. Now Comedy Central, that place we all go to find old SNL reruns, has made a movie. You would think it be funny. I mean, COMEDY CENTRAL making a movie. I thought wrong. Its really pretty boring. Its about a college student who starts a porn club and the problems he has trouble keeping it going. Its not really funny at all. Ide recommend only watching it if there's nothing else on otherwise go rent something.
