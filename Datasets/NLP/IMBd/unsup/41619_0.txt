I remember first seeing this in 1980 as part of THE HAMMER HOUSE OF HORROR series and everyone was talking about it at school on Monday . I saw it for a second time last night and to be honest it`s not much cop . It`s just another predictable story of a newly wed couple getting lost and spending the night at a creepy mansion that`s owned by a woman with a west country accent and being a horror story it`s always bad news to spend a night at a mansion owned by someone with a west country accent <br /><br />Two things I noticed about watching it for the second time : First up is the very poor budget . Unless I`m imagining it there only seems to be one set used and the set designer hides this fact by using different furniture scene to scene ( I might be wrong of course ) while the werewolf make up is absolutely laughable . Secondly watching it a second time you can`t fail to notice how predictably it all plays out . In many ways the story is structured like a whodunnit and just like any whodunnit it`s only worth watching once at most
