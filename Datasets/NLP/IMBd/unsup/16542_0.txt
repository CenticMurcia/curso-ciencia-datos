I will keep this short. Think of the worst Indian Bollywood film ever made, plus the worst Finnish TV theater ever made, and add a few Troma movies. Then multiply how BAD they are together by 100 and you have how bad "DIS" really is. Nazi Germans Dr. Mengele could not have tortured me worse than this movie did, in the time I watched it. If you still do not get the point...maybe this movie IS something for YOU anyway...<br /><br />What is even worse is this movie is made in my Home Country. And I am in Shame! Shame that my country could turn out such a horrible movie!
