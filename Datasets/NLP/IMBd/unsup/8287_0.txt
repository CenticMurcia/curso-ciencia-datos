So different to most films. This one really does allow the viewer to suspend disbelief. Bogarde is young here and his performance is typical if not brilliant. The film is stolen by the child actors and the director all of whom make wonderful impressions. A weird one parent family then the mother dies. So closely knit are they all and so brainwashed with religious belief, that the children decide to lock themselves away from the world. Then the estranged husband appears with disastrous consequences. Even the ending is excellent
