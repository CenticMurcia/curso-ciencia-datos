It's a bit of a harsh statement, but I personally thought the first episode was awful, not even a smile appeared on my face, in no way was it funny. It was the first programme in a while that I couldn't sit all the way through, I even thought there was funny moments in the 'Green Green Grass' (only fools spin off). With a cast of so much "talent", I thought there might have been at least a glimmer of something good, but no, possibly the worst comedy ever, I was always lead to believe comedies need to be funny. I personally am not a fan of "the league of gentlemen" but I can at least see some funny parts in that but this was so terrible I can't explain anymore. I can only hope that the BBC decides to cancel the show, if all the episodes are as bad as the first it will not be a hard choice. In all fairness, I should have known it was going to be bad as the previews and trailers (usually show best bits) were not funny. Maybe I am being too harsh as this was only the first episode but the whole idea of the pilot is to gain an audience that will continue to watch, so with that episode, i doubt many will watch the rest of the series.<br /><br />This is my opinion but I think it is how the majority will feel in the end.
