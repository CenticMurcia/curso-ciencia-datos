This is a throwback to the horror and action-adventure movies in which the tension is based on the threatened woman who cannot get out of the way of danger because of her passivity, gullibility, or other gender stereotyped disability. Here we are offered a pseudo-psychological explanation having to do with her mother having died (mother-loss rendering her more vulnerable to domination by the medical patriarchy????) She fails to act or to follow through repeatedly (e.g. failing to mention the clue of the two needle holes after she goes out on a limb at the incident review conference, and we are given no clues as to her motivation in taking that risk at that point or in her failure to follow through).<br /><br />Other egregious negative stereotyping in these genres (and in the crime genre) are--- screaming upon finding the corpse, and running from danger being pulled by the man (have you ever tried running holding someone's hand? Dysfunctional!!)
