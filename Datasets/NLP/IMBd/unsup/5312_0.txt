Having been a Mike Leigh fan for along time I always look forward to a new film. I was disappointed with "Topsy Turvey" as it was very unlike his previous films, and you expect, perhaps unfairly, something out of the ordinary from him. I was pleased this was back to his usual style, and it is extraordinary. The quality of acting is unbelievable, the misery and pain of real life never been better shown on screen. It also had many moments of humour that made watching more of a delight than a hardship. Apart from the music being a little too mawkish than was really necessary, this is another Mike Leigh classic to add to his ever growing reputation as Britain's finest film-maker. (9/10)
