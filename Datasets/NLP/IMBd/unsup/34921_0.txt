Oh dear, this is a bad movie. The acting by lead Robert Horton is even more horrible than the monsters. He keeps on repeating the line 'That's an order, Mister' all through the movie.<br /><br />The same year Kubrick made '2001' this movie was released. You can't help wondering what would have happened if Kubrick didn't revolutionized the SF-genre.<br /><br />
