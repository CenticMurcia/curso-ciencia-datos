This mysterious period thriller/horror from genre veteran Jacques Tourneur remains one of the creepiest chillers RKO ever produced. A vicious leopard escapes from a nightclub act and a series of brutal murders begin to take place. Is the leopard the culprit? Tourneur keeps the audience guessing and never lets the secret out till the very end. While the film as a whole may be a bit slow for today's standards, it's main set-pieces (the trapped-in-cemetery scene; the blood behind the locked door sequence; the eyes in the dark scene) retain their shock value. This rare classic is a forgotten gem that should be seen by any fan of classic horror, not least because it reminds one that horror at one time was about more than just bloodsoaked ultra-violence.
