I had read the novel of David Leavitt which this movie is based on just before watching it. I have to say that the novel was great, very well written and full of sincere feelings. Though, the movie is terrible. I can't say if it is because of being a TV movie, because it was made in the early 90's or just bad interpretation. The actors seem all the time to be waiting for the other to give them lines. The only scene I would save is when Jerene and the guys are in the park. A scene that didn't happen in the book. You don't need to have read the book to watch it as you'll follow properly. Though, there are some stuff that you'll miss because you don't have the background explanation. All the story about their past is lost in the film. Though, I would definitely recommend reading the book before watching this so you'll realise it is a very good story but a bad production. I wished I was a cinema director so I'd do a new version. I gave the maximum mark to this because I can't be fair with this. The book is extremely good.
