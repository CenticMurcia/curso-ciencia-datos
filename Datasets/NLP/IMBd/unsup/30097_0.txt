This is by far the best show I have ever seen. The acting is phenomenal, the casting is great, and the writing is out of this world. Each character ties perfectly into the next, and while there can be many different sub plots going on at once, they are all connected somehow, and go together so smoothly. I was hesitant to watch the show, but my friend got me watching it on DVD, and I literally could not wait to toss in the next disk when an episode ended. Give this show a chance, as Keifer Sutherland is fantastic in his role, and the show is an absolute pressure cooker that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
