A re-make of the very popular off-Broadway (and off-off-Broadway) show and 1960 film, Frank Oz's attempt at an off beat musical comes off as silly and ridiculous.<br /><br />In order to enjoy this movie you would have to love musicals, wacky humour and you would also have to forgive the leads' less than impressive voices. Rick Moranis is Seymour Krelborn, a pathetic little shop assistant who discovers an unusual plant with an even more unusual appetite.<br /><br />This is a musical comedy so the plot doesn't matter anyway. Sadly though it does not work as a comedy, and I have never had much time for musicals. Some of Alan Menken's music is quite catchy, especially "Mean, Green Mother", and the scenes involving sadistic dentist Steve Martin and masochistic patient Bill Murray are indeed very humorous. These would have to be the only two pluses though, in a film that is just too corny and stupid to be considered entertaining.<br /><br />Sunday, January 16, 1994 - T.V.
