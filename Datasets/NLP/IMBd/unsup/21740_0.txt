My heading summarizes my thoughts of the film in its entirety. The film is decent on all levels though it never breaks down the barriers of brilliance. The film is directed by Elissa Down and was co-written between her and Jimmy Jack. Elissa Down grew up with an autistic brother which is the main theme of the film. It is directed in a simplistic, true and heartfelt manner which suits the story perfectly. This isn't a film that tries to take on the universal disease that is autism but is a quiet and beautiful film which gives hope to those who watch it as we see a content family that deals with having two sons of similar age. One, our protagonist, is Thomas while the other is his autistic brother Charlie. Thomas is going through adolescence and is having his own troubles like a new girl at school called Jackie. Some scenes hold such emotional power that I found myself in tears. It is worth seeing.
