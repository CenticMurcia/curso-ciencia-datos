Normally I am not the kind of person to get mad about a movie. I either think abuot it as good entertainment - and that's it - or as not worth viewing, well, there go ? 8,-. But this film managed to almost make me scream in pain. If it was just plain bad I wouldn't bother to write this comment. But indeed it had its moments. In fact it was partly brilliant. As the first movie I know it managed to combine some of the best elements of genuine german film-making and big Hollywood cinema. There may be some minor flaws in the storyline, including the fact that one can guess quite early who the real antagonist is. But these are well compensated by a dense storyline, credible characters and a nice amount of gore ^_^ . So much potential. And then... THIS ENDING ?! Did Schwentke run out of money? Brain? Or both? Maybe I am just too dumb to get it, but I felt just unsatisfied and betrayed. And according to the reaction of my friends and the other viewers I was not alone. But anyways, 'trakl' may be right - this film might change the whole way of german film-making in a positive way. Let's hope for the best.
