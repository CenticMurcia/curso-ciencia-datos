Horrible movie. After watching it I read that Mickey Rourke wrote it. This makes sense. Actors all want to be writers, and vice versa. Fortunatly, we don't have to see writers trying to be actors. But we do see certain actors take a stab at writing. Some actors do a great job writing films, others do a horrible job. Like Rourke. Rouke took a stab at modern boxing noir, and stabs the audience with clich√© characters, and dialog that is trying for Cassevettes but is more fitting to an episode of 'Melrose Place'. Rourke is a good actor, but his acting in this film is horrendous. He proves that even if you don't say a word you can still overact. His character is completely unbelievable. He resembles a comic book palooka, has an extended chin, and walks around like he's trying to be menacing, like he's imitating some real life mean looking guy he knew once who wasn't a rich, trouble actor haunted by natural good looks; Rourke would probably give anything in the world to be a born loser with 'nothing to lose'... but then he'd never be able to write and star in films, would he? The characters around him, all having a kick with Rourke's lame dialog somehow (what else can they do?), attempt to keep things afloat. But you cannot save a sinking ship. How is it that a much lower actor, Sly Stallone, can write a ten times better boxing movie, and can act ten times better. The character Rocky Balboa was believable. Rourke's character was not. Even his name was pretentious: Johnny Walker (get it?) I'll repeat: this movie is horrible. The love story is horrible. The action is horrible. The acting is horrible. The music is good, thanks to Eric Clapton. But everything else stinks.
