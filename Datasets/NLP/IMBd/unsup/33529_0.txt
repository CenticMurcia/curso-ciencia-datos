Ping Pong is one of the greatest and most well-directed sports movie ever made. I am quite disappointed Souri Fumihiro's second attempt turned out to be such a failure. The setting of this film was extremely creative and promising. Japan became a closed nation in 2067 in retaliation against international restriction on robotic technology. "In the past 10 years, no one has seen the true Japan" was an extremely impacting quote to begin the story. Unfortunately, things take a downturn once the heroine reaches Japan.<br /><br />====SPOILER BEGINS HERE====<br /><br />Surprisingly, people in Japan was living in a nearly homeless condition, and Tokyo had turned into one large slum. I must say I was a bit disappointed I wouldn't see all the amazing technologies, but it was a nice twist that offered another promising story. What really disappointed me was how there were so many things that didn't make sense. If no one had seen Japan for 10 years and their guard was so perfect, how did Vexille and team so effortlessly infiltrate Japan? The very existence of those "Jags" were way too random and its structure makes absolutely no sense. What was its power source? Why the worm structure? It just felt like they needed a device to show off the computer graphics. Another thing is, how can a company become so powerful that it completely control Japanese government? No amount of corruption can allow virus injection to the entire population. And why, oh, why nobody in the street was surprised to see a white girl walking around, when no foreigner had visited Japan for 10 years? I understand this movie is a science FICTION, but all stories must be plausible. Even SF films must give its viewers acceptable explanations.<br /><br />====SPOILER ENDS HERE====<br /><br />Other than its story, this movie had many other disappointments. Some scenes were excessively cheesy, even for an anime, and other than intro, music choice was very poor. The most disturbing thing was the inconsistency in computer graphics. Background scenes, various machines, and special effects were fascinating, yet all the characters and some other objects were in extremely low quality that reminded me of Playstation polygons. Characters also seemed to be very stiff and movements seemed very unnatural. I know Japanese films have lower budget than American films, but a 2007 3D animated film with less convincing CG than Toy Story is simply unacceptable.
