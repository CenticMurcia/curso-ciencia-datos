Chaplin's first park comedy for Essanay is a rehash of more of the same we've seen before in his park comedies for Keystone. Chaplin flirts with a woman, gets in trouble with her significant other, and the slapstick is on. Although Chaplin again edited, wrote, directed, and starred in this film, there's little to recommend regarding originality from Chaplin. There's the usual unsavory characters thrown in for good measure, one of whom is played by Warner Brothers director Lloyd Bacon. Brick-throwing makes a come back in this film. Being away from Keystone, only one policeman shows up at the end for the usual dousing in a lake. Highlights of the film include Chaplin getting a leg up on Edna Purviance, Chaplin trying to eat sausages out of his breast pocket, and Chaplin winding up for a good swift kick in someone's fanny. *1/2 of 4 stars.
