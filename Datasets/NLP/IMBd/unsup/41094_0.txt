Routine Bette Davis and George Brent film devoted to two reporters, who love each other but work for rival papers, trying to scoop each other on a murder story. Davis becomes very good at searching for clues but Brent is in it to bag the story while getting the news before Garfield. (Davis)<br /><br />As the film goes on, Davis acts as if she is one of her usual no nonsense broad. Rosalind Russell would have been far better for the role; although, Davis does an adequate job as well as Brent.<br /><br />Roscoe Karns provides some funny comic relief as the photographer caught up in mayhem as well.<br /><br />J. Carrol Naish is wasted as the brother of the eventual murderer.<br /><br />This picture probably formed the basis for films such as "His Girl Friday" and reminds me of "The Front Page."
