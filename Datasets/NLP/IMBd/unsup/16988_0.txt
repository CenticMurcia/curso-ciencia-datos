I've read the reviews on this website and can only conclude that the two Johns involved with this movie (Travolta and Woo) must have paid a lot of people a lot of money to register with IMDb and write 10-star reviews to balance out the more valid 1 and 2-star reviews. This movie is absolutely atrocious in every aspect: directing, acting, special effects, dialog, plot-line, you name it. If Travolta were playing his role more tongue-in-cheek and the movie itself were touted as a comedy, then it might be palatable. But the movie and actor both appear to be actually taking themselves seriously, and the result is something that is just dreadful to watch. It took all my strength to actually see it through to the end all the while hoping that something redeeming would happen. It did not. Do not waste your time by seeing this movie. Use the two hours to weed your garden, mow your lawn, change the cat litter, or wash the windows. Any of those things are more enjoyable than sitting through this.
