This is another good animation. Unlike what Bakshi tried to do which was try and make a blockbuster out of a cartoon LOTR, Rankin and Bass just tried and make a nice cartoon that kids can enjoy, and it wound up being excellent.<br /><br />If you read my review on the Hobbit, then you know that the artistry lacks a little. Though, Aragorn looked pretty decent. My only real complaint here is that (spoiler here) Frodo puts on the Ring halfway through the story, when Theoden dies. Although, I suppose it would have been difficult to have it on the correct timeframe since they kind of skipped some stuff that happened in line with the other characters. Also, there is a noteable lack of Gimli and Legolas in here. But then, we might not have wanted to see Legolas since in the Hobbit, they portrayed Elves with blue skin, very long ears and pointy fingers. But on a high note, they did show the reason why Denethor went mad, and that was something PJ hasn't done. <br /><br />In a nutshell, very nicely done, kids'll like it and so will their parents. Like I said with the Hobbit. if you see it on the shelf in a store pick it up. You might be surprised.
