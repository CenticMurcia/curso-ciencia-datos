I thought this was a very poor drama. The setting - a radio telescope station in somewhere remote like Yorkshire was well done, but how come it was able to turn into a fully working molecular biology unit with containment facilities? Ludicrous. And as other commenters have mentioned the completely unrealistic communication with Andromeda. Two characters die with no real explanation. The characters were stereotyped scientists - the geeky one with glasses, the geeky one with a beard, the driven icy female. Oh and the girl, who clearly wasn't qualified to work there, let alone operate the computers. I assume they were all wearing lab coats to show that they were proper scientists - people operating a radio telescope don't usually wear them. It was just silly.
