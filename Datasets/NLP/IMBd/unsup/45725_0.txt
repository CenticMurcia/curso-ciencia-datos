I remember when I first heard about this movie; Seagal, Hopper, and Sizemore in a movie together; it sounded like a fantastic movie! I mean with good actors like that, how could you possibly screw up such a movie?<br /><br />Albert Pyun knows the way.<br /><br />The way this film is put together, it feels like a reject from film school shot and edited this piece. Hmmm, how many times does Seagal walk down the same hall? Or drive up in his pickup truck? Why are half of his lines spoken when he's off camera? What's up with the sound editing when Sizemore is interrogating Pressly? Pyun even managed to screw up the action sequences. Seagal doesn't throw a punch until near the end of this movie, and when he does get some action, the camera is so close in on him, you don't really see the moves.<br /><br />Save yourself the rental fee. If you want to see a decent Seagal action flick, your money is better spent on Exit Wounds.
