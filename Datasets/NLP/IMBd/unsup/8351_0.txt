Compared to all street-gang movies dating back from old to new, boulevard nights is by far the only one that portrays what Hispanic gang-members were really like. So much in fact that Hispanic street gangs of today became that way by imitating the lifestyle in the movie. I am not going to compare this to prison flicks but when it comes to gang flicks it rates way higher than "Colors" or others that I cant think of by name. <br /><br />A must see. As for the actor "Danny Delapaz", he was perfect playing the part of "Chuco" because he wasn't acting, he really is one.<br /><br />I have seen him in person at Low Rider events and He really dresses and talks just like he did in the movie.
