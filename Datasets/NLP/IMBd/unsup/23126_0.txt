While I found this film truly entertaining, it seemed to strive toward getting the sympathy of the viewer. I found myself thinking, "poor Stacy...", when in the end, she chose this way of life and can get out whenever she pleases. That was the strange thing about this documentary, it was not at all objective and seemed to be a way to make Stacy look like a poor girl who got stuck in this career. It was sad to see how she thought about her self image. those callogen implants looked terrible, and her breasts were so large it was sickening. (even after the reduction to the DD from an E), and in all honesty, I couldn't tell the difference after she had liposuction done on her thighs. Why is this?? She was already a petite, gorgeous woman before she had to go and mess with her body.<br /><br />Overall, I found this film interesting and gave it a 7/10.
