In "Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself," a young man - who basically lives from one unsuccessful suicide attempt to another - is looked after and cared for by his brother who is suffering from terminal pancreatic cancer. Moreover, it turns out that the mentally ill brother has designs on the physically ill brother's wife.<br /><br />It may be hard to believe from that synopsis, but "Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself" is actually a comedy.<br /><br />Indeed, "Wilbur," filled as it is with quirky characters and offbeat humor, is reminiscent of other well known Scottish comedies such as "Local Hero" and "Gregory's Girl," albeit this new film is darker and grimmer in its subject matter and theme. For in addition to death and illness, "Wilbur" also deals with the less tragic topics of adultery and unrequited love. Like the best Scottish comedies, this film provides us with a slice-of-life tale filled with ordinary, likable people who may have their weaknesses and eccentricities but who also strike chords of familiarity deep within the viewer.<br /><br />There are beautiful performances by Jamie Sives as Wilbur; Adrian Rawlins as his brother, Harbour; Shirley Henderson as Harbour's's wife, Alice (who is also in love with Wilbur); Lisa McKinlay as Mary, Alice's young daughter, and an assortment of other fine actors and actresses who populate the scene.<br /><br />Although the script threatens to veer off into melodrama and soap opera from time to time, the truthfulness of the writing and the honesty of the acting keep the film real and believable for most of the duration. The quiet conversations amongst the various characters, in which feelings are often hinted at and implied rather than explicitly stated, help to elevate the film above its sometimes contrived and maudlin plot. The movie ends with an ironic twist that shows that one person's death can often lead to a renewal of life for someone else. It's a fitting finale to a film in which one of the themes is the inextricable nature of human relationships, for what happens to one person happens to them all. It's a film that not everyone will surely like, but it is a treat for those in search of something a little bit offbeat and a little bit different.
