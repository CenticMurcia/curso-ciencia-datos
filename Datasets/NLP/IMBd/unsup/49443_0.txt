Witchcraft 10 ended with LAPD Detective Lutz returning home from England, with the papers necessary to join Interpol's Bureau 17 if she wished. In this one, there's no mention of that, so it seems she chose not to do so. She's reunited with her partner Garner, who had stayed home during her trip, as well as her short skirts and high heels.<br /><br />Will Spanner is back, with his fianc√© Kelly Jordan. I'm supposing this is his girlfriend Keli of parts 5, 6, 7, and 9. However, she doesn't seem to remember having met Lutz and Garner before, or having learned of Will's witchcraft skills, which Keli had. Will and Kelly go to visit her atheist sister Colleen at the Catholic college where she is studying drama.<br /><br />Colleen is rehearsing for a role as one of the three witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth "Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and cauldron bubble." In fact, writer/director Ron Ford said his original title for this was Witchcraft XI: The Weird Sisters. Their professor is not pleased with how they perform it, and he and the most assertive of the three women, Keri Burston, feel they should go to a ceremony and perform a real witchcraft ceremony to lend their performance credibility. There, they will try to revive three sisters who'd been executed for witchcraft who had tried to conjure Abaddon and open a gate to hell.<br /><br />The ceremony gives them all an opportunity (one of many) to take their tops off. Naturally, they're spied upon by three horny college guys, and when one of them dies, Detective Lutz and Garner show up to investigate. Meanwhile, the redheaded would-be Shakespearean Maria Fitzwater becomes possessed by one of the witch sisters.<br /><br />Things get worse, and Will and Kelly try to save Colleen, while Lutz and Garner continue to investigate. There's a lot of nudity in this one, from Kelly, the three lovely young college students (I was surprised this appears to be the only film any of the three have been in), and Lutz. There's considerably more blood and gore than most entries in the series, including a face chomping, and someone being torn limb from limb.<br /><br />Certainly not a great movie by any measure, but fairly entertaining, and I've found them to grow on me a bit the more titles in the series I see. Acting in this one isn't as bad as in some of the other later titles. There's a curious cameo by early film star Anita Page as a nun who knows something about the three witches; IMDb's page for her has a number of photos of her from the '20s and '30s. The sound is definitely better, with the dialogue being pretty clear at all times, whereas in some others it was poorly recorded or drowned by the soundtrack.
