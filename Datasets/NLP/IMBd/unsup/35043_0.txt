A typical Hollywoodesque formula comedy/drama sports feel-good schmaltz - but this time from the usually more offbeat Aussies. Complete with an awful, overly sentimental soundtrack next to which even Coldplay seem lively and heavy. The female part of the cast is interesting/good, but the male part, which dominates due to the subject matter, is quite apathetic - which is weird considering that they all play Aussie-rules rugby; one would think they'd have more life in them than to constantly mope around, looking depressed. The movie uses all the clich√©s and plot-devices that there are in order to hopefully press all the "right" sob-buttons, which makes me wonder for whom this movie was made. Women? Well, I certainly don't see guys getting excited about this story, except if they're similarly goofy misfits like most of the rugby-playing protagonists here. We've got a girl with asthma, a semi-retarded gentle giant, an old man in a nursing home, a player's girlfriend in jail, unemployed bums and a drug-addict seeking a new chance in life, and then the obligatory big-match finale. You get the picture.
