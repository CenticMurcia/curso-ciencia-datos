'Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire' is a film typical of this time of year; award season.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's the only reason Lee Daniels made this picture; to scoop sympathetic awards from the Oscar and Golden Globe panels.<br /><br />'Precious' is a shallow, cold-hearted film that basically a two-hour advert for child abuse, it's a sick way to guilt-trip Western audiences into donating money to charities and other money-squeezing organizations.<br /><br />They even had the cheek to get Oprah Winfrey to present the film which tells the audience only one thing; we want your money.<br /><br />It's a disgusting picture that deserves no awards and no praise. It's utter self-obsessed rubbish that made me angry to watch, it makes the audience feel responsible for Precious' appalling lifestyle.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's very well performed, Mo'Nique is quite extraordinary but she doesn't deserve the Oscar, that should go to Anna Kendrick for 'Up in the Air', but sadly that won't happen.<br /><br />And what's up all this stuff about it being uplifting and heart-warming? Have you actually watched the film? She's obese, illiterate, a victim of incest rape, pregnant, beaten, and she gets AIDS? Yeah, mega uplifting. It's hardly believable too.<br /><br />All in all, I really don't get why people are raving this film so much, it's long-winded, dire, depressing and frustrating.<br /><br />The only reason I've given it 2 stars is because of the performances.<br /><br />Just diabolical.
