...but when was the last time you saw Richard Farnsworth and metal queen Lita Ford in the same movie? Vacuous young lovers driving through the Nevada desert meet up with a demon cop who abducts the girl to Hell City. Low-budget, would-be cult item needed a lot more imagination and drive (and finance) to succeed. Straight-to-tape cheapie does have a few genuine highlights: I liked the demon policeman and his fire-breathing car, Chad Lowe's dog was kinda cute, and of course music-vixen Lita Ford's fun cameo as a sexy hitchhiker from Hates. This was something of a family affair for the Jerry Stiller clan, featuring curious appearances from Jerry, his wife Anne Meara, and their kids, Ben and Amy Stiller. *1/2 from ****
