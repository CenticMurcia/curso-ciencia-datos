I really happened to like Daffy Duck For President, I believe this is the greatest Looney Tune short done in the last decade at least. The short stars Daffy and Bugs Bunny in a debate about what the president really does and why. While the short goes on Daffy attempts to become the next president trying pass a law for rabbit season to last twelve months a year. This law is of course ridiculous and shows why the president can never really pass such ridiculous things, because of the system. Throughout this educational cartoon we are given a true example of why we have this system. At the end of the short Bugs breaks it down for us, telling about the three branches of Congress and how it works. Great Job A+, If I could give an A++ I would...............Maybe I would even give it an A+++.....if I could.
