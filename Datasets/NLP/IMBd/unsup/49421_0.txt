This was far too one sided to be called a "documentary." Really, it was more like propaganda! A little less "evil corporation" and a few more actual facts -- from BOTH sides -- would have made this a far more informational, effective film. After viewing it, I'm just insulted that the makers think I'm so lacking in intelligence that they can present this to me as a "documentary" with no questions asked. It is very obviously an opinion piece; label it as such! There are obvious appeals to emotion throughout the film; they could have been left out, and it would have raised the quality dramatically. There are several valid points made throughout the film of the problems that arise in corporations; it is disappointing that the makers felt the need to cloud those points with foggy emotional appeals. If they believe corporations to be so evil, present the whole story and I should be able to figure that out for myself.
