Wow, this has got to be one of the most ambitiously godawful flicks I have ever laid eyes on. Made for a budget of about $3.89 with some of the most hilarious techno-babble ever caught on film. Our hero is a tall,skinny, rat-faced redneck with a dubbed voice. His sidekick is a skunkhaired testosterone filled she-beast with a dubbed voice. Throw in a fat waddling robot cop, a wisecracking robot, an incompetent "Indian" janitor, and a gal who agrees to drive around for 14 hours to help our heroes and you have one of the worst movies ever made. Try not to throw yourself over the nearest highway overpass after watching this.
