When I began watching this, I thought it was pretty strange. I wasn't going to sit through the whole thing but I decided to, since I really had nothing else to do, but I'm glad I did. It's pretty different, to say the least. But it left me feeling happy and satisfied.<br /><br />Silverstone's acting, in my opinion, is mediocre. I've never been a big fan of hers. I don't know what it is about her, she just rubs me the wrong way. Del Toro, however, aces it, as per usual. (I love his dark, brooding eyes and the way he mumbles. Maybe it's just me :P )<br /><br />All in all, I recommend it. Even if you're a little skeptical at first, try it out.
