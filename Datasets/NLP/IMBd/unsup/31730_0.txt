This is the type of goofy, sexy romp Cinemax used to show on weekends in the 80's (before they switched to soft porn). It's not going to rank up there with Dr. Strangelove or Tootsie, but it's good for some silly fun. The lead actress Julia Lehman is very cute, and I hope to see more of her. If you enjoyed the teen comedies of the 80s like Weird Science, Screwballs, HOTS, and Loose Screws, this is a movie for you. It's a bit short; they could have added some more scenes away from the primary two locations and spent more time at the webcast house. I would recommend it for a weekend rental. If you like silly laughs to counter all the serious dramas flooding the market and to take the edge off the rat race, this is a good movie.
