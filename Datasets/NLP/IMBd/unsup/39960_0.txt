This show was terrible its its final years. Daryl Somers refused to change the format of the show (like the bosses/fans kept telling him he should) and so it got axed (yet he was still suprised).<br /><br />Whenever a side kick would get more popular then Daryl he would kick them off the show. He did this to Denise Drysdale because she was simply to funny, so anyhow he then decided to put blonde bimbos as his co-hosts on the show instead (they were really REALLY dim)<br /><br />I will give the show credit for unveiling alot of talent on its RED faces segemnt (this was a segment EXACTLY the same as The Gong Show from America)but beyond that it was pathetic.<br /><br />Actually the show was mentioned to Jay Leno once and he said " what a stupid name for a show, whats next run run its Monday. LOL This was actually show to Daryl during the show and he obviously wasnt expecting it by the look on his face. He was talking up Leno beforehand saying what a great guys he was and all this. You should have seen the look on his face what a classic!
