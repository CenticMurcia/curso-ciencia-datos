This was a wonderful but doomed series. I loved and saw every episode and really regret that it was canceled so quickly. Either than means I have terrible taste or America just "didn't get it". I think it was the latter, as a lot of the skits had clever writing and I still laugh about them. There were a lot of high-powered guests on the show, but people just didn't know or care who Thomas was--except for some die-hard Doug & Bob and SCTV fans. I really loved the skit about the three super-scared guys who make an air flight miserable for everyone because they are scared of EVERYTHING--the punch line about the film YENTIL was priceless.
