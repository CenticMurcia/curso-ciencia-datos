On watching, I found the storyline of this production rather fanciful. It reads well as a synopsis but feel that emotional immaturity of the production has been reflected in rather major flaws in the logic of the plot and consequent over dramatisation by actors that would, under other directorship, produced sterling performances.<br /><br />There is, of course, a place for fantasy in British film, but this is sold as a true-to life story and, in my opinion fails to reach the level that we should expect of young film writers and producers, such as those from Kewhaven, in Britain.<br /><br />Im sorry, but I really do find it hard to believe that this film nominated for an award and would suggest that viewers modify their expectations if they are anticipating an award winning feature when booking to see.
