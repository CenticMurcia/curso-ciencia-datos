Good god this show deviates hugely from the comic book and movie. In fact I liked this this TV show the first time round when it was called sliders.<br /><br />SCI FI give the money to star gate Atlantis or for another Babylon 5 movie. But 22 episodes of a sliders rip off.<br /><br />I don't even want to say its flash Gordon I mean he is just a small town athlete, nothing that great and he is trying to save his father.<br /><br />OH the acting sucks as well.<br /><br />They could of at least used the music from queen and tried to make it campy. But nope.
