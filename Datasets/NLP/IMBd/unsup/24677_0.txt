Recently, I have studied for one semester at a university in London and therefor I was very keen to see "Wonderland" when I got back to Germany. Unfortunately, I have just seen the german dubbed version but even without the english dialogue I recognized the London that I had experienced.<br /><br />The plot is similar to the films of Robert Altman as it is about a group of people who are all linked together, and the film follows the everyday life of these figures for a certain amount of time. In the case of "Wonderland" it is the family bond that unites the characters. In the centre of the constellation are the three sisters Molly, Debbie and Nadia.<br /><br />"Wonderland" is sometimes quite depressing as we see the problems that all the characters have to face, and as director Michael Winterbottom shows us how all of the pair relationships in the film form a very own kind of private hell. This is not presented in Hollywood style where even pain looks glamorous. "Wonderland" is very close to life, no stylization. Most of the film (if not everything) has been filmed with a hand camera on location on London streets, pubs, flats, etc. and indeed, when you have ever been to London (or England) for a longer period of time than you will be able to see that story and characters could happen everyday in everybody's life.
