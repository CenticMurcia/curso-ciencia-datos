I had heard a lot of good things about this movie and went with the intention of liking it - but it just didn't work for me. After reading the other reviews, I don't agree that this is a movie that PETA would love since it portrays an animal rights activist as an embezzling, slightly deranged loner who mistreats the dogs in her care and has no life, no friends, etc. Peggy didn't appeal to the dog lover in me either - she was the one who left her dog out all night, neglected to repair the hole in her fence, mistreated all the dogs she supposedly 'rescued'. I thought the other characters were more finely drawn and better portrayed as well, especially Laura Dern's Brett and Peter Saarsgard's Newt. Molly Shannon's acting ability seemed to be confined to keeping a fairly gruesome expression on her face - not much fun to look at for 90+ minutes - and it never changed whether she was sad, worried, concerned, happy.
