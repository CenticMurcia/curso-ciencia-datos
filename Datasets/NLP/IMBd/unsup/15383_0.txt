this show has been type-casted as the Sopranos on daytime TV. But i think this show is as good or if not better than the Sopranos. Kingpin is much more stylish with the camera and music then the Sopranos is and Kingpin hardly eases up there is constant action going on on screen. This show was made to be aired on Cable for the drug and violent content and i do believe this show could of beat out the Sopranos if it was made into a regular T.V. series and if it wasn't so restricted on content, overall if you like the Sopranos then you are more than likely love kingpin and even if you don't like the Sopranos you should give it a try for the massive amount of raw energy put in this TV Show.
