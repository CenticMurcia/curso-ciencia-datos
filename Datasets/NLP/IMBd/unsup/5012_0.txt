I'll admit that when I first turned on ABC family at 8 I was a bit skeptical about this movie. It looked like a cute romantic comedy though and there was nothing much on other than an "Alias" repeat and a repeat of the Lifetime show "The Division" so I settled down on my bed to watch it and I was quite surprised at how good it was. The characters worked well, Sarah Rue(I don't know how she spells her name)and Carley Pope both amazed me with their talent. Brian A. Green was somewhat of a new face to me. I had never seen him before in a movie or anything so I was suprised with his performance as well. Overall a good expiernce for a "TV" movie, I think had it been released at the box office it would have been medicore, but TV movies are never as good at box office hits.
