I think what makes this film great is its timeless music.Hridaynath Mangeshkar came up with a masterpiece with Lekin. The story provided the backdrop for a classical Hindustani-based music score and the result is a combination of hummable folk songs and classical numbers which are pure magic. The songs definitely add on to the story, but have such strong character themselves that they have their own identity even outside the film. <br /><br />Asha Bhonsle's 'Jhoothe Naina Bole' is my personal favorite.The sting she manages to put in the song is unparalleled.The beautiful rendition by Asha does justice to the music and to the words. <br /><br />So even if you do or do not manage to see this movie,do NOT miss the music, since that is bound to stay with you longer.
