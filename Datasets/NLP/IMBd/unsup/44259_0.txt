The first Ninja Turtle movie was a classic; the first sequel however was okay but tried to hard to be family-friendly. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III however didn't belong to be in the theaters or be watched since it lost all the darkness of the original and concentrated on cuteness and having children involved.<br /><br />The plot of TMNT III deals with the ninja turtles going back in time after finding a device that takes the turtles all the way to 1800 Japan where a war is going on. It takes their news reporter friend April (Paige Turco) with them while back in New York the humans from Japan who have another time device are in a bit of surprise when they realize they're not at home. With the turtles in Japan, they befriend many of the townspeople with tough turtle Raphael being a pal to young Yoshi while Michaelangelo finds love.<br /><br />While I was glad to hear Corey Feldman's voice as Donatello after his absence from the first sequel due to the drugs along with seeing Elias Koteas as the crazed Casey Jones, the film wasn't the same. Josh Pais who voiced the tough guy Raphael is replaced with another actor; April doesn't have much to do but be the damsel in distress. The costumes are just as freaky like puppets that you'll probably have nightmares after watching this movie.
