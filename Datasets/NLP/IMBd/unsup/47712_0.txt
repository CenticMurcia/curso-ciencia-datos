I think the creators of "7th Heaven" really need to look up the definition of Didactic.<br /><br />I'm a strong believer in the idea that a TV episode ought to have something to say. A message or theme perhaps. Now 7th heaven tries very hard to do this. Each episode ends with some kind of very special lesson that everyone learns. But that's my problem with the show. If you have something to say on TV, don't tell us with your voice. Show it to us with your story. That is one power of story telling - to teach us by drawing us into an experience where we can explore ideas and grow.<br /><br />What I'm saying is, 7th heaven is too preachy. They don't even try to work on the whole story. They just concentrate on getting their message across. But the medium that this message travels upon is just as important as the message itself and that's where the show falls short. Instead of being presented with a real family we get robotic stereotypes who only exist to communicate a frank moral. It's just hard to believe the shows message when the characters are unrealistic (they have 5 year old kids on the show that talk like they are at a theological seminary. And the adult characters - their behavior is so predictable, and their emotions so ingenuine.) and the story lines are too sensational to speak to the human condition (I remember one episode where every character had to have an addiction to something. Even the little girl was addicted to chewing gum or something. The moral: Addictions are bad. *o rly? no wai!*...).<br /><br />I would like to see this show start making real art. Mabey make some real characters next time. And try not to make their preachy morals so obvious. If you want to communicate and idea or a value to someone, you cant tell them. People don't want to be told things. You have to connect with them, and share an experience. This pathetic, maudlin excuse for a show just cant seem to do this, and thats why I'm rating this show a 1.
