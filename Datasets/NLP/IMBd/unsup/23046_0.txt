chased this little gem down, had to buy it on DVD and closest place to purchase was America. lovely film.. saw it years ago on TV and always wanted to share the experience with friends that never got an opportunity to watch it themselves.never have i forgotten the story or the film's name , waited years to see would it appear on TV again. i honestly never considered buying it on DVD. have a packet of hankies ready as even a brute like me shed a tear at the twist in the story line. a real Christmas story, very true to life with a lesson for everyone. you would never catch the twist near the end. being placed in a similar situation to the characters in the movie it is easy to see how quick it would be to pre-judge somebody without knowing all the facts.this film first appeared in 1988 (ian Barry), be careful there are similarly named movies out there.....
