I recommend the series to everyone interested in Russian culture and literature. Myself I have been waiting for such a masterpiece for a long time! The characters and the atmosphere created exactly like in the book -exactly how I wanted to see them! Apart from everything visible you can read more between the lines, specially if you are familiar with Russian history and the social relations in the past.Reality is not shown too clearly - but it is all on purpose because the author's and the director's idea was to show a grotesque,rather than a document. Every detail has a meaning here,so...open your mind!
