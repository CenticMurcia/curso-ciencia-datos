Ginger Rogers stars as a pending bride who's noted for leaving her suitor(s) at the altar. But this time, she's sure of her decision...until a new suitor, literally, shows up in her dreams.<br /><br />Although I don't believe something like this could REALLY happen, I was in the mood for something light and I ended up watching this. I've never been a big fan of the old movies, but I saw "Chicago" with Gere, Zellweger, and Zeta-Jones and then saw the film "Roxie Hart" (1927) with Ginger Rogers, and kind of liked the campy comedy that this film portrayed, so I keep an eye out for her on TCM and whenever I stumble across one of her films, I try and watch them. As I said, I don't believe the premise of the film could ever happen, but the way Ginger looks at Cornel Wilde is believable and, although it's probably with more infatuation than love, I know every guy wishes for a girl to look at him that way.<br /><br />The story won't necessarily keep you enthralled, but your wondering how they're gonna get out of this predicament will! 8 out of 10 stars!
