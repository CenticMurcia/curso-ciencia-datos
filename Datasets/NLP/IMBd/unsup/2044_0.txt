"Son of Dracula" is another fine movie from the Universal Studio horror series. Although I wouldn't rate this as high as "Dracula's Daughter", the film does have it's moments. It has a good cast, including Lon Chaney, Jr. as Dracula. Yeah, he seems miscast but he portrays a menacing vampire. J. Edward Bromberg and Frank Craven also stand out as they hunt down Dracula.This was the first vampire film to use Alucard as an anagram of Dracula. I thought it was pretty cool. There are some good scenes where Dracula and his bride turn into mist and the bat transformations were also well done. The story has Dracula being invited to a plantation. He really is securing a home to start to bleed our country dry. An interesting touch was Dracula's coffin floating to the top of a swamp and Dracula coming out as a mist and transforming into his form as a man. This was really original. His destruction is typical vampire stuff. The ending where Dracula's bride is killed is very touching. A nice film to add to your vampire collection.
