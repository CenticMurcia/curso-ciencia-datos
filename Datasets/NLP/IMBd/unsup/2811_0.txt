Apart from possibly being a tad sacrilegious, this is a truly bizarre and amazing film--one that can't really be compared to anything you've seen before (and probably ever will see). For me, this is a huge plus, as all too often films seem derivative and dull--two words that cannot be applied to DEATH TO THE TINMAN.<br /><br />However, there is a serious problem with any review of this TINMAN short film. Trying to describe it is practically impossible unless you give a very, very long and exhaustive summary AND if you do this, it will spoil all the many weird twists. Suffice to say that it's an odd little fairytale that will either make you laugh or possibly make your head explode if you try to think it out too much! Believe me--this is definitely a "turn off your brain and just enjoy" short film!! Extremely creative, funny and twisted--this is one cool little film.
