This is BY FAR the best Bruce Lee documentary I have ever seen for two reasons: they consentrate on more of his philosophical beliefs rather than his life story, and they show GAME OF DEATH!!! That was the real reason I watched it. They found Bruce Lee's original outline and stunt moves for the film, and also all of the footage cut for the 1979 version. They put it all together now in the order it was supposed to be in and the result is AWESOME!! The nunchakaus scene is sweet! And the fight with Kareem is cool as well. A must-see for any Bruce Lee fan.
