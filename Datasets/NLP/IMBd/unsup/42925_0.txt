I rarely comment on movies. However, this one drew the lucky card. I am not sure if the director has ever seen a western created in the last half century. The story line was going to be "iffy" at best. However, the movies starts with a chase scene that has the "posse" hot on the trail of the "bandits". The posse is shooting and riding. Of course, they are riding in a fairly straight line. Tough to be the first guy in the posse if your third guy in line is shooting at a moving target in front of you. Then, magically, the posse stops. Did they run out of bullets? Who knows? The good thing is that the hard-riding bandits clothes were not dirty at all. Whew! I thought for sure that hard riding would have caused a little sweat and dust to collect.<br /><br />The movie continued but really did not develop into a story that could be followed or believed. For a High School Project, it would not be a bad attempt. For a project distributed by ThinkFilm, it left a lot to be desired. I will keep an eye out for more projects from Jeff Hathcock and be sure to avoid them.
