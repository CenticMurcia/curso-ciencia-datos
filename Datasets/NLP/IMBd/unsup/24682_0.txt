It's hard to concentrate on the many worthy aspects of this film (the naturalistic acting, unvarnished inner London) when trying to keep one's stomach settled. The hand-held camera thing is getting a little old (at least for me) and when combined with the arty fuzziness and the lousy print (Odeon Victoria) I couldn't enjoy this the way I should have. Great to see Canadian Molly Parker carrying off her role with aplomb, however, and Ian Hart remains as convincing as ever. In fact, every actor is superb. Think I'll try this on video on my 20" telly...
