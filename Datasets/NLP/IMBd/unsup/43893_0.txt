This movie is so bad I don't know where to begin! First of all anyone can act better than Tori Spelling! She should thank the heavens above for her last name! She is not even a C rated actress whose limited looks can even help her! This plot was awful, uninteresting and the movie looked like it took about a day and a half to film! It did look much like a bad comedy with no climactic scenes at all!I was laughing out loud when her and the psychic had the "silent" conversation with each other! When Dean McDermott is the best actor( by a long shot)in the movie you know its a stinker! Has this guy ever made a good flick? He is nothing more than a male gold-digger using Tori for exposure because you can NOT convince me that he finds her the least bit attractive! They both suck and I hope they never make another movie again(especially together)!
