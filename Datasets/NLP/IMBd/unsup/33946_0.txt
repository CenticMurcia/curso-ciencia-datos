A film about grotesques. Couldn't believe that any of them were real people - or based on real people. So there was no sympathy towards any of them. They were cartoon characters. There was no intelligence. No humanity. No warmth. No real life in it - or them. It was all desperately dreary. Walked out of the cinema after the group session to select the contenders for the Comedy Award. I know it was supposed to be a satire on the types who get on such committees but it was so lacking in any bite it was just depressing. Setting up wooden targets to knock them down. Who cares? A real disappointment. Has put me off ever going anywhere near the Edinburgh Festival. They should sue for misrepresentation..
