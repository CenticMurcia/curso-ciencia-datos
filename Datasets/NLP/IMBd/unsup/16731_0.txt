After the long success of The Simpsons, Matt Groening and his cartoon creators decided to make another successful series, and they did. Some pizza delivery guy named Philip J. "Fry" (Bill West) accidentally freezes himself for 1000 years and wakes up in the 30th century. In this new world he befriends his great, great, great (you get the idea) nephew, clever Prof. Hubert J. Farnsworth (West), the weird and funny Dr. Zoidberg (West), the cyclops Turanga Leela (Katey Sagal), Amy Wong (Lauren Tom), Hermes Conrad (Phil LaMarr) and of course, the best character, similar to Homer Simpson, Bender the robot (John DiMaggio). Throughout the show they have many weird and wonderful adventures of futuristic and funny proportions. Guests included Frank Welker, Leonard Nimoy, Pamela Anderson, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta, John Goodman, Conan O'Brien, Parker Posey, Al Gore, Stephen Hawking, Hank Azaria, Lucy Liu, William Shatner, Jonathan Frakes and Roseanne Barr. Groening has done a very good job of creating another watchable cartoon. It won the Emmys for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour) (also nominated 4 times) and twice for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation, and it was nominated for Outstanding Music and Lyrics. It was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!
