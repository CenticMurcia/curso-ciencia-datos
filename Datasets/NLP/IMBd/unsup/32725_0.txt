"Tracks" is supposed to be about young teenagers 14 to 16 years of age being tried as adults and placed in an adult jail. Chris Gunn just doesn't look the part. He is too old, and this deprives the film of any impact. America has a reputation of being cruel towards juveniles. There is the possibility of a story along these lines, but the film doesn't manage to come across. There is a sexual harassment scene, and a couple of fights - almost compulsory stereotypes in this sort of story. But it is boring, boring, boring. The 'David and Goliath' factor, where a young and fragile hero goes up against a powerful brute villain is missing completely. There must be many young teenage actors who could do the part successfully. "Salems Lot" and "Dune" had the same problem. When will producers learn?
