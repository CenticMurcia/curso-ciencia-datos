Firstly, I just want to say that that I did not dole out that score lightly. This film was charming, funny, compassionate and really well scripted. The story isn't ground breaking and the little IMDb summary sums it up nicely. I just thought the performances and characterisation were excellent. I would have given it 10/10 but I felt James VanDer Beek as the popular but mean jock was a bit too two dimensional. Believe it or not the key reason I saw it was due to the clip of a dance I saw on Film'96 with the Mazzy Star song 'Fade Into You' being played. This song is exquisite, and they also used Love Spit Love's 'Am I right' in the movie. I go with my gut instinct a lot with films and I was not disappointed. I know this was a small release but I honestly think if you trust me on this one you won't regret it. Angus is a lovely gem of a film for anyone who wanted a movie were the boy with a heart of gold gets to have his day.
