Did you just have no ideas of your own? I asked this, because I recently saw another UK film called "Stranger from Venus", which was a cheap knockoff of "The Day the Earth Stood Still".<br /><br />This movie was obviously influenced by both the American "Beast from 20,000" fathoms and the Japanese "Gojira" (Or as he is known in America as "Godzilla".) The monster, mutated by atomic bomb tests, has the ability to spew radiation at its victims. Brought to life by Willis O'Brien (who did the FX for "King Kong" and whose protégé, Ray Harryhousen, animated the "Beast/20,000 Fathoms")the monster doesn't really look that good. In some parts, a hand puppet was used for its neck.<br /><br />The pacing is typical for this kind of movie. Strange things are occurring in remote sea-side villages until the monster makes its debut in a big city, and has a fight to the death with the military. Other than that, you have a bunch of British actors who show a little too much English reserve. For crying out loud people, there's a big giant lizard wrecking your capital! Try to act like you kind of care.<br /><br />The movie ends with a news bulletin that fish washed up all along the Ameican shore, meaning you Yanks are about to get yours. <br /><br />Another movie that proves the MST3K guys ended their work too soon. So many movies to lampoon, so little time.
