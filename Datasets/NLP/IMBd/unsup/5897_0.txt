First, I was attracted by the trailer but I never thought it would be that good I just thought of normal time travel movie and it was a very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The story is complicated but somehow still easy to follow. Even though the film is thoroughly enjoyable, the constant skips back and forth through time are rather mind-boggling. The complex ideas of time travel are interesting and well entwined into the love story.<br /><br />It shows the reality of a relationship between two individuals who have to deal with the negative effects of time travel in a close relationship.<br /><br />Actually nothing to say would make you understand how great this movie is and you don't even need to read the reviews before you watch it, All you need to do right now is to watch it because seeing this movie is a MUST.
