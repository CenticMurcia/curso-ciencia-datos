Soooooo freaking funny. Everything from Brooke Sheilds weeding, to the View, I have never laughed so hard in my life. A must see for anybody who likes comedy. Kathy is so funny, and completely destroys famous people, telling it like it is! Anybody who hasn't seen this DVD must go out and buy it. She also includes her trip on a USO tour to the middle east. This is also the perfect DVD to show to somebody who has never seen Kathy before! If you wish to hear about Brook Shields mom, getting drunk at her daughters weeding, groping Kathy, molesting Kathys husband before calling the grooms mother "a really nasty word" then this is the DVD for you. And thats only about 10 min of the DVD, imagine what else is on it (Its over an hour)!
