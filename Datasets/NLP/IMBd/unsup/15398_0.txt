Having lived many years in Acadiana, I can tell you that this is a beautiful depiction of the immense grace of the area during the forties. The film is not great drama, but the mystery and immense beauty of the bayou is authentic. Joseph Boudreaux, the boy in the movie will melt your heart with his lovely presence and Cajun ways.<br /><br />Thankfully, this film was placed in the archives of the National Library of Congress in the nineties. The restoration is exquisite! I, for one, am thankful that this monumental tribute to the true Cajun people, as they once were, has been resurrected.<br /><br />Much of what you will see in this film is, sadly, gone forever. There will never be another tribute to Acadiana like Louisiana Story!
