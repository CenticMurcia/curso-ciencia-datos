For the horror fans in the crowd, even the fringe fans, this is an enjoyable movie. Sure, it's low budget, it pays homage to other B-movies and the acting isn't going to win any Oscars. For all that, it does a decent job of entertaining with the premise of rednecks battling zombies.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of sleaze; only one scene with minor nudity, nor does the gore go over the top, so it isn't a schlockfest. The characters seem to be enjoying their roles, the dialogue was semi-witty, the production values better than many movies in the genre. It looks like a movie that was fun to work on.<br /><br />Good enough for zombie fans? Yes, indeed, the zombies are quite acceptable in this movie and act according to the standard model of zombie behavior. They lurch, drool, bite and bleed like zombies should.<br /><br />This is a beer and chips movie, without doubt. Enjoy it with your friends and some snacks. Break out the stash first and you'll be rating it up there with The Godfather.
