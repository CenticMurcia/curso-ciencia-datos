After the excellent Land Before Time 3, this fourth film comes as a disappointment. It involves Littlefoot and his friends setting off into the land of the mists to find the cure for his grandfather's illness. Also thrown in is a female young Brontosaurus. The concept of ignoring or forgetting friends for the sake of innocent love is the only interesting thing this sorry mess has to offer. It lasts the same amount of time as the other Land Before Time films but seems longer due to the plodding, uninspiring plot.<br /><br />Another major problem is the film's villains, the weakest yet. Instead of dinosaurs all we get is a rather uninspiring crocodile and an even more uninspiring bird which wants to kill Littlefoot and company for reasons best known to itself.<br /><br />The one really good thing about this waste of time is that you don't need to have watched it to understand the next film in the series and can therefore skip this pointless plodder and move straight on to the far superior Land Before Time 5.
