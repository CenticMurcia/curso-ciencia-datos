A wonderfully done historical biography of the Austrian girl who eventually became the ill-fated queen of France during the French Revolution. Elegant, lavish production that spares no expense in flamboyant period costumes and majestic sets.<br /><br />Norma Shearer is magnificent in her portrayal of Marie from age 14, when she was betrothed to the future Louis XVI, through their awkward marriage, and the years of their monarchy, culminating with their tragic destiny. Shearer's Marie is a sympathetic character, a victim of her circumstances. She is not the self-indulgent Marie with a taste for extravagance, and a patronizing attitude towards the people. She doesn't utter the phrase often attributed to her, "Let them eat cake." Instead, she is the victim of Court politics and intrigue designed to falsely implicate her as an insensitive, distant, and selfish monster.<br /><br />Robert Morley is perfect in his role as the inept king who ascends to the throne at an early age, and probably lacked the smarts and the intestinal fortitude to perform the duties of a monarch no matter what age he had become king. Even though history paints him as inept and weak, the movie gives a heart to this unfortunate man (as it does for Marie) that evokes compassion and understanding. Although Marie's lover only existed in the tongue of gossip, the sequences with Tyrone Power added a passionate romantic flavor to the story, a definite plus with its dramatic contrast to the understated Marie/Louis relationship.<br /><br />The story of the downfall of these two is intelligently and logically constructed with a fine script, an enthusiastic cast that all shine in their roles, and an uncommonly well scripted dramatization. Avoid the ridiculous new version with its out of place '80's music and woefully anachronistic depiction of the French queen as a partying Valley girl. See this version instead.
