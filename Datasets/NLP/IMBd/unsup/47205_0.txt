Weak follow-up to the original cult classic It's Alive is virtually a remake of the first film, but with three babies this time around instead of one. Dull, boring, talky horror flick with a disappointing score and just about all the action and scares confined to the end, but by then it is too late. Rick Baker actually did the poor effects for this horrible sequel to It's Alive! Not to mention a rotten script and ending. Also, the beginning is garbage which should be stomped on and thrown away. What was Larry Cohen thinking? He could have just made another movie besides this. He must have been thinking "I'm bored. Hey guys, let's make a sequel to It's Alive!". Don't rent it or buy it. It's a horrible movie.<br /><br />Rated R for Violence and Profanity.
