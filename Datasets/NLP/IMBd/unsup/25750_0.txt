Short and sweet: If you're a Bruce Lee Fan, You have to have this DVD. If you're not, you will be. Watching this Doc/Feature was like going back to the early 70's. Seeing this never before released footage reminded me why I became a fan. It's a treat to have the "Real Bruce" visiting us again. The original 30 minutes or so of Bruce's (not Robert Clouse's) "Game of Death" makes this DVD a must have. Anyone that does have the Clouse's version can now dump that film in the trash. Why settle for a film with 7 Bruce Lee imitators when you can have the one-and-only. "Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey," though only containing 30-or-so minutes of the original "Game of Death" is (the real) Bruce Lee's last film. Enjoy :-)
