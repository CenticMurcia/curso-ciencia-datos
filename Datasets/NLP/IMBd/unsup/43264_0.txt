I can't help but laugh that these people that did a review all give it a good rating.<br /><br />With such big profile star (except for prefame Ekin Cheng), one would wonder how will it turn out. After recently viewing this movie i can agree with Kozo from LoveHKFilm that Calling this film bad would be an insult to actual bad movies. This movie was sooo awful that it was worth it to watch till the end. This movie full of stupid humour that leave you confuse and will make you laughing how stupid the movie is. The storyline was just crapacular, if you have watch the film, they say the FutureCop can't lie or else they will get shock. Well when they are in present time, there was soo much lying going on (when Andy Lau and Jacky CHeung went for the interview is just one of many example). The plot was very shallow (which they stole from Fight Back to School) and the joke are not funny. From the start to the ending this movie look very fake, boring, and extremely stupid. <br /><br />Com'on guys let the public know that this movie should not be view and should all be burn and forget about. Right now this is the second worse HK movie i had ever saw behind the New Option.
