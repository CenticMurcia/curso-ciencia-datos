this movie was awful and boring, and this is said from a person who loves to watch many what other people would call 'boring' sundance films. first of all, i was expecting way more gore. there was barely any. it didn't start out to bad at the beginning since there were yakuzas acting sort of funny but then it went downhill from when the main characters went into the factory.<br /><br />this movie was dull. i hate to rate a movie so low, 4/10 but i just had to. out of all the asian horror cinema i have seen, this is by far the worst.
