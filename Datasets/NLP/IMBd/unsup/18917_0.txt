It is such a warm, lovable movie! There is no smut, just a sweet, memorable love story wrapped in sci-fi. Chris Knight made a great astronomer, very creative casting but it works! Meadow Williams is adorable, you want to take her home! Her scenes are beautiful and befitting of a lead actress. Eric Roberts makes a great villain, as is his style. This well blended tale has an endearing, old fashioned feel despite its science fiction flavorings. This little movie delivers! It has a creative story, great cast, and wonderful tenderness. It's definitely one to see. It is a great movie for all ages. It is an exciting, romantic love story that reminds you that love is the most powerful force in the universe. It reminds me of "Somewhere in Time" with all of it's timeless and beautiful storytelling. Movies like "Light Years Away" are rare. I can't wait to buy it so I can watch it again.
