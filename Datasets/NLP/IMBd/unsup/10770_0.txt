The production of this movie is pretty weak. It's disjointed and doesn't flow very well. I have to admit, after the first time seeing it I thought it was awful, but my 8 year old daughter and 4 year old son have it on tape and think it's hilarious. So I watched it with them again and after seeing it for the second time I remembered some really funny characters Dana Carvey does. The third time I watched it I found it to be extremely funny. It definitely grows on you.<br /><br />One of the reviews I read here said that the characters Dana does aren't funny, but they couldn't be further from the truth. He does a character based on Tony Montana from Scarface that is hilarious! He also does a character named Gammy Numnums, which is an older snobby woman and is one of the funniest characters in the movie. The problem is that he does so many characters that none of them last long enough. His turtle-man character is really funny and gets funnier the more you see it.<br /><br />Dana Carvey is an absolute brilliant comedian and this movie SHOULD HAVE been his gateway to super stardom (i.e. Jim Carrey). Unfortunately the movie really isn't very good and it shows upon first view. But give it a chance and watch it with you kids and I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much you like it and want to watch it again.
