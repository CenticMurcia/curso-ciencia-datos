this was such a great movie the climax my gid what a climax so great this movie focuses on the Muslim-hindu riots and the friendship of Dev (Amitabh Bhachchan)and Tej (Om Puri) and how Dev has a compulsion to act which makes up for the climax i didn't predict the climax what it would be but Nihalani shows us that being human is more important than anything and if you fail to be one or fail humanity for that matter death will come to you only then basically this movie is adapted from a specific incident from gujarat and some riots that took place there in some life-taking incident overall songs aren't that good except Rang De Ni" it's basically a good movie with everybody delivering a better performance as the movie progresses and the action just keeps you there
