Some movie executives deserve to burn in movie Hell for their actions. This is DEFINITELY the case with those who chose to make this film and the followup, THE CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER. In THE CURSE, it's really just a movie clip film--with outtakes and clips from Peter Sellers' other Panther films. In the case of this film, it's bringing in a plucky female cop and having her interview all the living characters they could muster from the previous films and stitch that into a new movie! To make matters worse, David Niven (who starred in the very first Panther movie) is back despite the fact that he's almost dead! In fact, he was so weak and sickly that his voice needed to be dubbed! This is a sad and pathetic way to continue a series--just let it die, fellas!
