I feel that, even though I really don't want to, I should maybe watch this film again - to maybe see if I missed out any important details or something because from my experience this film has very little to redeem its creation. Frankly, I'd rather the film didn't make any money so that would teach Michael Keaton a lesson. Kelly McDonald's in it - and her character doesn't do any favours to get the audience to empathise or sympathise in any way with her. Likewise, Michael Keaton the retired hit-man love interest out to do one last job is unengaging and wooden. The only portions of the film I enjoyed were most of the scenes involving the fat cop (who fancies Kelly) because he actually manages to act unlike the rest of the cast. In addition, the first twenty minutes of the film where Keaton sneaks about town doing 'hitmanny stuff' is all very well arranged and is admittedly kind of cool - yet this twenty minutes does not in any way reflect the tone nor the level of quality you should expect from the rest of the film following it. I didn't get it.
