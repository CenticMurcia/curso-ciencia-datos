This movie is proof that if you let some one watch to many zombie movies and give them a cheap camera and a bunch of air head extras, you to can make a BAD movie. The acting is some of the worst I have seen in awhile. The sets, locations and sound are way below par as well. This movie has nothing to make it worth while. In some scenes there are 5 or 6 people making plans, and then the next scene the have added about 10 to 15 more people to their group. The don't explain it either. Also the gore effects are not that good. To make matters even worse, the previews on the DVD were almost as bad as the main movie. I heard there was going to be a part 2 to this mess. I don't know how. If this played in any theater it should be closed down. When I got suckered into renting this there was only one copy in the store. If you like to waste 90 minutes of you life on bad movies, than this is for you. Yuck !!!
