This "game" actually made a better movie than a game. Some of the combat sequences tend to be a touch repetative, but the wonderful feel of being in "a movie" is really, really quite nice. The mission tree allows for multiple endings, so there's the chance that you'll be the dog of the movie instead of the hero. Odd that Chris Roberts would tap adult movie actress Ginger Allen for such a prominant role... but I'll give credit where credit is due, she did a wonderful job acting.
