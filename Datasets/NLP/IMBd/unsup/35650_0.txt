This movie is a terrible waste of 96 min. A story of a boy (Johnathan Taylor Thomas)and how his dad leaves his mother (Farrah Fawcett) for his secretary. Then Johnathan and his mother have wonderful times together skipping on the beach and collecting shells and junk. Then Chevy Chase comes along and the movie get's more boring than it already was to begin with. In my opinion, Chevy is altogether not funny enough to make this movie at least a mediocre comedy. It's a comedy with hardly any laughs throughout the entire movie. You start to get bored with how not funny the movie is after the first 20 min. Chevy Chase is dull and amazingly unfunny. Johnathan Taylor Thomas is alright, but hey it's Johnathan Taylor Thomas... can he be any better than alright? Farrah Fawcett is probably the best part of this movie, everything else seems to fail miserably.<br /><br />All in all, not recommended in the least. Go spend your money on a better movie like 'Howard the Duck'. 1/10
