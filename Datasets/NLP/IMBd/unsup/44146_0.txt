This is truly one of the worst films that i have ever seen. I was going to write a sarcastic review of this film, so I sat down and summoned all the vitriol and bitterness inside of me, and found that there simply wasn't enough. The acting is terrible which is OK cos the script is terrible too. The premise is thoroughly uninteresting, "a guy kills some people" (ohhhh the scathing social commentary). The characters are one dimensional clich√©s. The film is well shot, although the comparisons to "24" are laughable (I won't even mention the comparisons to Altman). The problem with a film that is well shot is that one expects other production values to be good too. If this film was shot with two video cameras and submitted as a first year film school project it might make for an interesting watch but as a director's 6th piece it is baffling. How anyone can misuse a comic talent like Rik Mayall like this i dont know. But of course, you don't have to believe me, hire it if you must, but if you do, realize that it starts out terribly and it never gets better. There are no plot twists, there is no character development, and the "social commentary" goes as deep as some people aren't very nice. In fact, after writing this review, I have become convinced that I am deeply stupid and have missed something, so if anyone out there understands what i don't get, please let me know.
