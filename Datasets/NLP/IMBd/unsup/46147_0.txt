Pure and simple, as a computer nerd this movie is crap.<br /><br />It is totally 100% unbelievable, thats about it. It plays on every single hacker stereotype that exists and it makes up laws of technology.<br /><br />"HEY! I bet I can guess the password to the FBI in 3 tries! I bet it's sex secret or god!"<br /><br />Thats the level of technology they expect us to believe the FBI uses.<br /><br />They ALSO expect us to believe that the FBI keeps its top secret files ONLINE in the first place!!<br /><br />Crap, all the way through, plain and simple.<br /><br />
