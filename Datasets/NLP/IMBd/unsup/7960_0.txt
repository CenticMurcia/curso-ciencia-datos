The '1990's gave us some real bad music. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, boy bands. The 90's did have one redeeming value. The movies. Clerks is one of them. Shoestring budget, Kevin Smith mortgaged his life to make this film. in fact, almost as much was spent on the three minute Soul Asylum video then was spent on Clerks. I laughed so hard at Clerks, i lost breath twice. I've worked retail. Dante and more so Randal say almost everything that a retail clerk would want to say. They get away with it as well. Kevin Smith proved himself a genius. Raunchy humor, endless sight gags, and the best use of a small cast i've ever seen. Something to offend everyone, and that's what makes this room so great. Another thing that makes so film so great was that it spawned sequels without them being true sequels. It was a series of movies that all tied in with each other. Even having the same actors play other roles. Not something that main stream Hollywood had done. Clerks made Hollywood take notice, and for awhile, they stayed away from the cookie cutter approach to making movies. No movie as important as Clerks had been made in a great while. If you haven't seen clerks, you don't know what you're missing. Best movie of the 90's. enough said.
