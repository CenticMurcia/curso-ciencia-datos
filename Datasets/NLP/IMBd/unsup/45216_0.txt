The film is an awful mess.<br /><br />The film's "plot" (if you can call it a plot) is merely a derivative for a rather predictable and stale girl-on-girl love story. The plot at best see's the girls trying to stop a world famous thief, but that plot is quickly dropped in favour of a supposed romance story featuring the no.1 good guy and the said girl thief.<br /><br />Lucy the title character is invited by the villain of the plot to spend a night at her residence. What follows is a series of misunderstandings where the D.E.B.S. believe their lead spy has been captured and one of the D.E.B.S. agents making a weak attempt at covering up the truth of the affair. <br /><br />When you consider that this constitutes the marrow of the film, it is quite easy then to understand how awful the movie is.<br /><br />Why lead us on in to thinking we are watching a spy spoof and then deliver us a weak, campy movie (it doesn't even do campy well) about some teen romance?<br /><br />It's not funny (even though it's supposed to be a spy spoof), it has little story, and the "romance" the movie hinges on, is contrived nonsense.
