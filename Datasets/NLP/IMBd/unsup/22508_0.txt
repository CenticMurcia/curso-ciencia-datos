I agree with much of the previous stuff...bad writing, dialog, etc., but what I really found most shocking was how ugly the cast was. I mean...in a horror? Don't you really want to see pretty people being killed, maimed, raped, tortured, etc.... Here, it looks like they went around to all the plastic surgeons' offices in town and took all the "befores" and threw them in the movie. Old ones at that. Everyone appeared to be at least in their 30s.<br /><br />***** Spoiler -- sort of ***** That "prettiest girl in the room" line just killed me!!! I think it wasn't as much an exclusive party as where the rest of the town hid out all the ugly people.
