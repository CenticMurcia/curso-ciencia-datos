This film is absolutely dire! Not only is it historically inaccurate, it takes massive liberties with the character of Oliver Cromwell. The real Cromwell was honest, brave, faithful to his wife, family and religious principles. As it happens I disagree with his religious beliefs but I recognise that they were sincerely held. Living in a time vastly different to our own, Cromwell sought guidance from God in everything he did. He was also a highly skilled and dedicated leader of men. To suggest that he would randomly shoot someone in the street is frankly an insult. He was subject to severe mood swings, possibly even manic depression but remained an honourable man. I realise he is a figure who polarises opinion, and he is not particularly popular here in Scotland but he most certainly is not the bloodthirsty little thug portrayed in this film. Tim Roth was spectacularly miscast! By the way ianpb you clearly haven't done your homework, yes Charles was born in Scotland but as he left it aged three you could hardly expect him to have a Scottish accent!
