Haven't seen such a beautifully portrayed romantic film in years! Of course Romola Garai(Cassandra)was great and more so charming; but so was Rose Byrne(Rose)detestable! What I mean to say is that the actress (I mean Byrne)is someone to lookout for. Because in both her films, this one and'Wicker Park', she's made audiences truly hate her respective characters. Whereas, in 'Troy', you fall in love with this damsel-in-distress kinda princess! But the reason I liked this movie was that all the actors did justice to their roles. The father is played just fine. And the stepmother is not the prototype abusive one; she's good to the girls. And the sibling rivalry as well as the bond of love between them is grippingly enacted. My Best of Luck to Romola and Rose!
