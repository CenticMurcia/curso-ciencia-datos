Yes, the movie is predictable. You can read the plot like a book and expect what's coming up next. A recalcitrant trapped in the school (taken over by a bunch of supposedly professional missionaries led by Patrick Stewart's character) turned out to be the hero that saves the day. Hurray! Oh well, the movie probably appeal those who are really young and fantasies about being a hero. Unless you have nothing else to watch, go ahead and see this movie.
