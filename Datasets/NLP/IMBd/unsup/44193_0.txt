With James Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli involved and some really good stars this sounded worth a watch, so I did. Basically Tony (Jack Lemmon) and Felix (Robert Mitchum) sail around the Caribbean in their tramp boat doing odd jobs and drinking. While travelling they meet Irena (Rita Hayworth) and agree to take her to another island, and they both fall for her, leading to a break-up of partnership and betrayal. Tony goes on a cargo ship to take a job, but after a crash his legs are trapped underneath a large metal structure, and it seems only Felix can help him. Also starring Herbert Lom as Harbor Master, Bonar Colleano as Lt. Sellars, Anthony Newley as Miguel, Bernard Lee as Dr. Sam Blake, Edric Connor as Jimmy Jean and Peter Illing as Captain of the 'Ulysses'. It is unfortunate that the film itself turned out not to be very interesting, it was pretty boring actually. Adequate!
