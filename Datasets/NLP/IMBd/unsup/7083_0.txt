Takashi Miike has got to be one of my favorite film makers these days, I'm out searching for his stuff left and right. Visitor Q is probably the weirdest of his weird movies that I've seen yet, maybe more so because it's missing any of the supernatural elements present in most of his other films. I guess the closest thing that I could compare this to is "Happiness" by Todd Solondz, but parts of this drag that through the mud and make it seem somewhat wholesome in comparison. Almost. This takes dysfunctional family behavior out to the "n-th" degree, and yet I didn't find it that hard to watch. We have incest, parental abuse, heroin addiction, prostitution (runs in the family) and just good old fashioned insanity. Miike apparently has some thing for mother's milk, too, if you've seen Gozu then you know what I mean. Dad is a failed TV reporter, whose downfall had something to do with a televised interview with some young punks that inserted a microphone where he didn't want it. Mom is a mess, the young son beats her & she turns tricks to support her drug addiction. The young son is bullied and takes things on on mom, apparently. And the oldest daughter, who is no longer living at home, well, you'll see. Along comes a mysterious visitor who becomes a house guest after hitting dad on the head with a rock (twice). His purpose is somewhat unclear but he somehow brings the family closer together, not that any of what they're doing is particularly Ozzie & Harriet but they're still doing things as a family again. Heartwarming. Yeah, right. Anyway this is a disturbing watch and I enjoyed every minute of it. Highly recommended, if you enjoy the current wave of strange Japanese films.
