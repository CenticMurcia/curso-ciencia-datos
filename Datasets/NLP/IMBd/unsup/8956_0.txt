I was flipping channels on a boring Saturday afternoon and I came across it because there wasn't anything interesting to watch at the time. In a matter of minutes I was absorbed into the story. It was very interesting surprisingly because there was so much silence and very little dialogue. At the end, you see one of the main characters on a rock but I had no idea why but after reading the plot on this site I realize why. It reminded me of my other favorites: Pretty in Pink and Breakfast Club. But now I know why since this is a John Huges film. I always thought Molly Ringwald was the prettiest actress I ever saw, but after seeing Brooke Langton, that may not be the case. You should definitely watch this film. If you do not enjoy the story you will enjoy watching Langton.
