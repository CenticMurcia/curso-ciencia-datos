I thought the movie was ridiculous. I can understand why Russell Manzatt hasn't written a movie script since 2001. It's like he came up with an amazing dilemma and just couldn't figure out an interesting way to solve it.<br /><br />A perfect plan right? A physco woman plotting revenge on the president is fortunate enough to slip pass the amazing security of the United State's Secret Service, with just a sniper from a building 50 feet away (amazing huh?), and infect him with an advanced form of the Ebola virus. But all her plans are ruined because of a little boy who is always sneaking around the hospital. And it's not as though this kid accidentally discovers her plan or anything like that, oh nohe just happens to be the only known survivor (other than the physco lady) of this strain of virus in the whole world. The world is so incredibly fortunate to have that kid in the hospital at just that right time. His white blood cells save the day great story? There were a lot of subplots within the story that were just weak. Dr. Landis's obsession with her work that inevitably ruins her social life could have been more developed. Her phone's ringing constantly in the beginning and for two days not a single call until the very end when she's walking away from the hospital. And at that time she decides that living a life is more important than work but where was that 'drive' during the rest of the movie? I don't know. It was a decent idea for a movie, just poorly written.
