This is one of the best pieces of TV drama i've seen, this I'm sorry to say is better then any previous Marple or recent Agatha Christie dramatisation I've seen. As good as any Joan Hickson dramatisation. Utterly fantastic sit back and enjoy, and all those who keep comparing Geraldine to Joan Don't WATCH buy her DVD series watch that and leave us to watch the new versions without criticisms they're superb. Its great that they're doing new things with the plots WE all know the books so something different is great! The book was of course adapted to accommodate Miss Marple and the writer did an incredible job, Miss Marple is given enough of a character and personality and role for it to have been written as a Miss Marple book. The performances of Jane Seymour and Dennis Lawson were fantastic in particular, cameos from Pippa Heywood and Camille Coduri were of course welcomed. All but cynical Chrsitie purists couldn't help but enjoy this whodunit meant as Christie's characters should have been bold and larger then life. Pour a large G and T sit back and enjoy..... I did :-)
