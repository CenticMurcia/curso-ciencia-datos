just watching this on late night FREE TV. <br /><br />bad acting, story, hairstyling, casting choreography, directing,,, can't even be bothered finishing the list. <br /><br />i love bad TV. i laugh at lame 1 liners and cheap sets. but this is just plain bad.<br /><br />i think the makers were going for a jean-claude/Dolph lundren type movie, but even they probably would have turned down the role. <br /><br />the only thing i like is the supposed tough 'mafia' guys who would make anybody they threaten laugh in their face.<br /><br />do not waste your money on this and if you are looking for cheap laughs you will be waiting a while.
