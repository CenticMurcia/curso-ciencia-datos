Being a basketball fan, I started to tape this movie when I saw that it was coming on the Family Channel. The mere fact that it was coming on the Family Channel should have tipped me off.<br /><br />About ten minutes after this "movie" began...I stopped taping and turned off the television. It was THAT bad. The actor they got to play Michael Jordan looked nothing like him. It must've been made for $350. They even took liberties with Michael Jordan's life story itself, pretending that the shot he hit in the 1982(4?) NCAA Championship won the game outright when in fact there was still time on the clock and the other team failed to score.<br /><br />Everything was so simplistic, it appeared as if it was written for an infant chimpanzee instead of even a teenage human audience. They didn't bother to get the license to use the Chicago Bulls logo and equipment so they made up some awful looking orange-red type jersey for their faux-Jordan to wear.<br /><br />All in all, so awful that it embarrasses the viewer.<br /><br />1.5/10...among the lowest ratings I've ever given out for a movie. In fairness, I'm giving it a few extra fractions of a point because I didn't watch the whole thing.
