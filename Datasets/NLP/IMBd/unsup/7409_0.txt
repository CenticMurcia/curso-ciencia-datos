Shep Ramsey is forced to land his ship in the suburbs, hilarity ensues. But yet this film is so much more. Brilliant execution and top-notch acting from Hogan and Christopher Lloyd are examples of what propel this film to the top of cinematic history. There is a sadness in Hogan's Ramsey; a feeling of alienation. This is perfectly exemplified in the scene where Ramsey must play an arcade game. He truly believe he is saving this virtual world, and he plays with such veracious intensity that he ends up forcing the machine to explode, causing us the audience to look on in empathy for this lost soul. A truly heart wrenching experience, and a masterpiece I shall never forget, this one haunts dreams folks.
