The first Bruce Lee documentary that tells the real story behind one of the most fascinating men of the 20th Century. For fans of Lee or martial arts it is absolutely unmissable. There is so many awful movies/documentaries out there that take advantage of Lee's name to make some money, it's great to see a documentary that's true to the great man.<br /><br />If you enjoy this, I recommend you read the Lee's biography 'Fighting Spirit', the author of which is Bruce Thomas.
