In the movies anything can happen. Its where logic goes out the window for a start. No way could you raise a ship like the Titanic by setting explosives under it.You would need hydraulics for a start. Yet it cops out by being made bouyant by filling the ship with foam rubber! Then the huge gash is patched up just like that. It was more like a fairy tale when the byzantium turned into gravel! Never having read the novel-as I have a short attention span-its not,by the sound of it,done the novel justice. Why for instance did it cost $40 million? And in real life if the Titanic had been raised it would be the Talk of the World-yet here its just a 5 minute event
