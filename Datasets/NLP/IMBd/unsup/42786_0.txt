From the mind of Swedens best selling author, Jan Guillou comes the tale of young Arn, a nobleman's son brought up in a monastery, and later charged to do penance as a knight in the holy land. The acting can at times best be described as sketchy, and the pace is slow for a supposed action movie. The sound score is a never ending string and choir act that doesn't add much for me, I just sat there wondering when all the racket would end. At some points I pondered leaving the cinema, but like a car wreck it's hard to stop watching, that is probably the strength of the movie,it's not bad enough to drive you out of the cinema. All in all a mediocre book made in to a abysmal movie.
