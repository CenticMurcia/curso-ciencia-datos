Jack Sparrow, Ledger Joker, Guru Pitka<br /><br />They were serious enough in their goals, but also they never took a path with the same seriousness. It is a very clear message, because Life is Hard. They all like to do tough jokes, even in difficult moments. This may look like foolishness, but maybe these characters realized that work is best done if people can refocus their concerns. If you recall, instead of receiving the best answer to an specific problem, they bring a very funny alternative that can make us free our worries. Was Guru Pitka's morbidity level high? Those were jokes! "but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose" as Eminem said.
