Well the title is a lot more suggestive than the story ever gets to be. The most exploitative this flick ever gets is showing a half dozen or so young girls in their undies, and they didn't seem to mind all that much. The trigger for the plot occurs right at the outset with a botched kidnap attempt (the girl was walking home from church!!!!), and from then on it's about getting the goods on a traveling prostitution ring. Darn if my timing isn't just SO coincidental with the Eliot Spitzer mess, but no one here looked anything like 'Kristen', Ashley Alexandra Dupre, or whatever name she might be using right now. But it was made seventy years ago, so I guess we can cut it some slack.<br /><br />You know, I couldn't figure out why Good Looking Freddie was such a klutz - didn't he ever read the newspapers? He would have known he was a hot commodity before Big Jim Murray (Wheeler Oakman) and Belle Harris (Florence Dudley) ever put the finger on him.<br /><br />And holy cow! - what was with those two boarding house guys with the goofy acrobatics? You would think that for an exploitation film, the principals involved could have made use of more stimulating filler related to the topic. Like a few more shots of the hookers in their underwear. It's all a stretch, I know, but there are so many good grief moments in the picture that it strains credibility on so many levels.<br /><br />I doubt you'll catch this one on any of your favorite cable channels, but stay alert and it will pop up as part of a four disc, twenty film DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment, that's to be commended for putting out tons of old material like this under various headings. This set goes by the way of 'Cult Classics', and it's a hoot to catch a whole barrel full of 1930's era 'educational' films related to the evils of the day, which quite coincidentally managed to make it to the present time. I guess we haven't really learned that much since, have we?
