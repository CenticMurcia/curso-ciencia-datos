as a general rule, any episode of any series showing the people and world we know from an outside perspective is a above average episode; this is no exception. Here we see the crew through the eyes of a 1960's astronaut who ends up aboard the ship. The episode is not told from his perspective of course, but it does let us see it from his point of view. What would someone from our time (roughly) think of their ways. I am very much borrowing from another reviewer here, I just happen to agree.<br /><br />The dialog is the main attraction here. The dialog involving captain Christopher, and kirk's infamous joking scene especially. Fans of the show, you know what I'm talking about. I won't spoil anything but I will say that they encounter a few problems trying to return to their own time; each of which they (of course) eventually overcome. 6 out of 5 stars here again mainly because of dialog and time-travel done inventively.
