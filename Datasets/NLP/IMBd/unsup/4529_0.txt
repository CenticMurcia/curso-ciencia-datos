While most movies are geared toward the younger crowd, this one tickled the funny bones of the 40+ generation. What a nice change! The language was surprising, but the antics were refreshing. There were some memorable moments, and some visuals you wish you could get out of your mind (Michael McKean to be exact). All in all...it was a fun-filled comedy.
