This is one of those films my friend calls a Potential Sleeper. Meaning that its one of those films that you have never heard of and have no idea who the actors are. Never the less the film might surprise you and be good. This film was not! The overall feel of the film was that it had been made by a 7 year old. However the film did keep me riveted to the screen. I kept watching and waiting to see what muck was going to appear on the screen next.<br /><br />The acting was terrible, the cinematography as already stated was amateurish, and the makeup and special effects were unbelievably bad. The corpses looked like they had covered a toy skeleton in jelly. When the first corpse spoke I almost wet myself with laughter.<br /><br />The opening scene in which her parents die from a gas leak, told me all I needed to know about the production values of this film. The main plot involved some kind of curse, at twin girl who pretended to be one of the dead people living in the lake and people getting killed every 13th something or other. The story was badly structured and made no real sense.<br /><br />The only saving grace, is that the main actress exposes her two bouncy friends. If this is a ploy to keep you watching in the hope that she will do it again, then it worked. I was rewarded for my 90mins of agonising pain when she did it again towards the end.<br /><br />I feel sorry for anyone who has to watch this film, and I feel sorrier for anyone who actually liked it.
