In an age where fundamentalism is on the rise and science is under attack - its is documentaries like these that should inspire imaginations and help the layman to appreciate the depth and breadth of science. Instead, this whole documentary skips over the real good stuff and focuses on doomsday scenarios...constantly! Countless times Sam would talk about an aspect of space and then somehow find a way to link it to the end of the world...then comes the dramatic music and a 3D model of the Earth blowing up.<br /><br />Incredible shame that someone like the BBC with its financial means and influence would resort to a Macdonalds wrapped sensationalist piece of garbage devoid of real science. Think I will stick to PBS for 'real' science documentaries from now on. Don't bother with this tripe!
