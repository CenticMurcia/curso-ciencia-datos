This Would make a excellent remake, just a remarkable story. The acting is wonderful as well as the direction. I first saw this episode in 1995, and it has haunted me ever since. It has created a fascination with ww1 and I now collect ww1 artifacts. This story could easily be adapted in to a feature film or even a mini serious. It states at the end of the story that it is based on actual events. Its hard to believe that it has never been mentioned since. I am currently working on trying to track down actual historical data about the event. This is a powerful story, please keep in mind the time and,low budget this was filmed in. Wish me luck on my research. Scott
