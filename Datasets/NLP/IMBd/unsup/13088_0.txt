Just got back from an advanced screening of this film and was compelled to write this with the hope who ever reads this will take my advice and go see this film immediately. For several reasons:the first being the acting and casting. Emmanuelle Chrioui (I am a big "Entourage" fan) and new comer Robert Capeli were fantastic together. And Pat Hingle should get a nomination for his role. Artie Lange couldn't of been funnier (I am a bigger Stern fan). I also liked the way they cast soap star J. Eddie Peck as a villain. And Grant Shaud from "Murphy Brown" fame was stellar. His last scene made me laugh out loud. The second was the story, I don't want to spoil it for you let me just type you will not be disappointed. I concur with the other posting's that this is a must see.....
