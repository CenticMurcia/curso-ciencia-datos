This is a very low budget Spanish version of Dracula that is chock full of breasts--sort of like a nudie version of a horror film. Plus, while I didn't think it looked very realistic, there was tons of fake blood as well. This surprised me, as it was marketed as a horror film presented by Elvira--and usually these are more family-friendly films. So beware when you get this--this is a soft-core horror film with more groaning and moaning than I thought was possible! Oh, and speaking of Elvira, I should point out that if you do get this version, you also get Elvira interrupting the film periodically to make comments. Fortunately, on the DVD you can chose not to see these--this is strongly recommended as they interrupt the flow of the film and really add nothing to the experience.<br /><br />As for the quality of the film overall, this isn't a particularly bad film for the first half and it does have an interesting plot twist (Dracula finding love). However, oddly, after he and his lady love profess their love, the film continues for some time and seems to drag. However, to make things worse, the original style of the narrative vanishes. No longer do people talk or act, but there is an annoying voice-over during the last half of the film--as if they ran out of money for translating the dialog! Plus, instead of story, the film is full of rather disjointed sadism and blood-letting. In hindsight, it probably would have been best to end the film shortly after he finds love, as up until then it was a rather decent (if "boobified") film.<br /><br />My final verdict is that this film is too hard-core for most people and the story itself is too convoluted and poor to merit it as a "must see" for people wanting a porno horror film--as a result, it probably won't appeal to many out there.
