A Woman running naked in the night (slow motion). Haunting soundtrack.<br /><br />A car. Dark night. Suddenly, a white indistinct silhouette in the middle of the road. Dr. Benson swerves just in time and stops the car. When he looks back the road is empty - no one in sight! While he's thinking about it, crash!!..... He looks back and there's another car in the road. A woman is in it, unconscious. She's Susan (Rita Calderoni). The scene is enhanced by a brooding soundtrack.<br /><br />Dr. Benson looks for help in a nearby castle. In this castle, he and Susan will meet their darker selves, and will have to fight a battle with them for their.... souls, egos, whatever....<br /><br />This is the castle of mirrors, where the statues spin and the corridors have many doors. Each door hides a secret. It may be a dream, a hallucination, a nightmare. Day and night seem to mix together and coexist at the same time. Whippings, lesbian succubus that like to pay surprise visits, a giant spider, a strange laughing butler roaming around....<br /><br />Dr. Benson meets Susan's darker half, Evelyn (Rita Calderoni). Susan meets Dr. Benson's darker half, Peter. Their darker selves are planning to take over. Satan (in civilian clothes) presides over everything.<br /><br />"Nuda per Satana" is a very sensual film. Rita Calderoni could have been a princess or a duchess in the Italian Renaissance. When she is dressed/undressed, kisses, smiles, screams, whatever she does, it looks like one of those paintings of the great Italian masters come alive. Sex, the devil, the unconscious, the dreams, desire, joy and fear.<br /><br />I think that "Nuda per Satana" was obviously inspired by Renato Polselli's "The reincarnation of Isabel", but it has nonetheless its own personality. Probably, a more distant source of inspiration was "Castle of Blood" made by Antonio Margheriti in 1964.<br /><br />In "Nuda per Satana" the visuals, the soundtrack, the dialogues... produce a dreamy, surreal ambiance. Instead of trying to follow the story, turn off your critical vibes, dive into the film and you may have something akin to an acid trip.
