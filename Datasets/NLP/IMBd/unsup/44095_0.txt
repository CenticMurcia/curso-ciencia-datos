Seriously folks, what did you expect? They couldn't make it just like the original novel/movie, because the original is not that obscure, and there isn't any good way to change the story and still make a reasonable production. All the major changes came in the second part, the first part was played almost exactly like the original. This seemed almost deliberate.<br /><br />In the second part, we get some cursory mention of the two survivors and some theorizing as to why they may still be alive... but then they're simply forgotten and don't even figure in the overall plot. Presumably this was to avoid the obvious ending where the military spray everything with large vat-worths of stomach acid.<br /><br />Having said that, I do feel that some of the reviewers here were watching a different mini-series. There weren't as many plot-holes as some want you to believe; it actually held up to plot scrutiny pretty well. The acting was about right for this kind of production, the effects were done well. It was just that cheesy rewrite of the original story that I can't get beyond. Time travel paradoxes, wormholes, 'things' sent back from the future? As someone already noted, way too many Star Trek plot-lifts for my liking. But the one thing that the original has in spades, and this has none of..? A spine-chilling sinister, spookiness, that just doesn't sit well and makes your skin crawl. The original, despite its almost complete lack of violence and gore, is every bit horror movie as it is sci-fi. This is just another one of those cheesy updates that will repeat endlessly on the SciFi channel.<br /><br />The worst part for me was that the nail-biting ladder sequence from the original was wasted and replaced with 10 minutes of mind-numbing stupidity. He's dying because it's a radioactive pool, geddit? The other fella, it was the gravity that got him. We didn't mention the gravity? Darnit! You don't know what I'm referring to? LUCKY YOU!<br /><br />If you want some advice, rent the original and watch it with the lights turned down, preferably late at night when it's all quiet outside.
