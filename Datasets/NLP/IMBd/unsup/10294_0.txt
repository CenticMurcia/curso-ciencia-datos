Just finished watching this pre-Code movie called Night Nurse starring Barbara Stanwyck on VHS as one in several of a series of videocassettes named "Forbidden Hollywood" hosted by Leonard Maltin. Before the picture starts Maltin tells of and shows many scenes that a few years after the year this film was made (1931) wouldn't have been allowed. Like scenes of Ms. Stanwyck and Joan Blondell undressing or of a bootlegger (Ben Lyon) getting away with murder. Clark Gable, in one of his early roles, impresses greatly in his scenes with Barbara as the brutal chauffeur who's in cahoots with the crooked doctor in her hospital. And it's always a treat to see Charles Winninger in another one of his kindly elderly paternal roles, here as Stanwyck's moral superior. And seeing Blondell and Lyon with the leading lady are such a treat that I'm now curious if they did anything else together. Quickly and efficiently helmed by William Wellman who directed James Cagney to stardom in The Public Enemy the same year, Night Nurse is one of his more underrated gems.
