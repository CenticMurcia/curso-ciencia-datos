Other than this movie featuring Ernest from all those wacky commercials, this movie just plays out as your basic summer camp movie. Why is it so bad, because you have Ernest as the main character, plus very annoying children, and a silly subplot involving some company trying to take over the camp. I just do not think the Ernest character should be center stage for a movie. The short lived television show was the only thing this character needed as it featured other characters and such to draw some of the focus away from Ernest himself. Lets face it, the character got his start in commercials as a rather annoying individual and it was funny to see him torment Vern, but more funny to see Vern get back at Ernest for bothering him in the first place. The movie here would feature a couple of the characters from the television show as cooks and they provide some comedy and Ernest has his moments. However, most of the movie is rather groan inducing and to top it off it gets overly sentimental at times as well. I can not really recommend this movie unless perhaps you have seen his other movies and liked them. Granted if you have seen them I am sure you saw this his first movie.
