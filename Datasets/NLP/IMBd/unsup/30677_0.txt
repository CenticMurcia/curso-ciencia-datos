This epic and beautifully shot western is one of Costner's best films.<br /><br />Following the life of legendary law man Wyatt Earp, this very underrated movie pictures the 'real' man with the 'legend' and gives viewers' a chance to decide for themselves what type of man Earp really was. <br /><br />Costner's performance as the law man is superb. Through the innocence of youth to a moody old man, he fits the role perfectly and proves he is better than Kurt Russell's Earp in 'Tombstone'. <br /><br />The shoot-outs are superb and there is fantastic support from Dennis Quaid as the ill Doc Holliday, as well as Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore and Bill Pullman. <br /><br />Although a tad long and the the fact that there seems to be no dirt anywhere in this film, I urge you to check this out.<br /><br />8 out of 10
