Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) is an attractive, unattached, upper middle class Manhattan computer programmer. Hoping for a romantic adventure, Paul arranges a date with a young woman who lives in Soho, a part of Manhattan populated by people who prefer a more bohemian lifestyle. But Paul loses all his money en-route to the woman's apartment. And the romantic encounter doesn't quite work out like he had hoped. Disappointed, Paul just wants to go back home. But fate has other ideas. He becomes trapped in a twilight zone of bizarre clashes and surrealistic frustrations.<br /><br />The entire story takes place in the course of one night. Few people are on the streets, as it is a work night. And off-and-on rain adds to a feeling of helplessness and entrapment in Hades. The film's mood alternates between subtle humor at the predicament Paul has gotten himself into, and melancholy angst.<br /><br />Griffin Dunne is ideal as Paul: likable, smart, reasonable, slightly guilt-ridden and out of his league in an underworld of non-conformists, misfits, petty thieves, and other human creatures of the night. The message here is that one can be successful and comfy in a world of one's own choosing, yet a foreigner and even viewed as a threat in a different setting. Further, we are just one mistake away from the misery of a world where fate rules.<br /><br />The film's acting and eclectic casting are fine. Noir lighting is impressive. The film's score is subtle. I especially liked the songs: "Over The Mountain" and "Is That All There Is?", both of which add to the film's nightmarish atmosphere.<br /><br />The way Paul loses his money is a little hokey. And the plot becomes increasingly silly and preposterous toward the end, as each subsequent frustration has to be continually worse than the previous one.<br /><br />Overall, however, "After Hours" is an enjoyable film. It is an especially good choice to gain a sense of perspective. Not many ongoing experiences can be worse than the rough night that Paul has in Soho.
