Even though I liked this last entry (yeah, right) in the Friday the 13th series, a part of me can understand why others don't care for it. Since Jason technically only appears (at least in the form we are used to) twice, and spends the rest of the movie jumping from body to body, this might be seen as tampering a bit too much with a comfortable formula.<br /><br />Personally, I was so glad that I was seeing something new here, (although it's actually not all that new as anybody who has seen the fun cult, sci-fi/action flick "The Hidden" can attest to,) that I was willing to put aside a few minor quibbles. Like what, you say? Well, it would have been nice if the Creighton Duke character had been a little more heroic instead of being such a jerk. Also: Where in the Hell did the "magic dagger" come from.<br /><br />Still, there were a few scenes here that are pure gold.<br /><br />#1: The opening bit where Jason faces off with the SWAT team. I had always wondered why nobody ever tried that before. Big dude isn't so tough when faced with high powered weaponry, is he?<br /><br />#2: The scene with the coroner and Jason's heart. It's just so goofy watching him chow down on it like a Big Mac, I laugh everytime.<br /><br />#3: The slo-mo diner attack. The "monster attacks the good guys who are trapped in a diner" is a classic horror movie stand-by. I get a warm feeling everytime I see it.<br /><br />Oh, one more point a friend brought to my attention: The hero of the movie sure can do a god job punching people after Duke breaks his fingers!
