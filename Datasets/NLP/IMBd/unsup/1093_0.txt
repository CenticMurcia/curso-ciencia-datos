I liked this a movie a lot. Everyone that likes comedy and action must watch this movie! I give it a 9.5/10! Comedy and action make a great team. I can't get enough of it, its too funny! The action was great too especially at the end and beginning. The funniest part is where when Boomer conducts John Ma's concert and doesn't know what to do. Its really funny! Infact, everyone should see this movie. I have it and watch it over like at least once a day or twice. Well not for the rest of my life. Its also funny because lots of people fainted because they thought they saw Jackie Chan twice, one after another.
