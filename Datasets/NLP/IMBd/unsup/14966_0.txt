Air Force One is a very good thriller. The action and suspense will be nothing to forget. This movie is about the President's plane, Air Force One being hijacked by Russian nationalists with the President on board. Now it's up to the President and the Vice-President to negotiate with the terrorists or the hostages will die. The acting in this film is pretty good. Harrison Ford did justice with his outstanding performance as the President. Gary Oldman is good as the evil terrorist. The music in this film is fabulous and patriotic considering that the score took two weeks by Jerry Goldmith to compose. I liked the effects in this film. There is nothing special, but for a film from 1997, this has good effects even though there are few. Overall, this is a good movie for everybody except for kids. This film is a moving picture with outstanding courage. My rating is 10/10.
