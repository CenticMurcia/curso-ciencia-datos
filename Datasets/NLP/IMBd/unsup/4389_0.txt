I first saw WWHTKB when it was screened in my hometown film festival two years ago at one in the morning on a Saturday. I had been watching movies all day for two days (thank you Jolt Cola and Continental Breakfast coffee) at this point, and WWHTKB stood out for a few reasons as one of my favorite movies from the festival. The main storyline, though contrived at points, kept a consistent mix of cynical humor and sarcastic wit with downright impossibly ridiculous situations and an extremely unlikely cast of characters - including "Bitch," the main character's abusive ex-girlfriend - that had me laughing out loud more than a few times. There were a lot of things outside of the main storyline that stood out as downright hilarious concepts, such as the fake John Travolta film, "Oh Shenannigans!" from which they show clips. Though these elements made me chuckle, they really don't stand out from the entire genre of late-teen-college-age movie as something original. What really stands out from the film is the high amount of action that happens within the scenes, but having no real interaction with the plot. For example two movie theater clerks poke holes into paper cups and get kinky with the popcorn tubs while two main characters talk about going out to the improv later that night. This is the kind of movie that is best watched with a couple of drinks and some good friends that you've gotten up to some fun with. I got to talk to the director at the festival, and ended up actually buying a copy of the movie. It has some of the most wonderful cover art for any movie that I've ever seen. A definite watch for one of those late night boredom releases.
