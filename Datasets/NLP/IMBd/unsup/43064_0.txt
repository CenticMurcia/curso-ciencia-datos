Let's face it , Qayamat is BAD . A supreme disaster . Worse , a complete ripoff of The Rock with unnecessary-yet-mandatory love interests and a truckload of songs all sounding the same . Harry Baweja has never been a good director and with this and Teesri Aankh , I have ceased to have any faith in him . Scriptwriter Suparn Verma was a Rediff.com critic and after you watch Qayamat you'll surely understand that critics don't necessarily make good filmmakers , and make horrible screenwriters .<br /><br />Plot : CBI Officer Akram Sheikh (Sunil Shetty) is after three dreaded Pakistani arms dealers - brothers Ali (Arbaaz Khan) and Abbas (Sanjay Kapoor) and their common moll Laila (Isha Koppikar) . After a botched arms deal , Ali-Abbas are left out in the cold with Akram closing in on them . They decide to steal a lethal virus from a top govt. lab where Gopal (Chunky Pandey) and Rahul (Ashish Chaudhary) are working . Then they take over the Elphinstone Jail and hold all terrorists as hostages . The location was used as a jail in the past , now it is a tourist spot . So convenient to lure unsuspecting visitors .<br /><br />Only one man in history has escaped Elphinstone Jail , Rachit (Ajay Devgan) is his name . Akram Sheikh asks Rachit to lead him to the secret passage into the jail , that is located below sea level . Then we learn of Rachit's past , how his GF Sapna (Neha Dhupia) was killed and he was reduced to being a vegetable .<br /><br />Rahul accompanies the commando squad since he knows how to diffuse the weapons . Thanks to the tipoff from a dishonest minister (Govind Namdeo) , the bad guys already know that the commandos are coming . They kill every commando on arrival , leaving Rachit and Rahul to complete the mission .<br /><br />Honestly this has so many plot holes , I would run out of words . I am sick of this continual and stereotypical Pakistan-bashing . It's like, "We don't have any villains left , why not pick up the Pakistanis?" and the makers go ahead . And Sapna was killed in the first half , wasn't she? Then how come she was alive and kicking in the second Half???!! Basically Sapna wasn't needed , the screechy Sheetal (Riya Sen playing Rahul's GF) wasn't needed (In fact this entire movie wasn't needed :) ) . As far as the drool quotient goes , Neha Dhupia does an Ursula Andress in a baby pink bikini for a few seconds in the song "Dil Chura Liya" , otherwise she is fully clad all the time . Riya Sen has skimpier outfits and a seductive song "Yaar Pyaar Ho Gaya" with Ashish Chaudhary . Isha Koppikar doesn't offer much in that department , but ends up having comparatively more screen time .<br /><br />The dialogues were cringe-inducing . Sample this, "Sapna Ko Main Kabhi Haqeeqat Nahin Banne Doonga" and "Police Ki Maar Ki Baat Hi Nirali , Goonga Bhi Gaaye Qawwali" :( . Performances were BAD : Ajay Devgan speaks very little (he knew this was going to be a waste) . Sunil Shetty , Arbaaz Khan , Sanjay Kapoor , Ashish Chaudhary are all horrible . The girls have nothing to do but flash their vital stats between alternately screeching and crying . This movie was talked about for its action scenes ; but they are very poorly copied from the likes of M:I , The Rock and others . And would Mr. Allan Amin tell me when will his obsession with slow-motion end? Songs are disappointing - Nadeem , Shravan and Sameer at their worst .<br /><br />The only high point is the stylish camera-work by Sanjay F. Gupta . But how come this became a hit ?
