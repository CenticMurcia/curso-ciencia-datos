You had better bring some... though not the standard light-hearted fare Dunne and Grant had performed in before, this film is a classic example of an American tear jerker. <br /><br />The film winds you though these flashbacks while you wait to fall deeper into their despair, knowing it will happen. It's like hitting some cute furry animal and then standing there.. watching it... you'd know whats coming.<br /><br />A great story and dramatic comedy its very well acted... films such as 'Terms of Endearment' and 'Beaches' learned their lessons here.<br /><br />If you enjoy this film, I definitely recommend the Grant / Dunne 'screwball' comedy "My Favorite Wife".
