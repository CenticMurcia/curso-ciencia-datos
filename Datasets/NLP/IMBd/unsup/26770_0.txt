Big Night is one of those life affirming films that will have the audience exiting with their heads in the clouds,as well as hungry,as food is a central gathering force here. Two brothers,both immigrants from Italy,both run a failing Italian restaurant in New York. Failing, because the restaurant serves upscale Italian dishes (or,nouveau cuisine)in a blue collar,working class neighborhood that doesn't know (or care)beyond spaghetti & meatballs. The fact that the local bank is just a whisper away from foreclosure on the property doesn't make matters any better. A rival restaurant owner across the street (played by an cheerful,over the top Ian Holm)offers to bring his "friend",Italian-American Jazz legend, Louis Prima,to try their restaurant. Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat. The film also gets some solid support from Minnie Driver,Isabella Rossellini,and even Marc Anthony,just as he was gaining fame as a pop singer. Campbell Scott (son of the late George C. Scott),who also co-directs the film,has a nice turn as a car salesman,who is always trying to sell just about anybody a Cadillac. Most of the second half of the film concerns the two brothers getting ready for their "big night". Does Mr.Prima ever show up for the feast? Food,food & more food are paraded on camera as much as possible. Make sure you enjoy a big meal before taking on this one. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for vulgar language,some adult situations & much smoking.
