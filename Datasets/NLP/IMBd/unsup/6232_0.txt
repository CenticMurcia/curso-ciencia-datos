This movie made me proud to be Catholic. While it's not totally successful on an artistic level, the story of Romero's conversion was inspiring and spiritually moving. I hope the church will keep him on the fast track to sainthood! Aside from that, as a film, it gets a little too didactic towards the end (it was more emotionally involving before his conversion than after); however, Raul Julia's performance is superb.
