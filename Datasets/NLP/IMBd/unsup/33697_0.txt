Every now and then a show comes along that redefines your relationship with the whole genre. Seinfeld was like that, The Sopranos as well. Maybe even Californication. This show is about as far from that as possible, bar reality television.<br /><br />As you watch it, you feel like you've seen that episode before, and you kind of know how it's going to end. That's because, in a way, you HAVE seen that episode before, and it's going to end exactly like any episode of any unimaginative half-hour sitcom based on some vaguely idiotic premise. It's the same old lame fodder we've seen a million times. It's kind of bearable and mostly dull and pointless, but at least it's not According to Jim.<br /><br />A feeling of déjà vu not unlike visiting a childhood home, but one in which you were molested by a crazy uncle. Recognition, repetition and repulsion, in one fell 30-minute swoop.<br /><br />But, once again, at least it's not According to Jim.<br /><br />(Could ANYTHING be as awful as that? I mean, really? It's the television equivalent of a colonoscopy.)
