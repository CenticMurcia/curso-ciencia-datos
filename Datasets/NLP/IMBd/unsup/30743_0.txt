After one of the greatest studio logos I've ever seen (check out those whirling hooters!) and getting all hyped about that, the next hour is a pretty boring escapade. Ken Maynard, who's shirt seems to be saying "look at my buttons and my armpits!" stars as Ken, a cowboy new to town, but has a lot of clothes stashed away somewhere, who is looking to find out who is his father. There are a lot of mysterious deaths going on, by one "Phantom Killer", who wanders around canyons in, yes, a cape and big hat (he looks like the V for Vendetta guy), and everyone in town thinks that Ken is the Phantom. It's up to Ken to prove them wrong and find out who his father is! Gee. One guess. This is SLOW. The plot just creeps along, not giving us a lot of suspense. The acting is OK, but the guy playing the sheriff seems to be sleepwalking through this role. As proved before in other movies, Ken Maynard is not much of an action star, as his fight scenes sure are flat. There are MUCH MUCH better westerns out there.
