Just got back from an advanced screening of this movie and I really liked it - it isn't phenomenal or overly brilliant - but what it is is very charming and a good time for the family or couple or anyone looking for a feel good movie. The acting is well-done by the entire the "creature" is cute and believable with enough "awwwwwwww" moments, but not too much to become redundant. I read about the legend of Loch Ness when I was about 6 years old and imagined and fantasized how awesome it would be to see and witness something like that - this is probably as close as I will ever come - so in essence, I've waited 30 years for this movie - and my family and I enjoyed it very much.
