Not long after the new animated series of Batman started they made a movie. Batman is suspected of murdering a gangster after a mysterious dark man does it. The police are now on the lookout for Batman (Kevin Conroy). Bruce Wayne (Batman's real name) meanwhile is having flashback's of a previous love, Andrea 'Andi' (Dana Delany) that he misses. When he finds her she obviously finds out he's Batman and they get back together. Unfortunately, he also finds out that she is this mysterious dark man, The Phantasm. Also, The Joker (Star Wars' Mark Hamill) is trying to find 'Andi' to kill her before he is next. A good animated film with some good action, and it almost warmed up towards the TV series. Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!
