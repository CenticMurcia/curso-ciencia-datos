i am going to keep this brief... if you value the use of your time this is one to miss.<br /><br />the film actually had an interesting start -3 young woman on a girls holiday meets a group of lads on holiday in a rented boat, drinks, drugs, flirting and banter... at this point you are still awaiting the film to really kick in, however up until this point, the film is still more than just watchable, which i thought had potential to continue in its tracks... suddenly, the whole film changes direction, they 'lose the plot' so to speak.. after a perfectly filmed porno styled orgy scene where the infamous DONKEY PUNCH DEATH occurs and the the carnage begins... words cannot explain how unrealistic the rest of the film plays out.. completely idiotic unbelievable murderous acts coming at you like flock of seagulls until all but the 'good girl' is left.. it was laughable. <br /><br />sorry guys! plot-less and pointless - very disappointing.
