'Big Brother' is without a shadow of a doubt the worst programme ever to have tainted our television screens. All it consists of is a group of people living in a large house far from the outside world but under the watchful eye of a C.C.T.V camera. The idea is to avoid periodic evictions from the house, whoever succeeds in this task will win a cash prize. Amongst the 'Brother' contestants, the most famous one was the now deceased Jade Goody (a girl who once thought East Anglia to be abroad!). Having a show like this on her C.V is nothing to be proud of. The show's title is named after the fictional character in George Orwell's novel 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'. I wonder if Orwell (if he were still alive that is) would be happy to find that one of his character's names is used as the title for such an excuse for a show, I think not! At least no one has to suffer this show any longer as the T.V stations have now come to their senses and taken 'Brother' off the air, though why it lasted as long as it did in the first place is beyond me.
