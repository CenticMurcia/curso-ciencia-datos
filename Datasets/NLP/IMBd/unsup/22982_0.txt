Brian Aherne stars as an aging stage actor. He is rich and famous, but very unhappy and tired. Most of this is because he's feeling that life has somehow passed him by--he's a relic of the past. His trophy wife isn't particularly interested in him and he longs for his long dead first wife and his idyllic youth.<br /><br />When he arrives late for the first rehearsal of his next play, the director (real-life director Sydney Pollack plays this part) is brash and obnoxious--further pushing him to long for the good old days.<br /><br />Then, suddenly, upon leaving the theater it's now 1927. He looks the same but everyone else is younger. And, to his great surprise, his old friend and wife are alive and full of life. You'd think that this would be everything he'd ever wished for, but Aherne soon learns that you can never go back.<br /><br />The theme of this episode is living in the moment and while this installment of the series isn't as weird or unpredictable as most, it manages to work well because of the nice leisurely pace that was created by Aherne. He glides slowly and deliberately through his role--instilling it with both class as well as sentimentality that I really liked. Not a great episode but also one well worth seeing.
