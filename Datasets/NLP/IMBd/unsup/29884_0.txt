It isn't often that you get to see a compelling film that deals with human sacrifices, love and the courage to find a true identity to lead a good moral life. . .<br /><br />Jason's Lyric was one film that became that testament of many issues combined. For me it's not just a film but more in terms of reaching out to those unfortunate souls living a somber life and helping to reflect on those wishing to make a change for the best.<br /><br />Allan Payne, Jada Pinkett and Bokeem Woodbine all give electrifying performances. One of the strongest issues the film dealt with was Payne's relationship as a brother to troubled Woodbine. The disturbing part for me though was Forest Whittaker's performance as the father who go's berserk after the Vietnam War, losing all sense of morality for himself and his family.<br /><br />A brilliant film, I can't recommend this film enough. <br /><br />8/10
