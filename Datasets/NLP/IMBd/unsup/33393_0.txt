Lmao!!! You guys think you have it bad watching this thing, I actually spent half my life in the little hick town it was filmed in.<br /><br />Now that is bad. <br /><br />Oddly only a small glimpse of the town is visible in the movie, in the scene where you can see an old barbed wire fence outside of the car window as John Schneider drives down the road... well the hill just above it has contained 3 apartment complexes since around 1992 and I currently reside in one of them.<br /><br />In another scene you can see out the door of the "Inn" (if you can call it that) the old historic Co-Op building which used to be a Railroad Station that was used in the Civil War (tracks have been gone since 1990 or so).<br /><br />Fortunately I did spend the other half of my childhood in various other places across the country.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am currently residing in good Ole' Tellico Plains Tennessee again ..... can't seem to stay out of this place .... aaahhh... omg it is a curse!!!!
