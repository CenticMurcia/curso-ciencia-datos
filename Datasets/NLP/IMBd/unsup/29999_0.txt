After reviewing some of the comments written by other contributors I felt I needed to clarify some issues raised.<br /><br />This was an independently produced film made with relatively unknown actors and a limited budget.<br /><br />That being said, the writing is a cut above most films put out to the public and the art direction (utilizing real apartments and settings) captures nicely the buffered world of New York City's Upper East Side.<br /><br />The acting style though it may appear to be arch and affected actually captures quite well the voice patterns and intonations of those people it portrays.<br /><br />The film is truly a small gem. The audience gets a glimpse into the lives of a privileged set of college aged "preppy" Manhattan-ites. Lots of fun music helps keep the scenes jaunty and most of the actors are well cast.<br /><br />The film while intellectual in bent, plays most of the scenes decidedly tongue in cheek which keeps the movie from feeling pretentious.<br /><br />The movie is a baby Hannah and Her Sisters if you will. I also enjoyed the director/writer's two other films to date, Barcelona and The Last Days of Disco.
