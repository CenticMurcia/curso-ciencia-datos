I saw this movie because I am a huge fan of the TV series of the same name starring Roy Dupuis and Pet Wilson. The movie was really good and I saw how the TV show is based on the movie. A few episodes of the TV series came directly from the movie and their similarity was amazing. To keep things short, any fan of the movie has to watch the series and any fan of the series must see the original Nikita.
