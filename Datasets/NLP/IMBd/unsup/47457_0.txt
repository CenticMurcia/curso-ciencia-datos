Unless you are American or have detailed knowledge of that country's history, this film is best avoided. Initially attracted to it through a fascination for time-travel movies, I ended up disappointed and confused. The use of colour and black and white does not correspond to the periods in time as I imagined initially and I ended up totally confused as to what time one was in. The premise for the film is interesting but the story itself, to me at least, was far from entertaining. There's also use of bad and crude language which I abhor in films generally, unless there is a very good reason for it. Quite frankly, I am not particularly interested in what JFK did or did not do with Marilyn Monroe ..doubtless, those people who are interested in this sort of thing will find some pleasure in the work. I know it is not easy to make time-travel films, a certain logic needs to be respected, but if in addition the story line is confusing for the spectator, there is no hope of salvation. Admittedly if I knew more about American politics at the time, fewer events would have passed me over but as a European, my interest in this particular part of American politics is limited - and even had I myself been a US citizen, I would never never have voted for a Democrat !
