Story: Aliens invade a redneck town in Alabama. Give anal probes and somehow create a hoard of zombies. A video store owner and rednecks with guns must now save the town.<br /><br />Review: I was laughing throughout this film. The parodies to the mighty Dead Quadrilogy (there are only three good American films, and they were all directed by Romero), South Park, and redneck jokes kept me laughing. There were also a lot of parallels to another parody, Shaun of the Dead. The acting in this movie wasn't good, but that was part of the charm and humor of this film. This is what Troma tries to do and fails. This was a nice low budget film with a spirited cast and director. The filming was very interesting because it was done on location in small town Alabama. It helped made the movie look authentic and original.<br /><br />Overall, this is a movie that you just have to set back and enjoy. It is not to be taken seriously. It is very flawed but charming. The story isn't brilliant and the acting is weak, but it still manages to keep you laughing with its originality.<br /><br />My Recommendation: It isn't for everyone. Fans of Dead Meat and Dead & Breakfast should like it. It is not a Shaun of the Dead, but it is very funny.
