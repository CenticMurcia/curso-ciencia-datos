After the brilliant adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel, we have a real stinker here. This is an insult to an excellent and original prequel. The only thing that was positive about this movie was the gorgeous girl that played the Psycho. Other than that, I am insulted as a huge fan of American Psycho. They should be ashamed of themselves for tainting the name with this piece of s%$# sequel.
