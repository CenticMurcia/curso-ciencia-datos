I don't want to give this 1 star, I wanted to like it, but it failed on so many counts to be either impressive or clever it's all it deserves.<br /><br />The story line could have actually said something, 24 hour media, terrorist threats, international cooperation, a US president doing something International - not unilateral. But it seemed to start an idea and then give up on it.<br /><br />I enjoyed the back flipping of time, but the continuity was terrible and the plot holes were too big to be forgiven. I'll allow a certain amount of coincidence in a film. But to accept all that this film asks is too much.<br /><br />Even the car chase, which was exciting and well shot, was horribly let down by the lack of continuity (damage and car badges, signs, models) If you don't want a European audience that's fine - but at least try to hide that it's mostly shot in Mexico. Do we shoot in Australia and claim it's the US? Finally. If i did forgive all of the above, and accept it as an action film with a few faults. The dialogue would still have been rock bottom. I've never heard the sound of a cinema audience's collective eyes rolling before.<br /><br />I know i should have read reviews first. But I'm trying to make up for it by writing this one.
