I have seen this movie one time, and will probably never want to see it again. I found "State Fair" disappointing with a boring storyline. The actors and actresses were great, and I have to say that Fay Bainter's role as Melissa Frake was a far greater performance than in that 60's version of "The Children's Hour". I didn't care much for this movie because the music wasn't that exceptional and I found that odd. Usually Rodger's and Hammerstein's musicals are the best. The acting was about an 8, the music was a 2, and the story line was -20. I don't recommend this to anybody.
