You already know it's a Jason Statham movie, as did I going into it. Also, following Paul W.S. Anderson's career, helped me decide what movie I was going to watch this weekend.<br /><br />Most Statham movies aren't going to contain any character or plot development. That's just his track record now as an action star. And with a title such as "Death Race," no one in their right mind should expect an epic of Oscar-worthy proportions.<br /><br />That being said, I really enjoyed this movie. I hate to use the term, but it really was a "no-brainer." It was very predictable. It had cars with machine guns and armor, that's what was shown in the trailers. It could be construed by some as a corny movie. But, it was what I fully expected. There are also some really bad one-liners in the movie. So bad, I just had to laugh a few times during serious scenes. But at 90 minutes, it was just enough time to get the point across.<br /><br />The beginning was a bit slow, but once the racing started, it never let up. The chasing and racing, and all of the loud gun-fire and explosions make me want this on DVD or BluRay real soon already. It was like a video game made with live actors. If you like a ridiculous amount of explosions and machine gun fire in a movie the typical Statham hero, this is your movie. If you want to be moved by any of gratuitous emotion, skip it.
