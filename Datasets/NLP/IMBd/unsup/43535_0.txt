I cant stand watching this show. Its painfully unfunny and I don't know how it lasted for 2 seasons. The jokes are horrible and the plot is rubbish. The characters are so annoying and I don't feel the least bit of entertainment. It just seems that they are trying too hard to be funny, that it backfired. Hopefully this will be a learning experience for them. Well its about Bonnie who is a mother, loving wife (clearly not a funny one) , and TV host of a local talk show. She tries to maintain a public image of the perfect wife and mother when in reality, her life is chaotic (and not funny).I thought I should give it a chance and maybe I just caught the show at a bad episode but I was wrong they are just plain fully uninteresting. They did do their best in to making this show funny but clearly their best wasn't good enough. I gave it a 4 for effort. But I personally find it UNFUNNY.
