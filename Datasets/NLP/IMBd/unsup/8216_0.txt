Very disappointing! I saw this documentary at a screening event and I actually walked out of the theater cause it was so bad. The sound editing was terrible, fisher's voice is enough to drive anyone into a mental institution (seriously - like freakin long pointy nails on a chalk board), and the bottom line is i don't think anyone really even knows of or cares about this man. I mean I certainly never heard of him, my friends never heard of him, so why make a film about him? why? My suggestion to the producers....try making a documentary about something worth watching next time and hire a different editor and sound person while you are at it. Also, maybe go back to film school, if you even attended, and try it again
