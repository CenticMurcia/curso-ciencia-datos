Four teens at a UK boarding school decide to skip a school trip and party in the bomb shelter. Soon, they realized they are actually locked in and mayhem ensues. Hmmm...this finally got released on DVD in the US and I am a bit disappointed...the trailer made this seem like a creepy straight-up horror flick, but it is more of a psychological thriller. It is entertaining and not predictable at first, but when you find out what is actually going on it does get a little silly. The performances are mostly good. Thora Birch shines as always. While it isn't groundbreaking or a great film, "The Hole" is better than most contemporary teen horror/thrillers. My Rating: 6.5/10.
