She Bitch, The Marsupials, were horrible sequels, and part IV was a disaster. So producers tried to copy the winning formula of "The Howling" and use it in "The Original Nightmare". The result is a mess, a disaster.<br /><br />Think about the original Howling, but with different and less likable characters, a less interesting setting, poorly done f/x, and a not so good plot. <br /><br />"The Original Nightmare" is a dull version of "The Howling" disguised as a sequel. The acting is horrid except for Romy Windsor who seemed to have a bright future because of her looks and decent acting skills. The direction is dull, boring, and does not offer anything for the viewer. The f/x as I mentioned, are poorly done and have nothing to do with the original. Ugh. The gore is laughable and I won't even talk about the beasts.<br /><br />Please, my advice is, avoid this horrid sequel. It's truly one of the worst sequels to any movie. Not to mention that it has one of the most horrible endings in the history of Horror! The look of Romy Windsor's face in the last scene summons the whole movie.
