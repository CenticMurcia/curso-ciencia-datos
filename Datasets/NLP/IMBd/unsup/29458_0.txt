Subhash Ghai - He has been my favorite for a long time. I was waiting for long for Kisna to release and saw it on the first day itself. However, I found that Kisna is rich is content but low in actual reproduction. The film builds up good . There is this foreign lady Catherine who is in her old age and comes to India to relive some of her childhood and youth memories !!! The movie is in a flashback.<br /><br />She tells her story as Catherine having Vivek (Kisna) as a childhood friend. It dates back to the times of Independence and caters to a small place called Devprayag in Uttaranchal. Her father was an English lord and Kisna the son of one of his servants. Her father did not like her association with the boy and sent her back to England only to return in her youth.<br /><br />He had also grown up now. By then it was 1947. The smell of independence gripped everyone...... A revolt!! and her house and family destroyed. She was in danger and Kisna's mother orders him to plunge and fill his 'Karma' of protecting her and safely deporting her to Delhi . In the way he has to pass through a tough phase of defending himself and her from many people including his own brother, uncle and many more. Finally he manages to safely reach her to Delhi where she asks him to marry her and leave for Britain.Though by this time he is also deeply in love with her, he must fulfill his 'Dharma' now, that is to marry his fianc√© Lakshmi . He departs leaving in her heart memories of love . Their love is thus immortalized.<br /><br />The songs were just superb and the music thanks to Ismail Darbar and A.R. Rehman , fabulous. Backed by great visuals and great performances notwithstanding the length of the movie which is quite long,I think it would be a descent watch. I give it a 8/10.
