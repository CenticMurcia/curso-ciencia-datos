How could one go wrong with a film about a masked cult in an Arizona desert town that worships someone called Bryan? The premise sounds pretty good, the execution, though, leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />This is mostly video-taped "archive footage" from a man who was investigating this cult. There's a bit of creepiness to the proceedings but mostly it's just plain dull. A classroom full of kids with Bryan masks is probably the most effective scene in the movie, but after that, well, there's nothing to hold one's interest. Even the presence of a few "cult film" types, like Tony Todd, George Wendt, Brinke Stevens, and even Lloyd Kaufman, can't save this, because their roles are pretty nondescript and brief. I can't really stress how disappointing this whole thing is, and it sounded so interesting. It's not.<br /><br />Anchor Bay used to be one of my favorite movie companies, and now its reduced to putting stuff out like this....pretty sad. Were they not making any money with the classic horror films that they used to put out? Very sad.<br /><br />Anyway, "Bryan Loves You" is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination, and the box art even states that it's "eerily reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange". Like hell it is. Avoid, avoid, avoid. 2 out of 10.
