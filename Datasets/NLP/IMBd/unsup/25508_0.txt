This is the only version of Jane Eyre that I've seen yet. I am reading the book now and the very dialogue of the movie is from the book. It does skip over her childhood, but if they included that it would be way too long. I wish that I could get it on video. My dad made a recording of it when it was on Masterpeice Theater on KQED a long time ago, but the tape is very bad now. I'd absolutely LOVE it if they could release it on video. The whole cast is excellent.
