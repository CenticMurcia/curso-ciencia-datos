The performances in this movie were so convincing that I found myself wanting to sit the starring trio down for a cup of coffee and a good old-fashioned intervention. It's so seldom that I find a movie of this caliber that's more gripping than it is entertaining. Only the most "grown-up" of movie goers will appreciate this truly compelling slice of life film. ENDURING LOVE is not for those who suffer from immaturity, ADD, or Mainstreamitis, although I find the three ailments are often interchangeable. If you couldn't care less about Paris Hilton's latest fiasco, or even better, you don't know who she is, then this movie is for you.
