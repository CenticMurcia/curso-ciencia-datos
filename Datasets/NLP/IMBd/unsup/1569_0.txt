A librarian living in a totalitarian state is deemed to be obsolete and expendable--since books and independent thinking are banned. So the self-righteous judge sentences him to death. However, and this made no sense to me, the manner of death was just plain silly and overly melodramatic--like the judge was playing with the librarian much like a cat might play with a doomed mouse. In the end, the tables (naturally) are turned.<br /><br />This seemed like one of the more preachy episodes of The Twilight Zone and is an obvious parable about not just Fascism but the horrors of Communism. Now I am NOT a fan of Communism--but the show is just so obvious and preachy that in the end I could see this show converting the audience to Communism! It just gives Democracies a bad name since it is so incredibly preachy and obvious.
