As a die-hard classic rock fan, I absolutely love this movie! "Rock School" is a movie that every future rock star should see.<br /><br />The person I was most amazed at, was 12-year-old CJ. I've never seen so much talent in a young boy. When he was at the Zappalan festival, everybody was bowing to him at the end of his performance.<br /><br />Will, Asa, and Tucker also had potential in music.<br /><br />Paul Green is a really good teacher when you think about it. Even though he can go off sometimes, it's usually for a good reason. I like people that know what real music is.<br /><br />In other words, everybody go see that documentary. 10 out of 10.
