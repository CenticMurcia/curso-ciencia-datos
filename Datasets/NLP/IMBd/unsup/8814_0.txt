What a great little film....This won't win Oscars or any other film award, but it will make you chuckle at the characters some of whom we all know in real life. What parent hasn't had the (mis)fortune to be part of ballet classes, whether it be classical, modern, tap or contemporary. Every week the little darlings don their leotards and ballet shoes and go along and join their other little friends and teacher Miss Denise (an ageing, usually overweight woman who shouldn't really wear a body hugging anything, but does. Every week she puts the kiddies through their steps, until the dreaded "End of year Dance Extravaganza" arrives. Parents fork out a lot of money to put their kids through dance class, then more money on costumes, buying the DVD, buying the music etc...all for 3 minutes on stage. This movie looks at it all, with hilarious consequences. Starring some of the best performers in Australian theatre, TV, cabaret and movies. A must see....it's awesome!!!!!
