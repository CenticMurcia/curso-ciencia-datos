The summary line says it all.<br /><br />Bogie as a kinda sexy guy, a la Casablanca, at first, but becoming more unhinged as time passes. (And a great nod to Casablanca's closing line.)<br /><br />An English country house with tea parties and hybrid rose gardens. Snooty neighbors and an eccentric housekeeper. <br /><br />A parish church with bells that chime at propitious moments. <br /><br />A glowing glass of poisoned milk (although not a glowy as in Suspicion).<br /><br />Kind of a fun movie, as it turns out.
