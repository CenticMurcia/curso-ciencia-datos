This movie was great, it had wonderful scenery, music, actors, the whole lot. It's very moving too: very sad and depressing. I saw it with 4 of my friends, and towards the end I could not stop squeezing my friend's hand. I was in a state of just *awe* for 1+ days after seeing it. It made me feel a lot like how i felt after "Escape from Sobibor." I predicted how the ending would play out (and i was right) even though I did not want it to. Very moving, very good, very sad...go see it unless you are the type who likes uplifting, comical films.
