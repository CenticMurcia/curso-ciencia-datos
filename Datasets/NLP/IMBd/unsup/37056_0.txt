I hardly know where to start. I was expecting things to be cut-out to make the book fit in a movie but not changed to such a degree that it almost seems like a different story.<br /><br />The whole movie seemed to be such a hurry that it felt like it was just a stumbling rush towards the end. <br /><br />Some of the characters did a decent enough job honouring their counterparts in the book; Meggie, Elinor, TeResa, Dustfinger, Magpie to mention a few.<br /><br />On the other hand Basta didn't even get close to portraying the evil, knife-wielding murderer. Flatnose just made me laugh, he was just big-nosed buffoon. He just needed to paint the nose red. I mean they are supposed to inspire fear and be purely evil.<br /><br />The ending? They actually managed to tie up all the loose ends, WHICH THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO!!! THERE IS A PART TWO AND PART THREE FOR GOD'S SAKE!<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Read the book instead! So much more enjoyable! Seems like just another movie trying to make money instead of entertaining the audience.
