Possibly one of the worst but also one of the funniest horrors I have ever seen and believe me I have seen allot. It starts off derivative and ends atrociously but I was hysterical all the way through. there is no motive for the awakening of these "zombies", there is no plot to speak of, it is tacky and crude but, shamefully hilarious. The dubbing is terrible as is the acting ( "OH ................. ......................................God!!!!") there is not much blood to speak of either although the version I watched is probably the cut one. The incest sub-plot is nasty but strangely amusing the list of complaints could go on and on I did not even speak of the zombies themselves! This is an extremely bad film. If you like that kind of thing (as I do) you should watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
