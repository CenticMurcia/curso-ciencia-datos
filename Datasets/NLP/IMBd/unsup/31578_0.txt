Robert De Niro plays David Callaway with his daughter Emily Callaway, played by Dakota Fanning. During New Years Eve, there is a party. Then we see David goes to sleep. We see a hand touch his face, he wakes up, and walks to the bathroom and finds his wife in suicide. The next day, Emily is in a mental hospital and the family decides to move out. During their stay, Emily makes up an "imaginary friend". David meets a nice neighbor that he likes to spend the rest of his life with. Emily's "imaginary friend" starts to kill people. Now we don't know if that person is imaginary or not.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a New Years Eve party. We just see glimpses of it. We see David's wife going somewhere. He follows without telling and the next thin we see is a face touching across his face. We see the black hallway, in which David walks, lighted by light in the bathroom door. He opens it to find his wife committed suicide. He and his daughter moves somewhere and they meet new friends. Even David meets a new woman. Emily doesn't appreciate this because she said that nothing can replace her mom. Then her imaginary friend turns out not too imaginary at all.<br /><br />This movie is thrilling and is the edge-of-your-seats thriller. The performances by De Niro and Fanning are great. John Polson tries to confuse us if the imaginary friend is actually real or not. The tone for this film is dark and dull. There are some clich√©s in this thriller. This is not a horror film but plays like one. In some parts, it's scary. We think to ourselves that we can solve this mystery all by ourself but misses it and the last few minutes reveal the big "twist" of the imaginary friend.<br /><br />This movie is smart, in the way it plays out. There are suspicions that if a neighbor might be Charlie, the imaginary friend. There are many things that Charlie has done that makes David think that his daughter, actually did them. He doesn't believe whatever Emily says. We go in our mines back and forth to solve this mystery but it doesn't work out.<br /><br />This is a great and suspenseful edge-of-your-seats thriller. It's not a horror film. This film is rated R but I don't know why? It has everything a PG-13 movie needs so I can tell it's a appropriate for children under 17. Watch this movie if you're into mysteries and thrillers but no horror.
