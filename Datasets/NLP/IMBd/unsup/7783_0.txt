Not quite slapstick but nearly entertaining, Ninja Bachelor Party is your best last resort for a dying party or boring summer afternoon. The plot meanders, the mostly intelligible voice-overs are funny, and the almost steady camera work will make you wish you had DramamineÂ®. A must see that will leave you scratching your head as to just exacly WHY it's a must see.
