If I were writing a script about the making of this movie I would have had a few friends sitting around after watching Shawn of the Dead and Day of the Living Dead (original) while getting high and munching on Rice Krispie treats and canned chili.<br /><br />One of them would suddenly jump up and scream, "hey, let's make a zombie movie."<br /><br />One would remember the old 8mm movie camera in Dad's closet, one would admit to having been in the school production of A Tree Grows In Brooklyn (probably as the tree), and someone would reveal the fact that he had been hiding a bunch of Smurf blue skin dye for years. <br /><br />Okay, so it was very low budget and looked like a high-school class assignment, it was still somebodies baby. And they got it made while most people sit around criticizing something that they have never done themselves. Most of the people who make these films don't aspire to become a Spielberg or a Coppola, they just want to make movies any way the can. I say god bless them all. We should all do the things that we enjoy, even if we aren't that good at it.<br /><br />Even if you hate the movie, remember two things: It is easier to criticize than to do; even a bad example is still an example.
