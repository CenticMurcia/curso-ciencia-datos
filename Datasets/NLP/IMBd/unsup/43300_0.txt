I've finally been able to see what Satin City/Universal Studios did to Red Dwarf in 1992 for the US. There were actually two pilots, which makes things a bit confusing for everyone. I was able to only see Pilot #1 but I researched Pilot #2 to give some background about it as well. I will try to lay everything down in small bits.<br /><br />Pilot #1 had a male Cat, a clean shaven Lister and Kryten. Of course, taking the plot from the UK pilot, entitled "The End". I did get a few chuckles out of this pilot but I shook my head in sorrow the rest of the time.<br /><br />Pilot #2 had some recasting as well as a different general plot altogether. This time the writers took ideas from the UK episodes of `Backwards' `Terrorform' and `Parallel Universe' and used them in a style ala `Tikki to Ride' recapped `Out of Time'. This premise would've been a better start. I never saw it, but I read some scripts and saw some pictures from it. It was sounding better, but not by much.<br /><br />*** Spoiler Alert ***<br /><br />My thoughts about Pilot #1 are as follows. The UK music would've been just fine for the beginning theme of the US version; Todd Rundgren's version was more like elevator music. The adaptation of Kryten was just to give the show flavour and nothing much more. Recapping the premise at the end of the episode makes people feel stupid, especially throwing in bogus footage from the UK series. The part of Lister was out of place; Lister is smeggy and always should be - where's the cigarette smoking, curry eater we love? The set was way too functional and futuristic for the 22nd century, especially for an old mining ship. They should've casted Mac MacDonald as the Captain, at least for the pilot. You can clearly see Craig Charles' face in the mask while painting the F in Red Dwarf in the beginning. The opening minutes, the overview should've been done with a bit more charm; having a guy talk about his sex life isn't a good start on a premise, especially in a command room setting. I didn't like the Battlestar Galactica feel to it. The graphics were actually worse, though it sounds impossible, than the UK version; this does include the credits. Finally the corny jokes, the general atmosphere and the canned laughter were the biggest issues of mine.<br /><br />My thoughts about Pilot #2 are as follows. They should've kept their first choice as Rimmer instead of using Anthony Fuscle, who looks way too muscular and not weasely enough. This pilot version also gives life to a female cat who is not at all like the UK version; instead, Terry Farrell, was casted as courageous and sharp-witted - obviously casted as a sex object. Kryten is in this version as well; I can't say anything bad about Robert. They used a lot of clips from Pilot #1 and the BBC version, which in my mind was not a good idea; starting fresh would've given them a better chance at selling the idea.<br /><br />The scripts for this premise were rewrites of the originals from the BBC with all the best parts taken to make a full episode. They would've had a lot less material overall and only could've done about 2-3 seasons rather than eight series, like the BBC version.<br /><br />In my opinion, instead of trying to mesh something like this for American audiences, they should sell the original Red Dwarf - Season by Season - to Sci-Fi or Comedy Central in the US. This would give true fans of comedy, or Sci-Fi, a great piece of work that entertains millions of people overseas, including Prof. Stephen Hawking and Patrick Stewart. I believe in 1992 there was no Comedy Central or Sci-Fi - but there was a USA Network; that would've had a great spot to run these on a nightly schedule around 11pm, right between two episodes of Wings.<br /><br />As for this version, I will give it an overall rating of 2/10, mainly for the idea. However there was no originality. A rule of thumb is that the concept should never change, even if the idea is ported overseas.
