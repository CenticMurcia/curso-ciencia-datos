Chevy Chase is just awesome, I can't say it enough. He is funny in every movie he's in. Charles Grodin is good in this one too. I love the way he moans and groans like a wuss. It's hilarious. This movie is just funny. Chevy leads the laughs, and the black butler Chester cracks me up. Watch it, it comes on an HBO every 2 hours it seems like .
