I went to watch this movie with a lot of excitement in the Estonian film festival but to my surprise the movie, presented in the style of opera, did not come close to my expectations. Even after knowing the story of Rama and Sita, I could not understand parts of the plot. It seemed the director had tried to put everything in one movie and somewhere forgot to connect the parts. A few scenes didn't seem to have any connection with the movie. This is not my attempt to completely bash the film , I will also add that there were some good musical parts and dance sequences but still the movie couldn't keep me or others watching the movie glued to the screen or even interested. Close to the end we were just looking at our watches to get out of the theater.
