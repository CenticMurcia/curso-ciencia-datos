An absolutely awful movie that's only redeeming feature is it's occasional moments of unintentional humour, when dodgy camera effects and ham-handed acting produce giggles instead of drama and suspense. The acting is terrible, the script is worse and the plot is just ridiculous. The only actor doing anywhere near a competent job is Marg Helgenberger, who plays to type as a "street-wise cop". The dialogue is clich√©d and stilted and the storyline is so convoluted and outlandish that you'll think you've been teleported into a different movie sometime during the second half. Unless you want to have a bit of a chuckle at this cringe-inducing film that I judge to be the worst I have seen (beating even the horrific "Johnny Mnemonic"), give this one a miss. It's not worth the renting price.
