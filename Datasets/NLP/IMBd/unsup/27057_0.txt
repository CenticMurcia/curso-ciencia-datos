Wearing it's Italian-American heart on it's blood-soaked sleeve, this derivative horror film has a group of unlikable, stupid jocks and their girlfriends getting killed by a masked killer while a retired police detective pairs up with a female one to try to find out who the murderer is. Lamely acted and uninteresting, uninvolving plot line makes this play out like countless other 'teen slashers' of the '90's/2000's. Not a totally worthless film, merely a ho-hum bad one that no one give two damns about as they likely have seen some variation of it before (and better). Sal Sirchia as Troy, a mentally challenged janitor, is absolutely horrible in his role in this film (everyone else in the movie are FAR from master thespians themselves, but he stood out as the worst) <br /><br />Eye Candy: Misty Meeler gets topless in the obligatory shower scene <br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />DVD Extras: 4 featurettes (Music and the Sound, Special FX Make-up, The Beat down, and Rico Behind the Mask); a Promo for Fear.net; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for "Midnght Meat Train", "Seance", "Dead Man's Bounty", & "Christie's Revenge"
