This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. I wanted to turn it off about 10 minutes into it but my husband insisted we give it a fair chance. There was a part in the middle where the never ending dry dullness of the movie actually did pick up but it was only momentarily and followed again by the rest of the movie sucking. Ron Perlman was one of the worst dramatic actors I've ever seen, my pug could have recited the lines and been more believable then he was. It was an ongoing mystery but the only mystery was when would the movie get good? I have absolutely NOTHING positive to say about this piece of crap hack job of a movie. I am completely and utterly disgusted that i paid money for this thank god it was cheap.
