I really don't like to say bad things about most movies I watch, no matter how bad they are. I also like 80s horror movies. CHUD, unfortunately, is a not a good movie. It is very silly and even funny sometimes in places where it was intended to be serious. <br /><br />The dialog is hard to believe and its annoying sometimes because half the time it makes the movie go by very slowly when I wish I saw some action happening. <br /><br />Cinematically it doesn't look good either. You never actually see the monsters, and when you do see them, the masks and makeup are poorly done. They are green and they have Christmas lights for eyes. Half the movie is set in a dark sewer where nothing is happening until the end of the film. Even with the bad makeup these monsters could have been made to play a bigger part in the movie. So that is kind of a disappointment. There is a funny scene where some guys are trying to contact someone while the guy near the other line is yawning in your face. There is also a funny part where one of the characters swallows a quarter when preventing someone from making a phone call. That was funny too. <br /><br />CHUD is based on a pretty interesting premise though. Having scary hungry mutants populate the sewer is simple yet scary. Its just not carried out well.<br /><br />I must say that CHUD is very watchable, despite its shortcomings. Its not that bad. Its funny because its silly and some of the actors are doing pretty good job.
