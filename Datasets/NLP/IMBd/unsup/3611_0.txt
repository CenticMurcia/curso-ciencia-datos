I've seen and read so many time travel things over the years that I know one could pick at this forever. Still, once we embrace the technology and go with the plot, it's hard to stop watching. This evaded me when it first came out. I rented it and was captured. First of all, it's that cool Denzel thing he does. Especially when he is quizzing someone. He knows he's the man and he leaves the person being spoken to looking to see if his wallet has been stolen. I remember some of this from "Remember the Titans." The passing in and out of realities begs the question of what will happen to the characters when they make it back? Especially if we like them. And we do. The government, of course, does what it can to screw up, but the rebel always get his way, doesn't he? This is a film one thinks about long after seeing it. I decided to ignore the science and just enjoy it. I would have given it 9 but there are some plodding parts in the middle. It also suffers from a bit too much avoidance of common sense.
