James Toback's slight film When will I be Loved has two important things going for it: First, shower scenes that linger longingly over the truly impressive dancer's torso of the Neve Campbell. Secondly, the fact that unlike many of the beautiful bodies that appear in films, this one belongs to an an honest to goodness actor who infuses meaning, mystery and interest into Toback's otherwise shallow and unconvincing story. Her purposefully understated performance in The Company is clearly revealed a choice, as opposed to, say the blank stylings that characterize the work of the great stone face, Keanue Reeves<br /><br />Who should see this film in theaters: Neve Campbell completists.
