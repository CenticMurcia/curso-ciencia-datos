The only two similarities to this classic novel were the title and the names of the main characters. Poor old Jerome must have turned in his grave as he looked down and watched this being created. The original book contained a multitude of comic situations which could have been harvested to create a memorable film but someone somewhere had a better idea ! All three leading actors where perfectly cast to play Jerome's characters, if only they had been allowed to do so then this could well have become a British comedy classic.<br /><br />Poor acting, directing and script with lightweight story line. One for all concerned to erase from their memoirs ! A great cast who must have shuddered and shrunk down in their seats at the showing of each days rushes.
