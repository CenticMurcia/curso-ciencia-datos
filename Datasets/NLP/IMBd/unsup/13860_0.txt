This fun musical is a treat to watch. It's clever and silly and exuberant. It is filled with great musical number and actually has a fairly decent plot. And of course, it has my favorite things in it: singing, dancing and a happy ending! There are a number of memorable performances. I mean, who is going to forget Billie Hayes Mammy Yokum declaring "I has spoken!", or Epassionata Von Climax's (Stella Stevens)mantra "What's in it for me?" The supporting roles were all so colorful and wonderful (I still laugh every time Evil Eye Fleagle scurries into a scene!) And we must not forget one of the best non-speaking roles ever, Stupifying Jones (Julie Newmarz).<br /><br />So if you want to enjoy an almost perfect musical with a few genuine belly laughs along the way, then this is the musical for you!
