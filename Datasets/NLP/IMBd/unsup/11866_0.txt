Sinbad sets out to save a buddy of his, a prince, from a spell that has transformed him into a baboon. Meanwhile he woos Jane Seymour who plays the prince's sister. This Sinbad film suffers from a really dumb story and one of the campiest villains to appear on film. This is not the strongest example of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion effects. However, the duel with demons at the film's opening and the battle between the Trog and a sabertooth tiger make this worth a look. Don't be fooled by the film's G rating. With it's violence, scary monsters, and a scene featuring quite a bit of skin from Jane Seymour and Taryn Power, let's just say the MPAA was generous.
