'Turbulence' is a daft movie, but a daft movie with good special effects, Ray Liotta/Lauren Holly (which is better than it seems) and - above all - is fun to watch.<br /><br />'Fear of Flying' (frankly, I reckon they added the 'Turbulence 2' to avoid litigation) is a ludicrous movie, with re-used footage from 'Turbluence', Craig Sheffer - my least favorite actor who has been in TWO other air disaster movies, 'Flying Virus' and 'Cabin Pressure' - and is absolutely humdrum.<br /><br />This film is not "So bad it's good!", it's "So bad its awful!". For one, Craig Sheffer is not a likable hero. He's a bumbling little weenie! I think I connected better with the bloody hijacker than anyone else! The supporting cast is not even worth a mention, and it sickens me to think that they reused one scene of this movie in Jodie Foster's 'Flightplan' (who keeps writing these bloody clich√©d scripts, anyway? Is it the same one guy?!?!). Heck, even 'Turbulence 3' was better than this! Yes, you heard me - 'TURBULENCE 3' is BETTER than this. Craig Sheffer should be BANNED from making movies. Locked up somewhere. He's such an AWFUL actor! And yes, I realize I'm having a whinge - but it's true! The worst part of this movie is HIM, in all his cocky, scaredy-cat 'save the world and my family' glory! I hate this movie!!!
