This film doesnt make the mistake of taking itself too seriously. The dialogue alone kept me interested throughout the picture so I never found myself suffering through a section of the movie to get to "the good part" Given the genre and the title of this film Im not expecting material deserving of an Academy Award. It does exactly what it sets out to do and in doing so earns a 9 out of 10 rating from me.
