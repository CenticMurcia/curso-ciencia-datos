WOW! All I can say is WOWWEEWOWWOW!!!! This blockbuster flick kept in a cold sweat from the first moment the bees made their swarmy appearance, I am shocked that this movie was inexplicably panned at the 2002 Oscars?!?! Not only was the spellbinding special effects ignored but the jaw dropping performances of to many actors to mention was also forgotten?? Who in Gods name does this sort of atrocity happen in Hollywood in the 21st Century....this movie needs to "Bee" re-released toot sweet perhaps now the so called insiders will be able to appreciate just what they missed the first time out. If you see this movie on you TV listings, I urge you to drop everything and anything you are doing to make time for this entertainment roller coaster, be it the Superbowl or birth of your first child... you wont be disappointed!!!!
