Coronal mass ejections from the Sun are the gimmick the makers of this film use to get you in front of the TV (or worse, inside a theater where you may have paid to see it).<br /><br />Extinction level events are the hack screenwriter's new refuge from the demands of serious drama and this is no different - except that coronal mass ejections are much less plausible as an extinction-level event than, say, impact by a large asteroid.<br /><br />Apart from this most obvious flaw in the movie, we're also expected to believe that these coronal mass ejections somehow keep satellites from burning up on re-entry, so they can take out streets full of people (for example, if the Soviet spy satellite which scattered itself all over the Yukon Territory back in the late 1970s had done so over downtown Detroit instead, the carnage could have been impressive).<br /><br />In this film, methane (and not carbon dioxide) is contaminating the upper atmosphere. Pockets of methane unaccountably ignite, causing atmospheric chaos for no real reason. And according to this movie, we can also dispense with all the money we're spending on ballstic missile defense - F-15 fighter planes can handle terminal stage ballistic intercepts just fine. Has Boeing been holding out on us?<br /><br />I keep harping on the problems created by stupidity in plot details because they damage willing suspension of disbelief by the audience and make the movie hard to enjoy. The factual errors in the plot of "Solar Strike" aren't points on which reasonable men of science can disagree, they're a series of clinkers which anyone who passed high school chemistry (or even "general science") will have trouble setting aside in order to enjoy the film.<br /><br />And the film needs the help. We enjoy "Society of Extraordinary Gentlemen" and "Van Helsing" despite the campy Victorian "science" because the actors and screenwriters do a good job and the story recruits the audience as a willing conspirator.<br /><br />The writers and director don't get Lou Gossett and the other "name" actors close enough to the goal to score. Even Lou Gossett can't sound intelligent when the lines he has to deliver are palpably foolish. There's nothing in this plot, the characterizations, or the dialogue to entertain.<br /><br />This is a dismal, dismal, dismal waste of the viewer's time. You have to wonder if SciFi Network shows garbage like this because of a special dumb movie discount or something.
