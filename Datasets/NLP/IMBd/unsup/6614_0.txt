OK first of all, i hated it. I watched The Prince & me like 100 times like literally. but now u have just ruined it for me with the second one. First off u forgot some characters Eddies sister, and Page's older brothers, Pages best friend, second, you casted not one person that was in the first one in the second one, I loved that movie u just ruined it with the second one, Some of the characters i had no idea what the hell they were doing or who the hell they were. so i was completely lost throughout the whole movie. So I really hope that u stop producing this movie and i really hope that you all(producer, writer, and director) a different career. really i'm not lying, me and my friends are really disappointed and please stop making these horrible movies and i would like my money back(witch was 6 dollars) back you could sent it to me in a check or u could personally give me that money and i really hope that u stop making movies because truthfully you really suck at making them thank you for your time goodnight not love (at all) Jesi, Lexie, and Chelsea you have ruined my night completely goodnight you my e-mail me back if u have anything to say to prove to us that this movie doesn't completely suck ass
