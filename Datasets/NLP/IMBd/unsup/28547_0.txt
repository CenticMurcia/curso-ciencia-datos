I was very surprised after watching the other films from the BMWs films "The Hire", because although all were clever and entertaining, none had the emotional power of this one. Guy Richie's was great but in a humorous way, and more as an homage to BMW's cars.... Powder Keg was about as deep and attaching and emotional and real as you can get in a 7 min film.<br /><br />Shot in a documentary style way in 16mm, it's a great look at the genius of an upcoming director. 8-1/2 /10
