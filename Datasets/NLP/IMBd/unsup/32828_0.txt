The first thing I thought after seeing this movie was "How is this possible that 'The Believer' actually won a price at the Sundance Filmfestival????"<br /><br />It's not that it's all bad, but it's not a movie I would call good. First, there are dozens of little errors. Especially in the beginning the editing is bad. Two times you get the feeling "where am I?" after a very quick cut to a scene somewhere else with the same characters. You get disoriented by it.<br /><br />Another error, when Danny vomits on the street, his girlfriend (who is actually not yet really his girlfriend) comes after him and french kisses him!! Man, that's gross! You just don't do that!<br /><br />The main character Danny, doesn't convince me either. Why did he become a skinhead? Okay, there's this explanation of banishment when he was a child, but I just don't see how you can choose for being a skinhead after that. And doesn't it seems slightly odd that although Danny has a huge collection of jewish items, knows hebrew by heart and doesn't want anyone to get close to the tora, and nobody seems to think, "well, maybe he's jewish???"<br /><br />Last but not least, there's the acting. Especially the flash-backs are very bad acted. The young Danny-boy tries to much and thinks he's as good as Haley Joel Osment. Furthermore, the older Danny tries a bit too hard to look like Edward Norton in American History X. I have to say, some of his looks sometimes work very well, but alas, most of the time they're just rip-offs.<br /><br />No, it really astonishes me that this movie won a prize. Well, it's just one prize, but because of that, I think less about the Sundance Filmfestival. A grand jury should know better than to give this movie a prize.
