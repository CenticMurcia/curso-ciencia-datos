Taye Diggs plays Harper Stewart, a writer who is just about to release a new book full of uncomfortable similarities between himself, his friends and the characters contained within. Can he stop people recognising the thinly veiled truth as he prepares to be the best man at his best friend's funeral or will past betrayals finally be brought to the surface at the most unfortunate of times? On top of that, his friends have their own problems and neuroses and Harper has to decide if he is finally ready for commitment with his girlfriend, who he loves very much but seems to keep distant from in certain areas.<br /><br />Yes, it's a romantic comedy-drama full of moments that we've seen done before and while unoriginality is not a cinematic sin (or, good grief, we would rarely see any film released in cinemas) it isn't a good thing when everything has been done BETTER than the movie you're currently watching.<br /><br />The cast is appealing enough (Diggs is fine, Morris Chestnut is very good, Nia Long is lovely, Terrence Howard is a standout and Harold Perrineau is great as the one "whipped" male of the group) and even the supporting members do well (Regina Hall is cuter than she's ever been and Sanaa Lathan makes the most of her limited character . . . the girl that Diggs should realise he wants to keep hold of) but this movie limps along thanks to a dull script and flat direction with nothing to really immerse you in the movie's environment.<br /><br />A romantic comedy-drama with unfunny "comedy", romance you don't care for and drama that starts to unfold before you even get to know who's involved in it all. When the ball does get rolling you can already see how things are going to end up. A poor show.<br /><br />See this if you like: Brown Sugar, The Brothers, Morris Chestnut.
