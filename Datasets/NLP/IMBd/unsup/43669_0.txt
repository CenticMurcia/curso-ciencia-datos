A Loretta Young vehicle. She plays Letty, a single mother with an obstreperous son, Mickey (Jackie Kelk). Letty has some sort of job wearing dresses at nightclubs혰it's a little obscure, but the point is, she gets to look pretty. Mickey gets knocked over by a milk truck driven by dairy magnate Malcolm Trevor (Cary Grant), and Letty, Mickey, and a shady lawyer try to get damages, but somebody's taken film of Mickey running and jumping, so they throw the case out of court and Mickey gets taken away, first by matrons, and then by the soft-hearted Trevor. Mickey rather likes the posh life, and the affection of Trevor and his wife Alyce (Marion Burns). Then the scheming Letty tries to get her son back by fascinating Trevor혰easily done혰but the noble response of the wife, first in not making a fuss, and then saving Mickey from drowning in the swimming pool, changes her mind. She dumps Trevor, though he's ready to divorce his wife for her, and walks away, teary-eyed. Big unselfish act, probably her first. The movie ends rather abruptly, after Letty's friend remembers some incident or other from the boy's infancy, saying something about how cute he was. Letty gazes tearfully into the middle distance. "Yeah," she says. That's the end. The bad girl goes good. Young does a decent enough job with this melodrama. The kid Kelk is knobby-kneed, big-eared, and a ham. Grant is mostly a stick figure혰any upright actor would do. Good thing it's only an hour long.
