I elected to devote three hours to watching this remake because I am a big fan of the original movie. But this remake was painfully violent and gory. The writers left no stone unturned in thinking up new ways to show people dying in brutally vicious ways.<br /><br />The original movie did not have this same level of violence and insanity. Yet it still kept an edge-of-your-seat level of suspense. It's too bad the producers of the remake felt that they needed a significant level of blood and guts to attract an audience.<br /><br />Also, the commercials, which seemed to come every 10 minutes, kept breaking up the flow. It felt as if a full hour of the three was ads! It was hard to get into the story when it was only delivered in small chunks amidst frequent commercials.<br /><br />There was indeed some good acting, however. Benjamin Bratt and Eric McCormack gave stand-out performances. They were fantastic. I also very much liked Daniel Dae Kim who was perfect in this role. Andre Braugher, however, was a little too over the top in his militarism, and became less than believable.<br /><br />Summary: go rent the original and enjoy a fantastic adventure that can truly stand the test of time.
