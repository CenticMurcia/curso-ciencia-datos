One of the worst movies I've ever rented. Sorry it had one of my favorite actors on it (Travolta) in a nonsense role. In fact, anything made sense in this movie.<br /><br />Who can say there was true love between Eddy and Maureen? Don't you remember the beginning of the movie ?<br /><br />Is she so lovely? Ask her daughters. I don't think so.
