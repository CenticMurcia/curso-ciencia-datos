The user rating says it all. This is supposed to be the biggest hit of Indian film history! Sorry I saw it only after 2 years and it was still running full, and I din't like it. Reason : its not the original. The story was borrowed form a Telugu classic 'Abhinandana'. It was a tragedy and hence not so salable. The director cleverly moulded the story with a happy ending.<br /><br />It looks like a typical marwari marriage party with the all the ingredients: Big family, happy family, no bad guys. The story is thin line and moves form one song to another, with some funny tricks added, like the old trial and test methods. This is no food for the head movie.<br /><br />It is solely for family entertainment, a picnic and a money spinning machine.<br /><br />Not recommended for serious viewing.
