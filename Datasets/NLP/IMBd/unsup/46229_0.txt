I'm quite a big fan of Stephen Chow's newer work, from King of Comedy to Kung Fu Hustle. But God of Cookery just didn't work for me. Of course there was some good fun in it, but there was also far too much vulgarity and other tasteless forms of humor that I happen not to appreciate.<br /><br />The worst, though, was that the story was so messy. There was hardly any structure to it (and of course the absolutely abysmal subtitles ruined even more of it), and it wasn't clearly told at all.<br /><br />Quite simply, not a very good movie. I can understand why Chow's movies didn't get popular outside of Asia until the brilliant Shaolin Soccer.<br /><br />My rating: 4 out of 10.
