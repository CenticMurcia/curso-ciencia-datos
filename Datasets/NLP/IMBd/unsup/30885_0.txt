This movie is a fond memory for me, yes i know that sounds weird as it is a movie about a horrible war that i am too young to know about. The reason is, The man Ken Wahl portrays in this film is my grandfather. The names have been changed and no one ever officially stated that it is his story. But it is. This is what happened to my grandfather in the 60s. He was sent home to Lakewood WA where his family lived (my grandmother uncle aunts and father were) he never related the intricate details to any of us. he worked as a doctor for the rest of his life. He passed away in September 2002 on the first anniversary of 9/11. but as i watch this movie, i am reminded of him. and what he did for his country.
