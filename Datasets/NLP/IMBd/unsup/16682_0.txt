While he did not direct it, but rather, only wrote a screen adaptation of his own play, this overlooked slapstick film from 1972 is one of Woody Allen's finest treasures. Back in the day when Woody was just as slapstick as he was verbal, "Play It Again, Sam" tells the story of Allen as a divorced film critic crushed by the failure of his marriage. A huge fan of Humphrey Bogart, Allen soon looks to an imaginary incarnation of Bogie to guide his fearful (and clumsy) voyage back into the single life. He is aided by his best friend Dick and his wife Linda (Woody regulars Tony Roberts and Diane Keaton), who assist him in setting up one disastrous date after another. Soon enough, Woody discovers that sometimes you actually find true love but it doesn't always work out the way you wish.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care too much for the whole Bogart-as-mentor thing. I spend most of the film cracking up at Woody's clumsy gestures and neurotic nay-sayings. As usual in an Allen film, Keaton gives a sweet, self-effacing performance. Because the film was directed by Herbert Ross, the typical rambling dialogue and back-and-forth editing is toned down a bit, so for an Allen vehicle, the movie feels more mannered and has more of a narrative strength than Woody's other wacky 70's productions. Still, Woody has never made me laugh harder - ever.
