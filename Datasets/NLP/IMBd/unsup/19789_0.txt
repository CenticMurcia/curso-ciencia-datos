"Shadow Builder" doesn't only dispose of the ugliest VHS-cover in the history of cinema, it also is one of the most ineptly bizarre films I ever had the (mis)fortune of seeing. The film is a little bit based on a short story by Bram Stoker (you know, the guy who gained some fame with his vampire novel) but the scriptwriter obviously had a lot of fun adding insane stuff that comes from his own imagination, like a swearing priest who operates 9mm gunsÂ…with laser beams! Believe it or not, but there are many interesting ideas and ingenious details noticeable in "Shadow Builder", and with a slightly more coherent script, the film might have been very good. It introduces a quite original monster, in the shape of Darth Vader-resembling demon that can only reign in the shadows. He has been summoned by a bunch of freaks and now he's looking for 12-year-old Chris Hatcher. During the sun eclipse, demon-guy will use Chris to make the world come to an end because he was born with stigmata. Yes, very clever!! Michael Rooker stars as the troubled priest who stalks the demon all over the country and Tony "Candyman" Todd has an insignificant role as the town's nut. The film is actually quite enjoyable, but only during the moments when the plot doesn't necessarily have to make sense, like for example the neat sequences of the town in chaos or when the demon possesses random souls in order to gain power. Director Jamie Dixon tries to uphold a constant level of action and most cast members seem to fulfill their job with great devotion. I can't properly judge the use of special effects, though. Some visual gimmicks are quite well done whereas others are lousy and on the verge of pitiful. Definitely not a must-see, but if you're a fan of silly horror, it's worth watching when it comes on TV or something.
