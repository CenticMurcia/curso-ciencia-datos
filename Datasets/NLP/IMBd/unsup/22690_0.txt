I do not think I have watched any comedy series without laughing 90% of every single show. The guests have always been top notch (perhaps with the exception of Ardal O Hanlon) and they never fail to make me laugh. This is what I believe to be true comedy, the art of improvisation. You get something different every time and it must require great talent to adapt to these situations so quickly! Highlights of this programme include Party Quirks and Standing, sitting, bending. Clive Anderson makes a very droll host. I believe the British version to be superior due to less whooping from the audience (although the American audiences are better participators!). Although we have our fair share of great comedians on here including Tony Slattery, Jim Sweeney and Josie Lawrence to name but a few, the Americans and Canadians bring a fair share of laughter. My particular favourite is Ryan Stiles, who in my eyes is a modern comedy genius! Closely followed by the lovely Colin Mochrie.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this program. Comedy has never been done so good.
