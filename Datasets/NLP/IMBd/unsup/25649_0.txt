Alien couple and child with cone-shaped noggins crash land on Earth and set up house in suburbia until their people can come and rescue them. Over-produced, under-written comedy dud, an extension of the shaggy, funny skits on the earliest years of TV's "Saturday Night Live", never cuts loose. Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin return to their roles as Beldar and Prymatt, though perhaps passing the torch on to different comic actors might have been wise (neither star looks very enthused about re-boarding this vehicle). Worse, a gratuitous, unfunny subplot involving Michael McKean as a Special Agent who tracks down "illegal aliens" is given far too much time on the clock. Some of the cameos are fun, and newcomer Michelle Burke has a nice presence as teenager Connie Conehead, but this is otherwise forgettable stuff indeed. *1/2 from ****
