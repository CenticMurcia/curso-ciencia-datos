So it's a Romeo and Juliet type movie only it has to do with class differences and color In Mexico, there is much racism and hate against dark and poor people but these two young lovers do not care. They fight against all odds to continue their relationship but this all ends in tragedy. Cute guys! Great actors and lots of fun too! Most of the youth in this movie began acting careers as children. I recommend this movie as well as others like Sexo Pudor y Lagrimas, Amores Perros and Ladies Night although this last one is more like a "chick flick" because there are male strippers, a bachelorette party, many guys and lots of fun! The others are great though!<br /><br />NONA
