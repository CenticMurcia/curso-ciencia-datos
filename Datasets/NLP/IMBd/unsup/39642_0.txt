This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Everything about it was so horrible that I'm surprised I finished watching it. The acting: terrible. The special effects: terrible. Plot: EXTREMELY BAD!<br /><br />I don't see how people can like this giant piece of crap. Doesn't the director have enough sense to know that all he did was embarrass himself in front of thousands of people that watched this movie?<br /><br />I just watched "Alone in the Dark" last night and "The House of the Dead" a few weeks ago. These movies are bad, and I mean REALLY bad. But I rated them both with 3 stars because:<br /><br />1. The acting was not good in either movie, but still nowhere near as bad as "Leigion of the Dead". 2. The special effects were OK, but not the best. 3. The plot was decent, and with better execution, both movies could be good. 4. At least "Alone in the Dark" and "The House of the Dead" had SOMEWHAT of an action scene in the movie!<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is never, EVER watch this movie. It is a bigger waste of time than "Alone in the Dark" and "The House of the Dead" put TOGETHER! I could go get my video camera right now, go outside and get a few friends together and make a movie better than Legion of the Dead. Never watch it. Its that bad.
