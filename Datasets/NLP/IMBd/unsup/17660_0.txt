This simply blows my mind backwards. With its low budget this film managed to do everything and more than your average classic big budget picture of its time. This is as simple as it can be said a timeless and true classic and one of the best crime/noir films ever produced. My congratulations to director Phil Karlson as well as John Payne and the rest of the fabulous actors who makes this superb film possible. <br /><br />I actually think this film although very overlooked where on the the great noir flicks that launched the entire crime genre cause the mood, the style and the plot can be found in later movies, even the ones made today.<br /><br />9.5/10<br /><br />YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS!!!!
