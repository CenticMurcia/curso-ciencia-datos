Can somebody who liked the movie please explain: - Okay so the military drops at least 2 smart bombs when they open one of the silo holes.... but at the end of the movie Dolph and Montel crawl out to greet the press and no visible damage??? - The bad guy is seconds from having his goal of blowing up Washington but for some unknown reason he uncuffs himself from the code suitcase and falls to his death.... thus allowing Dolph time to run to the lab and stop the bomb from exploding... gave me a headache trying to make sense of that - Dolph and one of the bad guys are fighting under one of the missiles when it launches and sprays them with superheated fiery compressed flaming exhaust ..... but Dolph picks himself up and fights on - the bad guy demands the poor President (that guy from Jaws)shoot himself on national TV in the graveyard.... but the gun on the headstone is full of blanks... so why not have a secret service guy bump off the President if it would save the country??? - I guess a nuclear bomb exploding in South Dakota was no big deal... just a warning... nothing real important - the rooftop car chase was interesting - at least have Dolph take his shirt off and show us his body
