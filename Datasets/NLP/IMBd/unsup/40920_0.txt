Turkish comedian Cem Yılmaz ("Her Şey Çok Güzel Olacak" & "Vizontele") and director Ömer Faruk Sorak ("Asansor" & "Vizontele") re-unite to spin-out a sketch from the former's "Bir Tat Bir Doku" stand-up show into a record-breaking Turkish box office hit.<br /><br />Turkish tour guide and carpet salesman Arif (Cem Yılmaz) is abducted by the evil Commander Logar (Cem Yılmaz) and taken to Gora where he is chosen by the mysterious Garavel (Özkan Ugur) to rescue Princess Ceku (Özge Özberk) in an uninspired comedy set-up.<br /><br />Cem Yılmaz puts in a rather insipid performance as the stereotypical Turkish every-man Arif but comes alive in his brilliant turn as Commander Logar with solid support coming from the likes of Özkan Ugur, Rasim Oztekin, Ozan Guven and the gorgeous Özge Özberk.<br /><br />The film-makers' three year struggle with budget and technical problems paid-off with a convincingly realised sci-fi movie pastiche that acts as a magnificent backdrop for a tired series of parodies and gags that are more well-worn than one of Arif's carpets.<br /><br />"I learnt to look at life from a different angle."
