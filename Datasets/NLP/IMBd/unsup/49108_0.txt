I really loved the first seasons of the Simpsons, but I think their humour is not fresh anymore. This episode is another proof. The magic that The Simpsons had was trasfering into scene simple situations of the everyday life but in a funny way. The new chapters are about extravagant situations which make no sense at all. The Ronaldo dialogue is annoying, the chapter has a lot of emphasis on a boring online game. Then we have the typical opinions of the writers about various subjects like Christopher Colombus discovery being insignificant or football making whole continents insane, those are also quite annoying, specially because of the emphasis they are given.
