The timing for this episode was perfect. My daughter, then, 9 or 10, was curious about the Santa thing, she was definitely asking questions. This episode gained another 2 years of magic for her, well me really. I was touched beyond belief with this episode. I sat with my Daughter and watched this with her, it was a magical episode. I think we watched it another 6 OR 7 times over the course of the holiday season. I felt it should have been a Holiday special every year, along with the Frosty's, Grinches, Rudolph's etc. I am now purchasing this boxed set for my Grandson, who is turning 9 soon. I can't wait to sit and relive the wonderful experience of this episode again. Truly one that shouldn't be missed and should be watched by all family members, together!
