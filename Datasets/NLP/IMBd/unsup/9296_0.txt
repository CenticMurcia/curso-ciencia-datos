As a Prince Valiant collector and as editor of the Prince Valiant--an American Epic series, I naturally have mixed feelings about this movie. Parts of it are really bad, I know. Hal Foster sent many pages of corrections after he read the script. Naturally, they were ignored. On the other hand, James Mason makes a great villain, and if you kind of squint your eyes during the middle part, the rest of the movie is quite enjoyable. Rick Norwood www.io.com/~norwoodr
