I actually saw this movie when it first came out when I was just eleven years old. Little did I know I was only one of a few people who would actually admit to viewing it. I have been looking for a chance to review it for many years.<br /><br />At the time, I thought this movie was pure science fiction, but it turns out that CGI and animation are actually replacing live actors beginning with Max Headroom a few year later. To me, this movie was ahead of its time. A bit of '1984' meets 'James Bond'.<br /><br />Not that it was such a great acting movie, it stars Albert Finney, but I give it a little extra because of the interesting story and eerie foretelling. The directing and overall technical aspects gives this movie most of its accolades.<br /><br />Given the dated material and the talent, this one has dissolved into an '80s B-movie. Would like to see it again for nostalgia's sake, though.
