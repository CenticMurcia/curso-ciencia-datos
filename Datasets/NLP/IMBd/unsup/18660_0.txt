This is a story of conflict. And to handle conflict it seems the more objective we are the better we are able to handle conflict and take decisive action.<br /><br />In viewing this film, start looking for the conflict in the very first scenes. You will see the re-action of one actor who doesn't like the final scene of the play within the film that forms this story. Then note the conflict between the dresser (Claire Danes/Maria) and the young women who go back stage to flirt with the lead actor (Billy Crudup/Ned Kynaston) and see how this conflict builds to the full conflict between Maria and Ned.<br /><br />And where else do we find better conflict between a male and a female. This story proves even more compelling because it is between a female and a male who impersonates a female on stage. Maria's challenge seems to be to change the societal norms of not allowing female actors on stage. But this is just the face value. For she comes to see her real challenge is that she cannot relate to Ned even though she loves him very much.<br /><br />For Ned, his challenge is that he thinks he knows the female better than most males. What a farce that turns out to be. As Ned's self image crumbles, he does eventually realize that it is he who must change. He finds his redemption by working with Maria and takes action that changes both of them.<br /><br />Don't miss the fine performance of the King's mistress (Alice Eve/Miss Frayne) who knows exactly why and how she got to where she now happens to be in the King's court. But she doesn't let that deter her from seeing what needs to be changed. As a minor character, she is very funny, and by being detached and objective, she plays a significant role in the unfolding of the plot for this drama.
