It's artfully shot like other V.V.Chopra movies. The male star cast has given stellar acting performances. Amitabh is brilliant (for a change), Boman is starkly poignant and Sanjay Dutt is rock-solid. <br /><br />What then stops the film from being an engrossing entertainer or a classic art film? The reason, ladies and gentlemen, seems to be the director's confusion about whether he wanted an out and out commercial entertainer or a subtle artsy classic. The treatment goes from extremely spoofable (the screenplay is THAT mediocre) to intensely admirable between shots-and that is where the audience's attention wanes.<br /><br />Set in the here and now, the film is about skeletons in royal cupboards and illegitimate royalty. King Rana Jaywardhan (Boman Irani)'s impotence results in Eklavya (Amitabh Bachchan)'s sleeping with Queen Suhasinidevi (Sharmila Tagore). While she's bed-ridden, the queen gets foolish enough to ask her husband to fetch her lover and gets strangled. It is then upto Prince Harshwardhan (Saif Ali Khan), Eklavya and Sanju the brash and witty cop to seek revenge and justice and a very sweet'n'syrupy family reunion. <br /><br />- Amitabh has done great justice to this role of a lifetime. - Ditto with Boman. - Sanjay Dutt is refreshing. - Vidya Balan plays a very unconvincing Rajjo, Harshwardhan's childhood sweetheart. (Someone could do with a few hours in the gym there.) - Raima Sen turns in an unremarkable but just about OK performance as Harshwardhan's mentally challenged twin sister, Princess Nandini. - Sharmila Tagore disappoints greatly. - Jimmy Shergill and Jackie Shroff are surprisingly good. - Saif doesn't have all that much to do differently-given a rather conventional role and a more conventional approach to handling it. But he seems to have done whatever justice he could.<br /><br />The music's nothing great, the romance lacks spark. But yes, it deserves a chance for sure.
