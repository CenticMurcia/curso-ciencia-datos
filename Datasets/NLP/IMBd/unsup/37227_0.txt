Warning this contains a spoiler. I'm sure we all saw the promos about the most prolific serial killer in history, again not true that tile belongs to Elizabeth Bathory with over 600 victims but that's another topic entirely. Many people might think that this is going to be another good psychological thriller ala Silence of the Lambs. Sadly you couldn't be more wrong. The "serial killer" is in fact a crocodile, a large and impressive crocodile, but a crocodile none the less and I'm sorry to say but a crocodile, which kills in defense of territory or for food, cannot be a serial killer. What we end up with is a generic creature feature.<br /><br />The creature feature genre is more or less uninspired and formulaic to the point of nausea anyway and this film takes that to a whole new level. It follows the formula exactly, one tough protagonist, one hot female interest and then your token comic relief character. The addition of a antagonist warlord hints at some current events savvy but other than that it is more or less a wasted plot device meant to add depth to a woefully shallow flick. Between deceptive promotion and an uninspired plot this has to be the worst hour and a half I've ever spent in a theatre and I don't recommend anyone expecting a fresh plot or inventive story go and see this movie. It will only disappoint
