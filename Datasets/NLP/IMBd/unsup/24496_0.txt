Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) is on the trail of finding Colombian drug-lord, Calderone, who killed his partner (Jimmy Smit, who would later get killed on NYPD Blue), when his runs into Rico Tubbs (Philip Thomas) who's out to avenger his brother's death at the same man's hands.Miami Vice affected pretty much every aspect of American culture in the '80's. Sonny was the epitome of cool. And it all started here, in the pilot episode/ TV movie. Perhaps it didn't age well, but I still like watching it every now and then. It can be seen on the Season one DVD set of the show.<br /><br />My Grade: B+
