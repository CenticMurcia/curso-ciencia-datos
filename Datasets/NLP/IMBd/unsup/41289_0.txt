The story of the movie was not really to bad, something like that could possibly happen now or in the future. Some parts of the story were really kinda silly and didn't make much since. The story didn't flow as good as it could have. The acting was another really big part that kept the movie from being better than it was. Some of the actors actions were just not really believable and did some very odd things. This was another big factor that kept the flow of the movie from being as smooth as it could. Like I said the storyline was for the most part believable, but their were some holes in the story. Their were a lot of parts where they didn't go into enough detail so you really don't know whats going on. But overall I gave Contagion a rating of 4.
