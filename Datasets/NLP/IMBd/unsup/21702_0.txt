The story was very well written and entertaining. The tales from many nations were told, and were the focus of the movie. A perfect family movie that keeps everyone entertained. The messages behind the stories have deep social significance and seem chosen with care. The next best thing to hearing these stories yourself from the dreamkeeper would be to see this movie. The first 10 minutes of the movie seems awkward, but the story gets better. The acting varies from competent to fantastic, but some just seem out of place and stiff. The cinematography is very good and there's many breathtaking aerial sweeps. There were two camera passes right through vehicles from headlight to tailpipe that seemed quite out of place. The Coyote and spider characters enthralled the kids.
