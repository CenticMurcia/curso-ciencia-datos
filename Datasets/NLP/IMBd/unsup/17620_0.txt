I have always thought of myself as doing my part for LGBT causes but after seeing this and how people dedicate there LIFE to it and how even straight people are dedicating there precious time away from family to do give us what we deserve, I gotta say I felt guilty.<br /><br />Saving Marriage shows the passion these people have for this 'cause' even though it shouldn't be an issue, it was truly heartfelt and is just what we need in our fight for equality. I hope this gets the chance for distribution because if any doubters watch this and is not moved by the fight, the sadness from the personal stories and dedication from these people then you can't be human.<br /><br />Peace out, Marcus
