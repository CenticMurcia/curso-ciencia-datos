This film is really not about anything. It starts off simply introducing some of the characters who you will soon never forget. We are immediately introduced to a crumudgen named Melvin played by Jack Nicholson.<br /><br />Melvin in short is a SOB. He is rude, racist, paranoid, homophobic, and just a horrible person. Our first introduction to him we wittness him taking his gay neighbour's dog running around and chucking it down the garbage chute.<br /><br />When Simon finds out (played by Greg Kineear) he decides to take a stand but is so intimidated by Melvin's antics that even when he tries to confront him he just breaks down. This also leads to a diatribe Melvin says to Simon that is so brutal that you can't help but feel bad but laugh at hystericaly.<br /><br />This is pretty much the pace of the film. All the characters have their shining moment. Melvin has several, Simon has many, and even Simon's lover played by Cuba Gooding Jr. has a great confrontation scene with Melvin telling him to lay off Simon.<br /><br />There is a reason for Melvin's antics, which isn't explained until about 1/2 way through the film, and that is he has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). In short this is a bit of a flaw cause it makes the viewer not sympathize with Melvin right away. Instead many people witnessing his antics may just end up hating him so much cause his behaviour is without reason, (walking in to the same restaurant every day, at the exact time, demanding to be served by the same waitress [Helen Hunt], bringing his own plastic cutlery, while bad mouthing everyone else in the place is a good example). When he finally gets kicked out by the owner all the patrons stand up and cheer. To some degree that may be the reaction some people watching this film may have by walking out of this film before its even 1/4 through. It's a testament to Jack's performance for creating someone who is truly an absolute unbearable person to witness. Melvin seems VERY real..<br /><br />But in short all these characters come together in the end out of bizarre circumstances and life changes for the better. It's an enjoyable film, with some great performances particularly for Jack's best actor performance, and Kineear's wounded likes of Simon.<br /><br />The film also has a very well trained memorable dog that is amazing in its personality. This dog even has better acting chops than most actors in films I have seen! The film does try to create a romance between Melvin and the waitress which is OK but gets a bit overlong (the restaurant scene is a bit lengthy), but still highly recommended<br /><br />Great feel good film.<br /><br />Rating 8 out of 10.
