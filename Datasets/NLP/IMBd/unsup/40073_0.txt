Like the previous reviewer, I watched this film on television the other night and am eternally grateful that I didn't spend any hard earned cash going to the pictures to see it. What a disappointment.<br /><br />When I read the plot synopsis in the newspaper, I was expecting something vaguely along the lines of "Carve her name with pride". A stirring tribute to the men and women of the SOE who put their lives on the line in Wartime Occupied France. What I actually got in return was a jumbled mess resembling an advert for expensive perfume, full of meaningless close ups and mumbled dialogue. Cate Blanchett's character (supposedley a hard bitten Secret Agent)looked as if she'd just stepped off a photo shoot for "Cosmopolitan", and exuded all the sexual allure of a maths lesson.It was over an hour before I saw a German.<br /><br />Pretentious arty farty rubbish.Sensitive girlies who think Sebastian Faulks "is like really, really good" will love this film. I hated it. I'm off to get me some real WW2 action - "Guns of Navarone" anybody?
