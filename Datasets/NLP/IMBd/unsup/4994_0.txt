This was the first Bud Spencer/Terence Hill movie I saw and it is probably the last.I just wanted to experience it since it is a very famous formula.The quality is inferior though.Everything that made the 80's such a terrible decade is in this movie.<br /><br />First of all there is the terrible 80's synthesizer music,it really is a nightmare to hear.The repetitive sounds are so awful that at one point you're only thinking about the mute button.The 80's were not famous for their musical quality (except for Sonic Youth which is brilliant) but this is really the lowest of the low!<br /><br />The acting is not much better,Spencer and Hill try but they just can't act.The supporting cast isn't any better,even worse! The story doesn't make any sense and is full of holes and dead end streets.<br /><br />Not a recommendation! 3/10
