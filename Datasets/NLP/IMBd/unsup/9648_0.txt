It's nice to see an indie film use an actual orchestra and choir rather than capitulate to the compromised sounds produced by computers and synthesizers. The film's score is not only brilliant in its composition, but equally impressive in its execution. From the opening credits to the chilling end of this film, the music proves to set an appropriate and fitting backdrop from scene to scene. Cristo, the composer, delivers us a score that juxtaposes beautiful sweeping lyrical melodies and hauntingly disturbing music. The inter-play between beauty and beast in the score reflects well both the killer's internal struggle between the forces of good and evil as well as the struggle that ensues between the disturbed killer and her innocent college-aged victims. The choir, magnificently harmonized and blended, is reminiscent of the 'Omen' in its 'hair-raising effectiveness,' but nevertheless maintains its own uniqueness in composition. The composer could be compared to venerable John Williams or perhaps a modern day Tchaikovsky for his orchestration. I don't know if the movie has been released yet, but I would highly recommend finding a release of the score on CD. I believe this film comes to us from Boston. If anyone has more information about the filmmakers, I would appreciate hearing back from you.
