Well, isn't it wonderful to be a rich teenager, having your parents on a vacation, leaving you a big house, a car and all the money you can spend? Isn't it nice to have a friend who convinces you to call up a prostitute with whom you fall in love after you spent the "wild" night together? And after you've been robbed, car chased and after your dad's car ends up in a lake, there is still a good chance everything will be fine, with no serious consequences! And it does! Hey! You even get a chance to go to Princeton! You think I'm joking, right? It may sound disappointing, but this movie is a joke, it's no more than a teenage sex fantasy film, trying to have a "moral message in the background", but fails to afford one in the end. But who wants moral messages in a teenage movies anyway, right?
