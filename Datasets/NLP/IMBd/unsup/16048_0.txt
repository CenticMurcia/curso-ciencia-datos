"The Late Show" is the unexpected combination of several things. Unexpected, not because of the genre, but because of the era. The isn't a very reaching film, and certainly not totally straight-faced compared to the film noirs it is very openly influenced by. Just like the B movies that were once churned out monthly with nothing more than a good lead and a fast-paced script, Robert Benton creates his film in much the same style.<br /><br />The surprise is Art Carney, giving one of his many more impressive performances. He makes the character real, in a lean script that begs for that kind of focus. Lily Tomlin is certainly convincing, a jumpy personality that would never be present in a classic film of this type, but feels perfectly at home here. I like the look of "The Late Show", the feel and attitude of it. It's a passing thing, but a good time and a thing or two to think about.
