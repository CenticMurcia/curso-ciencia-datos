A rather convoluted and tedious 'action' movie from the 80s, Wanted: Dead or Alive stars Rutger Hauer as Nick Randall, a tough-as-nails bounty hunter on the trail of nasty Arab terrorists (led by Malak Al Rahim played by Gene Simmons), who are out and about in L.A. blowing up innocent people.<br /><br />Hauer is his usual reliable self, and turns in a good performance as the hardboiled ex-CIA operative who makes his living bringing in the bad guys any way he can. Likewise, Simmons (the demon bassist from my favourite rock band, Kiss) makes the most of his part as the head terrorist, sneering and glowering to the max and generally looking very evil. But with its rather dull script and pedestrian direction from Gary Sherman, even they can't save this movie from being a less than average production.<br /><br />Apart from a few bits of nasty violence, and a nifty ending which sees Randall wreaking revenge on Malak Al Rahim in explosive fashion, Wanted: Dead or Alive is a pretty forgettable movie.
