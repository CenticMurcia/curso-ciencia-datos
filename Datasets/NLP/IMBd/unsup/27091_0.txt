The authors had to be under the influence of chemicals that are not normally present in the body (perhaps something from the 8th dimension). It's a rare style of movie in that while the characters take themselves seriously, the movie does not. This movie really makes no sense, but you don't want to watch it if it has to make sense. It's a series of moments. If you try to go linking them together to form a plot, you will fail miserably. So just enjoy.<br /><br />If you watch it, you'll understand the full context of "Laugh a-while-a you can, monkey-boy!"
