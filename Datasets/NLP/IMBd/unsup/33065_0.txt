This has got to be the worst movie I've ever seen. Nothing compares to watching this completely boring and weak story. There is no blood, and No ZOMBIES. I rented this because it had a zombie on the cover and it said on the back of the box it was about zombies. The picture on the cover has nothing to do with the movie at all. This was release during the decline of Italian Zombie movies and I personally believe this movie KILLED the Italian Zombie scene.<br /><br />I can't understand how this awful movie is on DVD and the one of the best zombie movies EVER, Return of the Living Dead, is still not on DVD.<br /><br />Bottom line, ANYTHING is more scarier and better than this COMPLETE WASTE OF SPACE of a Movie.
