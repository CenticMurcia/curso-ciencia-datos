This film is a classic comedy. I would recommend this one up there with Clerks, Swingers and Old School. This is well shot who ever did the editing was solid. I'm not sure if this is out yet in the movies. It should be out soon. The girls are extremely hot. I would like to have seen more of the girls but then I've always got those type of movies in the top shelf of my closet. The acting was good. I think that this is going to launch many new faces and new careers in the business. Looking forward to see your next project. I am going to watch it again there were a couple of scenes with some very funny lines. I'm not sure if these were the same guys that did Clerks. It feels like the same type of humor very witty and sharp dialog.
