Anyone who tries to make a movie for little or no money deserves a little credit, but at the end of the day, I still expect to see an enjoyable film. This film does not meet that criteria. The acting is poor, to say the least. The story lacks any interest at all. At first I found some of the weak points to be frustrating, but then the whole thing quickly became laughable. Somehow I sat through it, and I have no idea how I did it.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of the idea of vampires movies, but at this point I'm starting to hate them. This could be the nail in the coffin. I give the film two stars, though I'm not sure it deserves it.
