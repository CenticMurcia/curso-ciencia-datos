Juhi Chahwla and Irfan star in this hilarious Hindi take on the reality series phenomenon. The former plays a TV executive who zeroes in on a particular family and wants to produce their latest family wedding as a TV serial. The latter plays a member of the family, who becomes in on the scheme and in the process falls in love with her.<br /><br />The family initially agrees to have their lives filmed and turned into a telly show but later back out of the deal. Irfan's character then secretly strikes up a deal to have the family's lives taped without their knowledge and in the process and bunch of ugly misdeeds surface and resurface.<br /><br />At 155 minutes and with just two short songs to help pass the time, this is an unusual production for Hindi cinema. But it's different in an interesting way. It's a tale of lost love, unrequited love, family life and the sacrifices people sometimes have to make.<br /><br />One unresolved scene baffled me though and it involves Irfan's character discovering two girls kissing during a power failure. The identity of only one of the women was revealed during the course of the movie. A bizarre scandal indeed!
