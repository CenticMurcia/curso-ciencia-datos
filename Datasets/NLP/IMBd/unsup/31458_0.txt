Well done episode, certainly by early 60's standards, cast and direction of Norman Lloyd, create feel of summer in a small southern town. Perhaps the very best of the, "Alfred Hitchcock Hour," series, the ending has a lasting impact; even though I haven't seen it in years. James Best is memorable as the leading man here. Although he always found steady work in films and television since 1950, Best never quite reached the top tier of film stars; despite the fact that he was a remarkably handsome young man. Perhaps, like Dennis Weaver, his southern drawl held him back a bit. He continues to work today. I would have thought his presence in this episode would have elevated him to bigger parts. A must see for Hitchcock fans. Norman Lloyd worked with Hitch in, "Sabateur," and was known in the 1980's for appearing on, "St. Elsewhere."
