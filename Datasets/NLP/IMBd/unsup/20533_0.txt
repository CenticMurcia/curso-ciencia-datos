Yes it's awful. BUT It's so bad it's good !! Like not being able to take your eyes off a car wreck. It's good for some retro yukking. I'd recommend it to EVERYONE !!! We especially enjoy Quince getting mad in every episode. If that were real like no one would want to work with him. He a raving maniac. But that's what makes him so lovable. Maybe more like tough love. Yeah that's it tough love. I'll tell you whats tough. Trying to write ten lines about Quincy. This is crazy. This is cruel. Quince is getting back at me right. Not only must I suffer through his show but I must suffer writing about his show !! I MUST repeat myself. I'm going nuts !! Repeat. Yes it's awful. BUT It's so bad it's good !!
