Is this the same Akhtar guy that directed Dil Chahta Hai ?!! If so, I suppose he began ingesting brain numbing substances after the success of his first movie.<br /><br />The storyline is non-existent and the dialogues are weak. The desperate attempt at character-development leaves one yawning through the first half, and the direction seemed amateurish at best. In one scene, when Karan (Hrithik) sees the LOC for the first time, he claims being overcome by a feeling of belonging (to India). Nothing in the shot or the music imparts that feeling to the audience. This is a common thread through out the movie where the actors mouth lines that are either totally disconnected with the scene, or they are so obvious that the audience is left feeling spoon-fed.<br /><br />The battle scenes are very poorly shot. I don't know how they compare with other bollywood movies but to someone who's seen Saving Private Ryan or the Band of Brothers, they look like laser tag. I think the best part of the movie was the location. The visuals were stunning and nothing like I had seen in other bollywood movies. Even there I think Farhan took the audience for granted. In one of the penultimate scenes, Indian soldiers are shown crossing a dense wooded area to get to the base of the peak 5179. The only problem is that such trees do not grow at elevations of 16000 feet. Just nitpicking in a movie filled with stupidities :)
