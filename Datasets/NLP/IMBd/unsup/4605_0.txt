I've seen this movie on lifetime and i think it was great. we actually got to see how hard it is to have and raise a child and what it takes to give it up for adaption. I loved the end where Jasey gave her son to the teacher to raise and then they showed the child saying that the teacher is his mother but that he came out "of my Jasey's stomach". The part where Jasey brought her son to school along with her friends who have or will have kids. It showed that even though those girls have kids they are still just like us. It was very inspirational, especially for those mothers, when the whole room stood up to applaud the girls for their courage.
