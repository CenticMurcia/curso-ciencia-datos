My friend tracked down a copy of this on eBay. He says he spent $8 on it, which is $7.99 too much. What a complete and utter waste of time and effort.<br /><br />The best part of this failed TV pilot is Roddy McDowell who takes the role of Chiun and does a decent job. The only other positive I can tell you is the awesome (if overused) theme music from the movie is used for the TV show. Jeffrey Meek as Remo is so bad. The stunts and fights are slow and poorly choreographed. Everything else is just flat-out poor. The original movie was good and deserved better than this. See it (if you must) out of morbid curiosity, just don't pay more than 1Â¢!
