I was as excited as a child on Christmas Eve as I made my way to the Cinema to watch this brand new Australian 'Comedy'. All I can say was, whilst the 'actors' tried hard, and an honorable mention is given to 'Benny G' (played by Glenn Robbins), they failed to get more than a handful of laughs from the entire audience.<br /><br />Constant errors in the dialog, strange and rather improbable plot structures and a lack of a genuine sense of humor ruined this film - one which had so much potential, and was bandied around the Australian television and radio airwaves as a potential Aussie classic.<br /><br />The script was poor, and when a more humorous part of the film occurred, it was quickly wiped away by overkill. I came away struggling to find any positives from this film, which at only 88 minutes in duration, was hardly even one of those 'worth the money' experiences.<br /><br />Give the film ago if you have nothing better to do with just under 1 and a half hours, otherwise, wait until it hits the local video store shelves, and gaze at the cover of something that could have been, should have been, but stumbled terribly short of the mark.
