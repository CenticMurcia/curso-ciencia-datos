Arguably the best of the films adhering to the Dogma 95 Manifesto, and the first to be shot on film rather than video, MIFUNE'S LAST SONG is a genuinely enjoyable film. Unpretentious and optimistic, MIFUNE is funny, affectionate and entertaining. This is the one which illustrates the brilliant new path which Danish film has taken in the past few years.
