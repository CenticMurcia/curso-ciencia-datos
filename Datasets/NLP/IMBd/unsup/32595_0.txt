You will surely laugh at the awful singing when you watch this movie! And it was so stupid having Esther Rolle to play a witch doctor. I was so annoyed with Denzel Washington, Sheryl Lee Ralph, and Robert Townsend's phony Jamaican accents! They were not speaking Jamaican. They were speaking Jamaicinglish! I thought this movie was stupid when I first saw it when I was 14. And I still think this movie is stupid! Denzel Washington cannot sing! This movie joined my list of movies that received a one star rating!
