At every turn, another expected unexpected event springs fourth to entertain and amuse. For those of us who have seen Django, this movie will support your prejudices while allowing you to enjoy the fabulous cinematography, costumes, acting and scenery. The plot is barely enough to keep one interested although the movie, as a whole, is grossly entertaining. White vs Red, last man standing, evil vs evil with a tinge of good barely surfacing gives this movie a turn from the usual pap so often seen in cinema. Miike pulled out the stops for this one giving us enough blood and guts to wonder what was coming next while allowing for his own unique style to peek through. While not for everyone, this belongs in the midnight movie genre, suitable for those of us who enjoy something off of the beaten path.
