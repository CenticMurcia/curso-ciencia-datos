This movie as you can see by my rating, was complete drivel. Almost every plot event was coming a mile off. Satellites falling out of the sky cannot happen. There is something called "the Atmosphere" surrounding the Earth, which makes anything falling from space heat up to insanely hot. The SFX were mediocre bordering on bad, but they were brilliant compared to the acting and the plot. Blowing up the Arctic with nukes. Doesn't that just sound stupid, because that's what they did. I mean is spraying thousands of tonnes of ice into the air going to put out huge fires in the atmosphere, and then ice starts raining from the sky and everyone goes all happy-clappy. Its most redeeming feature was the unintentional humour at the actors trying to make the plot seem believable. I mean the whole atmosphere exploding due to methane. Methane can only burn at concentrations between 5 and 15%, and there are 1,745 parts per billion, which is about 0.000001745% of the total atmosphere. Just a little bit below 5%.
