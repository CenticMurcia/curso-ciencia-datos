I would highly recommend Under The Same Moon aka La Misma Luna, at first I was not sure whether this movie would be a movie I would watch but after watching it, I had a different perspective. I think this movie did not get as much credit as it should have for the simple fact that it was filmed by a Mexican production company even though it was released by 20th Century Fox. The majority of the film is in Spanish with some English dialog.<br /><br />Under The Same Moon deals with the sensitive issue of illegal immigration, whether for it or against this film will have you thinking. There are many Mexican actors as well as known actors in the United States such as America Ferrara. The little boy who plays Carlitos does an excellent job at portraying his character. The movie is about a mom who is working hard in the United States and her son is back in Mexico. The child than decides he will cross the border illegally facing many dangers. As I said before this film will open your mind and will be enjoyed that is why I recommend it.
