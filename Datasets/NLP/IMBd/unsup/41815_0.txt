The script is idiotic, and the actors look and sound like porn movie rejects...<br /><br />The horror is so boring with dumb effects and complete lack of suspense. It's amusing to see the main male character trying hard to be funny all through the movie with very sad rude one-liners. You don't really care for the characters as they are just a bunch of boring cannon fodder.<br /><br />When all the bad elements are all put together you get an incredibly idiotic movie that is fun to watch BECAUSE it's so bad.
