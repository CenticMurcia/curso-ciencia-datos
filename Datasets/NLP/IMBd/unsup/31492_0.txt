I can't digest that people would protest this amazing film. People need to respect that there are alternate versions of history, and the director states that in the credits from the beginning. If people had some sense, they would respect the integrity of a person committed to bringing history to film with utmost dignity and respect. Those people clashing an protesting the film are idiotic! <br /><br />The 3 hours flew by because the story was captivating. The actors were amazing, especially Ila Arun...Sonu is also a revelation. Aishwarya was just right! A talent that needs to be recognized, Ash showed how amazing an actor she really is. Hrithik was equally amazing as Aishwarya. I don't understand why there is such sexism in Hindi cinema, the males always get their critiques or praises first and then the females. Well Aishwarya is first here! The music was simply well suited and appropriate. I want A R Rehman to continue being brilliant! That's an order! The director has proved himself yet again that he is simply the best there is in the world of cinema...HE makes South Asians Proud! <br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone.
