Where the hell does the cop come from at the end of the film? He just appears and suddenly says 'We'll have to move quickly but it can be done!' and how did he know the dad was going to be divorced from his wife before he did? was he nailing her on the side??? How come the bad kid becomes the Italian kids friend at the end? despite having attempted to rape his sister, breaking the Italian kids leg and calling his mother a whore! Why was this film made? to promote 'soccer' in America? I've seen better football played by five year olds. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, but a couple of the girls are worth looking at on a bored afternoon inbetween the AWFUL acting and badly choreographed football. And there are some funny moments, not intentionally funny though, 'Its in the back of the net already tomazzo! Visualise it!' The sledgehammer workout is worth a giggle and the way everyone comes together at the end for a happy ending is like the end of Waynes World - just for the two fit girls and the funny ending this gets two extra stars but I've seen better acting in porno and come to think of it better story lines and nicer looking people!
