Never have so many been so humiliated for so little. John Wayne as Genghis Khan is beyond a doubt the most ludicrous casting decision in movie history: John Gacy and would have been a better choice. The Duke seems to have Mongolian confused with Mongoloid, and nobody's told him The Conqueror isn't a Western. Oscar Millard seems to have this Mongolian horse opera confused with Shakespeare, and writes his poetic dialogue accordingly. We now know why Wayne never did Hamlet. Lots of toppling horses during the battle scenes, and the weird casting of William Conrad (who at least looks like he's having fun), Lee Van Cleef and Agnes Moorehead as Khan's fellow Mongolians just add to the fun. And let's not forget Susan Hayward as a red-haired Tartar bride to Genghis (?!?). Only Pedro Armendariz avoids humiliating himself, but he looks embarrassed to be here. A camp classic.
