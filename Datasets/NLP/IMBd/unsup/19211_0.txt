Bogey is superb as a crusading D.A. matching wits and organizations with evil crime lord Everett Sloane (in a chillingly believable performance). Many terrific character actors on both sides of the law lend support. And the film does not play softball with the manner in which women inevitably are the victim's of men's violence. Well worth watching, this makes an excellent companion piece to "Knock On Any Door."
