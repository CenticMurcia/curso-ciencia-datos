The story may be complete bunkum, and the dialogue rather cheesy, but Antonio Margheriti's Cannibal Apocalype is still a great way to pass the time. With some deliciously juicy gore FX, a great turn by lead John Saxon, and a funky score by Alexander Blonksteiner, this Italian splatter pic tells of a group of Vietnam vets (Saxon, John Morghen and Tony King) who have contracted a virus which turns them into cannibals. Along with an infected nurse, they attempt to escape the police (and a biker gang) via the network of sewers under the city.<br /><br />Margheriti keeps the action flowing nicely, only pausing slightly to throw in a sub-plot featuring a rather tasty teen who has the hots for Saxon. The blood runs regularly, and Giannetto De Rossi's great gore make-up is excellent. Highlights include a bloody tongue-biting and the infamous 'shotgun-blast to the belly' effect which is well worth the wait.<br /><br />If you love the classic Italian zombie and cannibal movies of the 70s and 80s, then be sure to catch Cannibal Apocalypse (but make sure to see the uncut version!!!).<br /><br />7.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 8 for IMDb).
