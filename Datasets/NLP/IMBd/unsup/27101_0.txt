Unless you can approach a movie with an open mind and an eye for parody, stay far, far away from this film.<br /><br />If you CAN approach the movie as noted above, this is a film you'll love. It would be hard to compare this to any other movie. It is sci-fi. It is 30s pulp fiction. It is adventure. It is comedy. And for the most part, it is a brilliant piece of work.<br /><br />When Buckaroo discovers that aliens from another dimension are infiltrating our world, he and his intrepid band of engineers and scientists go on the job to investigate and correct the dangerous situation. The word band is not used lightly. In addition to their work beyond the frontiers of known science, they are also a music band with raving fans and groupies. LOL Just a wonderful escape into a truly different slant on things for a couple of hours. Highly recommended.
