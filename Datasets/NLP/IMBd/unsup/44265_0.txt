*THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS... OR MAYBE NOT. THE WARNING IS THE SAME FOR ALL*<br /><br />I don't understand it. The second film wasn't that well received. Did they really think third time would be the charm? The turtles are back in time now. April bought some weird device that sent her back to Ancient Japan, where the evil Lord Norinaga plans to take over. As you can guess the turtles decide to travel back in time to save her.<br /><br />Ye, it's a forced plot, but it's not SO bad if you think about it. Also we don't have Schredder again as the villain. However, we don't have Jim Henson Creature Shop providing the costumes... as a result, the turtles look more... ugly in this film (their eyes and mouth operate better, though).<br /><br />Sincerely, I still don't understand why they did the film. I mean, I was disappointed when I saw it the first time; and considering I loved the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, that has to mean something, right?
