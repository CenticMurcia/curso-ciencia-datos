Pla seems 100 percent real but the voice-over in the story seems 100 percent bull<br /><br />The film Maker. He seems to have filmed it with a handicam I think the Katoeys and Pla had no idea they were taking part in a money making operation.<br /><br />He even complains when he has to pay a small "fine" to the local police who could just as easily, put him in the local jail, confiscated his equipment permanently and eventually deported him for working without the correct permits.( i think they should have)but i doubt it happened.<br /><br />Pla and the other players probably thought he was just a tourist with a camera who, eventually would actually, pay.<br /><br />Wayne
