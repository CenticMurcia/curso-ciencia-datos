On my first view of Little Britain it didn't strike me as something that was hilariously funny. I found it witty and somewhat entertaining but wouldn't have rated it anywhere near English sitcoms such as The Office and the like..<br /><br />However as I watched it more and began to understand the characters and relate them to stereotypes of everyday people the show began to "wow" me with how many layers of comedy are actually present.<br /><br />From Daffyth - The only gay in the village, a stereotype that we know all too well to the Cross Dressing lady boys who act as though they want to remain subtle in their acts cross dressing however draw attention to themselves whenever possible.<br /><br />These characters are real. David Walliams and Matt Lucas have really done English comedy proud by making fictional takes on real people. They manage to capture all demographics of audience with their mix of slapstick humour with more subtle comedy traits that audiences might not pick up on the first viewing.<br /><br />Little Britain is a timeless classic - if you don't like it at first, give it another go. There is more to it than meets the eye...
