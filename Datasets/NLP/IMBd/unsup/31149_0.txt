I rented this DVD last night and actually really enjoyed it.It was a good realistic movie with a believable plot and real ordinary looking people.Even though it's a horror,I haven't laughed so hard in my life. Even though the humor was dark and cruel,it was hysterically funny.For a movie made on a very low budget,this was impressive.It began with a gory scene in a thunderstorm and then begins years later.The actor that played Monty was perfectly cast.I loved it at the end when he got back at his tormentors since they sure had it coming! I enjoyed the original gruesome deaths.That pizza scene really stays in your mind<br /><br />since it looked so real.I hope there will be a sequel to this movie and that it doesn't end there.
