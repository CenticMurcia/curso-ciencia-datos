Zwigoff, Schmigoff - this movie was boring, awkward, and very rarely funny. There were glimmers of freshness at the start, but then the staleness took over and even efforts to view it as dry self-parody were met with cricket chirps. Still, with such artistic giants in the cast - each of whom, I'm assuming, had a pretty good sense of what they were getting into - I'm struggling to make more sense of it. Maybe, just maybe the joke was on us. Maybe Zwigoff knew all along that he'd attract a certain audience - the type who assumes it's coming to sneer at these tired, overblown, kiss-ass stereotypes - when, in fact, the tables were turned and he's actually laughing at our banal sense of superiority, not to mention our eagerness to project greatness onto any schlock he throws our way. If so, that would be very clever of him, but the movie would still be a waste of time.
