Both if you are interested or not in politic, or if you have different political ideas with the Director, you may see this film. New generations of every Latin American country must know what happened and how happened the facts, and Solanas shows everything in a perfect way. Anybody can see this documentary film, even if don't have any previous knowledge about the issue, and can understand the real reasons of the most important political, social, institutional and moral crisis in the whole Argentinian history. Like in "The Hour of the Furnaces" Solanas make too much with few economical resources but a lot of talent. Thanks Solanas for your dignity and your work.
