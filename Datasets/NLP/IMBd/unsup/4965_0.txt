IT's stylish, it's clever, it moves. I am always amazed at how great English actors are in comparison to American or German ones. Of course this film is violent, but the violence is neither superfluous nor superficial. It has something to say. About the language - well, you can't really expect Gangsters to speak like schoolmarms, can ya? This is a real movie.
