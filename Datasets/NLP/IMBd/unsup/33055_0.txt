Stoo-oo-pid! If the plot had had some actual effort put into it, the movie might have been almost bearable. But it was so trite and clich√©, you can't help but snicker at how dumb it all is.<br /><br />On its slight plus side, it did have some nice eye candy, And the desert landscapes were quite impressive. Downright beautiful, in fact.<br /><br />But otherwise, this laughable excuse for a "movie" is total sloppy slosh from beginning to end. Basically, it's a chick flick for those who read trashy romance novels and like to believe their inane glop can be real. But for anyone else, there's a whole lot of groaning and guffawing involved trying to get through this thing.<br /><br />I barely managed to get through this mostly to the end until i finally declared, "Enough is enough! I can't take it anymore!" And then i turned it off and feel much better now for having done so. MUCH better.<br /><br />I sort of enjoy Willie Aames' ability to play characters that are earnestly stupid, and he does that in spades here, but the chick flick format just got to be too much for me.
