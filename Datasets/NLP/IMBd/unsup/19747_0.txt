I went to see this in the theatres after hearing about how many oscar nominations it was up for. It is painfully slow, very bloody, with no plot to relate to (unless maybe you live in NYC). The only reason I didn't leave before the 3 hours of torture were over was because I was expecting it to get good (oscar nominations) and I paid full price to go.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your time or money.
