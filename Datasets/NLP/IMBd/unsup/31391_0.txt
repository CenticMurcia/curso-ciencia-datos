True story of one Bernie McPhillimy, a determined lady who tries to negotiate an agreement between the IRA and the Brits in 1972, during the height of the fighting. She is tired of innocent children being killed and comes up with an idea of a 'daytime truce' so the children can safely get to school and back. From he modest petition drive she is thrust quickly into the limelight as a leader of the 'peace movement.' Although she is not pro-British, she is given the tag of 'anti-IRA' by the nieghbours and we see the wrath that label brings upon her and her family. Despite all the setbacks and threats, her dogged determination is inspiring and at times even fun to watch. This movie does a great job of putting you right in the thick of things in Belfast. Unlike other movies based on the troubles in Ireland which usually looks at it from an IRA standpoint, this one focuses on how the regular blokes are affected and what their daily lives are like. Not entirely uplifting nor a complete bummer, it treads keenly between an over the top drama and made for tv drama. Still, I like it.
