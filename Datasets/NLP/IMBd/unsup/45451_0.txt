This is just another one in a long line of teenage/ high school films we saw last few years. It tries to be funny and cool, but it fails everywhere.<br /><br />First of all: I didn't care Liz died in the beginning. Why? I didn't know her. Wouldn't it be better if the writer/ director put a few scenes with her in it in the beginning of the film. (Not just that walking through the hallway stuff?).<br /><br />Second: Didn't anybody on that school notice Fern was gone? Wasn't there a teacher who would check this?<br /><br />Third: Pam Grier deserved a bigger part in this one.<br /><br />Fourth: Rose McGowan's character is so unbelievable it's almost laughable!<br /><br />Fifth: Advice: look another film!
