The challenge to bring a homosexual love story to the big screen, which ends out being interesting and catchy, for not only a limited gay audience, is a task no many production companies can lift; "Locked Up" is no exception.<br /><br />Already from the beginning, when Dennis (Marcell Schlutt) arrives in prison, the border between drama and porn is crossed - he has to undress in front of two uniformed macho men. Standing in nothing but his low boxers, one of the guards command him to take "It all" off - so he does, and it leaves you with the question "Am I watching a gay porn movie from Germany?" But before you can crab the DVD-cassette to find out, something that seems like a social realistic story starts; or does it?<br /><br />Dennis' inmates are quickly introduced; they are all standing in groups in the hallway outside their cells, looking like "We have to talk about something and be rough". The so-called leader presents himself to Dennis, giving him a small lecture in behavior and the must of having a toned masculine body. <br /><br />The love story between Dennis and Mark (Mike Sale), who by mysterious reason is digging dirt outside Dennis' window, does not work at all. Their "coffee-love-sex" sessions in the prison breaks are both ridiculous and stupid. At no point you get the feeling of attraction; it's simply laughable - especially the scenes where we see them live together in a double cell with carpet, curtains and toilet.<br /><br />To sum up; more then one hour of stupidity, bad acting and soft gay porn cinematography. The only plus, so to speak, is the extremely funny interview with the to actors.<br /><br />A random German gay porn movie - just without visible sex.
