The One is a wonderful movie. It is very similar to "The Wedding Planner", but is still it's own movie. Richard Ruccolo is great as Michael Blake, and it was great to see him again since his show went off the air. He is very adorable, and should have more roles! This movie was so great, I stayed up to watch the encore presentation. It really gets you think about whether or not "the One" really exists. I don't know when it will be on again, right now its not scheduled anytime soon, but definitely watch it with someone you love!
