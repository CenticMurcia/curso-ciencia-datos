I watched this movie at my friend's house and I quite frankly found it more than a little boring. I mean, it wasn't BAD, it started out well but then it just bored me to wherever. And another thing, Mary-Kate's character, Roxy. Eh.. she was so gung-ho about the Simple Plan video-shooting-concert-watchamacallit. Simple Plan and Metallica are very different genres. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Simple Plan. Its just that it seemed that her character wasn't current-like-mainstream, at least at the beginning it did, and that would've been a lot more interesting, maybe for some people, if it'd been a less-mainstream band and such. I mean, it HAD to be Simple Plan, didn't it? <br /><br />Overall, the movie could've been a lot better than it was.
