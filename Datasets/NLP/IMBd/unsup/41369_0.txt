As a teenager- I enjoy cheesy pre-teen films- just for the laugh. However, after I saw this- I felt violated. Girls at that age never say 'OMG' or 'BFF'. There is cheesy and just stupid! I also think it sends out a really bad message to pre-teens or younger girls; all these girls are too pretty and no one can be so popular and likable and it happens that they all get guys. I can't think of a worse film I've seen, and I've seen a lot of crappy films. The acting was rubbish and the actresses who are supposed to be 16 or 17 actually look like they are 30! And what I hated most of all was how unrealistic it was; it just happened that they could all sing, dance, and bake! And it so happens that they are all pretty. Whoever would watch this film more than once should be shot! Don't watch it unless you want to waste two hours of your life...
