This is one of the rare movies in comedy that i could watch over and over again,, this movie is sooooo , freaking funny it's like a laugh a minute,, especially how Vinny,, "bag of donuts" is woken up constantly every morning,, first the train,, then the pigs i think the owl, and o yeah the steam whistle... i can relate to that stuff, and living relatively close to N.Y. for years i can relate to the accents in the movie,, very Brooklyn if i'm not mistaken,, i loved Joe Pesci in this movie,, this is one of his finer moments ever in a comedic role,, Marissa Tomei however stole the whole show for me,, not only is she sexy and pretty she can act too, her accent fits her like a glove, Ralph Maccio,, hmm well, not everything can be perfect.. i Loved Fred Gwynne the judge,, he is so hilarious,, i just bust out every time he gets Vinny on Contempt of Court or something,, and order him to some jail time,, overall the plot was simple... yeah some of it's corny,, i guess you kinda have to be a Pesci, Tomei fan to appreciate all the slapstick,, but hey it's one of the funniest movies that you'll ever see and you won't regret watching it that's for sure,,
