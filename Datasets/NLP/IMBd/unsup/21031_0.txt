I forced myself to travel far and fork up $5 to see this film on the sole basis that it was shot in Boston (the world's greatest city) and the great story behind the writer/director, Troy Duffy (an ex-New England bartender, he apparently pitched "Boondock" to a producer/patron and the rest is Hollywood history). I'm sorry I made the effort. Tip to Duffy: Tarantino excelled in ripping-off dozens of films by twisting them into new, more exciting cinema - you, on the other hand, have ripped-off Tarantino, "The Professional" and "Things to do in Denver When You're Dead"...and very, very, very badly. I was terribly bored. If I were Troy Duffy, I'd be asking for that bartender job back real quick.
