I saw the movie right after its release, in Europe. I was so impressed that I went to see it again in theaters. I learned all the songs and I discovered John Denver through this movie. The moment I arrived in Canada I tried to look for a tape, later on for a DVD. I see that is rated 7.4 and I don't understand why that many bad movies with bad ratings are on the market but this isn't. Shirley is right. To release another movie with the same name and totally different subject is deceiving and not right. What happened? Why can't we find this movie in the stores or at blockbuster? I join all the voices that ask for this movie on DVD. In a world flooded with movies full of violence, bad language and hatred lets have "Sunshine" (1973) for a change!
