Don't even bother with this one. Lance is the only real actor out of this whole movie. It's basically the Treasure Island story but with the worst acting I have ever seen in one movie. Horrible and cheap looking costuming right out of a Party City store. And where did that giant cockroach come from?! I bought a used DVD for a buddy who wants to see it. But I warned him. This has to be one of the worst films ever made. Plus, where did the good looking babes come from? They wouldn't of been there as women aboard ships were considered bad luck. Very rarely did you ever see them. They were no Anne Bonney and Mary Reed! Too bad they can't be charged with "Wasting Celluloid"!
