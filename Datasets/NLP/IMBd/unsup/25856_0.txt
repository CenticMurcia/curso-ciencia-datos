One can never forget the desperate attempts at surviving the solitary confinement portrayed by the vastly talented Steve McQueen. Equally brilliant was the indomitable Dustin Hoffman as Luis Dega, the counterfeiter. The settings and location truly match the descriptions as described in the book written by the father-of-all-survivors Henri Charriere. The DVD version contains a short film of Henri revisiting the prison where he was living for most of his life seeking to escape, just to prove a point to his captors. Altogether, a film that is a must-watch for all lovers of classic cinema. Best watched at 2:00pm in the afternoon after a light lunch on a Sunday afternoon with your favorite brand of beer.
