I went with trepidations, figuring Tilda Swinton would be wonderful and the rest would be so-so. I was delighted to be wrong. The movie really hinges on the four children, they are the center. I thought it was extremely well-cast and acted. I can't remember the actors names but Lucy is enchanting, Peter is noble, Susan is a difficult role as the practical, spoil-sport so I can't say she was marvelous, but really Edmund is where everything revolves.<br /><br />This Edmund was really great. I was able to care about him and hope for him in a way I never did in the book. Kudos to the kids.<br /><br />In the book, Mr. Tumnus was pivotal, even if briefly seen, and the movie's Mr. Tumnus was delightfully sweet and touching. There's a special scene between he and Lucy that is inventive and wonderful.<br /><br />Aslan - impossible really to capture as he is a concept. I felt the facial expression was so true to the sense of sorrow that Aslan carries but I was not fond of Liam Neesan's voice. Somehow that did not work for me, nor did the voice of the wolf.<br /><br />But Aslan does convey goodness and it's transitory nature and the end brought that home so well. While many seem to believe this is a Christian-themed movie, I think whatever you believe will work because the themes of good and evil, nobility and sacrifice are universal and symbolic.<br /><br />A beautiful movie that I highly recommend to those who love adventure, fantasy and myth.
