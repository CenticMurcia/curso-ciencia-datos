"Fire ants came to the United States from South America some 60 years ago and are now common in the Southeast. Medical reports say as many as 80 people may have been killed in the country by fire ants." Copied from The Associated Press.<br /><br />This is the zoological basis of the movie. Apparently the low budget movie has not had the opportunity to overhaul it's script in order to create remotely believable details.<br /><br />Right, the actors are only giving half an effort, while they don't have any sensible materials to work with.<br /><br />However the movie can run in the background and you can enjoy the scenery and blue sky of Utah. Maybe the producer and instructor have created a cult material: eco-disaster with comedy elements. Not much different from the much appreciated Dune or other flops like Jurassic Park.<br /><br />Surely there are goofs, like the motor bike helmet back on the bike after the kids threw it earlier, and the teacher being a crack shooter loading a shotgun with bullets inside the sheriffs office. Any person trained with weapons wouldn't load a shotgun and waive it about inside buildings least of all the sheriffs office. He would surely have protested.<br /><br />The guy claimed to be running with a broken leg actually just says he 'thinks' he broke his leg, and he is limping off with the help of a friend. Surely the prospect of being eaten by ants could make him eat his pain of a strained ankle.<br /><br />The bullets fired against the ants were magnesium bullets meant for flash exploding to burn the ants, not shooting them.<br /><br />Anyway, as most disaster movies the action is naturally beyond all credibility, but this movie is not different from films like Shark, the Tornado movies, Volcano movie etc etc. *Â½
