I think that "The Other Me" was an amazingly humorous movie and I recommend that when you get a chance to watch it you do. Andy Lawrence did a great job along with everyone else involved in the movie. If you cannot see the movie then I recommend reading the book and if you have seen the movie then you should read the book also if you've read the book then you should see the movie. I think that the movie was a great reflection of the book.
