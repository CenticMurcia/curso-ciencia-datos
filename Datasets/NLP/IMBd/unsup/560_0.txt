I rented this one based on largely marginally positive reviews i've read, expecting a fun little gory horror flick, what I got however was a pretty uninspired "Nightmare on Elm Street" retread, but with a clown fast food mascot. The jokes fall extremely flat and the horror just isn't there. Plus it has a non-ending ending of the kind that I've really grown to detest throughout the years, leaving it open for a sequel which i'm not hoping for in the least bit. Perhaps it would have helped the film if any of the characters were fleshed out in the least bit, but the way it is now the movie had me thinking about how much creepier it might have been if it was about a deranged Burger King mascot (YOU watch those commercials and play Sneak King and NOT be terrified). Oh yeah before I forget the film also can 'boast' (and I use the term loosely) a forgettable cameo by Mr. Super-Size Me Morgan Spurlock, in a role so atrociously acted that one of the people from the group of individuals that he made fun of during a college lecture can act circles act circles around (no I'm not going to use the term he did, you have the internet, look it up) <br /><br />My Grade: D
