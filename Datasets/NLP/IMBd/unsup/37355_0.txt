Perhaps my favorite part of "The TV Set" was the enlarged and mounted review of it from the LA Times that the theater put in the window to presumably attract casual moviegoers who don't know what they want to watch. And there it was, writ in letters as tall as coffin nails: "not that there is anything in this movie that we haven't seen before...". What a tremendous accolade! And perfectly true. The kind of movie that possibly passes for interesting outside of Los Angeles where presumably people think we must be so smart and funny and sensitive and so fail to realize that we are, in fact, as prone to vapid fart-noises as to anything else... Isn't it amazing what passes for thoughtful entertainment today..? "The TV Set" is in every way untrue, hackneyed, inauthentic, dull, uninspired, recycled tedium.<br /><br />Enjoy!
