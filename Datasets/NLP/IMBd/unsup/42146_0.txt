Sure, a documentary can be lighthearted, but this ode to seemingly brain dead Brian Herzlinger's celebrity obsessions is the absolute dregs. The moronic Herlinger, who clearly has never watched any film shot for less than 50 million, grins like a lunatic over and over into the camera. When his mother tells the unemployed 27 year old that she reads The Star tabloid because everything in the rag is true, I realized that Herlinger probably never had a chance. Still, it's hard not to want to take a baseball bat to someone this utterly inane in that oh so L.A. way. As Joe Pesci would say, "I think someone needs a beatin'"! Oh, and I did check out some of the other responses. Clearly Herzlinger and his pals have been stuffing the ballot box as NO ONE would find this to be a great, "inspiring" film.
