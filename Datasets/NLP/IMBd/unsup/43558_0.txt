The plot is good but is never really expanded. There is a picture of Hungarian officials with Tito of Yugoslavia. Were they planning something against Russia?<br /><br />Dana Andrews goes to Budapest, Hungary as a newspaper reporter. He is replacing someone at the bureau that has been felled by a heart attack. Andrews is soon arrested and charged with espionage. He is about to be hung until the above picture surfaces. This is used as a bargaining chip to free him. Still, Andrews comes back totally brainwashed and this ends this bad film.<br /><br />Marta Toren is his love interest and Audrey Totter is totally wasted as another reporter on the bureau in Paris. In addition, the talents of George Sanders are not made use here. He was supposed to be the bureau chief. Both he and Andrews had designs on Ms. Toren.<br /><br />The writing is the true culprit in this film.
