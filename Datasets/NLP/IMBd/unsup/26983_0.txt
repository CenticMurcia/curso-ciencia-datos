The film may have been a little sentimental, but not too much, and it includes Over the Rainbow by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole which sets the tone for the whole film. And seeing Jason Mamoa without his dreadlocks was worthy and dreamy (I love my Hawaiian men). I really did enjoy this Hallmark film, and the scenery made it worthwhile. Can you imagine, for the main character to find out that her mother was Hawaiian, and the land could be theirs. But this particular plot of the land feud was not resolve in the film by the time it was the ceremony for Lily. But ending it by her going back to her old life in Boston, is as real as you get, but what else could she do, split her family up to spend her romantic days with her Hawaiian hunk? and i suppose, Hawaii is a paradise, for a moment, and that's all. it would be nice if we all packed off to Hawaii to live with our Hawaiian hunks, if that were so, Hawaii would be the awful tourist trap of middle aged women you would see in some of the Spanish resorts today. Then, end of paradise.
