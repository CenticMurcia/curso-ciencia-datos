What else can be added regarding this solid noir? This was the first time I had seen Payne in a "serious" role, and I was not disappointed. All of the heavies were good, but I particularly liked Van Cleef and Brand (the latter with his magnificently pock-marked face). Loved the opening scene where the women in New Look dresses, and the gents with suits and fedoras are waiting in front of the bank. My favorite piece of dialog is when one cop says to Payne's character, Rolfe, "... left school to enlist with the engineers. Pretty good soldier too! Bronze Star, Purple Heart!" Rolfe answers, "Try and buy a cup of coffee with them!" Kind of sums up the way many noir male characters felt about the cards that life had dealt them. Thoroughly enjoyable film!
