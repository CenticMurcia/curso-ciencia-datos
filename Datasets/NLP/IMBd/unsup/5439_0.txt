Exorcism: The Possession of Gail Bowers starts six weeks after the death of teenager Gail Bowers (Erica Roby) mom & dad as she moves to a new home in a new state with her now legal guardians her older sister Anne (Noel Thurman) & her husband Clark Pederson (Griff Furst). At first things seem alright but that that doesn't last for long as Gail begins to change, she starts to sleepwalk, talk in ancient Latin, her voice suddenly becomes very deep, she spouts obscenities & begins to undergo a dramatic & horrifying change of personality. Anne & Clark call in a shrink, Dr. Richard Thornhill (David Shick) who quickly comes to the realisation that Gail is possessed by a demon, as you would. Thornhill approaches the Church & ask's for help in performing an exorcism, the only thing he believes that can save Gail...<br /><br />Written & directed by low budget horror regular Leigh Scott this is yet another 'mockbuster' rip-off which obviously takes it's inspiration & title from The Exorcist (1973) & to a lesser extent The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) from The Asylum who specialise in this sort of cheap low budget horror themed cash-on of big budget Hollywood flicks. I must admit I think The Asylum make some of the worst films out there, do they even try to make good films? They seem to have this formula where they rip some well known film off with a catchy & familiar sounding title, try to include maybe one or two has-been actors for name value & try to include one or two sequences that will look good in a trailer & they just stick to it. Not wishing to sound too unkind the majority of their output is absolutely dreadful both technically & conceptually. Anyway, Exorcism: The Possession of Gail Bowers doesn't buck the trend & this is one long, dull, boring, predictable & tedious rip-off of The Exorcist, that really is the best way to describe it. The possessed teenage girl trapped in her room & tied to her bed, an early scene with a Ouija board, frantic parents seeking help first from doctor's & then priest's, the final climatic exorcism which is so badly written & handled it's untrue & a few of the notorious trademark scenes from The Exorcist are clearly replicated here such as the spider walk (quite literally here as Gail walks up a wall), speaking in an ancient language, lots of unintentionally funny porno dialogue as Gail spouts various obscenities & of course the final exorcism itself which is performed by a priest wearing sunglasses! The whole film is misjudged, it goes from being unintentionally hilarious to being unintentionally awful to unintentionally boring, or at least I hope it was unintentional. Character's, dialogue & the plot are all well below average as is the film as a whole.<br /><br />If you were to look in the bathroom mirror & see strips of your flesh peeling from your face what would you do? Think about it for a moment. Right I doubt very much that anyone reading this would have thought to themselves 'undress & take a shower' but that's precisely what one teenage girl decides to do in this. Yes that's right, after seeing the skin on her face literally fall off she takes her clothes off (gratuitous breast shot included) & takes a shower. Does that make any sort of sense to anyone? The gore is tame, there's a bit of blood, scissors stuck in someones shoulder, a stabbing or two & that's about it. There's not too much GCI here thankfully. I was extremely surprised not to see a vomiting scene in this, despite being probably the most famous scene in The Exorcist there's no recreation here which is odd since Exorcism: The Possession of Gail Bowers rips pretty much every other significant scene in The Exorcist off. Forget about any scares as it's all rather inept & cheap looking, the last twenty odd minutes & the exorcism itself is an eyesore of bad lighting & camera angles.<br /><br />It seems actor turned directed Griff Furst has a lead role in this, he would go on to make three of the worst films ever in Universal Soldiers (2007), I Am Omega (2007) & 100 Million BC (2008) all for The Asylum & all 'mockbuster' rip-offs. Overall the acting isn't that good & I don't actually recognise anyone from this.<br /><br />Exorcism: The Possession of Gail Bowers sounds like a cheap rip-off, it looks like a cheap rip-off & is a cheap rip-off. Anyone with no standards at all might like it but anyone looking for a decent horror film would be better served watching The Exorcist again.
