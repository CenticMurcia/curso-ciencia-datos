This is a very entertaining movie as expected from the cast list and the exceptional trailers, that showcased producer Seinfeld as a human bee and had a cameo appearance of the studio head, Steven Spielberg. <br /><br />A nonconformist bee graduates after the nine days of mandatory education from which he missed one. He is faced with choosing a job for life which only becomes available on the death of another bee in the very organised bee colony/hive. <br /><br />He is only interested in one job 'Pollen Jock' for which he has not qualified for on his breeding but gets to try and qualify for at the movie end.<br /><br />Because a human spares his life, he breaks the bee law of not speaking to humans, discovers that humans obtain honey from bee prison camps, and successfully sues humans to return all the stolen honey. This has effects that he could not have predicted.<br /><br />There are some biological errors on the role of bees in pollination that are redeemed by the final message of the interrelatedness of all species in nature.<br /><br />I particularly liked the irony of the bloodsucking mosquito's conversion to lawyer. This exemplifies the use of verbal and visual humour designed for the adult viewer.
