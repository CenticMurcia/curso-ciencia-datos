john ford have said that "The Fugitive " was his only perfect film . The film was not a commercial success and the critics write bad thing about it . Never mind . This movie is a song of beauty , a study about the catholic faith that can survive against the worst conditions ( an atheist government). See you "the fugitive ", a truly great movie .<br /><br />fernando alonso barahona author of "Cecil B. de Mille ", "LAs obras maestras del cine ", "Antropolog√≠a del cine " ....
