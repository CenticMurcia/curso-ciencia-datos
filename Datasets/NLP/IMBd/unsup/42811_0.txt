When I first read about this film I thought I would enjoy, It looked offbeat and has an excellent cast. I was wrong, what I got was a boring, pointless mess of a movie. I think the problem was actually Redford's directing, everything seemed so boring and out of place. The only unique thing about this film was the casting, not to say that most of the actors werent miscast, because they were but Redford put unknown actors in the lead, and "name" actors in smaller supporting roles, I thought that was an interesting touch. Overall a very lame movie. *1/2 out of *****.
