I am a longtime fan of Disneyland, and many of the rides that they have put there. This is one of my favorite rides, even though it is not in any sense a great ride, nor is it one of the better attractions that Lucas worked on with Disney, EO of course being his best. All and all this is a decent ride but as many star wars fans will know, there are some major flaws in this ride: <br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />1. As this is taking place after the battle of Endor, how can there be another Death star that is completely built up like the first one, when the second one was no where near completion? 2. The X-wings you see in this attraction violate the laws of the Star Wars universe, because they launch to hyperspace in attack position<br /><br />*END SPOILER* <br /><br />The flaws aside though, this is a fun ride for the whole family that actually brings some characters from the movie in, though you wont see any Jedi battles, as this is a flight simulator which takes you on a rough space trip, to an explosive ending. The attraction is a decent, if not great ride, and even though the only character in ride you see is R2, you will still hear some memorable quotes, and see memorable faces during the preflight safety videos. Be sure to look for the hidden mickeys!
