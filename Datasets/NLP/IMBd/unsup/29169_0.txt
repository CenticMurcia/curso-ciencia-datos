Back in the day when the Disney brand was a force to be dealt with and not just another brand name, there was a cartoon called "Darkwing Duck", chronicling the adventures of the title Batman wannabe, his adopted daughter Gosalyn, and his crash-prone partner, Launchpad. The wit was rapier, the plots were funny and quite redeemable, and even over 10 years later, the show's material isn't dated.<br /><br />I remember that I was on cloud nine when I'd rush (run) home from school and catch this on the tail end of the Disney Afternoon. Though "Gargoyles" did have its moments, DD is, in my opinion, the last great cartoon out of Disney's arsenal, mostly of bombs they churn out like so many second-rate straight to video sequels.<br /><br />Along with "Ducktales", "Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers", and "TaleSpin", this cartoon was the backbone of the Disney Afternoon. The moment that the DD DVD box set comes out (don't worry, I'm not holding my breath), I'm so there.<br /><br />Darkwing Duck: 4.5 / 5 stars
