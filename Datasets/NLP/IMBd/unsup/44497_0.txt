It almost made me cry to watch the whole "documentary". One definitely has to be in a catatonic state of mind to believe that the proof presented in this film is genuine. In many parts of this movie trying to prove some intergovernmental global new world order -scheme, the video and the audio track have been taken from different sources.<br /><br />I wonder why this film was made. It must have a real purpose, besides shocking those stupid and eager enough to believe that various US federal institutions are/were responsible for the Oklahoma bombing, the -93 bombing of WTC complex and 911.<br /><br />If this is an alternative medium challenging the military industrial complex in the US of A, the "big" media etc., why is the only message of this film; "Do not trust anything federal and first of all - do not let go of your guns. Owning guns is your right, and it is good for you."?<br /><br /> Sometimes poor documentaries are hilariously funny. Sometimes they are shocking because they are made *means for an end*, just the thing that they claim is done by your government... And this one falls to the latter category.<br /><br /> It gains it one point (out of ten) for showing - very truthfully - that leaders of this world, from Caesar Nero approx. 2000 yrs ago to world leaders in our times have lied and attacked their own people in order to gain more power over them. This should be no news. Everyone who has attended a history class knows it.<br /><br /> To find this film informative or entertaining simply isn't possible for any human being.
