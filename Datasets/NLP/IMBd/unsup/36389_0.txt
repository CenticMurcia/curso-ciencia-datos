The story line of this film is almost completely non-sensical. The director/writer of this film took ideas/concepts from other films and tried to put them together into a 'uniquely' drawn out story (with the always great 'twist' ending), however, the end product is a piece of garbage. The characters in this story lack any depth whatsoever. The film contains no original scoring, poor editing, and at times, even worse acting. The director/writer clearly did not care about his characters and it shows in his work. While I hate to slam the 'efforts' of a low budget film maker, everyone should steer clear of this wasted effort. I did manage to sit through the entire 'experience' and can only offer that if you are feeling sad, lonely or just misunderstood, watch this film, you will laugh at how ridiculous it is.
