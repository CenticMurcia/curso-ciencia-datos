This is one of my top 10 movies of all time. I still think this is Gary Oldman's best performance of his career and Sean Penn and Ed Harris were very good as well. The title of the movie explains it for anyone who doesn't understand the movie and if you still need clarification on what a state of grace is Penn's character explains it in detail in the movie when visiting Robin Wright Penn's characters apartment. The acting is superb, the story is great, the dialog is witty and dramatic. I am an Irishman but that does not make me biased. Anyone who watches this movie and "gets it" will really like it. Trust me if you have not seen this movie make sure you do. The whole movie is great but its worth seeing for Gary Oldman's performance alone.
