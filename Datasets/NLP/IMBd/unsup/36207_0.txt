If you liked the first movie, don't see this. Actually nothing is good in this film. It's the first time I feel this way about a movie, I just find it ridiculous. I like American Psycho because of the entire environment that really is. We've got the thing about Dorsia and their calling cards and all the different expensive brands. This film got nothing of it. For first it takes place in some kind of American college environment, and the head actress is Mila Kunis, that's the first warning sign. And then there's a different director. How many follow-ups with a different director have actually turned up good? I don't think I can mention any. And what's charming with the murder she does? Nothing. And who seriously believe that Patrick Bateman would be slaughtered by that tiny girl? And where's all the nice music that was played in American Psycho?
