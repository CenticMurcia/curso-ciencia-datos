A note made in a previous comment is absolutely true: "turn your brain off". I really liked George Peppard and take a little bit of associated pride in that he went to the same school system in Dearborn, MI that I did but this really is a weird movie. To call it science fiction means it should have some scientific background to substantiate the story. Killer cockroaches? And then when they needed to repair these state of the art "RV's", they happen to be on top of "what's left of Detroit" and find a replacement rear end in a junkyard. And the special effects were sad even for the time the movie was produced. With all due respect to Mr. Peppard and Mr. Vincent, you should be forewarned that this movie has a great deal of "cheesiness".
