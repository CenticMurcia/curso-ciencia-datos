Oh, man... I remember seeing this absolute dog as a teenager. It was a matinee in this run-down theater, and no one was there but me and some friends... The plot was so incomprehensible from the outset that we began hooting at Reb Brown (dressed as a caveman and Steve Martin look-alike)... every time someone called his name -- "Yor!" -- we would yell back in unison: "My what?" Crappy movie, but a fond memory.<br /><br />Can anyone explain how 22 people gave this laugher a "10?"
