A few years ago, the world's been touched by MacDonald's Beautiful Thing involving Jamie & Ste's love story, they were young, cute... So imagine a film much better than that one, this is Get Real, by genius director Simon Shore (remember "Eton, class of '91"), with a wonderful cast (especially young Ben Silverstone - just GREAT !!!!- already seen in The Browning Version...) The screenplay is so interesting, a lot more than Beautiful Thing's, we can feel Johnny and Steve's emotion, the fear of being "discovered" because of the reactions of all those stupid people... Johnny's difficulty to admit what he's... In my opinion, one of the greatest films ever, even if the reaction of everybody, at the end, is maybe more positive than it would be in reality... but we have to be optimistic... Thank you Simon, Thank you Ben !
