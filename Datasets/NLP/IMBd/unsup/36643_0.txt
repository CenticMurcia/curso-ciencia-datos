The unexpected and premature death of Peter Sellers at an early age of 54 robbed the world a comic genius in both radio and film and should have brought an abrupt end to any forthcoming Pink Panther film. Somehow it didn't stop director Blake Edwards from coming up with a hapless idea in making a series of posthumous flops, the first being the Trail of the Pink Panther that I comment about. This film with some clips featuring Peter Sellers were from deleted scenes together with a lame plot to suggested that the incompetent French detective Inspector Clouseau had disappeared in mysterious circumstances while Joanna Lumley played a journalist in search for an answer using as-filmed footages together with much of the Peter Sellers scenes actually coming from The Pink Panther Strikes Again. It just didn't work and not even the remaining two films that followed and they are only fit to end up in the cutting room bin but at what cost. In fact, I have recently seen some DVD issues of the complete Pink Panther set onto the domestic film market with some posthumous films added in but I would recommend anyone and even myself to avoid these somewhat cunning releases and buy the best ones individually at the lowest price. Also I wish the deleted Peter Sellers scenes were restored back to where they originally belonged.
