This movie is animated fantasy. It shows the mythical aspects of the arthurian legend, a world of wonder, wizards, violence - and Wagner. His music (especially from "Tristan und Isolde" and "Parsifal") appoints to the film its tragic and melancholy atmosphere. The characters are a little flat, ok, but its not a plot written by Dostojewski or Proust. Its a heroic fairy tale, remembered and told for centuries, and this film gives it a depth till the beginning of our world. SEE IT!!!
