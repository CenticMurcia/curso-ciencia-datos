Words cannot really describe how bad swamp zombies is. You have to see it to believe it, but i don't wish that punishment on anybody.<br /><br />Swamp Zombies by director and star Len Fabianksi is the story of a doctor who is trying to bring the dead back to life, but when federal agents come to inspect the hospital he is working in he must ditch the cadavers quick. So basically the bodies get dumped in the lake and there are a bunch of kids near the swamp and after a storm the bodies come back to life and try feasting on the living.<br /><br />The acting is THE worst i have ever seen, i've seen school plays with better acting. The direction is also terrible, has this guy never heard of 'Take 2' the actors and even he himself fluff their lines on camera and did they never think of re doing that take? The make up effects are the best thing in the film, but again nothing to brag about considering the rest of the film is garbage. The zombies look ridiculous and the blood looks like red syrup. Also you never really see any decent shots of the zombies taking chunks out of people, you just see them sucking on their arms and blood coming out.<br /><br />Some shots linger on for too long and are completely unnecessary, for instance a 1 or 2 minutes long shot of old whore Jasmine st Claire in the shower, it brings nothing to the film and doesn't join on to another scene, my guess is the male crew told Len it would make a good addition to the film and also that they should all watch.<br /><br />On the IMDb boards director Len has faced the criticism with rants about how this movie is meant to be a campy horror film with some shots made for laughs.<br /><br />Well Len, in short, it isn't a fun campy horror film. Its boring, dull and painful to watch.<br /><br />You mention that the scene where the old man runs screaming through the trees is supposed to be funny, well i didn't know that when watching because that guys acting skills made me believe that was his best attempt at being terrified. Even if it was played for laughs, it isn't funny nor is anything else in the film.<br /><br />As the film neared its end i was expecting to see a very basic credits list maybe a crew of 3 or 4 people doing numerous jobs. So i was shocked to see their is a quite large crew. Why any of them agreed to doing this project after they read the scripts is beyond me.<br /><br />I honestly thought that this was a film made by a kid fresh out of film school with a couple of hundred bucks.<br /><br />I know the budget of $12,000 is small but they could have at least used a decent camera.<br /><br />I didn't pay to watch this film, which i am glad i didn't and when i can get the directors second film 'curse of the wolf' for free i will watch that too, out of pure curiosity as the director mentions that it is a much better film which shows that he has advanced as a film maker. After seeing the trailer i doubt that.<br /><br />Maybe you should hang up your film makers hat Mr Fabinaksi, your first two ideas for films have been zombies and werewolves, so your hardly original, you have 0 talent when deciding what angles to use and you cant write a script.<br /><br />The editing is appalling, in one scene two people are fighting in broad daylight one second and the next its pitch black. After nearly every shot the actors will be standing still and in the wrong positions from the last shot.<br /><br />The sound was THE worst I've ever heard in a film that is listed on IMDb, in some scenes you can barely hear the actors and in others their voices nearly broke my speakers. Its blatantly obvious from one shot to another as the background noise changes completely. Just to sum up how bad and amateur it is, in once scene where the blue meanie and a woman in a bikini are supposed to be in a cabin/hut in the middle of a swamp you can clearly hear a car whizzing by in the background.<br /><br />Ther fight scenes are again terrible, no one actually gets hit, just one person will kick near another persons face and a 'wham' sound effect will be used. Seeing as most of the cast are trained in martial arts i would have expected better. Also the moves used in the fight scenes become very repetitive and the fight choreographer makes no attempt to change any of the moves used.<br /><br />1/10 <br /><br />By the way this film has inspired me though, if this junk can get distributed then surely i could get a film released too.
