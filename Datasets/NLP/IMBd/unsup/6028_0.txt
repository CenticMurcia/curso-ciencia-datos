This film is highly reminiscent of the gangster films made by Warner Brothers throughout the 1930s, though oddly it has less action and more talking--a strange thing indeed for a silent film! While you might expect lots of shootouts and action, most of the film is confined to a police station and it unfolds an awful lot like a play. This isn't necessarily bad--the film still earned a score of 7. But if it had featured a little more action, I frankly think it would have been a better film. Still, the plot involving a dedicated police captain who is frustrated by his own corrupt city hall makes an interesting film. Unfortunately, on occasion, the corruptness of the administration is a bit over-the-top. For example, no town, no matter HOW corrupt, would have crooked judges who issue release orders (writs of habeas corpus) the second the crime is committed or before the person is even charged--especially when it appears they will be up on murder charges!! Despite this and it's talkiness, it's still a decent film with an exceptional print through most of the film--though in a few tiny spots it is scratchy and appears in need of further restoration.<br /><br />By the way, the character of "Chick" looks a lot like Paul Rubens ("Peewee Herman"). I found this pretty amusing.
