anyone know the name of the beginning song? LoL movie not that good tho anyway this movie sucked big time. waste of money. don't buy this movie. it sucks. not very good Jeff Lucas comes back from the dead and murders people he dies at end. not wot worth the money. anyone know begging song name? i thought Halloween was better. i think some the actors was high when making this movie. very dumb movie. so does anyone know the theme song name? i been looking for the soundtrack but cant find it. I know this is a straight to video release. It also has some familiar faces in it. But it's horrible. A goth kid makes a crappy 5 minute movie that everyone laughs at so he goes nuts. He gets into a beef with a jock and takes off in his car being chased by the jock. Eventually goth kid drives over a cliff. One year later, the teachers and students who mocked him start dying, each one leaving a clue as to who will die next. Now, forget you read all that because you are never going to want to sit through this horrible movie. Now anyone who has the name to the beginning theme email me @ crazyjames99@hotmail.com
