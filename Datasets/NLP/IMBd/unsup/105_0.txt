Rob Reiner is hilarious. I haven't seen the movie in a long time and have trouble finding it everywhere. Some of the humor is ethnic, but to me seems pretty harmless, as well as very funny. I thought there was a lot of good slapstick and madcap silliness.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the movie is not more available in stores or on different internet sites where some individual who had the interest in buying a movie like this would be able to have the opportunity to purchase a funny and entertaining and humorous movie such as this particular movie was.<br /><br />If you can find it, give it a try.
