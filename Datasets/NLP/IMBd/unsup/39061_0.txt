I only saw the mummy segment, but it was SO stupid. The plot makes itself unexplainable. Bellingham pries open the mummy's sarcophagus. The first thing he does is goes on about how the ritual of mummification calls for pulling out the corpse's brain. Then he finds the piece of paper in the mummy's stomach. He asks the other guy "You know how to read this?" Later that night, he reads it fluently, enabling the ancient Egyptian curse which wakes the mummy. Now, if I'm wrong, stop me, but he said the mummy's brains were pulled out. If that is true, the mummy cannot think. Hence, he could not have a had a solid working knowledge of the human anatomy, and the knowhow to steal that one guy's brain. Also, not that even a brain could help him here, if he is from ancient times, how does he know how to cause an electrical blackout? Finally, if he has no brain, his nerves wouldn't work. How can he move?
