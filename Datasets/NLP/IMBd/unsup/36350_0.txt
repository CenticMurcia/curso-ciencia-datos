This is really hard for me to do,as Christian Slater is my favourite actor,but this movie was,well terrible.<br /><br />As well as being a Slater fan,i also like Stephen King,but this really disappoints,It starts off with Jimmy Dolan killing a couple of immigrant's,as he is a trafficker and burying them alive in the Nevada desert,whilst being watched by a school teacher played by Emmanuele Vaugier(check spelling),so Dolan order's her death,she is put into protective custody along with her partner,Wes Bentley,she ends up dead and Bentley goes on the hunt for revenge,he has numerous opportunities but fails to take them,the same being said for Slater,who also has the opportunity to get rid of Bentley,but makes a mistake by not doing so.<br /><br />I only gave it a 3 because Slaters performance was good enough,but i'm sorry to all Wes Bentley fans,as i get angry when people slag Slater,but this guy really can't act,the last 10 minutes of the film,he gets a pass from me,but up until then,he is like a lump of wood,again,i apologise for being negative about him,but in this movie,he deserves it.<br /><br />I beg you not to watch this,even if your a Slater fan.
