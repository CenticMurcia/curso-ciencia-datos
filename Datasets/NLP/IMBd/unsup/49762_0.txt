"After the first 5 minutes there is nothing worth watching in this film" (xnix444).<br /><br />Yes, but even the first 5 minutes are really bad. The intro with the sword seems to be stolen by 'Conan the barbarian' (also 1982), but in quality not even close to it.<br /><br />"It has possibly the worst score in film history." (eightx10)<br /><br />Yes, that is also true. The score is scary!<br /><br />"The production values are terrible; the writing, nonexistent." (yngue)<br /><br />Yes, I agree and have nothing more to say about that. Even "The Barbarians" (1987) is a true masterpiece compared to this crap.<br /><br />Rating: 1 of 10.
