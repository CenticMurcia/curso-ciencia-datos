In a Mary Poppins meets Supernanny, entwined with an element of enchantment; Nanny McPhee will hopefully win several awards for best actress, best actor, best supporting actress and best supporting actor, best script and best director!! <br /><br />Emma Thompson, as terrific as ever, stars as Nanny McPhee, a mysterious nanny who is called to the aid of Mr. Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) a widower who is struggling to bring up his badly behaved children. With her mystical powers and unique ways she soon charms all seven children and helps them woo their father towards the attractive housemaid, Evangeline (Kelly McDonald). But the bliss is threatened by the arrival of Cedric's drag-queen, admirer (Celia Imrie)  <br /><br />Emma Thompson is the next Helen Mirren/Meryl Streep without a shadow of a doubt and here is a prime example. The clever make up and well acted performance adds to the authentic side to the film and also shows her how much she deserves another award. Colin Firth is posh and snobby  as always, but that's how we know him. Ha ah ha. He too is excellent in his role, as the workaholic Dad. Celia Imrie reveals her more evil side and is without doubt PERFECT as the over-made villain! It was also nice to see Angela Lansbury, now much older, in a cameo as Firth's domineering Aunt, but with an important role in the story. <br /><br />The SXF's are low key but terrific throughout the film. I particularly liked Emma Thompson's entrance  the camera zooming towards the manor from several different directions before she storms the screen. The script, also Thompson's work, is well written and enjoyable with jokes for the entire family as well as the well remembered quotes from all the characters. The set design is particularly eye catching, especially Imrie's house, personally it reminded me of Hansel and Gretal. <br /><br />Couples who are looking for a date flick, do NOT be put off because it's a U. Its perfect for a date flick! Not scary, good acting, British, good jokes, several cameos, touching and at a reasonable and appropriate pace. Parents who are looking for something to take the children to see  this is also ideal! For the exact same reasons. <br /><br />Don't really know what else to say, other than this could well be the film of 2005. Its quite simply perfect. A moving, feel-good film.
