This movie is a complete waste of time. This movie had the potential to be funny, but it failed miserably. The only thing that could save this movie was Christopher Walken, and he failed to deliver.<br /><br />Walken was the only thing that I was excited about, and the 45 minutes or so he spent in this movie was terrible.<br /><br />Something that really grinded my gears during this movie was the love plot. Randy likes this Asian girl named Maggie who is tired of "all the guys all over her", and she's also mad that Randy is the reason that her home was destroyed. But soon after, for no apparent reason, she falls in love with him and starts to kiss him. There was no explanation for this, but whatever. The whole movie fails anyway.<br /><br />This movie was not funny. I basically forced myself to laugh. If you're walking into this movie expecting to see a funny Will Ferrell movie or something along the lines of Anchorman, or even a smarter comedy such as Superbad, you will be highly disappointed.<br /><br />I give this movie a 3/10 because it had Christopher Walken in it, and because it had a plot that could have been used to much greater effect.<br /><br />Do not believe what this movie is selling - a laugh fest with your buddies at the local cinema. This is garbage.
