The above rating is for the mid-'70's to mid-80's shows, when 'Last Of The Summer Wine' was at its peak in my view. Brian Wilde was 'Foggy', Peter Sallis 'Clegg', and the irreplaceable Bill Owen played 'Compo'. 'Last' is the perfect tonic; the sun always shines in Holmfirth, everybody gets on well with everybody else, and nothing unpleasant ever seems to happen. No wonder its lasted thirty-three years. Its detractors seem to think its main audience are pensioners. Wrong. 'Last' is watched by children too; in fact its one of the few television comedies on now that the family can enjoy. Naturally, this makes it a thorn in the side of the 'cutting-edge' comedy brigade, who can't sit through anything for more than two minutes unless someone either swears, vomits or farts. The quality of the show might not be what it once was, but its still more enjoyable than the dire 'Little Britain'. Brian Murphy, Frank Thornton, Peter Sallis and Stephen Lewis are living proof that comedy doesn't have to be 'a young man's game'.
