While I don't have MUCH to say about this hilariously, painful monstrosity I do have one question...who the hell thinks of sh*t like an 'albino'-black slave? And for that matter, why is being a pasty-skinned Anglo-Saxon male considered close enough? If indeed the story calls for an albino I'd expect any respectable casting agent to go out and find such a person. True the population of albino-Africans is probably not soaring through the roof, but any albino would do (with exception of those of Asian kin); or perhaps a better make-up artist was all that was needed. Whatever the case, when I have trouble conceptualizing the viability towards one of MAIN characters, I find the rest of the film to be contrived and lackluster. BUT, with the right amount of THC in your system (or whatever your poison may be) the movie quickly becomes a wonderful, laughable joke. I'm sure this was not intended, but at least they accomplished something with a flick that otherwise would be better used as a book-end.
