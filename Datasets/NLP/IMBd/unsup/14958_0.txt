<br /><br />This is a propaganda film Leni Riefenstahl, Mao and Stalin would be proud of. Senseless, waste of time, starring wooden Harrison Ford who has been playing the same role, since Han Solo and Deckard of Blade Runner, now for 20 years. He is certainly one of the worst professional actors in the world.
