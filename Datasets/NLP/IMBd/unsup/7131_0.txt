Interviewed shortly before his death, the writer Dennis Potter identified the three of his works he considered the best: his serials 'Pennies From Heaven' and 'The Singing Detective', and this short play, in which he addresses childhood (and the memories thereof) by casting adults to play their younger selves. There's a great thematic consistency to all of Potter's writings, and it's easy in retrospect to see everything he wrote prior to 'The Singing Detective' as leading up to that masterpiece (he was shameless about self-plagiarism), a view which also explains the relative vacuity of his later work; and this means that watching 'Blue Remembered Hills' today, it doesn't quite have the impact that it may first have done, before elements present in it were reworked (together with elements from all his other dramas) in his landmark achievement. But it's still well-observed and disturbing, although it's almost as shocking to hear its really quite distinguished cast speaking in Forest of Dean accents as it is to see them dressed as children. What's really a shame is that Potter learnt his trade writing numerous screenplays for television: produced on low budgets, they nonetheless aired to a mass audience (in an age of few channels); and it's hard to see where today's young writers have a similar opportunity (or desire) to make challenging drama of this sort. Which is not to say there is no talent any more; but another Dennis Potter may be a long time in coming.
