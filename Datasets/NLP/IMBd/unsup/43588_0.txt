Ok, this goes out to my friend Lou who said, "Hey, let's rent this and see if it's really as bad as it looks".<br /><br />Lou, it was worse.<br /><br />Good God, I've rarely seen a piece of crap this poorly written; and what was with that ending? Without saying too much, let me comment that the psychodelic tunnel ride in "2001: A Space Odyssey" made much more sense and could even be called "coherant" by comparisson.<br /><br />Basically, the story is about a guy who looks like "Shaggy" from Scooby Doo, his two friends "Ed Grimly" and "Whiney-Boy", and their hosts in a winter retreat in Manitoba (read someone's hick town in Wisconsin) as they happen to miss out on a smoke-bomb and red-flashlight invasion that eventually catches up with them anyway.<br /><br />They run around in the wintery woods, get frostbite, vanish one-by-one from a mysterious disease that disintegrates their bodies. Then, the movie ends. For no aparant reason.<br /><br />AAAAARRRRGH!
