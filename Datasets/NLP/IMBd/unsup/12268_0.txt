In reviewing African-Americans on film in chronological order for Black History Month, we're now at 1936 with the first all-black production for a major studio since Hallelujah! from MGM in 1929: The Green Pastures from Warner Bros. Rex Ingram stars in three roles-De Lawd, Adam, and Hezdrel. As De Lawd, Ingram brings a human dimension to the Supreme Being that expresses his doubts occasionally because of the way things turn out. Playwright Marc Connelly brought to his screenplay adaptation some wonderful humorous touches in retelling some of the bible stories like that exchange between De Lawd and Noah (Eddie Anderson who I just saw at the beginning of Show Boat) about whether to bring one keg or two of whiskey to the ark or Gabriel (Oscar Polk) saying he'll spit in the eye of Satan! Among the females, Edna Mae Harris makes an impression in her brief role of Zeba who, after her boyfriend gets shot, takes a shine to the one who shot him! Was most impressed with the Moses story especially the trick scene with the walking stick turning into a snake and what happened afterward when the Pharaoh initially refused Moses' request to let his people go. The spiritual singing of the Hall Johnson Choir serving as score throughout was very inspirational. And having New Orleans being mentioned as the Sin City told this Louisianian how some things never change! While, yes, there's some stereotypes about the Negroes being such simple people (with heaven presented as a fish fry and the angels getting ten-cent cigars), there's also a message about tolerance and how, despite all that's wrong with the world, there's also plenty that's right that is made clear at the end when there's word of someone being nailed at the cross...
