Godzilla has been and will always be a Japanese creation and thankfully Godzilla 2000 has no Hollywood input. The American version some years ago was a disaster with the story plot focused on Hollywood actors, not the big fella. In this film, Godzilla once more comes to the rescue of an ungrateful planet. Godzilla always saves the world from some creature or aliens that would take over the planet Earth. The military tries it's best to kill Godzilla without success of course. The whole plot involves a flying, ancient rock that has a flying saucer hidden within it. The saucer attempts to clone itself with the cells of Godzilla. This film brings us the fight music of the original movies beginning with Godzilla, King of the Monsters. If you enjoy Godzilla then you will be pleased with this film.
