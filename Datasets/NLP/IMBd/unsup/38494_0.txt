This was very very horrible. In all the wrong ways. Its basically about some handicapped icecream truck driver who comes back to exact revenge on those responsible for his death. I have only seen two episodes of the second season of this series and hope a third season isn't in the works. Trust me I love horror but this season and particularly this episode just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The acting is shockingly abysmal. (except for the Clown icecream truck driver who does good with what lines he has)<br /><br />The stupid 'We All Scream For Icrecream' song is used so many times it makes you wish you were deaf.<br /><br />The story drags on and on and on and becomes repetitive.<br /><br />It felt like a 2 and a half hour TV movie which is bad considering it was only an hour.<br /><br />SSDD is used and one word is changed. (For those who don't know: SSDD was used in a Steven King book: Dreamcatcher, while not the best book its bad to rip off someone elses phrasing even if you do change one word in it)<br /><br />It seemed to me that the story was copying 'It' also by Steven King. I mean we have a clown and the kids that tormented him and he comes back when they are adults to exact his revenge.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Great Special Effects Good acting by the Clown The episode actually finished (I honestly never thought it was going to end)<br /><br />Conclusion: Please steer clear of this episode entirely, its for lack of a better word: Rubbish
