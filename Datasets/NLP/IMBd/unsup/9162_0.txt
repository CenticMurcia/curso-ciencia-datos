This is a Terrible movie, in almost every aspect, murky cinematography, sloppy special effects, and cheap sets, the argument it's full of gaps, flat, slow and predictable, and the direction it's Kind of ED WOOD in a LSD trip... It's a Colombian movie, and one of the main lines is: It's better to born in Colombia than be dead....Great, it's also very patriot.<br /><br />It's Just another movie about Colombians and drugs...from a very drugged point of view.<br /><br />125 lost minutes in my life, and 125 millions of dead brain cells... don't waste your time, nor your brain by watching this...
