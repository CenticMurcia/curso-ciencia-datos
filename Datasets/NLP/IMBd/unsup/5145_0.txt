like i said its funny but its pretty darn good too.......................<br /><br />the film is about people being filmed without knowing it and getting their reactions to unusual encounters mainly with nudity, like a naked lady asking for directions, one asks some ppl to kiss her, and a naked girl in an elevator, and then has video of ppl discussing the film after they watched it...........<br /><br />so if you haven't seen this and you like stuff like candid camera and things like that you'll like this, but this is also more than that, so ya i recommend it, if you can ever find it
