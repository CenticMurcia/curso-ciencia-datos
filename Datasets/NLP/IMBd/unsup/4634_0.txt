Having lived throughout the depression and the Presidency of F D R, I was pleasantly surprised when I happened upon Roughly Speaking on T C M last week. Somehow,in all these years of movie going and viewing,I never had a clue about this moving film.<br /><br />The author expertly weaves into the plot glimpses of those bygone days.. The early airplanes,the the struggle to ride out the lean times. <br /><br />The staid mother's daughter having fought the same crippling disease as had the President,the stock market crash the early war years. <br /><br />Her heart wrenching scene watching all three sons go off to war.<br /><br />Although the movie depicted the triumph over adversity women of the thirties/forties achieved, the young women of today are the daughters and grand daughters of the multi taskers of my mother's day<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to all American women.
