Oh, Nowhere started off with great intentions... a film trying to make a statement about the end of the world, a statement about the hatred and self-centered living of mankind. This statement was never defined because of the garbage that was presented. If I had to see one more pretty boy and his little prep girlfriend playing tonsil hockey, I would have punched by screen.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was horrible. The themes were never properly presented. The themes were never good in the first place. The characters were never given more than one dimension. I didn't give a damn about any of them. This movie attempted to be Kubrickish in presenting the horrible possibilities... but, at least Kubrick films are written and acted by members of our society that contain intelligent thought and feeling.<br /><br />Yes, my word to you... stay clear of Nowhere... all the title does is explain where the plot goes. It's a nonsense piece of crap. Go rent A Clockwork Orange. Now, there's a shocking movie with a clear cut message
