Let's get one thing straight. I enjoyed this movie, it had some great action sequences. But it definitely had its weak points, namely its characters. The characters are alright, better than characters in DragonBall Z (but that isn't saying to much), but the writers obviously tried to make the characters appear deeper than they actually are by having them say and do things that really don't make a whole lot of sense (they did this much more in the show, the movie wasn't nearly as bad on this subject). They also have the characters spew out lines that sound philosophical, but are really just common sense. But overall the movie was pretty decent, but it shouldn't be portrayed as more than it is; a good action movie (and it often is made up to be more). The last thing that really bugged me (and if this were different I might have given this an 8) is that none of the good guys die. They all survive and live happily ever after. There needs to be sacrifice and heartache in a story like this to make it more effective.
