This is very easily in contention for the worst movie ever. Painful to watch. I was tempted to get up and leave the theater as I endured the pain. The only thing that kept me in the theater was I was there with three friends. Later when we got out of the theater we all commented that the movie was completely bad and that we should have walked out on it.
