Man, oh man. I remember seeing this movie when I was about six with my mom and thinking "Turbo is the coolest thing EVER." Of course, my friends and I were break dancing outside (with or without cardboard) for the next several months. Spiked bracelets and adidas ruled the day. My wife and I rented the movie a year ago and it completely stunk. Where the hell do Ozone and Turbo live, in a garage? They're two grown men; to whose home is their garage attached? Why does Turbo dislike Special K? Is it because she becomes lovey-dovey with Ozone? Is the reason for the hatred at all related to the flamingly gay dude with the pink leotard that shows up EVERYWHERE Ozone and Turbo go? It's great to watch this movie to recall the good ol' days and maybe to see some pretty good breakin, but as a film it truly sucks b*lls.
