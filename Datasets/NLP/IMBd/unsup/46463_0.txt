Cheesy Eurotrash horror movie that makes Jesus Franco look like Hitchcock. Paul Naschy plays a man who turns into a werewolf when the full moon is out. While hiding out in a small French village, he welcomes two students (Gaby Fuchs and Barbara Capell) doing research on local vampire legends into his home. They awake the vampire woman (Patty Shepard) in a scene that rips off Bava's Mask of Satan very badly. As with all of these movies, there's gratuitous nudity, but not nearly enough, as well as hints at lesbian erotica - but only the most teasing of hints. I saw this in a theater (which was cool, despite the terribleness of the film) and the biggest crowd reaction came when one of the reels ended right in the middle of one of the lesbian scenes. Someone in the front row shrieked "NO!" and then a moment later, before the next reel started, "WHY?" Of course, when it reappeared, the lesbianism ended abruptly. Doesn't it always in these movies? It's like Europeans of the 1970s liked the idea of two women together, but weren't entirely sure if two women could have sex. Instead, they must just unbutton one another's shirts and rub the back of their hands across each other's breasts for a few seconds before the director yells "CUT!" As with the erotica, the promised werewolf vs. vampire woman action was pathetically short and unsatisfying. The print had faded terribly - it was as pink as undercooked chicken.
