The spoof movie was started in the hilarious AIRPLANE!, the trend continued with THE NAKED GUN and TOP SECRET, those were funny movies, it has since turned itself into a horrible, money controlled scheme to take peoples hard earned cash.<br /><br />EPIC MOVIE (about as epic as a kindergarten play), is and I'm going to emphasize it as hard as I possibly could a horrible, horrible, HORRRIBLE movie. I actually got a headache watching this piece of crap. It makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE look like POLTERGEIST, JAWS, PSYCHO and THE SHINING'S greatness combined.<br /><br />None of that hasn't bee said before. But let me tell you this film is about as funny as a funeral. No worse, as funny as going to prison. The film tries to rely on it's "jokes", which are no better then fart and poop jokes. My 5-year old cousin could've wrote a better script.<br /><br />so, in another words, only watch this if someone else's life in is danger.
