I truly enjoyed this film when I saw it back in 1978, the scene of Jesse eating a whole chocolate cake is so true to how someone her age might react when she had her heart broken, it was soo funny. I really wish that I could somehow own this movie even if it was an old copy but I have had no luck and I look for it on a regular basis. I also check the tv guide weekly to see if it will be on tv at all. Anyhow, it one of my favorite movies and it made me laugh even though it is dated it is true to how people would react in that situation, I loved the ending also.
