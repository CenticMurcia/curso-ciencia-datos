No... Seriously... Just NOOOO! this should never have been made. i was lucky enough to have spoken to Rob Grant one of the creators of the original red dwarf whilst he was doing a book release and heres a little story he told me.<br /><br />"the producers approached me and Doug (Naylor) and said he had a few questions before the go ahead, the first was that he didn't feel the American audiences would be able to associate with a hologram, so was there any way we could not kill Rimmer. second, He also felt that American audiences wouldn't feel comfortable with a creature evolved from cats so was there a way to write the Cats part as human, and lastly, Does it HAVE to be set in space?" now as to the truth behind this story i don't know but i assume due to the dire quality of the USA Pilot that it may hold some basis in truth, maybe with a typical Rob Grant humorous twist, either way it sums the show up perfectly, it was set for disaster from the off, recreating red dwarf is like trying to re-make Only Fools and Horses. <br /><br />its not just the perfect scripting, awe inspiringly bad scenery, and excellent production work that made Red Dwarf what it was, it was Craig Charles, Chris Barrie, Robert Llewellyn, Danny John Jules and Norman Lovett. they ARE Red Dwarf and always will be. as proved by the temporary replacement of Norman Lovett by Hatie Hayridge in the original Brit series, the program slumped, and was much worse, her performance was excellent but she isn't Holly.<br /><br />i am interested to find out where the second version of the Cat played by Terry Farrell (A Woman??? Why???) comes into it as only the pilot was ever made....
