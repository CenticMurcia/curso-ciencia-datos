The movie is badly directed though a good story and Vivek Oberoi cannot act. Please buy the movie if you want an example of how not to direct a movie.So see it at you own risk. The use of actresses has been poor. The feel of an old lady coming back to India in search of her love did not sell too well. But I haven't seen any brilliant work from the director in the recent times except for Iqbal which he produced. The movie had everything that makes a commercial success, it is a period movie it was quiet well done, songs were out of the world the two best music directors Rehman and Ismail Darbar and a commercial cast,the dances were choreographed by S.Dawar group the best dancing school available if you add all this with a good story a very good film!!!!! To make a flop with all this is and art by itself. Please buy this copy to see how not to do it.
