The movie cover makes it look like a comedy. It really wasn't all that funny. It was a drama, I suppose. It really wasn't all that dramatic. I watch movies to be entertained, and I was not entertained.<br /><br />Top three things I loved about this movie. 1. Papa Doc. He done well. 2. I'm hard pressed to come up with a second, so I doubt I can come up with a third.<br /><br />Top three things I despised about the movie. 1. The fact that I started the movie at 7:30 pm, took two short breaks, and didn't get to bed time past 10. I really thought he was wrapping it up somewhere near the second hour. 2. The end. 3. The plot.<br /><br />As a side note, wow. This was my first Spike Lee experience, and I have to say, I now understand why I'm laughing when comics make jokes such as "That makes about as much sense as a white person's script in a Spike Lee movie" ***SPOILER ALERT **** I thought it was hilarious that the first white man on screen kills himself, and the next white person shown is a complete and utter witch. The corrupt head of the company, white. The good judge: black. The bad judge: white. If it wasn't so obviously racist, I would take some of it to heart but it's borderline humorously bad. My first and last "joint".
