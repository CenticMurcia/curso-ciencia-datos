At first I saw that this film was rated a 10, which I never see on here. Then I noticed that it only had 19 votes and there were no comments yet. This made me leery but I decided to check it out for myself.<br /><br />First I must say that I am a big Sci-Fi fan, and I do enjoy some good Indie films, even if they are low budget. This film started off looking like it was going to be interesting. I definitely think they came up with a good movie idea. But about five minutes into it I totally lost interest.<br /><br />After about 5 minutes of narration setting up the plot, it jumps into a lot of action. The problem is that most of the characters are about the same height and weight and all wearing similar, if not identical, outfits. This combined with the complete lack of character development made it nearly impossible to tell what was going on. I had no idea who were the good guys and who were the bad guys.<br /><br />After the action died down a little I thought maybe the film would redeem itself, maybe let us get to know some characters a little bit. But this film was sheer disappointment. Out of about 100 minutes of film there was probably only 15 minutes of dialogue the rest was all kicking and punching.<br /><br />Anyone who rated this film a 10 either: <br /><br />a) Just wanted to see a bunch of kicking and punching. <br /><br />b) Worked on the production of this film.<br /><br />c) Thinks 10 is the lowest rating...
