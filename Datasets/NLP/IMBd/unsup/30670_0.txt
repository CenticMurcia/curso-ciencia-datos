I really liked this film. Kevin Costner and, for that matter, the whole cast was outstanding. Dennis Quaid was exceptional and surely deserved more recognition from the critics than he received. My objections to the film must be laid at the door of Kasdan...it could have been edited with a sharper hand. I under-stand the desire to expand the story to it's fullest but many minutes could have been cut during the manhunt at the railway station and the end scenes done in retrospect weren't necessary. More careful editing might have saved the day on a fine film.
