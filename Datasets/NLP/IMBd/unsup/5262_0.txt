This movie certainly lives out many of its expectations. Freddie Prinze does an excellent job as Blair and the boy with the so-called 'Force'. Saffron Burrows also does well as the commander of the fighters. I also like the fact that the movie is interpreted more like today's naval battleships and uses torpedos and gun fire as opposed to Lasers of most sci-fi movies. The 'Tigerclaw' also appears more like reality as a naval ship with the submarine 'look' of today's standards too.<br /><br />Another good thing would the constant action and lack of dead time this movie provides. As a viewer one does not have time to get bored. The special effects are not lacking either as it meets today's standards. But the score is wonderful, and as a fan of good movie scores this one is up their with the best.<br /><br />Don't listen to those critics who put this movie way down..this movie goes beyond all expectations. Remember its based on the book
