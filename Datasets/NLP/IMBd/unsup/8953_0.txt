This movie is the most utmost movie about a black man who becomes friends with this white family. The movie is very well planned out and thought of with a lot of creativity. If i had ten thumbs, i would give him ten thumbs up. This movie shows today how hard it is for black people to make friends with white people. In a way it is still hard but it's starting to progress slowly because there still is a little racism out there somewhere. James Earl Jones needs ten Grammies for this movie along with the cast. Now i have to go out and buy this movie on DVD hopefully if it's on there. I have watched this movie last Sunday it was so good that i thought i wasn't going to be able to go to church. But it went off though so i could go. thank you for letting me post my comment. Have a nice day
