What a breath of fresh air. I enjoyed Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events and this film's over-the-top storytelling reminded me of what I thought was lacking in that other film. There was much joy to be had. It really was a lot of fun and quite the breath of fresh air for children's movies since the slump between The Incredibles and now.<br /><br />The actors are perfectly cast. So often children can only distract from a movie with very few turning in believable performances. Not the case here.<br /><br />My only regret was the missed opportunity for the perfect tag-line...maybe they's take my idea for the DVD promotion...<br /><br />"You can't handle the tooth!"
