And that was funnier than any single moment on this show. I mean the nail came back and all but for like four months it was exposed. I wish this show would go he way of my original toenail -- thrown away in a dirty tube sock.<br /><br />This certainly can;t be considered funny by anyone -- can it? I mean it's like the kid in your 7th grade class who sings songs into his dad's tape recorder, then he brings them to school and he laughs while the rest of the class just sits there feeling pity and shame for hating someone so much, knowing he's trying to bring laughter to the world, but to spend so much time on something so inconsequential feels karmonically wrong.
