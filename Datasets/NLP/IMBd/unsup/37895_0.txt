The first two were good. Decent plot, cool fight scenes, and good acting(personally I like Treat Williams better)and was excited to find out a third was coming w/ Treat Willliams. This movie is pretty bad. The plot is ok, the acting is only ok. The fight scenes in the first two were imaginative, but these are only the usual. There are probably 5 mins that actually take place in the classroom. The makers must have realized it wasn't looking too good and decided to put in some pointless nudity. If you liked the other Subs give this one a try, but don't expect too much.
