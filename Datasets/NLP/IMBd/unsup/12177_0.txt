Inspiration, feelings, thoughts, emotion, life, tension, idealism, morality, activism, temptation, love, friendship... One of the best movies i've ever seen. I never read about it before, but after watching it yesterday night with a friend, i couldn't stop thinking about the whole plot, the ending, the dialogs, all the words and actions in the movie. And I watched it again just right now. I liked it a lot, i could feel everything: tension, anger, love, friendship, everything. Very few movies make you feel and think that way. There's no need to write about the plot, it must be discovered by you. It will make you think a lot and will touch you emotionally. Be clever, and enjoy the great cinema. The best movies aren't the one with the best images and less mistakes, but the movies which make you think and wake up your curiosity about things. Highly recommended!
