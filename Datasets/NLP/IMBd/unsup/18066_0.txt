Of all the movies that are so stupid that you just have to laugh at, DUMB AND DUMBER is by far the best. Anyone with a true sense of humor will love it as much as I did. Carrey and Daniels are perfect as lovable losers Lloyd and Harry and will have you laughing the entire time. They travel cross country to return a briefcase to dream girl Mary Swanson, and meet many interesting characters along their way. Some highlights are in the restaurant with Sea Bass, in the car with the hitchhiker, the guy at the phone booth, and when Lloyd finds out just how cold Harry's hands really are. A must see. Without a doubt, the funniest movie I have ever seen!
