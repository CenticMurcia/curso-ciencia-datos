I have to agree. What a really awful movie. This was just a poor ripoff at a time when poor ripoffs weren't as common as now.<br /><br />Sigh...<br /><br />The original Westworld takes a good concept and works well. The attempts to tie futureworld back to Westworld are poorly structured.<br /><br />Wooden performances abound, not just from the 'robots' either.<br /><br />Watch Westworld and skip the sequel.<br /><br />Another reasonable pick for an odd Yul Brenner movie is an odd post-apocalyptic knife fighter flick.<br /><br />Aardvaark
