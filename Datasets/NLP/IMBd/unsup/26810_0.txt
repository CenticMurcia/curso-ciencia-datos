I had never heard about this "documentary" before, so I saw it with an open mind.. So when the footage of the first flight around 31 of mars 1903 came, I thought; "Wow, is this for real, is what I was thought in school just bull"... Then I remembered that the documentary was made in 1995, and this I would have heard of... Anyway, it is a mindblower in a way, it makes ppl think how much you are influenced by these socalled serious documentaries..<br /><br />Allways remember that movies, news and documentaries are made in the eyes of it`s maker..
