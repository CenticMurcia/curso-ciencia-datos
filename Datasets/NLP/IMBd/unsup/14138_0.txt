With all deference to the comments of a previous reviewer (that Big Brother was a TV show, instead of one of the most influential novels of the 20th century), this movie is not about an all-knowing computer that runs every individual's personal life. In fact, the movie shows us that that granular level of control is not necessary. Colossus is a supercomputer designed for the defense of the country. The problem is that it is built so well, that it begins to make imaginative plans of its own. Shortly after activation, it discovers that another system, Guardian, has been built by the Soviets. In an effort toward scientific curiosity, the two countries allow for communication between the two systems. The systems combine and plot for the control of the planet. The plot leaves us, short story style, to imagine what takes place from here on. Several notable sci-fi buffs have suggested, and rightly so, that the story behind Colossus is eerily similar in concept to the story of Skynet in the Terminator series In fact, the story of the third movie would have been better served by following this script than the one used! This is a very underrated movie, asking many questions that are even more pertinent today.
