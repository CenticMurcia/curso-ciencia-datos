This show had low budget written all over it. Way too much overacting (especially with DynaGirl), along with the cheap sets, lame effects (even for the mid 1970s), and lame villains. I also couldn't stand the overuse of "Electra". I know catch phrases are important to a series like this, but come on! The ones I remember most are the spider woman and whoever made DynaGirl evil. These plots have been used in many superhero series. Come on Kroffts, can't you at least be semi-original? No wonder why this lasted only eight episodes. The theme song was kinda catchy, but the rest stunk. At least Deidre Hall had a career after this...
