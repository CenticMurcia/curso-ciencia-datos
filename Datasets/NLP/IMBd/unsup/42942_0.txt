It wasn't quite as bad as "2001 a Space Travesty", but almost. If it was supposed to be a black comedy, it failed. If it was supposed to be a serious drama, it failed. I didn't even know that they meant it to be a comedy until I watched the theatrical trailer on the DVD after the film. It wasn't funny, it wasn't touching, it wasn't much. It was a waste of 2 hours.<br /><br />
