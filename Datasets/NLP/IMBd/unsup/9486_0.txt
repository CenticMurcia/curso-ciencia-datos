With a suspenseful mood and tone of the film-Bad Guy shows us how brilliant Korean thrillers can be. At first, seeing that this film is on Sundance's ASIA EXTREME-I could've sworn it would be horror rather than a disturbing drama. I was wrong yet now glad that I did not turn down watching this film. Now to get to the plot: A very young woman is desperate for money, trying to recover from the aftermath of a random harassment by a stranger (known here as the 'bad guy') she is forced into prostitution by him mysteriously and watches, without being seen, her life face horrible changes. Throughout the film, all members of the audience despise this 'bad guy'-however, nearing the end of the film be is given a "I'm not that BAD of a GUY once you get to know me" feels. The quote is clich√© yet expressed in an original manner, representing many of the director's prolific talents.
