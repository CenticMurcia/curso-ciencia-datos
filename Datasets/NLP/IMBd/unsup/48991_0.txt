This film lost all appeal for me when I started laughing about five minutes into it. Was that really the New York city skyline being used as a French seaport in 1940? The World Trade Centers were even there! We rewound and yes, that was supposed to be a French seaport in 1940. The film was made in 1978, the Towers completed in 1976. Really, really, really big mistake. I guess the audience wasn't supposed to be intelligent enough to know the difference.<br /><br />And that announcers' voice! What was up with that? I know he was providing background information but it was just plain annoying. We bought this for $5 thinking it was a good Tom Selleck movie. My comment to my husband was actually "it's a Tom Selleck movie, it can't be all that bad". It was that bad and even worse. Although after seeing the New York city skyline as France, we turned it off after we stopped laughing.
