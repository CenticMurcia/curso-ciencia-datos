This is a really horrible movie, it's too bad, it's awful. It's a senseless combination of racist and sexist clich√©s, along with stupid touristic stereotypes and silly, dated puns (the jokes are so crude, so banal, that it's impossible even to have a good laugh) that can only disgust. I wonder why this film was a box office hit in Greece, where I live, since it is such a terrible, anachronistic insult to the country and its people. The direction is mediocre, the actors are worse and the plot is pure trash. It is so ridiculous, so irrelevant to the actual problems of this country, it is a movie that I'd rather forget. Nia Vardalos' "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" was a pleasant comedy, nothing special but at least there were some successful puns and originality. This film works on the same pattern without any imagination, without any respect to the viewer and, furthermore, it's very long and boring.
