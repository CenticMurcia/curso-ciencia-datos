A fairly good watch, Every seems rather realistic, The fact the movie looks as though seen through a crappy camera makes it seem life-like. I first watched this around 5 years ago at 11pm with the lights off and a storm outside, Scary no?, Thus making me lose 2 nights sleep...The ways the Aliens were conveyed were okay, and the "powers" they had were a tad far-fetched but still a great movie to watch alone and in the dark, the bad thing though is if you watch it for a second time all the scary moments just aren't there leaving you to sell it or watch as your friends are scared by it just to play small jokes on them for a day or two(worked with my brother, so meh). I highly suggest to rent this and not buy it as it loses its worth after one view through.
