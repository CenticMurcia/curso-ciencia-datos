I've been looking for a video of this film for many years. Mainly so I can give it as a gag gift to a buddy of mine that saw it with me back in 1973.<br /><br />The bad part was, it had been my idea to see this particular film. To me it has the potential of a good plot and even though there wasn't a big name cast, I really thought it would be okay.<br /><br />I can honestly say that there is not one single redeeming part of this film that would have me recommend it<br /><br />One line in the film is uttered by a man running through a swamp and falls. As he lays there he is looking at a frog sitting across from him and in his mind is saying, "Humans are not like frogs....." My verbal comment was, "Yeah, a frog wouldn't pay three dollars to come and see this stupid movie!" at which time we left. (my line got a better audience reaction than the whole film) Sorry, not something I can recommend.
