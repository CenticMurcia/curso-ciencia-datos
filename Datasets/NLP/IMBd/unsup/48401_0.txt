I am all for a sweet, funny, touching independent film about a band of dysfunctional, quirky characters interacting but I felt that Eulogy fell flat, was uninspiring, was over the top and worst of all, was just not believable.<br /><br />Someone dies. The whole family comes together as a result. Interactions and Hilarity and Drama ensue and the audience is supposed to be engrossed. This is nothing new and yet still had potential to be something great if the writing and acting and all the elements came together but they didn't and as a result, this movie was average at best.<br /><br />If someone told me that there was going to be a sequel about this family and their hijinks, I would not watch b/c I don't care and THAT is the problem. I didn't find the characters endearing or likable at all except maybe Katie played by Zooey Deschanel who was the token normal one of the bunch. In fact, at times it seemed as though she was in a different movie since she was so laid back and sane and the characters around her were so over the top and cartoonish. I just didn't find the family interaction or characters believable - it's like each character was his or her own caricature of what a true character should be only not.<br /><br />I wanted to get into this family and this movie. I wanted to care about these characters. I wanted to go on the journey with these characters as they rehashed the past and dealt with repressed demons BUT as I said above, I just didn't care one iota about them and I found the whole dynamic very manufactured. I was very aware at all times that these were actors trying to create a dynamic of a dysfunctional family. It just didn't work for me at all.<br /><br />4/10 since there were some funny moments albeit over the top just like the characters and the dialogue in this movie.<br /><br />Oh and be ready for some cheap jokes at lesbians' expense because apparently the movie is that sophisticated and smart (*snerk*) - many that can be see as offensive including the 10 year old mentality that girl + girl couple = hot lesbian action. Yes, it's that stupid.
