You can see the great ideas here that made the Seinfeld show a treasure. But this show has two huge problems. First, Larry David is awful as a performer. Second, they insist on an "improv" feel to the show. Folks--actors really aren't good at improv. So, the dialog is stilted and awkward, the pacing of the script is poor. The good ideas go to waste with no one to execute them. It would be nice if we took all these ideas and ressurected Seinfeld--then they'd have competent people actually doing the scripts and performing!
