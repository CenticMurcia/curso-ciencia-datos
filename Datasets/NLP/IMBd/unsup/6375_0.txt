Dracula verses Frankenstein is one of those so bad its good movies, a drive in movie.with a great cast;Lon Chaney Jr as a puppy loving murderer,j Carroll Nash as Dr Frankenstein.and Regina Carroll as the busty blonde heroine.and then there's a great extended cameo by Forrest j Ackerman(Dr. acula and to us horror fans uncle forry)OK i know a lot of critics hated this but its really an entertaining tribute to the universal Frankenstein movies,the monster looks like a brute with a face that resembles a raw steak,and Dracula looks like a hippie with fangs.also starring the great Russ tamblyn and Anthony eisley.with music from the universal monster films.troma picked up the DVD rights to this.it really is a scream.notably this was Lon Chaney Jr's last film as well as j Carroll Nash(both were in house of Frankenstein 1945) also in the cast is Jim Davis who later played jock Ewing on TVs Dallas. i remember first hearing about this in the great magazine famous monsters of filmland.8 out of 10,check it out.
