The problem with white boys in the red-light district in any city is that it is dangerous to these girls in more than one way. The really sad thing about this film (although all intentions was good but so naive) was that the girl of course was perceived as "hanging" out with a rich white guy who paid for her services, as girls do in the red light zone. This behavior spells MONEY in that neighborhood. And this guy Jordan Clark is so naive that he doesn't recognize the violence that is there. I get a feeling that he is somewhat superstitious in his way of looking at the world and this environment in particular. Probably religious in some way, because this is so typical with these people trying to impose there moral standards and be morally upset as they've done in Africa and elsewhere. (Spells disaster, just as much prostitution as anywhere else) So what happens after this well meaning young man has left? Well, the pimps controlling her and her neighborhood gets right to it. They "know" of course that a girl like that doing a film and all certainly got more money stashed away for herself from this deal with the tourist guy. So they get right to it, to get their share and that killed her of course. She's just another expendable commodity in that environment and nobody will ever ask for her. Make no mistake, those guys don't care one bitÂ…. And there are 1000's more where she came from. So all in all; this film actually tells you more about the western world and its way of dealing with things than exposes the red-light district called Bangkok. I think this guy should just stay at home in his own environment where he probably is less harmful. The real criminals in this episode are of course the Police in Thailand who protects these Pimps and make a good living out of it through corruption/protection and of course in the end the Politicians and the KING who is generally seen as some sort of God.<br /><br />WAKE UP TO REALITY !<br /><br />/Z
