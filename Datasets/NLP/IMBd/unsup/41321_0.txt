yes, worse than anaconda.<br /><br />consists of mostly pointless and usually very violent animations. revels in pointless grossouts -- not grossouts that have a point and humor, but for the sake of the grossout. same for the ubiquitous violence -- no point, no reason, no humor, just because animation can do it. i went with high hopes of good entertainment, but I didn't laugh once -- and I held out for almost an hour hoping.<br /><br />don't do it.
