The plotting in this film is beyond poor. How can the Enterprise drop the warp core yet still make it back in time to save Picard? Why does the ship need to fly over the collector to transport Picard back to safety? Why doesn't the holodeck simulate the collection after simulating the collection sequence? And the proliferation of hideous cliches ... the child running back into danger; the ram scoot (which was tired by the 40's); the fight sequence predictably ending in the stretching chair. The villains claim they don't want to co-inhabit the planet because "it would take ten years" to feel the effects, yet the Enterprise crew are significantly affected within hours! And I haven't even mentioned the joystick yet...
