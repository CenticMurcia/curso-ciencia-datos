Oh dear, what an extravaganza in over acting. The characters have a depth a puddle wouldn't envy, and the cringe factor was of the chart. There was no interaction between the characters other than the lines they had been given. The opening scene started with the FBI saying that the CI 5 boys were the best. When has the FBI ever said such a thing, I could only imagine their bravado shrinking into non-existence. I am not comparing this series to the old professionals as I don't think that is fair. My recollection of the old Pro's could be tainted with the passage of 25 years. However I fear that the great writing of Brian Clemens has been turned into a poor directorial debut of someone who should go back to children's programming. The chief then ended the scene with a pathetic excuse for a salute to George Cowley, well you might as well carry the unbelievably to the end. Don't waste your time if you want to be entertained.
