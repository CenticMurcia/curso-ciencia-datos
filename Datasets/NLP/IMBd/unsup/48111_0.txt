Seriously....I thought this movie was an utter waste of 2 1/2 hours of my life! The only reason why I stayed in the cinema to go through this pain of a movie was because I was out on a date! If you make a great movie like Lord of the Rings and let it go on for 3 hours, that's great. But if you make a crappy movie like this and it goes on for 2 1/2 hours, it annoys the hell out of viewers. It could've finished about 1 hour earlier but I thought it was painfully draggy! Unless you're a comic fan of this movie (if it was even based on a comic), stay away. I went in being optimistic of catching a horror movie but I burst out laughing when i saw the first supposedly 'scary' scene where the God of Death appears. You have been warned!
