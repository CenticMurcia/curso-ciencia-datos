I agree with the reviewer that this "felt" like the Royal Tans or Running w/Scissors, both of which are acquired tastes in my opinion. Top shelf stars, no doubt. Interesting sets and an obviously expensive budget. It was meant to be intriguing but wasn't. I developed no interest in any of the characters or their predicaments and like the reviewer above, I felt nothing but disgust for most of the them. It didn't leave me looking forward to the next episode so, if it was immediately canceled, I would not take notice. That's truly sad to say of an act with such notable stars. This show has much to do if it is to gain my interest...so, in one sense, it has only one way to go but up and that's better than having crashed on take-off. On the merit of the stars' past performances, I'll give the show a few more chances.
