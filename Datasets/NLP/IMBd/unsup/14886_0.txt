This movie is so bad it's almost funny. The characters and plot were never fully developed, which left me wondering what, exactly, the movie was supposed to be about. If it truly was supposed to be a love story, it has to go down as one of the worst love stories ever written. Angelina Jolie's acting was so bad it was almost hilarious at times. Try to keep your composure after about the 10th shot of her staring at him with that sad, pouty face and lips that look like they're about to explode collagen everywhere. You can only fault her to a certain degree, however. Whoever wrote this thing gave her very little to work with. The dialogue was trite, cliche, just downright awful. The dialogue and story line was so predictable that my wife and I started saying the lines even before the characters said them. That's how bad this movie is. I do think the positive side of this movie is that it can be held up in any decent film school as an example of "How to NOT Make a Movie."
