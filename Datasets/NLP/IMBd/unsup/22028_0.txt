Terrible movie. I don't know who Betsy Morris is, but she did a terrible job with the script. The dialogs that should be spoken by young people today sound like my grandmother wrote them after reading a girl magazine. The acting doesn't help much, because the characters are so badly stereotyped that the actors must've felt quite stupid. Jensen Ackles is SO wasted in this movie. I don't mind that he was supposed to play something else than Dean, but his character got the stereotype thing the worst I'd say. I didn't notice directing and music much so they were probably just as mediocre as everything else. What else is there to like about a movie? A plot maybe. OK, this movie doesn't have one. There are a few story lines that somehow concern all those people working in a diner, but they're just as clichéd and stereotyped as the characters themselves. What the pluck was it about? The end was just as bad as the beginning and all the stuff in between. The few "twists" I expected since the beginning, I just didn't believe the script was really so dumb that it would actually go for ALL these cliché. 4 stars for the fact Jensen Ackles was there, for the cute blonde girl...you know what? I'll make it 3. There's nothing positive about this movie except two actors. (JA counts as 2 stars.)<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this unless you had your brain lobotomized.
