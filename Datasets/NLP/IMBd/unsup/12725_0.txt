Personally, I rented this movie because Russell Crowe starred in it before he got huge. That fact was the only thing that saved this movie. Granted, it was a good story and the casting was wonderful, however, at the end of a movie, one is not supposed to be left with questions. What were their last names? What grade did she teach? What was it he did? What city were they in? Basic questions should be answered in the beginning. I can see asking yourself at the end, "Why did their relationship turn the way it did?" Of course, you should almost have an answer for that too. Film makers definitely do not want to leave you with the question, "Why did I rent this movie?" but this movie would achieve that if it hadn't been for the young, mostly shirtless, incredible actor, Russell Crowe.
