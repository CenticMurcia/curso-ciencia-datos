Everyones going to say it and I'm no different. Shark Tale/Finding Nemo rip-off!<br /><br />The start is Finding Nemo, right down to the parent being caught.<br /><br />Pi is sent off to find his Aunt on The Reef. On the journey Pi grows up in less than 5 seconds and is told by Aunt Pearl they never go to Flat Bottom so you know he IS going to go there. And to stay off the Haunted Pirate Shipwreck. And sure enough they go to both forbidden places within less than 5 minutes of being told not to.<br /><br />Odd that.<br /><br />I do question how a fish knows the names of Star constellations?<br /><br />Anyway, Pi gets bullied and beaten up by a Shark who likes the girl/fish he loves, goes on a journey of self discovery until all his friends help him defeat the bad shark. Exceptionally DULL and predictable.<br /><br />He gets the girl. No shock there.<br /><br />This is Really Boring and awful, nothing happens and its tedious to watch as it takes SO much time to get anywhere at all.<br /><br />Leave it until its in the DVD bargain bin which won't be long.
