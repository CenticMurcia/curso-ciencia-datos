It is a terrible bad film, do not waste your time to disturb you with it. It is without any story, very bad music. At the half of the film I left it, which occurred only second time in my life. The film suggests that the medical doctors are not able to treat any patient and that paramedical therapies are much more useful. It is declared for instance that a patient who would need a liver transplantation could be healed by sex therapy given by Johanna. I can not imagine what could be in the brain of the director. The pictures are also depressing, the whole film is very unpleasant and misses any taste and good human feeling. As a medical doctor I am especially upset with the content of this film.
