Here we go with another instantly forgettable direct-to-video romp. The story - or what they call the story - is just insulting. Perhaps that's not saying a lot for the territory, but this one hurt to sit through. Don't believe me? Watch it. It doesn't make once bit of sense. Now, okay, I know what you're thinking. It's not like we tune into T&A flicks for the stories so what about the naughty bits.<br /><br />I found them disappointing because they were just more of the same found in any number of other T&A duds. Filmed in the usual predictable style against the same 'ol backdrop. Nothing new, no style, no atmosphere. As for Tweed herself, she doesn't even star no matter what the movie box tells you. She only gets naked once and when she finally does drop the dress it's far from mind blowing. Some T&A flicks surprise you, some don't and just deliver the goods. This did neither. Pass.
