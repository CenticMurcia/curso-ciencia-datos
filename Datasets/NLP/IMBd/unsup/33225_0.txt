First of all, I can't stand the show Pokemon,and I am sorry to say, this film was no improvement whatsoever. First of all, there is this pointless cartoon, that made me go to sleep. Then when the main actually started, what we eventually got was... Awful animation, honestly if you want excellent Japanese animes, see a Studio Ghibli like Princess Mononoke, Cat Returns or Spirited Away instead. They are vastly superior to this. An utterly predictable and boring plot that did absolutely nothing for the film. The pace was inexcusably slow, the film dragged so much, it really did. The voice acting was pretty atrocious to say the least.The only voice actor I liked was the voice actor of MewTwo, but compared to other villains, he is pretty lousy. I will admit though, Mew is really cute. Team rocket i found very annoying, and the ending I didn't like either. All in all, a boring and dull film, that is one of the worst animations I've seen.Sorry, but this is a 1/10. Bethany Cox
