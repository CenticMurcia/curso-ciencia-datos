***POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />This short is the story of a young man and a young woman who go around the 1962 Seattle World's fair and look at things. They're all smiles and excited as the audience gets bored. In the orient exhibit, the young man pulls the woman in a rickshaw. After a while, they come to the AT&T pavilion and look at what ma bell has been working on. They have a race between two phones, one of which is rotary and the other a keypad. Then they show the first ever pagers, which are considerably larger and more limited than today's models.<br /><br />All in all, this short tries to excite the viewer into the future of phone service, but sadly, it just ends up boring the viewer.
