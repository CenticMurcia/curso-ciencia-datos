The movie is excellent, it's a pure reality! What's more, i think that these a******s from RTS ( Serbian TV and radio broadcast ( controled by Milosevic )) didn't even knew that they were digging the grave for themselves when they have invested the money in the movie! I want to say that "The Wounds" are the best movie recorded in Yugoslavia last year, and that everything in it is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God!
