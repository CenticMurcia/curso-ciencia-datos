I gave this movie 9 stars out of Ten, only because the story line resembles other flicks like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Timber Falls. I went and seen this at a theater when they they had the After Dark Horrorfest playing, and I was really impressed. I went into it thinking that its gonna be a cheesy gore-fest, but it proved me wrong. I mean it had some bloody and violent parts, but it actually is a decent flick. The acting was decent, especially for the fact that the actors weren't really known. When three sisters Kelsey Crane, Kelsey Weeden(Detour) and Tara Gerard inherit some property deep in the country, they and a group of their friends Alex A. Quinn, Malea Richardson, Vanessa Viola and Jim Devotti decide to take a weekend off and check it out. They end up finding a beautiful camping ground and a huge lake and think that it is going to be a weekend that none of them are ever going to forget, until they encounter a family of psychos living on the property. This movie is intense and brutal, so I definitely recommend this flick to everyone.
