I loved the ended of this movie. <br /><br />Beatrice Lilly had such a screen presence, her eyes seem to jump off the screen. It's easy to see why Rudolph Valentino had a romantic interest in her. It's a shame she only made 8 movies in her career. TCM said that it was because movie making lacked the audience interaction she so much loved. And didn't care to make movies with out knowing instantly how the audience was reacting.<br /><br />Sure the ended may have shocked some audience goers and it wasn't what they wanted but, I kinda liked that. It was in the times with today to have twist and turns in the plot.<br /><br />The updated musical score probably adds more to this movie than we'll ever know without hearing the original. It was simply suburb!!<br /><br />I would imagine with a few edits and very little re-write this movie would have moderate success today.
