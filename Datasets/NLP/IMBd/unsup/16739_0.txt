Matt Groening will forever be known as the creator of "The Simpsons". It is a pity that he will be remembered for the second-best thing he ever did. "The Simpsons" has been endured for nearly two decades yet in all those episodes, you would be hard-pressed to find an equivalent number of memorable episodes as the far superior "Futurama" managed in its five seasons of existence. "Futurama" generally has much superior story lines, the characters are far more quirky and enjoyable, the humour is way better, the animation is way better and the writing was most importantly much more consistent. Overall, Matt Groening achieved far more enjoyable television entertainment with "Futurama" than he has with "The Simpsons", yet the better show was cancelled. Go figure.
