The story is so bizarre but it is all true. Mary Tyler Moore deserves an Emmy nomination for her performance as the criminal mastermind, Sante Kimes. She really makes you forget her days on the Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke shows altogether playing this incestuous control freak. She was true to her character as awful as she was. The real story behind it is such a tragedy. Poor Irene Silverman and other victims who was so suspicious and caught on to their act only to get murdered and discarded like garbage. It is such a shame that they never found her body and probably never will at this point. But what gall is that they filmed this in Australia. Come on, US can't be that expensive. The film is awful but true to the story. I have read several books on the case so you can't say it wasn't made up when it indeed happened.
