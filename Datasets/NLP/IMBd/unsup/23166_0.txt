I didn't have great expectations for this movie as the cover is cheesy and the back cover summary was uninspiring. However a friend talked me into seeing it and I haven't taken reccomendations from her since. The movie was terrible. The acting was bad - especially the lead role(Todd). The character was without personality. The Indian characters were much to stereotypical and exaggerated, which made the setting completely unbelievable. You never had the feeling of being in India, but just of being in a bad Hollywood clich√©. The plot was thin and all the problems were enormously unoriginal (man is sceptical towards new developments in his life (moving to India), but changes his opinion). The love story is without emotion or nerve, the crises in the story are few and uninteresting and the jokes are corny and unfunny. So; if you wanna see a really bad movie - this is a great choice.
