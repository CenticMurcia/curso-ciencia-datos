I don't speak Norwegian..not a single word...but I didn't read half the subtitles of this movie, I was so engrossed in the visuals. When I watched it again, I read the subtitles...and realized that I had understood the entire thing despite the lack of paying attention to language. That said...this movie was stunning. It was quite long, and there were a few bits that dragged a bit, but the good made up for the not-as-good ten times. The photography of the Norwegian landscape is astounding, and the acting is subtle and completely believable. The dialog is more sparse than most movies that I've seen, but adding a single word more would become verbose. This is the story of a young woman in medieval Europe who rebells against what she is expected to do and lives to get what she wants, and deals with the consequences which run deep. (The church-burning scene had me in tears)
