This show is a piece of trash,I hate it when people try to tell you what to do and how you live your life.It is cloths people,wear what you want.If you like it and it fells good than power to you.Yes,there is some place where you have dress codes.There should be no rules in they why you present your self,express yourself they way you like.The one thing I hate is that women Stacy,she seams to be very uptight and make very rude comments.So,what if the cloths do not fit her shape.if the girl like it than power to her.Clinton is OK but some times he kind of sounds to posh and act like he is the cream Dee la cream.The other thing is that some of the cloths are far too darn expensive.No one is going to buy a skirt that cost a person $500 dollars.no one can afford it.A person beauty is in the inside , not because she wears the latest designer cloths.At the end of the day beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Sorry but Stacy and Clinton get faces out of TV.We need to except people for who they are and what they like.<br /><br />oh bye the way Stacy Goth is not something that you can leave out of high school.There are allot of Goths who have good jobs and live their life.
