Many words come to mind when describing this film but, unfortunately, `funny' isn't one of them. Even though the cast is great and the potential is obviously there, the screenplay is overall tame and uninspired. Count Vladimir Dracula (George Hamilton with a sleazy accent) is forced to leave his Transylvanian castle and ships for New York. Along with his loyal slave Renfield, he tracks down the girl of his dreams, Cindy. Her boyfriend slash schrink happens to be an ancestor of Dracula's old nemesis Van Helsing. The few successful jokes in this lame spoof are limited to a couple of classic references and a goofy portrayal of Arte Johnson as Renfield. He constantly eats insects and his laugh is unvarnished but that's about it. The attempt to give a disco swing to Dracula's personality is embarrassing. The scenery and settings look way too cheap (not even charmingly cheap) and inexperienced director Dragoti clearly can't handle the material. It looks like the actors had a lot of fun while shooting this filmtoo bad they can't convey it to the audience. Good horror spoofs are very rare and hard to make. For a minute, I actually hoped this could be a reasonable effort but I was wrong. Better luck next time.
