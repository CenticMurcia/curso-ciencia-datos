"Mask" is so realistic, touching and true that there are no words to describe it. It's as if someone simply took a camera and filmed a slice of life. Yet incredibly, the film avoids the "feel" of a documentary. Also incredibly, the film somehow avoids making Rocky Dennis' deformity the central theme, and shows how someone with a severe and disfiguring disability can live very much of a normal life, given a good attitude and some positive hopes and dreams.<br /><br />Acting performances are incredible all around, but for one exception: Laura Dern. How and why she's still acting is beyond me. Both Cher and Eric Stoltz turn in absolutely incredible performances, especially Cher. Generally I dislike her in movies, but this one was the exception.<br /><br />If you haven't seen "Mask" and you enjoy movies about the good and the bad in everyday life (e.g. "Ordinary People"), "Mask" comes highly recommended. 9/10.
