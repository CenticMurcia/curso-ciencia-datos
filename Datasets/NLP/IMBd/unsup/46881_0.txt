Micheal Moore hates America as this movie likes to call itself is a mockumentary on the documentary "Bowling for Colombine" by Micheal Moore. If you are going to make a critique about somebody's waffle, by making another waffle. Please make a waffle that isn't so bland and utterly boring. I don't care much what ingredients Micheal Moore uses in his waffles, as long as it isn't the same ingredients used in this waffle right here. <br /><br />Come on, I watch movies to be entertained, not to hear some dude tell me how wrong a movie is for being entertaining. And with that said and told, I don't believe for one single second that Micheal Moore hates America so much as the producer of this movie wants him to.
