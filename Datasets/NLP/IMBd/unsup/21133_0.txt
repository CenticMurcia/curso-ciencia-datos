I just watched this movie and it wasn't worth the time. Admittedly the idea behind it is somehow creepy, but the actors (and most of all the actresses) did an unconvincing job. The dialogs were stiff and sometimes the story wasn't really conclusive. Besides that one gotta have a sick mind to get a kick out of snuff you gotta be truly patient to watch this movie straight from the beginning to the end. The cuts were a la mode - sometimes they reminded me of some of those FBI TV series, but they didn't help building up tension. Considering the fact this was the first appearance of Douglas A. Raine as director, there's still a chance of improvement. If you're looking for a movie that deals with the snuff topic, you better watch "8mm" but don't waste your time with "From a place of darkness".
