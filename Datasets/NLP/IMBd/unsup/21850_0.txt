Everybody knows that Dracula is just a character, nothing real. Just the same, this film is pure fiction. First of all, it is not a war-zone, there are no peace-keeping forces stationed in the country. It looks more like Afganistan than Romania. Horrifying image.. Secondly, we do have roads, security cameras where the traffic is intense, internet, cable TV, cars.. like in which junkyard did they find those heaps? Besides, people here are not scared of vampires.. they are part of our folklore therefore people are not easily frightened. and providing that there was a real vampire called Dracula and he came to Romania as the one in the film did, he would have been dead long ago :) No more comments
