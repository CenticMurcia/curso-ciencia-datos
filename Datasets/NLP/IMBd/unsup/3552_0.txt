This movie made me question my own sincerity of faith.<br /><br />One can only pray that the Lord will provide special graces to anyone who ever faces that level of persecution. In, and of myself, I would never be able to withstand such mistreatment.<br /><br />I look at how coddled and spoiled I am socially as a professing Christian in the USA, and have to really wonder how much I would truly be able to withstand under such harsh situations.<br /><br />I have heard Nora Lam's testimony, and I can hardly imagine what it would be like to have to stand firm under any "real" persecution.<br /><br />Just to think that such things even still go on today around the world, is a painful reality.
