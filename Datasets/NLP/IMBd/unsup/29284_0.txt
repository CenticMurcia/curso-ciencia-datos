I thought this film was very well executed. It was hilarious from beginning to end, despite some of the bad acting by a few of the actors. It was an original concept and very good fit for a comedy. The two bums had me in stitches and the scene with Sommore and the two bums was classic. And if you wanna see some the HOTTEST Black and Latina models that you have ever seen then you definitely want this film. Also the comedian that plays the sidekick is hilarious! Iv'e seen him on Comic View on BET several times and he does a good job in this film too. Whatever the actors lack in this film, all the comedians definitely make up for it. I also thought it was well written and well directed, despite the shortcomings of a low budget urban film. I could see this film as a big box office hit with a more experienced cast of actors. But I really enjoyed this film nonetheless. This one stays in my collection.
