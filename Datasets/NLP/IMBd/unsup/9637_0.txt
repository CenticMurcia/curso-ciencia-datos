Very enjoyable. This is a very good Western. This movie is a must see for fans of the genre or of Robert Mitchum. I was never able to find this movie on video let alone DVD. My favorite aspect of the movie is the little boy who trails Robert Mitchum throughout the movie. I believe that the movie would have been even better if this relationship had been emphasized more. This is especially true when you consider the climax of the movie which is left a little wanting because of this lack of relationship. Nevertheless, I was still moved at the end. What a cute kid! Wise and unusual choice for Hollywood to pick a Mexican child actor for the part.
