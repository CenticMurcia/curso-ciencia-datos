When I saw Fangoria listed on the cover of this DVD, I thought for sure it would be interesting and fun to watch. I'm a big horror fan. It's my favorite genre and I can easily find entertainment value in most horror flicks -- even if they are truly bad, they're usually good for a laugh or two...<br /><br />NOT this one. I watched the first 30 minutes with genuine interest and curiosity, wondering what was going to happen next, and even thinking that this movie was promising, very different from most that I have seen. Soon after, the substandard acting and repetitive dialogue pushed me far past boring to extremely annoyed. Obviously the writers thought the audience's interest would be piqued, judging by Max's constant comments to the effect of, "I know you're wondering," "You must want to see," "I'll bet you want to know..." By the end of the film I honestly couldn't care less what happened and I just wanted it to be over. The bad acting completely obliterated the integrity of the characters and the storyline and I couldn't break past it to believe in it anymore... I couldn't see the characters anymore, just a bunch of really bad actors.<br /><br />My opinion clearly differs with the majority of people who have commented so far, but I have to note it's very rare that I don't like a film. I am NOT one of the people who nitpick a movie to death and complain about every other movie that's released. Nine out of ten movies I see have true merit, whether it's in the writing, the acting, the cinematography, the styling, etc. As hard as I tried, I couldn't find any in this one. A complete waste of time and rental fees. Four thumbs down from these two very disappointed viewers...
