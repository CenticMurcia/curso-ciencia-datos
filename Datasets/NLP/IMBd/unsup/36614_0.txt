This was a fun film to see on TV reruns in the early 1980s, and to see it now would be fun simply to remind me of when I was a kid. <br /><br />GREAT train scenes. The computer in the railroad offices that runs the whole railroad is as big as the room, yet today, a laptop could probably run the railroad.<br /><br />It is quite filled with technical errors and the like, plus cheesy acting + dialog, but these things can be ignored. It is refreshing to see William Shatner as "NOT" Capt. Kirk or the Priceline guy.<br /><br />See it.....if you can locate a copy. It's terrible, but you just might enjoy it. I did. I have given it a 3 out of 10, because it's a bad movie. But that does NOT mean that I don't recommend it....I do recommend it.<br /><br />But to give it more than a "3", would be kidding you. <br /><br />Find it, rent it/buy it/borrow it, and enjoy.
