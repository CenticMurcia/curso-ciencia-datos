Wow! A great movie. Well, at least sometimes.<br /><br />A great start, nice playing and a (nearly) foreseeable ending.<br /><br />But the story is good though, so give it a try. It is really difficult to comment on this movie. I just had all the time a feeling of foreseeing everything but it wasnÂ´t boring.<br /><br />You really have to see this one.<br /><br />7 out of 10 points (alternatively: 3 out of 4).
