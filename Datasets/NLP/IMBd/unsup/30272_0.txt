Very entertaining and affecting story of women's struggle for the vote. Rather than the period-piece drama one would get on a BBC show about the movement, this portrays very modern, very impassioned women. The director is determined to avoid any hint of stuffiness, and at times the gimmicky camera work seems there not to further the story but just to make sure this works for the MTV generation, but the result is a dynamic and entertaining movie. I've never heard much of anything about the women's suffrage movement and it is interesting to see how it played out and to learn a little about the movie's impassioned heroine Alice Paul and her struggle both with the patriarchy and with the more cautious suffragettes. She seems to have been a fascinating woman, and judging from her photographs, almost as cute as Hillary Swank.
