This no doubtedly is the best miniseries ever made for television. Yes, it was 11 hours plus long, but it is certainly worth it. From episode to episode, you feel closer and closer attached to each of the characters and their feelings and passion for power and lust. Never before have I seen such a well-orchestrated soap opera as this, displaying the history of the 1st century- going through the Julian Dynasty. Heck, if it wasn't for the intense nudity of the series, I would recommend this to every classroom across the globe. <br /><br /> The characters of I, Claudius are unforgetable. Brian Blessed (Gladiator) as Augustus did a wonderful job and you'll really admire his efforts as the portrayal of Rome's first emperor. Another notable performance is from John Hurt as Caligula, who lit up the screen with his psycho fantasies, and unpredictable hatred towards others. Lastly, the glory and all the credit goes to Derek Jacobi (Gladiator), who turned a risky and grueling role into a soft symphony, despite the mental retardation inflicted on the character of Claudius. I bet no actor would've done a better job than Jacobi, so hats off to him. Overall, this movie is about 99% accurate to the real thing so you cannot get any better than that folks.<br /><br />Gladiator? Fall of the Roman Empire? Spartacus? Caligula?<br /><br /> None of these movies match up to this miniseries- which is not afraid to tell the facts of the first five emperors; Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. Don't even think about passing this one on- this is a must see and who cares if it takes 11 hours of your time- it's just like any other TV show on a DVD pack, but better.
