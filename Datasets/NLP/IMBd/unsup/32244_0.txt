Nothing to say but avoid. This has to be one of the worst, if not THE worst, movies I have ever seen. It is boring, predictable and just plain stupid. It is unintentionally more funny than scary and obviously the makers of this pathetic waste of film thought we'd all enjoy a typical, yet much more awful, teen slasher flick. What do they take us for? I'm surprised this movie even made it on to DVD. There are so many more enjoyable movies than this out there, please don't waste your time on this, you'll regret it afterwards. Not even my 8 year old sister was scared of this movie and by the end we were all just laughing at how physically painful this movie was in terms of horror, suspense, and overall, a decent plot.
