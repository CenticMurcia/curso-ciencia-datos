The idea of the film is great. Mixing the creation of a movie and his viewing. It's done in a very ambitious way, incredibly sophisticated and elegant when we know the budget who was assigned to the movie.<br /><br />A lot of scenes are incredible, specially the one who shows the contamination of the priest, adding a reflection on the condition of the black man.
