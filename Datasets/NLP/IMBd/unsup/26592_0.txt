This is obviously a tongue in cheek scary movie, with lots of little jabs of humor at all walks of life. It plays few favorites, except perhaps favoring blondes, but it doesn't take itself serious enough to be a propaganda movie.<br /><br />It starts with a bit that comes into play later. Characters disappear and then reappear at the end. Meanwhile, the main characters are fairly enjoyable and amusing. So are the minor characters.<br /><br />A bordello of bloodsucking meanies finds victims from the town. A private investigator and a Jimmy Baker type evangelist lead the way into fighting them.<br /><br />It is mostly disjointed, and has some trivial chuckles, but no guffaws. It comes up a bit short, but everyone tries in this movie, and the performances are grand, which provides most of the chuckles.
