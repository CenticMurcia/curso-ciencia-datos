The Secret Service Agent Alex McGregor (Daryl Hannah) is in charge of the security of President Jonathan Hayes (Gregory Harrison), who is facing problems with a powerful group represented by his vice-president (Ken Camroux) and the entrepreneur and Senator Jack 'J.P.' Hunter (Tom Butler) that helped him to win the elections. Alex's fianc√© Grant Coleman (Doug Savant) is a close friend of the president, after saving the life of his daughter Jessica, and he intends to propose Alex. The conspirators leaded by Hunter decide to eliminate President Hayes while in Seattle to inaugurate the cable wire transportation Skytran, and they hire the professional and seductive killer Nina Stahl (Ona Grauer) and her brother and hacker Evan Stahl (Aaron Grain). With part of the Secret Service compromised and serving to the purposes of the Vice-President, Alex faces difficulties to protect the president.<br /><br />"First Target" is a surprisingly solid thriller made for television that overcame my best expectations. The beginning is exaggerated, with the drill of the agents, but the screenplay develops the characters very well. The gorgeous Daryl Hannah seems to be tailored for this role and has a great performance. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Alvo Principal" ("The Main Target")
