"I'm trying to hold a family together..." speaks Cherry Jones as Julia to her husband, Robert Knott, who plays the part of Will, in this compelling story of a waterman's family on Chesapeake Bay's Eastern Shore. Excellent performances from both actors, as well as from Tara Gallagher, Mike Mosley, Sarah Paulson, and Sean Hatosy in supporting roles. Financial pressures and strains from Will's drinking issues take the family to the breaking point and everyone is affected by the struggle. Doug Sadler's movie, brilliantly scripted, is a winner on all accounts and holds a mirror to reflect what is common in so many people's lives. Yes, that can be uncomfortable at times, but it is real and jarring in it's truths. Sadler manages to provide just enough levity through the film to keep us hopeful that everyone will pull through somehow. If you are looking for special effects, violence, gratuitous sex and nudity, this is not the film to see, but if you want a good story, well told and beautifully filmed, this is it and worth watching more than once.
