The charming con men featured in this film have found that the easiest way to make money is to part fools from it. It's so easy, in fact, it's like shooting fish in a barrel--hence the movie's name. Excellent acting and quirky characterization make this flick really fun to watch. Dialogue is sharp and witty, with some truly memorable lines.
