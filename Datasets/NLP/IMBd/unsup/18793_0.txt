This movie continues the tradition of Clint Eastwood making great movies. The Enforcer is not the best of the Dirty Harry films, but it isn't the worst of them either. (The Dead Pool is). Don't get me wrong, they are all great flicks and I enjoy all of them but there is a best to worst order to these movies. The Enforcer is filled with Harry's dry humor and tough talking dialogue. 1976 San Francisco is filmed beautifully and provides a great background as in all the Dirty Harrys. The music is suitably funky. A bit dated, but funky. Tyne Daly does a good job as Harry's spunky new partner. Tyne Daly wasn't bad lookin' in 1976 either. I'm sure Tyne misses those days. Bottom Line: Must have this movie to complete the Dirty Harry collection. It's a good tough-cop movie on it's own but I suggest getting all these films. Get the box set on DVD.
