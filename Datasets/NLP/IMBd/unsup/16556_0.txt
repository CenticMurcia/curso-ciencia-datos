I was expecting a real puff piece and it was actually not too horrible.<br /><br />It did not gloss over the fact that Linda Eastman was, no polite way of putting it, a groupie in the mid-60s. It didn't try to smooth that over and say she just "dated" guys like Mick Jagger and Jim Morrison -- it came right out and admitted, she went to bed with them.<br /><br />It did not attempt to pretend she had great musical talent. She admitted she was "just an amateur up there," but Paul didn't care, he wanted her up there anyway.<br /><br />FWIW, I am a big, BIG John Lennon fan, and I don't think he was really depicted all that inaccurately in the film. He was always blunt and outspoken, and by his own admission got very nasty with Paul during the course of the band's breakup. Yoko DID cause problems in the studio by saying things very similar to the script. <br /><br />The movie did include the scene at the Dakota, apparently set in 1979 or so (shortly before Paul's pot bust in Japan) which depicted that John and Paul had made up most of their differences. When Lennon was killed, J&P were on semi-decent terms -- they hadn't talked for a while, but not because of any big feud.<br /><br />One big problem, of course, was that very little actual Beatles (or even Wings) music could be used in the movie, undoubtedly due to legal clearance issues.<br /><br />The Allen Klein references were hilarious. "Bruce 'Gross'-Man." LMAO. If anything, Allen Klein managed to do what nobody else could -- reunite the Beatles, since by about the mid-1970s, Klein had screwed over Ringo, George and John too, and they were all suing him too.<br /><br />If the Beatles never got back together to play music, they certainly agreed that Allen Klein was a MF-SOB. In interviews just before his death, Lennon said he "couldn't even talk about" things like the band's breakup "because it is still in court." I don't think the Allen Klein mess was finally solved until the 1990s. He'll probably track us all down and sue us now. :-O
