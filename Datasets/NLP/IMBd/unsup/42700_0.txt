Why this is considered such a Disney classic is far beyond me. It's is so boring. It is not mature enough for adults and it is either too boring or way too scary for little children. Their is no plot, so someone with a short attention span like me will be in pain watching this. The only part that little kids would really like is the part with Mickey Mouse as the Soucerer's apprentice. Though i am really not getting the whole broomsticks with arms thing. Aside from hat there was one cute part, which was the dancing hippos and the alligators. That part is far more enjoyable than the Mickey Mouse section. But overall i just a a brief summary of this film. and that is that it was long boring pointless and STUPID STUPIDS STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID!!!!
