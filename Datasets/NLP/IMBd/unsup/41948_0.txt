Even while trying to recover an extremely poor script with above average actors, this movie is a bomb. What started out as enticing, quickly became boring and relatively unbelievable. James Marsden (X-Men, Sugar and Spice) is a high school student who is forced to transfer to a new school in a small town after living the big city life in Chicago. Shortly after arrival, he learns of a community plot to surgically brain wash all the teens into perfection. After deciding to be the hero, he is overshadowed by a moronic janitor played by William Sadler (Project X, Demon Knight, Shawshank Redemption) who saves the day with an El Camino filled with high pitch whistling rat traps. With numerous plot holes and unexplained story lines, this movie is not much above a quick cure for insomnia.
