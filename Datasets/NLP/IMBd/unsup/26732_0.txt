One of my favorite shows. I started watching Popular and I felt myself being sucked in by the powerful emotions encountered in this show. The acting is believable, but one thing I found about this show is that it is somewhat exaggerated. I don't know how high schools are now, but I still think that some of the themes explored are slightly misleading, and stereotypical. Nevertheless, a good show, capturing the heart of the confusing whirl of emotions in the high school experience, and I would recommend this show to anyone open minded. Mind you, the first time you watch this show, you will be confused, but give it a few episodes, then you will agree with me. It is very different from other shows that I have watched.
