I find it hard to understand how a horror movie could be equated with a bunch of frogs. Frogs aren't scary. They don't have teeth or claws. What's the worst they could do? Croak all night and hop around all over the place. How could this make for a good horror movie? I would say this director lacked any sense of horror. I could have made a better movie than this and I'm not even a director. Check out "Food of the Gods". Now THAT is scary. It's full of giant mosquitos, giant rats, giant worms and snakes, even a giant chicken,all of which could mangle a human being. But FROGS? A pitiful subject for a horror movie. (this line added simply to fill in enough space so my comments would post. When are they going to change this stupid requirement?)
