This is a good attempt to show some of the symptoms and family issues which occur when a member develops the illness. A very good movie considering that it was made for television. This film is better than most of the stuff shown on lifetime movie network. Not a great film but one worth watching. Some useful information can be learned from it. I believe the progression of the illness, when it occurred and the effect is had on her family was fairly accurate. It seems as though some critic expect this film to be on the level of " A Beautiful Mind". That just is not realistic. The film was made years ago and for much less money. Yes it is a shame that money has such an effect on film production but it does. I disagree with other reviewers who are too hard on the film. Considering the "Made for TV" budget constraints on actors, script and direction I think the total package is good.
