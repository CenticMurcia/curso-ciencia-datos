Could you make a worse tv movie? You could, but it wouldn't get on your nerves like this one. Holly Hunter plays possibly the most annoying character I've ever had the opportunity see. The only thing that makes this movie watchable is the very small appearance by Andy Richter from the Conan O'Brien show. Who cares if this is a true story, I feel cheated for the 2 hours I spent watching this film.
