I saw this film when it came out in the theater 23 years ago and I'm still mad about the $4.50 I paid and the precious 83 minutes of my life that I will never get back. If I remember correctly, after watching it the MST3K group said that it was worse than any other movie they had ever seen except for "The Castle of Fu Manchu" and that is was AS BAD AS that movie. If it were possible I would devote my life to creating a time machine just so I could go back in time and do whatever it took, including assassination, to ensure that this movie never got made. I'm amazed that it did not hit the 100 worst movies list, I can only assume that it's not there because not enough people have seen it and endured its awfulness. There are some bad movies that are entertaining in their badness, there are some bad movies that I have enjoyed watching just to laugh at them. This is not one of them, this is just plain bad from beginning to end.
