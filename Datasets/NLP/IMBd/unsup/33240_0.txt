This was one of the SciFi channels better offerings (although that isn't saying much). However, any resemblance between this movie and the mythology of the Minotaur is purely coincidental. The size of Athens's yearly tribute is wrong. The size of Athens is wrong. The hero's name is wrong (Theseus, not Theo). The gal who helped Theseus was Ariadne, daughter of King Minos and not sister to the high priest. Ariadne gave Theseus a sword to kill the Minotaur and ball of string to mark his way out of the labyrinth. None of Thesus's companions were killed and he took Ariadne when he left, etc ad nauseum.<br /><br />But if you are not a purest and don't mind the "literary license" it wasn't too bad. The story line was better than usual, the special effects weren't too bad considering the limited amount of money spent, and character development was about the same as usual.
