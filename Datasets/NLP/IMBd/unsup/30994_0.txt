yes. i am such a die-hard inuyasha fan i'm gonna label this the best anime movie ever (however i'm aware my biased opinion will not convince everyone). still, out of the 4 inuyasha movies out there, this 3rd movie contains all the good qualities an anime movie should have. let me start by saying the movie can be almost written as canon (meaning, it follows somewhat the original storyline). it is well animated (althought the 4th movie has the best animation)... and the fact that sesshoumaru here has so many screen minutes. in this film, you can also see sesshoumaru realizing he does care for someone (albeit trying hard to maintain his aloofness and denying it). it's also surprising in one of the battle scenes that he took the hit for inuyasha - showing he does not really HATE inuyasha that much.<br /><br />if there's only one thing that 'dirties' this movie, it's whenever kagome is on the scene. granted, i really despised her character. she did nothing in this movie that actually helped except for the fact she screamed to sesshoumaru to actually help inuyasha (much to my fave half-demon's ire). even rin had a use in this movie.. kagome: just plain useless.<br /><br />but don't let kagome's uselessness (note to all kagome-haters) deter you from watching or owning a DVD of this film. if you liked the two previous inu movies (this one is a guarantee to be your favourite). i have the dvds of the two films and cant wait for the sept 6 release of this film.<br /><br />then, i'll be patiently waiting for the 4th one!!!
