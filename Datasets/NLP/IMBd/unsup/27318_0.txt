A lot of people! and so do I. Seeing this movie at first made me think this looks good... infact I think it started good then gradually got worse then it just buried itself. Michael Moriarty (who I'm a fan of) was in his typical horror movie role similar to movies like "The Stuff". The movie dies right after Joe (Moriarty) gave Van Meer (Fuller) the book about who the people of the town were, The Vampires. A lot more could have been put into the plot it was like it was made up as it goes along. I actually purchased this movie simply because Moriarty was in it, absolutely for no other reason.
