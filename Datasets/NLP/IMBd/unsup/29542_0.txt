Yes this movie is far short of a classic film, but that doesn't matter ITS A HOOT! There should be a new Genre of film named fun bad and this one is the poster child. <br /><br />Bela was in the declining years of his career, everyone knows the story of his last days, and his performance is typical of that time period. I thought the Matin and Lewis knockoff was terrific. No one would dare do that kind of thing now. The plot is generic, but for pure fun I thought it was great. Bela Lugosi is a name that will go down in movie trivia history. How many "great" films did he make? No one has made as many bad films yet their name is immortal.
