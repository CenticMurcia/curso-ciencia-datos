Stay away from this piece of garbage! The book, co-authored by Holiday and William Duffy(1956), was one of the most honest, brutal and human autobiographies ever written. Ross' depiction of Holiday is horrendously erroneous on every level. She doesn't look, sound or act like her. This movie is only for Ross fans. Billie Holiday fans will learn just as much about her by watching old reruns of The Jetsons. I'm Johnny Roulette and this movie was absolutely horrible!
