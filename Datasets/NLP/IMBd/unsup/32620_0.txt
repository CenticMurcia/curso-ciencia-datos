My guess is ALL the great reviews this turkey gets are from lily white, upscale adults who REALLY buy into the awful phoniness of this silly pseudo-romance. There's Ms. Puke-face who dates Mr. Lays-all-the-chicks who falls for Ms. Post-Meno-Mom, but wait Ms. Puke-face bows out so that the two STARS can romance each other and then along comes Dr. Do-right who ALSO bows out (talk about a non-Alpha-male type) in Paris (no less) so the Geritol-set couple can finally after two tedious hours ... who cares? This film represents ALL that is wrong w/ H'wood studio pics and the ego-driven dribble audiences just eat up.<br /><br />I'd rather be made sit through one Mad Mel's recent films then ever watch this bloated, rotting corpse of a film ever again!
