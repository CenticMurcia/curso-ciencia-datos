I bought this movie on VHS a while back and watched it last night. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but was kinda disappointed in the end.<br /><br />Here's the story (spoiler?):<br /><br />An archaeologist (Christopher McDonald) has returning nightmares about his childhood when his family was killed. His father was (also played by Christopher McDonald) an archaeologist too and wants to finish his father's work (finding a tomb of an 10- year-old prince who sold his soul to a demon for eternal life) after he finds the map in a book cover. He and his girlfriend and 2 other friends (one alcoholic photographer and an ex-model.....to give the characters some depth......) go to the same place in Serbia were his family was killed to find this tomb. Once there, he get's obsessed with finding the entrance to the tomb and slowly goes insane when his imaginary friend appears again....<br /><br />*******SPOILER*********<br /><br />Turns out he killed his family out of revenge (and being under the influence of his imaginary friend) for being locked up in the "playroom" by his father. In there he makes up an imaginary friend. This imaginary friend turns out to be the prince "who doesn t want to be alone". Together they plot to kill his family and blame it on a worker.<br /><br />There are some huge holes and non-logical things in the story and the story is also very simplistic. The main character goes insane very quickly, the ex-model changes from a Buddist to a nymph, the people in Serbia speak English etc etc.<br /><br />Also I didn't like Christopher McDonald's acting. A lot of over-acting, which didn't work for me.<br /><br />The movie isn't scary at all, nore bloody. But the thing that ruined the movie were the SE of the prince. First we see a young boy, but then we get to see his "real appearance": Some plastic dummy with the voice of that same boy! <br /><br />2 Things I liked though: The setting off the movie in Serbia. That looked great. Second: I liked the ending.<br /><br />But you have check that for yourself!
