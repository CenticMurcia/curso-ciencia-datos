I just happened to watch this movie on TV. After a few scenes I realized that it was a remake of Truffaut's very entertaining " La Sirene du Mississippi" ( 7.1 IMDb rating). Like all of Hollywood's remakes that I have seen so far , this one is just as unsatisfactory ( to say the least )as all the others (The Day of the Jackal, The Manchurian Candidate etc.).<br /><br />All of the reviews I read ( the first 20 or so) were all raving about this in my opinion silly remake. They are too young to know that many , many years ago there were so much better originals( mostly European)which is also expressed by IMDb ratings ( for The Day of the Jackal 7.9 vs. 5.7 and for The Manchurian Candidate 8.4 vs. 6.7 )
