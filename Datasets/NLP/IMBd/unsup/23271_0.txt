I believe that The Amazing Race is the greatest "reality" show. People get to race around the world and do things that they never thought they would do. Not only do the viewers get to see the beautiful and wonderful places that are visited, but we also get to learn about the cultures and customs of different countries. I feel as though I am actually visiting these places that I will probably never get to see in my life. Racers need to be both physically and mentally strong in order to complete the detours, road blocks, and other puzzles that need to be solved. Map skills are also an excellent thing to have on this show, as many of the teams get lost and need to stop and ask for directions. The racers never know where they are going to be next...there is no planning ahead of time and that's one of the things that makes this show absolutely exciting.
