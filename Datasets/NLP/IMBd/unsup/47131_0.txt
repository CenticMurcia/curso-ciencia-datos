Music mogul, Bernie Stein, joins his nephew Freakie and a hippie roadie, Iggy in an effort to make a superstar out of dead body parts. The hands of Jimmy Hendrix, Sid Vicious's ass, Elvis's head, and the penis of Jim Morrison. Well it would have been Morrison if Iggy didn't screw up and bring back Liberace's love sausage. uh-oh, I smell a wall of gay jokes cumin along. Sure enough King, the monster, gets confused by his fudge packing pecker whom actually talks to him. And, oh who am I kidding, as a red blooded heterosexual make this film is just way too gay for me. (not that there's anything wrong with that) <br /><br />Eye Candy: Kate Fallon & Joan Gerardi get topless; plus more nudity in the extra features <br /><br />DVD Extras: Commentary Director and crew; 22 minute Behind the scenes featurette; music video; Theatrical trailer; and trailers for 28 other Seduction Cinema titles <br /><br />My Grade: F
