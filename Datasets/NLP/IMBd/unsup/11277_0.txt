I also saw London to Brighton at the Edinburgh film festival, the buzz after the film was all so positive and I think this film will do really well based on this word of mouth. Wining awards at both Edinburgh and rain dance can't be a bad sign. For a first time director Paul Andrew Williams pulls off a very confident film, it can be quite hard hitting, very well written with some really good performances. The two central characters particularly shine in the darker moments in the film, the combination of there acting and the directors ability to create such a tangible atmosphere creates some truly gripping scenes. In short Its the kind of film the British film industry should be making more of, challenging, entertaining and decidedly British and hopefully it will get a large release. Highly Recommend!!
