I've always recommended this movie to people who like bad horror flicks. Both Shatner and Borgnine are at their overacting best in this as they debate good and evil, while the black robed Satanists just sit around and chant; really, have you ever seen evil be so devout and boring? The highlight is Borgnine as a goat. The melty effects are fun and cheesy too. It's clear the director had just gotten/seen this effect and decided to go to town with it. As someone said earlier, Travolta debuting is just plain weird, and the fact that Anton LaVey hisself has a cameo just makes this a cheesy scream queen classic. Buy/rent or borrow this and have a laugh!
