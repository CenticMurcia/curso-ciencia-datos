At age 50, I still remember the profound effect this Holiday classic had on me as a kid. Growing up in middle class comfort, it was hard for me to understand how JT could grow so attached to a straggled alley cat. However, I understand now, it was something this poor child could give love to. I also remember how devastating it was to see the poor creature lose it's life by getting hit by a car. It should be required viewing for youth today who seem to have no respect for animal life. I'm wondering whether or not they would even understand the message. I'll add my comments to the many comments already posted. This poignant film needs to be released on DVD so hat hopefully, it won't be forgotten.
