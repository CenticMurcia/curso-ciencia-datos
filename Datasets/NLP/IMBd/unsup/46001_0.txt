Hey, This Is Funny, but not as funny as some of the other spoofs i've seen (Scary Movie, Student Bodies, Repossesed, Etc...) If I Ever Wanted To Do A Spoof Of Horror Movies, it'd spoof the fact that a lot of movies are out there ripping off SCREAM, like a lot of us are out there ripping off SCARY MOVIE. to sum it up, Rip-offs are Funny, But not so funny. wacth it on the SCI-FI Channel. Go Ahead, Enjoy Yourself, But Keep In Mind: Scary Movie, Scary Movie 2, and Student Bodies Were Hilarious!
