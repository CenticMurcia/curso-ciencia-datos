There are scenes in this movie that defy quality, professional honesty that work like gems. The home family scene was particularly intriguing in "How To Lose A Guy...," the quality of the photography went from professional quality feature film to a something not home video, but less sharp and informal. It is there the audience experiences an honest, genuine quality time the coming off the screen between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. This movie was has a smart send up, funny lines and comical scenes about the dating behavior and quirky incidents that have befallen man and woman over time. While the ending wasn't quite as dazzling as it could have been, it ties itself up nicely. I was hoping for something more traditional, classy but as it was the ending was more personal and straight forward. A good date movie with bit more of a bite than the average man/woman collision/confrontation/competition movie.
