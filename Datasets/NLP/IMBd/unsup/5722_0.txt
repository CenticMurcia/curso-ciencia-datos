"I Love to Singa" is probably the funniest cartoon I've ever seen. It's a spoof of The Jazz Singer, and although seeing that film helps make the cartoon even funnier, you can still appreciate the cartoon without seeing it. There is a priceless scene in the cartoon that I'm sure will leave you in stitches. When Owl Jolson, our misfit hero, goes to sing at an audition, the viewer sees a bunch of other participants. One of them, a blue bird that looks like it was stoned, starts to show off his "talent". What ensues is the funniest piece of animation I have ever seen. I don't want to spoil the moment, but if you don't think that scene is funny, you don't have a sense of humor. It's one of Tex Avery's best cartoons, and is recommended to all ages. It's on the Looney Toons Golden Collection 2, so buy that if you want to experience this classic cartoon.
