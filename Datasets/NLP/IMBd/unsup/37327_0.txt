This movie wasn't bad enough to make me fall asleep. Because I was laughing hysterically throughout the entire film. I want to know how anyone associated with Lord of the Rings (John Rhys-Davies) could allow themselves to be a part of this project. I honestly didn't know these types of films existed. When it is obvious footage is taken from the likes of Dante's Peak you know this movie will be horrible. Whoever green lit this film could have given the money to any charity and probably felt better about his/herself. After the initial "shock" that the world only has the time left for the plate to move another 20 cm or so I said to myself, "Okay were is the villain because the movie can't rely only on an evil-moving tectonic plate." And boy did the movie deliver! All in all the film is an SNL parody of all the disaster picks that plagued the late 90s.
