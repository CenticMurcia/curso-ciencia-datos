I think this movie wasn't even worthy of being a Crow movie. It simply didn't feel like one. The movie wasn't dark enough and I didn't feel the same vengeance from this character as I did with the first two films. There were a few things I liked, such as the image of the crow makeup burned into his face and the angel crying blood but I really didn't think that the acting was that great, the bad guys weren't bad enough, and the general feeling of a Crow film just wasn't there.
