This story seemed to have a reasonable budget so I have no idea how it got such a terrible screenplay. <br /><br />There were so many egregious plot problems that I don't know where to begin. Another reviewer mentioned, `cringing' through the entire film and that's a fair comment. <br /><br />Let's just mention a few of the more glaring plot gaffsÂ…<br /><br />Daniel has supposedly suffered some type of serious head injury in the past and yet he plays lacrosse for an entire season on a team that's never won a game to improve his `coaching' credentials?<br /><br />A local mobster (whose son is the captain of an undefeated collegiate team) fixes the all too predictable match up between the teams. (How could he have thought his son's team could lose) The mobster fixes the match by kidnapping the official and substituting fake officials who make blatantly unfair calls. The mobster is apparently making book on the game (who bets on extra collegiate lacrosse?)<br /><br />The kidnapped coaches escape when the two goons who have lured them into the mobster's limousine stop for gas and both have to go to the men's room just as the refs are figuring out what's going on. No worries though cause when the refs try to call the police on the limo's phone they find out that the mobster owns the phone company too. <br /><br />I'm not sure why the `championship' team played the first half like a bunch of thugs. (Did the mobster pay them or something?) Maybe it has something to do with a speech by the mobster's son that ended up on the cutting room floor. When he tells his teammates at the beginning of the second half `forget what I said earlier' it's no problem for the audience since we didn't hear this kid make any speech. <br /><br />For some inexplicable reason the `fake' refs stop making unfair calls in the second half and the hero's team starts to catch up. Course it might be that his sister is now playing. Oh, did I mention that the mobster has bought the mortgage on the family store and is throwing them out? The mobster did promise not to if Daniel threw the game (was Mr. Mobster worried that a championship team playing nobodies aided by his fake officials was going to lose?) <br /><br />I'm surprised that I rated this as highly as I did but even with all of the above, many of the actors were likeable and it was nice to see a sports movie about a lesser known sport for a change.
