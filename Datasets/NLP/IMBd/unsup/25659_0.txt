While not quite a masterpiece, the movie is really funny in places and has some inspired moments. But the best thing about it is the huge cast of comedy allstars (some of whom were still relatively unknown at the time) that make appearances. It would almost be easier to list the comedy stars who aren't in the movie. Not only is there a huge contingent of SNL stars from the 70s up to the 90s (Aykroyd, Curtin, Garret Morris, Laraine Newman, Jan Hooks, Michael McKean, Julia Sweeney, Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Jon Lovitz, Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, Tim Meadows, David Spade, etc.) but others like Jason Alexander, Drew Carey, Michael Richards, Dave Thomas, Joey Lauren Adams, Parker Posey and Tom Arnold. Seems like almost every scene has a cameo from somebody. My vote for funniest goes to Jan Hooks as the driving student who tries to seduce Aykroyd. The dentists office scene with Lovitz is also unbeatable. The movie's premise is so bizarre that along with all the cameos, watching it is pretty surreal. Most characters in the movie barely notice or mention the cones; most of the time the coneheads make little effort to fit in, and only a few people seem to notice the difference. I guess New Jersey is even stranger than I had imagined. The movie is just interestingly weird. It must be one of the best movies of all time for intoxication.
