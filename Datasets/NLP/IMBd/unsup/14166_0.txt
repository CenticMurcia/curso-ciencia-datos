Updated remake of George Romero's 1968 classic, has better makeup and special effects than it's predecessor. The plot is virtually the same as a group of townspeople hole up in a shack as the "walkers" close in on them, forcing them to make life or death decisions; extremely graphic. Tom Savini was the makeup master of Romero's original Dawn of the Dead and he directs this remake which, by the way, is a better zombie movie than the average one out there on the video shelf. Personally, I found the modern version more enjoyable than the original. The zombies look scarier, Barbara isn't annoyingly scared stiff like in the 1st version, and its updated in color. Notably absent is the crummy acting and gags that have marred many zombie movies...I was 17 when this one was made and I don't recall it playing in theaters at the time. If your a fan of the original, give this one a chance, it comes with director commentary which compares it to the original. I highly recommend watching it at least once. (7 out of 10)
