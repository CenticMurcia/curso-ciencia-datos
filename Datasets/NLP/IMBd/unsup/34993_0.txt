If I could have given this piece of garbage negative stars, I would have. The plot is terrible, they take two bad jokes and beat them to death with a sledgehammer. Why some talented people agreed to be in this is beyond me. Did Christopher Walken need to make a car payment? Don't waste your money - even when this pile of poo comes out on DVD.<br /><br />My husband liked the fight scene between Maggie Q and Jason Scott Lee, but that is about the only recommendation I can give it. There are some talented people in the film and they seem to actually try to do their best with material that isn't even fit to be called substandard.<br /><br />I've only seen two movies as bad as this one - Bloodrayne and Sympathy for the Devil. Even The Weatherman was better than this.
