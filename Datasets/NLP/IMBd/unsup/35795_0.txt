Nadja is hands-down one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. The film is basically a different take on the classic vampire story. It's shot in black and white and features a contemporary soundtrack. Director Michael Almereyda obviously thought all this was very cool; but in reality it's extremely dull. The plot actually makes the film sound like it might be worth watching and focuses on Dracula's death, and the resulting plight of his dysfunctional family, who are also being hunted by Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing. The film reminded me of something that could have been directed by Jim Jarmusch, although it's only a cheap imitation. The plot runs really slowly and it wasn't long before I was starting to get bored with it. It's all very arty, though unfortunately the artiness isn't used in the best way possible. Sure, there are a few memorable images; but not enough considering what the film was trying to achieve. The director shows his experimental side by shooting some of the film with a Fisher Price Pixelvision camera, but to me it just came off as arrogant and pointless. Overall, Nadja is a very disappointing and boring attempt at a vampire film and I'd recommend everyone avoids it.
