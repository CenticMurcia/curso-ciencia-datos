This was shown on channel 5 in england on 5/9/03 and channel 5 not normally being a very good channel i was going to skip this movie, even though it sounded quite 'interesting'. But then I decided i was going to watch it and i was glad that I did. I felt so sorry for Jodi in the way that her mother is basically a Nazi German commander! And Zachary was so sweet. This movie really pulled at my heartstrings and I'm normally a hard hearted person! Made for TV movies aren't normally great, but I really quite liked this film and I'd watch it again. I'd quite like to know what happened in the end though! The character of Maggie Fergus was a good and likeable character too, I liked her fiery and funny nature.
