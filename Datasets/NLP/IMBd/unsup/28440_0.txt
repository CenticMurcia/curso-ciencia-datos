I had the pleasure of playing Darell in the movie(drug dealer in the opening scenes) First: what a great experience to work with that cast and crew, no matter how many times I fell, jumped, got shot, sped out, ate arms, got smothered by a pack of zombies, and snorted powdered sugar for cocaine, and then hear..let's do it again! <br /><br />I finally had the opportunity to see the movie and I think Byron Werner did an amazing, amazing job as cinemaphotographer. He shot this movie like it was big budget. For an independent horror I say...Well done Mr. Latt and mr. Walker. It's very much worth the rent. By the way, the music in this movie rocked...the score was right on in every scene. It still amazes me how much music adds to a scene. Again, GOOD WORK EVERYONE, I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER.<br /><br />I still think Darell should have come back again....but then again I am Bias...<br /><br />Dean N. Arevalo(Darell)
