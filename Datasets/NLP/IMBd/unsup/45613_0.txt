Group of sorority and fraternity pledges must spend the night in a supposedly haunted house as part of their initiation--how much you wanna bet something evil really lurks there? Schlock thriller with terrible cinematography and a draggy pace does boast some talented names in the credits (co-producer Irwin Yablans had a hand in the original "Halloween"), but the drawing card is of course Linda Blair, and she's attractive and professional as always (though looking a bit sheepish with this third-rate material). Supporting cast is less interesting, with Peter Barton perhaps an escapee from the Osmond family. A better director might have worked up more suspense by drawing us closer to the characters--and a better screenwriter might have given the director something to work with. It's a suspiciously mild drive-in quickie, not really deserving of its R-rating, though the big finale is well-staged. * from ****
