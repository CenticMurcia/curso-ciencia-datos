Some people ask me, "Why do you give such horrible ratings?" I have 6 accounts on this thing so people can never track me, but this is my most accurate account by far. Back to the movie....The reason I give bad ratings is because of movies like this one. Lifetime original (more like unoriginal) movies are as enjoyable as me stapling my balls to a tree. This particular movie stinks worse than a New York dumpster due to its horrible taste in storyline. Teenage girl who is freakin' hot basically decides to do a documentary on what it would be like to be fat. Yippie! Tyra Banks called and said to stop copying her gimmicks and for that matter, Shallow Hal wouldn't even promote this terrible copycat. Do people really think that if they dress up like a "different" type of person for a day, hell, even a week that they can truly know what the hell it's like to be like that. Wake up fools! Real life overweight people deal with this all day, everyday and it's not something to toy with. Movies like this make me sick to my stomach how in the end...zzzzzzz.....sorry.....how she "magically" feels sorry about what she has done and wants to befriend the people she hurt in the beginning. The story should have been to where she really gained weight, then it would have been more believable. But still, this movie has been done before. Why do directors insists on taking on these ridiculous remakes of crappy stories. Man, thank God for great stories like Drumline. Just kidding, that movie also sucked. I just wanted to re-state that comment because everyone knows how much I hate that one too. But in closing, I will say that I'm from GA and there are plenty of bigger women that get plenty of love from dudes so don't feel sorry for them you A-holes.
