TEARS OF THE BLACK TIGER (Fah Talai Jone) <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />Driven apart by class differences, young lovers (Chartchai Ngamsan and Stella Malucchi) are forced to take a stand against the treachery and villainy of those around them.<br /><br />Ultra-stylized debut by director Wisit Sasanatieng which uses exaggerated colors, painted backdrops and silent-era acting styles in the service of an ultra-melodramatic plot, embroidered by lavish camera-work and explosions of graphic violence. The over-arching campness of the entire enterprise (including an intense emotional 'bond' between the handsome hero and his equally handsome nemesis, Arawat Ruangvuth) suggests a gay sensibility run riot, making this one of the Queerest 'straight' movies of recent years! Oddly, though set in present day Thailand, the characters dress and behave like cowboys, which - if nothing else - allows Sasanatieng to reference his favorite films and filmmakers (most notably the works of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah), and the director's bold visual assurance prevents the whole thing from sliding into obscurity. There's a number of surprising plot developments during the film's second half, but the narrative is almost wholly subservient to the filmmakers' technical skills. Not for all tastes, this was the first Thai film to play in competition at Cannes.<br /><br />(Thai dialogue)
