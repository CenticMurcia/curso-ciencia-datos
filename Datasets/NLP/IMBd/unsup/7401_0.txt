This is the story of Ferrari, his personal life and the way he started as a racing driver and then founded the Ferrari company.<br /><br />Yes, this story is about the famous Ferrari sports cars, about the men himself who made Ferrari what it is today.<br /><br />In the movie we see the old Enzo Ferrari tells the story of his life, his women, his children and the people he worked with.<br /><br />This movie is pretty good, just a bit too long at some parts.<br /><br />I'm a bit troubled with the way it ended, they should have done the ending more clear.<br /><br />Watch it if you like the Ferrari cars.
