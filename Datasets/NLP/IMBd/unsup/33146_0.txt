Okay, this has to be one of the worst 'romantic comedies' I've ever seen - its a completely unbelievable plot line, with a far-too-easily-HATEable heroine - who, by the way, overacts throughout the entire film. There are far too many close-ups in the last 15 mins of Brittany Murphy's quivering lips and tear-filled eyes - takes away any possible sympathy you might have been tempted to feel for her self-involved egomaniac character. And any rom-com that leaves the viewer at the end of a tortuous two hours with neither an idea of how romantically- happy the heroine ends up (whether one actually cares or not) OR whether there's any chance she might die in some horrible accident can really be summed up with the words "a complete and utter waste of my time" - that I'll never get back!
