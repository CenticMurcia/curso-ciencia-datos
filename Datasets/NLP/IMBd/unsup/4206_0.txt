Warner Bros pulled out all the stops to make this excellent western action classic which I rate 9 out of 10. One of the best parts of the movie was the greatest saloon fight ever filmed... which was all about... Hmm! I forget! One thing to convey to young movie fans is that most people who saw this movie on theaters --- it was re-issued more than once --- saw it in black & white with no hint it was ever in Technicolor. When this film was released in 1939, I was 8 months old, so I missed it. But in the late 1940's and throughout the 1950's, many Technicolor pictures, particularly from 20th Centory-Fox and Warner Bros, were re-issued in black and white --- all that rare and beautiful Technicolor work relegated to the ash can by Hollywood cheapskates. During the war years of 1941-45, Hollywood was tightly rationed on use of Technicolor, which was needed at the time by the war effort. But after the war, it's amazing that Hollywood czars like Darryl F. Zanuck would denude their movies of their Technicolor --- often using Technicolor previews as if to slap the faces of ticket buyers.
