When i first saw this i thought it would be a bit samey, like any other sitcom or teen show but it wasn't, it's very funny.<br /><br />It's not nauseating like Friends but a likable scenario of three ex-college pals embarking on their careers and love lives. The friendship between these three is the best part, it isn't a contrived friendship, it's very real. Sharon is tough, bossy and one of the guys but she does have a girlie side too, Berg is witty but a bit childish, Pete is on the quest for true love, never really finding it and then later we get Johnny, lovable but tight. Ashley, sarcastic and strong and Irene, crazy cat lover who has a crush on Pete.<br /><br />Pete is my favourite, everyone loves Berg, but Pete had the depth and his extremeness to find the perfect mate was funny, charming and cute. he also has a great singing voice! He and Ashley were better suited than Berg and Ashley.<br /><br />I think it was a shame it got cancelled and left us on a cliffhanger, normally i'm all for endings that make you think but this was just unfair! Love the episodes later on, the one with no dialogue (Silent movie) the one which shows us the characters lives linking together throughout one day, the writers were original with material, the halloween episodes were fun and love Mr. Bower's tall tales (the ones from movies) Overall a decent four series which deserved more time on the air.
