I, like most probably watched this film because the striking Anna Friel was in it and it was not even worth enduring this awful film to catch sight of her. Poor Friel either gets bad parts in bad movies (An Everlasting Peace) or gets bad parts in terrible movies (Mad Cows.) Albeit a leading role, "Sunset Strip" is more of the same.<br /><br />The film progresses a 70s wannabe rock band trying to get a break and whilst the film is tedious Friel is actually fairly good, there are a few descent scenes and the Ali G (UK) look-alike is funny. But as I write this I feel I am being too generous after looking at Friel her not wearing a bra for most of the filmÂ…<br /><br />Before you ask - no we do not see anyone strip nor are there any notable dirty moments. The closest we get is seeing half of Anna Friel's breast. - Only a mega Anna Friel fan is going to be able endure the whole 90 minutes.
