Robert Duvall's greatness lies in part, on his ability to become the character he's portraying, his identity subsumed in the film. In this movie, unfortunately, he emerges not as a hit man, but as an odd permutation of Harvey Keitel. I found myself wondering exactly "who" I was watching. Discovering after the fact that Duvall wrote the screenplay, all became clear. Actors tend to be empty vessels, filled by a writer's creation...Duvall mistook his acting gifts for writing talent, and produced an interesting glimpse of Buenos Aires' tango world, populated with the road show cast of "Reservoir Dogs". A few viewings of "The Official Story" might have provided better source material for Duvall, although the dialog consistently fails to ring true.
