"Sweet Hideaway" may not succeed overall in its approach. However, several moments in the film are hilarious. The talent gathered for the effort are amazing, taking average material and making it interesting. New talent Chip Joslin, Benjamin Dane, Marco Rodriguez, Dane Hereford shine in their performances. "Sweet Hideaway" is far from a perfect comedy, but it succeeds on several levels. The added cast of Rickey Smiley, Anthony Johnson and Natalie Desselle propel the film and veteran Burton Gilliam adds an over-the-top element that actually helps ground the story. Newcomer Parisa Fakhri is also very endearing. "Hideaway" provides a start to several talented actors and is a guilty pleasure to watch. It is a film that promises to offend on every level but is not mean-spirited in its delivery.
