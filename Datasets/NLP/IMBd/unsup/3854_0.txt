Cabaret is an exceptionally well made film - the music, choreography, acting, screenplay and direction are all of very high caliber. Even after 36 years, it hasn't aged, and is as shocking and entertaining as ever. It deservedly won 8 Oscars in spite of competition from one of the most beloved movies of all times The Godfather. Although the academy is notorious for decisions based on emotions rather than merit, in this instance, I consider the splitting of best direction and best picture Oscars between the 2 films as a just outcome. It's therefore very surprising, it's not on any of the all-time-great lists - a great injustice, or could it be a conspiracy? It'll certainly be on my list of 100 all-time-great movies.
