I thought Blue Hill Avenue was very well written. Allen Payne and Angelle Brooks were phenomenal together. I would have love to have seen a LOVE scene between them, but Maybe Next Time. I like All the movies Allen play's in. Including New Jack City where he got shot. And Jason's Lyric, with Jada Pinkett Smith. Angelle Brooks is quite the Actress herself. I've enjoyed All her movie's too. I'm glad to see more African-American's today getting better position's, in movie's. And in Business, Today. I look forward to seeing both Actor's in Movie's to come. Allen Payne is just a dreamboat. I wonder if he's still married. I really appreciate them as Entertainer's.
