Director Avati can come up with a good ghoulish scenario like he did with MACABRO but this film is a real dud. A good synthesizer score cannot make up for the fact that this anemic horror film is dull as the dirt the dead rise out of. It's no wonder that Avati went on to make art films after this. Avati knows how to build up suspense but there's no payoff here. Plus the film has the bland look of something that was made for television.
