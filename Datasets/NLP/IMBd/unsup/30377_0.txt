I did not enjoy this movie. I understood most of the story line (not much of a line, but more of a time traveling scribble), and was able to follow most of the abstract and interpret it for what it was, but this movie just did NOT do it for me. I've seen thousands of films, and for as long as I've known his name, for some reason I'd not seen any of his films. This was my first Lynch film, and as such I had no expectations whatsoever.<br /><br />I felt fear, amusement, I jumped out of fright once, felt anxious, laughed a bit, and was otherwise bored and under stimulated. Very likely I will score it a 4, for the fact that regardless of the severe lack of a understandable plot, or decipherable sequencing, etc, the effective use of sounds, lighting, perspective, and more that drove me to FEEL something from the film was very, very well done.<br /><br />I don't watch trailers or read reviews before watching something new, so I had no idea what to expect. I wouldn't be surprised if someone says 'well you really have to see one or two of his other films to really understand and appreciate it', but, that's not true. It might acclimate me to his odd and original techniques and style, but unless this film, er, video, is tied to another by being part of a series or trilogy, it should be able to be judged fully and honestly without any prior exposure to the director's previous work.<br /><br />What I watched was, to me, the very near equivalent of a weird, bothersome, torturous half-nightmare, as well illustrated as one could possibly do so through the chosen medium. The confusion, the transformations, from one place to another, one person to another; it was very surreal. What I did not expect was that I would feel that such an experience was such a waste of my time. If I had woken at the end, rested at 7am from a good night's sleep and feeling a bit funny from the insane dream I had, I may have been just fine; I quite enjoy psychedelics and the insanity of my own dreams. Rather, I spent half the night on HIS dream, and feel I am a bit numb in the brain from the experience.<br /><br />I know that all of the film-school graduates may disagree with me, with him being a much loved director, but come on now, if this is beautiful art, then so are paintings of soup cans.
