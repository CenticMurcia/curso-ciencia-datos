In the middle of nowhere at a bar, the costumers including Barkeeper (Clu Gulagar) are enjoying the booze until a mysterious man breaks in and warns them of creatures coming to kill them. They don't believe in him until a bizarre creature kills one of the costumers as each person must try to stay alive and inside the bar as possible to ward off these flesh-eating beasts.<br /><br />Exciting and gory-as-hell action-horror comedy is one of the better horror flicks of late. From executive producers Wes Craven, Chris Moore, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon this is an adrenaline pumping roller-coaster that harks back to the old school style monster movie days. Sure the movie may seem plot less even with no explanation of where the monsters come from until the sequels, but it's good quality entertainment for fans of the genre. The film co-stars Pulp Fiction's Dwayne Witaker, Judah Friedlander, Henry Rollins and Balthazar Getty ("Alias") as they give all great performances. I love how the creatures are more traditional style then CGI which doesn't seem to be realistic, i do admire CGI unless it's well done. The gore is non-stop in a cartoony "Dead Alive" or "Re-Animator" kind of way as you see Eyeballs ripped out, heads blowing up and so much blood you need an umbrella.<br /><br />I highly recommend this throwback to old school horror movies to any fan, it's great fun.<br /><br />Also recommended: "From Dusk Till Dawn", "CHUD", "Re-Animator", "Evil Dead 1 & 2", "The Toxic Avenger", "Basket Case", "It's Alive (1974)", "The Mist", "Pumpkinhead", "Demons 1 & 2", "Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)", "Night of the Living Dead (1968 and 1990)", "Hatchet", "Slither", "Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead", "Diary of the Dead", "Street Trash", "Day of the Dead (1985)", "The Blob (1988)", "The Descent", "The Pit", "Bad Taste", "The Thing (1982)", "Grindhouse", "The Host" and "The Hills Have Eyes (1977 and 2006)".
