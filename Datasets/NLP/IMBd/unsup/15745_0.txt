A very interesting movie with horror cheese written all over it. It's basically about an extremely rich business man called Virgil Travis who is genetically disfigured and is going about getting revenge on rival business people who have screwed him out of a hell of a load of money. He creates dolls who with the aid of Travis's clown faced right hand man go about killing these business people. It makes for a good watch but falls short of the mark for me due to a lousy script and poor acting from a couple of the female cast. It reminded me of Puppet Master several times which is superior in every way to Blood Dolls. One more thing which i thought this movie lacked and that thing is gore. Most of the killings were too fast or not focused on long enough. The goriest part was near the beginning and even that wasn't too gory. Gore fans go elsewhere. It was still enjoyable though and is fairly fun to watch. 7/10
