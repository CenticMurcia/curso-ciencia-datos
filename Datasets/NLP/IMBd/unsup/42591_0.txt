I could not appreciate this movie in the slightest. The characters were non-existent in the Lovecraft canon. The stories were twisted into an attempt to be scary, introducing romanticized elements that were totally unnecessary. The material in the books far outclass it in horror and suspense. Whoever thought they could pass this swill off as a Lovecraftian horror film was thick in the head! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, Lovecraft fan or otherwise.<br /><br />If you want a good--not necessarily period appropriate, but good--Lovecraft horror film, I'd recommend The Reanimator. It's not the best, but it's better than this piece of garbage.
