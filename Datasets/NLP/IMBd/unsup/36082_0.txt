...then see this movie. It is typical, B-action movie. Overacted, with the wide range of teen-aged sarcasm to deer-in-the-headlights serious-face. Wesley spends most of the movie looking like he's drugged and regretting something - like signing up for this flick. He does get to do some karate kicks and yelling, though. For Obradors, this is a big step-up. Unfortunately, she is made for T.V. and certain magazines. Her role begs to be taken seriously and such is impossible. Premise device has promise: hallucinations on command. Certainly gave the editor something to do. I pity those who shelled out money for this. They must have been ticked-off.
