Harry Crumb (John Candy), the last of the great detective Crumb lineage, is a bumbling idiot who's put on the case of a missing socialite by his shady boss, with the express purpose that he's a clown who couldn't detect himself out of a paper bag. But poor Harry may just goof his way to the truth after all. Harry Crumb is also not Candy's best film by a long shot and a good deal of the slapstick humor falls flat. Even the handful instances where the film works and you crack a smile, they're too few and far between to suggest this one for multiple viewings. Not nearly as sheerly dreadful as "Canadian Bacon", but still a far cry from classics such as Uncle Buck, Plain, trains and Great Outdoors.<br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />Eye Candy: Blink and you'll miss Ren√©e Coleman's nipples in the opening scene
