With a stellar cast and some very good special effects, one might assume that the film Eragon, following in the wake of lotr might achieve a modicum of success. Not so. the acting is adequate, but the uter failure in the script, directorial lead, and perhaps most importantly book adaptation and editing makes this movie a truly awful experience. while i've read the two books in the series and had been looking forward to this film, i forgot i'd seen it later that same day, perhaps i'd blocked it out. irons, malkovitch and honsou should fire their agents. spellers, good luck in life, because after this movie, i'd be surprised if you were in a hallmark commercial.
