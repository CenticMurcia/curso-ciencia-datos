I first viewed this movie in my teens and have watched it on countless occasions since, it never tires, a fantastic movie that gives a great insight into the world of surfing, as well as making you want to learn to surf the moment it ends.<br /><br />Set in california in the 60's Big Wednesday follows the lives of three surf buddies Matt, Leroy and Jack, from surfing their local beach, call ups to Vietnam, parties, gatecrashers, vacations in mexico and some amazing surf.<br /><br />This is the best surfing movie i have come across, and definately one of my favourite films of all time - even if you have never surfed or live in the middle of a city miles from the sea this is a must see!!!<br /><br />This is the closest most of us will ever come to, or dare to face, the likes of Killers or Mavericks (which i believe the movie is based around)<br /><br />10 out of 10
