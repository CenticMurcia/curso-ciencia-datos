This film was not scary, nor was it exciting at any point. I was bored out of my skull watching this slow-developing piece of trash. It just didn't seem to ever get moving. I saw the ending coming a mile away, since it was a LOT like the ending to Sixth Sense. I've seen worse, but the hype surrounding this movie made it a HUGE disappointment. Terrible excuse for horror, only Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows was worse in that category.
