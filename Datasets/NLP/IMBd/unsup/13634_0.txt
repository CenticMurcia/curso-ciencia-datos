In a sense everything the original poster says is correct but ironically their judgment is guilty of the same short sighted-sightedness as the movie. Race, identity, culture and politics are deeply complex sensitive issues. Most works of art (or general comments like these) can only address a handful of those issues from a single perspective. The "great" artists and their works are able to encompass the multiplicity of views rendering the complex simple enough to digest yet learn from (for the converted choir and the alienated masses).<br /><br />Unfortunenately Drop Sqaud is not one of these works of arts. Yet I do not believe its content should be dismissed with such an easy wave of the hand. For me I found something valuable from this movie yet I completely see the original poster's comments. I am writing this comment/rebuttal not to debate or argue the worth of Drop Sqaud but to urge those of you interested in this movie to give it a chance knowing that their is "something" there even if it's buried in a bunch of "nothing".<br /><br />peace
