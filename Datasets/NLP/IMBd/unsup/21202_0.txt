When I first reviewed this movie on my website, I was very harsh regarding the acting. In retrospect, I was far too critical. Since then I've learned a lot about this movie, how it was made, and when. It's important to realize that this was made by high school kids! If you keep this in mind when you watch, it is in fact a terrific achievement, and a testament to the drive of young minds. It has cheesy moments sure, but as a whole you have a full-out feature based on a popular series, and it's well done for it's age. Check it out and get inspired to do one of your own..
