I was shocked to be watching such an awful rip off of puppetmasters. Dolls that obey and kill. yeah hate to tell you but its been done before and much better. This movie was awful and i am glad that i didn't watch the end of it. The man with a little head was too much, really don't think that was real since his body never moved from a frontal shot. At least it has it comical value.
