Me growing up watching the Friday the 13th series, left me loving it,but this part was the WORST, i hated it so much and it makes me feel like never ever watching any part of its series again. The cast was lame,the acting was very poor, and the script was disgusting,this makes part 5 looks soooooo good.There's a new Freddy V.S jason coming out and I'M NOT looking forward to seeing it. Out of 5 Acting-1.0 Actors-1.0 Script-0.5 Display-1.5 Performace-1.0 Suspence-1.0 Credits-1.5 End-1.5 Overall-1.1/5.0<br /><br />F<br /><br />
