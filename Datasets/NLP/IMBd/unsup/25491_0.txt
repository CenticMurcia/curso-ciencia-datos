I viewed this film and was shocked by how utterly horrible it was. I knew it was a B movie, but this was below even that. The special effects were terrible.<br /><br />The DVD jacket looked really good. It looked professional. That was the first impression that this film was worth seeing. Don't let the jacket fool you. This film isn't even worth picking up.<br /><br />The movie started out the way every B movie would, but I had good expectations for this film. The story was good at first, showing a plantation owner looking for his workers. The film got even better, when they showed a gory picked-to-the-bone skeleton. I thought, "this is going to be good!" But my anticipation shrank when the first shot of the menacing critters flashed to my television screen. The large ants were very obviously plastic, and were being controlled by a human arm. I expected some CG effects to be completely honest. The movement of the ants reminded me immediately of Kermit the Frog. The gore was poor in quality. Usually, in a horror flick, you expect to see a good amount of blood, but in this film there were splatters. They were quite small and weren't very convincing. And the gory bodies left around from the ants were the same prop, used in different scenes. It became quite repetitive very quickly.<br /><br />The acting was poor. It seemed the actors were hired off the street. But, what can I say. Most B movies have poor acting. But, this was one to remember. These people see these giant ants coming up the stairs, and all they have to say is. "That's a big ant!" It should have been a terrified scream. The acting was almost deliberately terrible.<br /><br />Overall, this film was very poor. Most 1950's horror flicks packed more of a punch than this film. Glass Trap was painful to watch. If you want to see a good movie, Glass Trap isn't the way to go.
