Overall, this movie was a disappointment. I'm a huge film noir fan but the plot wasn't enjoyable or interesting enough to make up for its complexity. I found myself not caring as things were revealed. None of the characters made an impression on me. There were a few good visual tricks (the question-mark shadow in a doorway, bullets through a doorway in a dark room) but nevertheless a weak effort by Lang. Distinct feeling of having wasted my time.
