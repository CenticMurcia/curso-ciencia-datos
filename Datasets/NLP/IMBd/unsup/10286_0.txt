I really love the flying doctors. I've watched it when i was a child and now as a young adult again. And i know i will still love it after 10 or 20 years. It will always be my favorite TV series. It's well written and easy to follow. I like all the story lines. But especially the romance between Geoff and Kate. It's so beautiful to watch them get close. They are all great actors. You really believe what they say. You can feel there pain and there happiness. I'm so glad that they are now playing the series back on Belgium television. But what i really want is that they make DVD's of all the episodes so i can watch whenever i want to. So please make the DVD boxes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
