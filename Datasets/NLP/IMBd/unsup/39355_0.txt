"Stealth Fighter" is a joke from start to end. Terrible actors, horrible screenplay and an even worse story makes this one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The film is a bad copy of "Golden Eye", which already is terrible so what is to be expected anyway? Then mix it up with actors from the bad side of gangster rap and "Picket Fences", and there you have it, Stealth Fighter. The only positive thing about this movie is that it even makes Steven Seagal-films look good, a hard task all by itself. Do yourself a favor, don't waste any time by seeing this flop.
