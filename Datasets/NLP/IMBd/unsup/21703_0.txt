I loved this movie. It tells about a boy-turning into a man and a journey to a powwow with his grandpa who is getting ready to die. Along the way, the grandpa, who is a story keeper, uses the stories of a few different tribes to teach his grandson and encourage him to choose the right path in life. The stories come to life in this movie... I almost believed them myself. This also teaches some really good lessons, besides the ones in the stories. This movie teaches about racism, whites vs. indians, indians vs. indians, and that we should look at the heart. It also shows some current problems today with the native American culture. About alcoholism, the "angry" Indian, dysfunctional families, gangs, the importance of our ancestors, and our importance to them. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in learning more about the native American culture and about oral history.
