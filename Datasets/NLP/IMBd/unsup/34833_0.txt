I never post reviews on the IMDb.<br /><br />But for reasons best known to my subconscious, the memory of this film slipped into my head on the bus this morning. Wandering online, I was amazed to find this had mustered above 3 stars.<br /><br />Woeful in every manner, devoid of comedy or redemption and leaving a slightly nihilistic sick taste in the mouth, even as an undemanding teen <br /><br />I remember my childhood abhorrence for this film. And since it was on Sky Movies weekly for a month back in the 90s I had enough opportunities to hate it.<br /><br />I think a comment from my father best sums up this mess.<br /><br />'Dear God, what is wrong with Elliot Gould? Things can't be that bad?'<br /><br />Ugh.
