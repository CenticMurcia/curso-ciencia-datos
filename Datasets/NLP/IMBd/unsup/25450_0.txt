I only watched this movie because parts of it were filmed in my hometown and I was very disappointed with it. I just thought the plot was stupid. Apparently, people don't think there's drugs in Iowa, because stereotypically, we're just a whole bunch of white farmers or something, and that's what the movie portrays us as. But there are a lot of drugs here because people make the stop in between Chicago. Anyway, I just didn't like all the stereotyping. It was totally not what life is like here.
