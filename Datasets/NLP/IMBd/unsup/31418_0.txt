This movie is the younger brother to David Lynch's _Wild at Heart_. Its direction and performances are rougher and more archly surreal but I think director Araki wanted it that way. This movie does have a plot but its landscape is almost entirely psychological--especially the ending. It combines punk and pre-Goth music with a character, Jordan White, who is a kind of lovingly accepting, moment-by-moment Christ-figure. If you can accept that statement, you should watch this movie.<br /><br />By the way, the opening credit "A heterosexual movie by Gregg Araki" is a bit of a flipped bird to reviewers who pigeonholed his last movie with the tag "gay film." "Doom Generation" does have a gay subtext throughout; a very interesting one, too.
