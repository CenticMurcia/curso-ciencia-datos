It's been a couple of years now since I saw this astounding film for the first (only) time; actually, I don't think I'll ever quite recover from the experience.<br /><br />The English language doesn't have enough negative terms to give an adequate analysis of what's wrong here, but let's give it a try.<br /><br />First, the plot, which has more holes than my oldest jacket. We are asked to believe that Earth has been strip mined by the vicious Psychlos for 1000 years, yet can still produce useful quantities of valuable minerals. In all that time, the Psychlos never found Fort Knox, though gold is high on their shopping list, nor did they stumble on the jet fighters that the humans themselves find when the aliens send them out to find gold. The humans, by the way, though reduced to primitive servitude by their conquerors, learn to use those jets in about a day, with the help of a flight simulator that fortunately is not only in working order, but can draw on power from... somewhere.<br /><br />The story is given appropriate support by some of the worst acting (what WAS John Travolta thinking???), dialog, and music you're ever likely to see or hear. A couple of acceptable special effects shots only serve to highlight the wretched standard of the rest. As for the camera work, well, I have nothing in particular against slow motion or tilting the camera, but was it really necessary to use either so lavishly here?<br /><br />After a while, I stopped even trying to find anything good in this mess and sat watching in sullen silence, unwilling to admit defeat by walking out, but determined not to see the film again.<br /><br />Since IMDb doesn't allow a zero rating, I guess it has to be 1/10 - which is at least 10 points more than this deserves.
