Very very interesting movie about self story struggling being a sex addict. Even if its a low budget film project, this could be a great enjoyable movie with a much better casts. These days everything is about how you present the 'whole package'. Acting by Caveh himself is truly brave, but sometimes expression and fire is more convincing,the constant eye starring and mimic could be a bit annoying to watch, same goes to the female casts, it needs to gets the audience to feel the story, the only female cast that I feel did a good job was the alcoholic girlfriend, she did a great job, very convincing. But the fact that it won for an award surely must be a great joy and pride for Caveh, I hope to see great future films from him.
