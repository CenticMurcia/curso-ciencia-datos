OK, lets get the obvious out of the way, Zack Efron is in this movie. That said, there's really not much positive to say about this boy coming of age film. The acting is OK, the camera work is OK, the continuity leaves a lot to be desired as previously mentioned, the story is painfully predicable (spoiler alert, watch the opening menu long enough and you know he races)...<br /><br />Probably the most disappointing thing about the film is it's lack of justice. A good sense of justice and good prevailing completely is essential in a family movie. That does not happen in this film. The two "bad guys" (Michael Nardelli and Colton James) really tear it up and should have been arrested following the race (lets add a little drama), but we don't even see Nardelli when he loses, so there isn't even a chance to rub it in a bit. It's unfortunate, but I can't recommend this movie....unless you absolutely must see Zac Efron.
