This show seems to be quite underrated. It's got it going on - solid story lines and characters. Everyone is very believable in the roles and the story lines are relate-able. It's kinda fresh too vs. clich√© and predictable. There are familiar faces and several new ones. Rosie Perez is a nice addition. Great acting and eye candy for the ladies and guys. This show deserves way more credit then it gets. Each episode gets better and better. The 10/8 was awesome. It's in a good time slot too - watch Project Runway then switch to NBC for this quality programming. I feel invested in the show and will keep watching it. Hope you give it a chance.
