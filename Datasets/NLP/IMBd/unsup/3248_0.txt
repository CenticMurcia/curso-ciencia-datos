I have seen Flaaklypa Grand Prix over 200-400 times. Not kidding! I just have to say that it is the best movie ever! Normally I don't like to see a movie more then 1 or 2 times, but Flaaklypa is different! The movie makes me happy and you get a picture of how Norway was before! It may be difficult to understand all the humour in the movie if you are not from Norway, but it is still a great movie! The music, the sounds, the dolls, the little details, everything! An example is when Reodor(the mecanic), Solan (the bird) and Ludvig are watching tv. There is a dead moose head on the wall, and when they are watching tv it looks down with its eyes for a while!<br /><br />That is just an example of the humorous details in the movie! So just go and buy it! Now!
