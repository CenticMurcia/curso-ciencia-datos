Three episodes in, and this show is so far hilarious... the interview segments are sweepingly satirical, whilst the actual "show" itself, Darkplace, is VERY funny. Bad acting, hilarious dialogue, great cuts, great dodgy special effects, it runs the full gamut of fun-poking. I can't wait for it to be released on DVD!
