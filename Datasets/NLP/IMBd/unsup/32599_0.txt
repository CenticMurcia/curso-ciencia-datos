Rafi (Thurman) just got divorced and starts seeing a younger man (Greenberg), whose mother (Streep) is her Therapist. This is not good.<br /><br />If I didn't know better I would say this is an bad infomercial for all Jewish mothers who are really concerned that their sons marry nice Jewish girls, have Jewish kidsÂ….well you get the idea.<br /><br />I have seen Jewish mothers who are concerned about their sons marrying non-Jewish girls and they are not silent, or reserved about it. No way. Lisa (Streep) must, of course, show a certain reserve when treating patients. Okay, we know that. But, that aside, she should have been a raving lunatic about her son going with and getting serious about a non-Jewish girl, who is also quite older than her son. But, she doesn't play it that way. That would have made for a better show. I do believe she was miscast. Ooops, did I step on a national treasure? <br /><br />Now, the chemistry between Rafi and David (Greenberg) was non-existent. I cannot fault Thurman. She did everything that was called for, but Greenberg needed more coaching. He acted too much like a 40-year old. His face never, never changed expression, never. Not that he should have been doing silly things because of his age, but because he didn't show the passion he should have. The jumping of someone's bones doesn't count here. The jumping was in the script. His passion should have come from him. Never did. Everything was played with a lump in his throat. Thurman had the passion, but not enough for the both of them. I think she should get some kind of award for this.<br /><br />And, they call this a comedy? Where was the comedy? Where were the Jewish jokes? Even the tame ones? There was enough material here to keep me in stitches, but no one did anything with it. Where is Molly Goldberg when you need her?<br /><br />For "comedy", I cannot count David's friend who smashes pies into the faces of girls who won't give him a second date. The first time was funny, shocking when you first see it. . After that it was pathetic.<br /><br />Sometimes I wonder why certain movies are made. Here there was nothing, no impact, nothing. They could have used a better title too. Prime? Yes, I get it, just don't like it.
