What in the name of Slumdog Millionaire is this? Mind you, I loved Rushmore, but Oh Lord! How do you screw up a cast like this? And how do you misuse Bill Murray by just letting him run for a train he clearly won't catch? <br /><br />The Whitman brothers reunite after a year of estrangement on a train in India of all places. Francis is the oldest bro with his face banged up pretty badly, creating itineraries on what to do, what to see, etc. on the trip and intent on staying on schedule, all the while it's all a plan for the three of them to reunite with their mother who abandoned them after their father died (not even attending the funeral) to be some nun in a quasi church/ashram/temple/somethingorother. Peter is the middle bro whose about to be a father and not too keen about it, tends to steal things like Francis' belt, hangs on to his dead father's things, and buys a cobra for...I have no friggin idea why. Jack is the youngest still hung up on a ex-girlfriend back in Paris, but has no problem having a quickie with Rita, the stewardess on the train. After all their secrets come out, getting thrown off the train, trying to rescue some kids but one unfortunately dies, attending the funeral, and finally seeing runaway delusional mom who apparently has no interest in her sons' lives, abandons them yet again that the brothers leave on another train to, I guess, sort out their lives.<br /><br />I have no clue what the point of the film was, but all I got out of it was this: if your an adult and your surviving parent decides to run away to join some ashram/cult/whatever instead of attending the dead spouses' funeral, forget searching for them, just cut your loses and move on.
