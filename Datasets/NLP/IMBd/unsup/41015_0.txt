for all of you, if you're like myself, who enjoy watching a good B movie to bag on it, this isnt any good. it's boring, plain and simple. there really isn't anything to grasp on to. the cast seems stuck in a wasteland of bad writing, directing, and editing. and a lot of people would probably check this out for curiosity's sake, to see John Travolta's first role. the problem isn't that the role is small, but you really don't see him too much, or too clearly. and when you do, he has on very cheap makeup that looks like a facial mask in a beauty saloon. Ernest Borgnine, as one poster said, does seem very at ease here. if anything, this is his picture. that is, there's way too much of him, and not enough of William Shatner. i wanted more bad acting for the Willmeister, because he does it like nobody else can. Tom Skerrit has on a fake mustache and a large black wig and resembles one of the banditos in TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE ('We dont need no stinking Satanists!). but it was nice to see the lady who played David's girlfriend in 8 is Enough, she's a hottie. so anyway, this movie, unlike Troll2 and a whole lotta other great bagable B horror flicks, isnt any fun at all - avoid it and... live long and prosper....!!!
