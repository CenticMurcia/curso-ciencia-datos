When we saw the previews to this, we thought, wow, that looks really funny! Well, guess what? All the funny stuff was in the previews!! And sadly, these previews were probably the only parts of the movie that could be shown on TV. This movie was raunchy, rude, disgusting and just plain foul. I suppose if that is your sense of humor, then it will go over very well for you. However, for me, it was all in very bad taste. I wasn't one bit surprised when the family in front of us with 3 young boys under the age of 13 left the theater about 15 minutes after the film started. This was certainly not intended to be a kid's movie. I don't even think I would let a teenager watch this one. It took one of the best kid's movies ever made and turned it into a nightmare. We felt it was so bad that we immediately had to go see another movie to get the bad taste out of our mouths and the horrible images out of our heads. Parents BEWARE! This is not an appropriate movie for anyone under the age of 21!! And even then, I wouldn't suggest it. For those of you who actually liked this movie - I feel sorry for you and your sense of humor!
