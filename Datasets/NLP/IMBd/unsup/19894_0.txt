"Waiting for Guffman" was a little bit of genius. "Best in Show" and "Mighty Wind" expanded on the same concept: focusing on a sub-culture of people who take their little world entirely too seriously. Unfortunately, "For Your Consideration" lacks the subtle satire of Guest's recent efforts.<br /><br />The beauty of the previous films was the bubble-world of the cast. The assumption of the viewer is, outside this microcosm, exists the "real world." That illusion is broken in "Consideration," with its all-too-broad send up of "Entertainment Tonight," "Wake Up L.A." and similar shows. It would have been funnier if the Oscar buzz was a complete construct WITHIN the set of "Purim", and then later, the realization there was no Oscar buzz at all.<br /><br />The humor wasn't as sharp as previous efforts. For example, the handful of characters that were unfamiliar with the internet ... that didn't ring true. Worst of all, there's a cruelty toward the characters in "For Your Consideration" that didn't sit well with me. All in all, a disappointment.
