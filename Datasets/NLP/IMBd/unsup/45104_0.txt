A good thing they hardly ever show Montgomery because he is completely unbelievable as Marlowe. How and why he ever falls seriously for Audrey Totter, whose characterization of a phony female is overdone even for the time, is one of the mysteries of the film. Audrey Meadows steals the show as a ditzy possible murderess. All in all a poorly done detective flick.
