OK, much has already been said about the ridiculous plot; total lack of research, shopping mall props and general total ignorance exhibited within every facet of this film. Evidently it was directed with contempt for the audience's intelligence. It did occur to me early on that this whole film might be a mis-packaged spoof of all the bad films that went before, but no - they appear to have been serious in their attempt. Although how anyone could think people would not notice the continuity errors (e.g. red rope/blue rope, tarmac outside the mountain-top gun station, Nissen huts suddenly changing shape, etc etc) is beyond me.<br /><br />But the crowning glory for me was:<br /><br />Do the producers really think that there are pine trees at the summit of K2?
