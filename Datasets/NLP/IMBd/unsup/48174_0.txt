True, I was given a warning that this was a bad movie. I proceeded at my own peril, especially since I have rather enjoyed some truly awful movies in the past. The difference here is that "Revelation" takes itself waaaay too seriously (speaking as a Christian!) to make up for the complete and total lack of quality. The plot itself had some potential. Unfortunately, none of that potential was fulfilled. I can only describe the dialogue between the actors as tired and predictable thanks to a lousy script and lackluster acting. This only served to uncover a glaring truth: this movie features the worst directing I've ever witnessed. Safe to say, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm really trying to be positive, I swear. Can I say one nice thing about it? At least it was only the length of an average children's movie. I still can't believe I sat through the whole movie! Please tell me they're kidding when they list *4* of these in a series?!?!? Best to avoid this one.
