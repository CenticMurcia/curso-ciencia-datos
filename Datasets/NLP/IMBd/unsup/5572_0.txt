Yeah I said it! "Reaper" is just that. The trio has the same relationship and sense of comic timing that the Ghost trappin' quartet had in the films and animated series.<br /><br />The difference is that the ghosts are demons. Well sort of. I guess I'm splitting hairs here with the analogy.<br /><br />Aside from that, Reaper is just a damn good time. Bret Harrison must've inherited some of Topher Grace's comic timing on that 70's Show because he's great as Sam. He's a normal Joe who's makes the best of the worst kind of situation. Great leader. Tyler Labine's past performances as "burn-outs/dudes" sure prepared him to play the ultimate stoner geek freak. Rick Gonzalez is perfect as the straight-man with a conscious. Many kudos go to veteran Ray Wise as "The Devil" who chews the scenery up with a big, bleached smile. Last but not least is Christine Willes as Gladys the DMV/Hell (not much difference) customer service rep. Dead pan comedy at its finest.<br /><br />The stories are basically the same as Brimstone: Find the escaped Hell souls and return them to hell.<br /><br />The plot is simple but its not the baddies so much that make Reaper worthwhile: its the boys. They're fun to watch and you really root for them. They fight with what little wits they have and with the oddest of materials. The "vessels" are a hoot. Each soul gets their own vessel to be used on them and in different ways.<br /><br />Funny, silly, action packed and genuinely entertaining. Great show.
