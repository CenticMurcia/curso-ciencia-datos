The movie is a true Balkan Love story - Sex, Passion, Love, Tragedy. If you watch some of the American romantic comedies before watching Karaula, you'll see the diff–µrences. And there's a second line of the story (that is a bit difficult for people outside the Balkans to understand - which is the reason for the words on the screen at the end of the film) - all the main characters are from different ex-Yugoslavian countries, but they are no different as people. So when you start watching the film you get the feeling of a happy story, maybe even comedy, but the film goes deeper and deeper. Pretty good film, makes you think. Actors are perfect, maybe because it's a true story and it's not very different from what happens in their real life. So go and watch it if you have the chance, you wouldn't regret it.
