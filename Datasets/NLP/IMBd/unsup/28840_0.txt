Theory says that a good movie should be understood even if you don't know the language in which it's spoken. Well, my notions of french are so-so, but I followed pretty well the plot of the movie, thanks to the great performances and visceral emotions described in it. I'll try to propose watching the movie in my french class. I can only hope that Audiard movies grew bigger and bigger in ambition and craftsmanship, in a time where good crime movies are barely seen in and out Hollywood. Great film, and great title. I'll never grow tired of recite it (in french, of course). Now i'll try to see "Fingers", the James Toback film in which "De battre mon coeur s'est arret√©" is based.
