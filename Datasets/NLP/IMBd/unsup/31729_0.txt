Big relief here that Bates's modern classic has not only survived its transition to the big screen but has actually been enhanced by it. It's difficult to find anything in this made-for-television adaptation that is at odds with the book of the same name. The characters are well cast, in particular David Jason as Pop Larkin and Pam Ferris as Ma, who live life with abandonment and cavalier disregard for society's expectations. The conversion of Charlie, a most challenging task in story and film, is accomplished with care and precision, Catherine Zeta Jones as Mariette providing the required enticement. This is a highly entertaining and deeply satisfying adaptation, and richly captures the life of post-war Britain. Perfick!
