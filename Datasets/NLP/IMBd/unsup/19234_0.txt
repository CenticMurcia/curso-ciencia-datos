What made this movie to Cann, and winning the Canadian film festival is, it bold production design, Very Brave to be difference, It also does capture and show beautiful scene though, While I was seeing this movie I just fell like I was in a real stage theater. How bold could it be with the burn yellow and sweetest pink comprised with quite a strange but nice music in the background?<br /><br />It would be nice if they have done a more homework for the script. (I still feel missing something in the story line.)<br /><br />Unfortunately it was brought to compare with last year CT-HT, I would prefer this movie rather than CT-HT,<br /><br />I'm not a movie snob but if you have seen the a hundred of HK martial art movie you will realize that that CT-HT is SOOOO DARN ORDINARY with the cliché-ending scene, Chorography that actually no better than a HK B grade martial art movie, how slow is the story line And if you compare in term of budget wise. With so little money Tear of the Black Tiger' have spend, does give us some good remark in the film industry.<br /><br />For me Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, (Sleepy Tiger Boring Dragon) is a real BOO-HOO,<br /><br />Tear of the Black Tiger is something that catching my eye..
