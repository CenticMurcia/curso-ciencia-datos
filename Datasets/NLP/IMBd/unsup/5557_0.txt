Well I am positively surprised how good this movie actually was. Not sure why sometimes it's branded 'horror'because it's more like dramatic thriller. I liked the story and I liked the characters who were rich and believable. For the first time 'a chick' didn't annoy me:)and there was more to her than meets the eye. The story begins when a couple of newlyweds decides to take a trip to the Grand Canyon. Their guide is a rough, heavy drinking guy, who promises them an unforgettable experience. The trip however does not go as planned. I think this film is a solid piece. Don't expect more than 140min of adventure/survival flick and you won't be disappointed. It kept me focused and interested. Well worth seeing.
