P. a. i. n. f. u. l.<br /><br />Absurd, insultingly banal sex farce that attempts to make some obvious statement about reformed gays but the screenwriters and director are too superficial to accomplish this simple a task. The film is chock full of character with names like "Marc's Trick," "Hot Shirtless Guy" and "Hot Clothed Guy" - I'd rather receive a hot glue enema than sit through this a second time, but this film does raise so many questions: Why do people see movies like this when there are so many quality films out right now? After watching this, do people immediately rush home to take a shower? Will any of these actors ever work again? What can we, as a civilization, do to stop Phillip J. Bartell from directing another film?
