This was a very touching movie. This movie made me cry upon thinking of it the next day. Very few movies have done that to me. I was particularly struck by what a sweet and pure performance that Sondra Locke gave as Mick. And the loneliness that Alan Arkin portrayed as John Singer really resonated with me. I really liked how Mick dealt with this and the snobbery too. Why no one received an Oscar for this movie is beyond me.<br /><br />My only criticism with this film is that is seemed to try to hit too many emotional chords in too short a span of time. It tried to do too much all at once and I noticed myself being left with a slight disappointment and rushed feeling that points were left undeveloped. The loneliness and snobbery were quite enough to deal with without all the racism too. It seemed like a whole other movie was somehow lurking in the background. Perhaps this is the fault of the book. I plan to read it since I think it will develop these points much better.<br /><br />Although all the racism had a definite impact, I can't help thinking that the movie would have been simpler and sweeter without it. I suppose longing for a simple and sweet melancholy resolution and being left with an unsettled feeling was what Carson McCullers may have been after.<br /><br />Still a great and timeless movie!
