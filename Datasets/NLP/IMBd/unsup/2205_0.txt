Must have been 16 years ago since I saw this movie for the very first time, as a kid just 10 years old. Last week I made a trip to memory lane and boy did I got entertained ! Highway to Hell tells the story of Charlie Sykes (Chad Lowe) and Rachel Clark (Kristy Swanson)on a trip to Las Vegas to get secretly married. While driving on the Interstate Charlie decides to take a shortcut but finds out he should've listened to his girlfriend and just kept driving on the main roads. They stop at a gas station for a quick fill and have a strange encounter with the attendant and owner named Sam (Richard Farnsworth). He warns Charlie not to fall asleep on the road ahead, but as you can guess this is exactly what happened. He wakes up to find out a strange cop named "Hellcop" arrests them and takes Rachel with him. Charlie hurries back to the gas station and tells Sam the situation. Sam explains he has to get to Hell because that is where Hellcop took his fianc√©e.<br /><br />Then the adventure begins ! As a Kid I just loved the creativity of Hell and it's citizens. There's a lot of comedy in this movie, like you see in most Horror movies from this era. Horror is a genre which doesn't fit this movie well anyways. There are even Cameo's of the Stiller's ( Ben (in one of his first movies), his father Jerry and his sister ). If you're into Comedy-Horror movies then you shouldn't miss this gem. It's very underrated and to a lot of people this classic has become a cult-movie. Take this roller-coaster ride to hell and I'm sure you'll have a big smile on your face at the end.
