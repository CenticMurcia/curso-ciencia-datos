Saw this at the Dead by Dawn film festival in Edinburgh and it was the best short film screened there this year in my opinion.<br /><br />Essentially this is a one man show with Scott Graham alone with an evil mirror for much of the running time. While this doesn't sound particularly exciting, this growing feeling of paranoia and the increasing madness of the lone character propel the story.<br /><br />Keep an eye on the video monitors that have been set up for the experiment, it's a small but very creepy touch.<br /><br />Oculus is part 3 of a 9 part story. If Mike Flanagan can keep up this level of invention then I look forward to further entries.
