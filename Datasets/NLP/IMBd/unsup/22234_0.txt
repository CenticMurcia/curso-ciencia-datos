Who's That Knocking at My Door is a very good extension of Martin Scorsesee's student film. Harvey Keitel, in his first role, is very good as a man who falls into a doomed relationship with a girl he meets on the Long Island Ferry. I bought this movie as part of the The Scorsesee Collection because I wanted Goodfellas and Mean Streets. I figured the other movies were bonuses. Who's That Knocking at My Door is the surprise of the bunch. Although the movie makes very little sense going from one scene to another, it is still engrossing to watch. You could probably see this movie today as a rough draft for the far superior Mean Streets. Still it is interesting to watch and you should get it with The Scorsesee Collection to see how a gifted filmmaker grew from this film to Goodfellas, arguably his best film (though a legitimate case could be Raging Bull, but you need to buy another collection to get that one).
