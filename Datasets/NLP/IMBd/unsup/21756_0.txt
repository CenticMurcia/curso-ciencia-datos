A pathetic excuse for seeing a lot of naked girls, this Fred Olen Ray apocriph production is a lesbian feast, with several almost always naked female ghosts doing a lot of two-some, three-some and four-some while a team of reporters shoots a documentary on them. Julie Strain appears only in two erotic scenes (both with the porcelain twins, a couple of blondes resembling - but only for the face, as she as definitely better boobs - Italian pornstar Selen), while in the other five you have a couple each with Aria Giovanni (another goddess of this kind of movies), Mia Zottoli (also known as Ava Lake), Felony and Nicole Specht.<br /><br />The movie starts well, with a pool scene among Julie and the Twins involving a silver dildo, but it becomes almost boring for the rest, apart from a few very good moments (as the sado-maso scene involving again Julie and the Twin and also the final four some, involving all the rest of the female cast), with really annoying fake moans, always out of synchro. Good, yes, for the genre, but could be a lot much better than this
