Kim is an okay film, but has too many weaknesses. At least they actually filmed it in India... <br /><br />The worst aspect is Peter O'Toole who looked terrible, acted terribly, whose spirituality was expressed through empty platitudes and lack of any kind of foresight. He seems more like a lost old man than a holy man. And the fake bald rubber head cap was just ugly. Sheesh. <br /><br />I'd skip it and watch something else, like Ghandi. With Bollywood turning out so many films it is amazing that this film could be so bad.<br /><br />For those who get bored halfway through can have fun watching the Indian extras trying and failing to avoid looking into the lens.
