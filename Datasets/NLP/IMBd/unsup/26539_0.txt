I have earlier seen Modern Times (which actually god dialog and singing in it) and City Lights (which had melodies in it), both were great (I need to rewatch City Lights though.<br /><br />Anyways, today I watched my first true silent film. The Thief of Bagdad (1924) and it will most probably land in my top 50 or close to it. That means it's better than any 30's film I have seen. I just loved pretty much everything with this film and surprisingly enough the special effects (without counting the horse riding on the skies) were perfect. Fairbanks and the rest of the cast were to my surprise extremely good too, who would have thought that about a silent. I'm just truly glad I decided to give this film a try. It's only problem was the constant changing of colors which would disappear if someone took the time to restore it. Overall 98.5%.
