License to Wed <br /><br />For quite a long time now, I've begun to think that I've become an easy-going critic about the movies I watch. But now I realize simply that I have been watching good movies, and "License to Wed" is a healthy reminder to myself that I can still recognize the sight of horrid cinema when it veers before my eyes.<br /><br />John Krasinksi as Ben Murphy, and Mandy Moore as Sadi, are an engaged couple, preparing for marriage. But unluckily for them, in their church community, they have to pass a "marriage course" before they can wed. And that course is run by priest-from-hell (if there ever was such a thing) Reverend Frank (Robin Williams). That's all you need to, or want to, know about this movie.<br /><br />The most awful part of "License to Wed", as with many Robin Williams, it is not funny at all. I didn't laugh once through its entire run, nor even come close to cracking a smile. The jokes were either all ready used, just not funny, or so predictable they made me want to leave the theater. But the horrible writing continues; Reverend Frank is absolutely insane, not a likable quirky man at all. He is a psychopath, make no mistake; bugging peoples houses, training a poor kid to do anything he said, and turning loved ones into worst enemies. The many scenarios that the characters are put into, make no sense at all (I'm sure Ben would start insulting family members in a game for no reason; they could have left those fake babies at home) and neither do the Reverend's tests (what the hell does driving have to do with marriage?). And at the end, why exactly are Ben and Sadi thankful for what Frank did? <br /><br />Mandy Moore stays in a perpetual state of perkiness, Robin Williams tries so hard to be quirky but he's really just scary, and John Krasinski gains my sympathy for having to put up with it all (not that he's any better).<br /><br />The only good part in this movie for me was when the Reverend got punched out by Ben. I thanked God. 1/10 (but I'd like to give it a zero)
