I saw this movie on SBS (Australia) two years ago and have scanned the TV guide for it to come on again every week since! I loved it! This movie is the reason that I first became interested in learning Japanese language and about the culture (and I'm still doing it with the intention of becoming a teacher in Japan).<br /><br />I found the end to be, like a lot of movies that build you up, quite disappointing, but the attractiveness of the actors and the relative originality of the plot more than made up for it. Yoshino Kimika's character Misa is captivating - you can *see* she's no normal Japanese high school girl. Yoshino's doubtful earlier movie career must have brightened considerably on the release of this movie.<br /><br />However, Yoshino is not the only star in this production. Miho Kanno plays the submissive sacrificial lamb of the school, and with her plaintive face and doe eyes, you just can't help but go 'Awww' whenever she appears on the screen. The others, and unfortunately I can't remember all of their name, are equally as satisfying.<br /><br />For those of you who can't or won't understand Japanese culture, this movie may confuse you and frustrate you. However, those more open-minded of you who are willing to look past the cover, please see this movie!! I can't guarantee you won't be disappointed, but after all, beauty is in the eye of the movie critic.<br /><br />10 out of 10 for some great work by all involved.
