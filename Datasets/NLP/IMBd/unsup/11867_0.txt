Ray Harryhausen fans beware. If you love the man who gave such great creatures for movies like JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS and THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD and THE 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD, don't buy this movie. It's horrible. Instead of having cool skeletons, or six armed god statues, we get to see a giant Walrus and a killer bumble bee. Oh boy! (There is NOTHING better than once inanimate things coming to life... I prefer that to giant Cyclops' or otherwise already living creatures, as far as Ray's work goes.) Patrick Wayne's acting is possibly worse than the storyline, and there is no storyline. This movie is Harryhausen the special effects genius in SLEEP MODE. Avoid it like the Black Plague.
