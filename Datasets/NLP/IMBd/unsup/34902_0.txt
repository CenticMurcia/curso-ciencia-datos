This movie sucked so bad. The director apparently phoned in his job. I read the book twice and could not wait to see this pile of crap. The production was terrible. The action scenes were done at night which is always a giveaway that the director is pocketing money.<br /><br />There were so many plot points missed that it is not easily followed. The relationships between characters are changed for what seems like no good reason. The ending has been changed again for no good reason, except maybe to save money (again).<br /><br />The only comparable movie to this disaster is DreamCatcher, but thats another story! Its been 3 years and I hope this movie never sees the light of day again.<br /><br />Read the book!
