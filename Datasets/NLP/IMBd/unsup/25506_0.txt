Both leads are perfect in their roles and the chemistry between them is breathtaking. Best romantic scene is when Rochester thanks Jane for saving him from the bedroom fire - as Rochester holds onto Jane's hands, the glances they exchange and when Rochester says 'Jane' after a silent pause as she walks out of his room - speaks volumes. The funniest scene is the gypsy scene which I had not seen in the film version in 1996 and was a welcome surprise. Both are also average-looking rather than gorgeous which makes the story more believable although Sorcha is beautiful in a classic way. Both leads are the best Jane and Rochester.
