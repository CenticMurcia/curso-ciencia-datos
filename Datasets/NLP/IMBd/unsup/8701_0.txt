I was intruigued by the title of the movie and I am glad that they waited til near the end to reveal why it was red. I liked how the movie wove together the tarot readings and the different owners of the red violin and I also liked how it was all again brought together at the auction. I don't mind reading subtitles- that made the parts of the movie that were in Germany and China and Italy more authentic. The music was very good and the story that most touched me was that of Kaspar Weiss the little boy with so much talent and such a weak body. A very good film- I also enjoyed the directors other work abou Gould- he has a knack for typing music and stories together.
