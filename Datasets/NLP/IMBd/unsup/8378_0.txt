If the name Armand Mastroianni rings a bell, it's because he directed "He Knows You're Alone", most famous as Tom Hanks's movie debut. This is the only other movie of his with which I'm familiar. If this is any indication, he went downhill after giving Hanks a start. A number of the horror flicks that I've seen on FearNet - even if they lack a masterful plot - have some great music ("Down", "Blood Diner" and "Waxwork" are the prime examples). "Cameron's Closet" doesn't even have that. It's another "Exorcist" rip-off. How ironic that the man who directs these sorts of movies gave a debut to a back-to-back Oscar-winning actor. Life really is a box of chocolates after all...but don't bite this one.
