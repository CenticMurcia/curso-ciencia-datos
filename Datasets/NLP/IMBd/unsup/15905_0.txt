This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Hearts and Minds, and Roger and Me, and Farenheit 9/ll, and even Supersize Me are way up there for me, but this one is compelling. I live in a part of the country where controversial documentaries are seldom seen, so I'm a long time getting to this one, but, wow! I just rented it and I'll be watching it again before I send it back. It's very, very good. I'm a woman with some years on me, so a documentary about a man admittedly so hostile to women, whose work is sometimes pornographic, and racist as well, is not someone I would ordinarily pay any attention to, except in a forensic kind of way, but Crumb's story is riveting. What a wacky family! He and his two brothers (his two sisters declined the spotlight) seem to have been just a skosh away from becoming serial rapists or worse--yet it didn't happen. This documentary leaves you wanting more. There are hints, broad hints, about what caused the three brothers to become so dysfunctional. Yet, it's very, very odd isn't it? Crumb, in spite of it all, is a likable and familiar sort of a guy. This documentary, apparently now 11 years old, will leave you wanting to find out more about this family.
