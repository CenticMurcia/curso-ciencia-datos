It's well known in horror circles that the sequel to Pumpkinhead is one of the all time worst sequels ever made. I rented it with this in mind and braced myself for something horrible. I was surprised that the movie DID! have some entertaining value. <br /><br />I guess if you thought the first Pumpkinhead was awesome, this movie would be a let down. The original does have a following, but I always thought it was just sort of standard, and the sequel is the same. Not horrible, just so-so.<br /><br />Pumpkinhead is a cool monster, the scariest thing about him are those giant hands that can wrap around your head and crush your skull. Since this movie shows that happen, I wasn't disappointed. Low standards, sure, but what makes a Pumpkinhead movie for me is giant hands crushing heads, I got that, I was happy.<br /><br />Plus, this is apart of the Ami Dolenz horror movie library that includes Witchboard 2 and Ticks. So if your a fan of that subgenre like I'm not, you should check this out just for completionist purposes.<br /><br />All and all, pretty darn bad, but some fun and retarded things to keep you entertained. Loved the wires moving Pumpkinhead's arms around during the climax. Them wire's cool!
