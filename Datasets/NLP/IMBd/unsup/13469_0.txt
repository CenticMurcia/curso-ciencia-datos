Not a good movie indeed. Far too much talking, and not enough cars eating Paris. Wait, what am I talking about? THERE WERE NO CARS EATING PARIS!!! What kind of a stupid title is that?!? How can you call a movie something it is not?! There was no eating, and there definately was no Paris like I imagined. I did not imagine a rinky dink little town in Australia that ran cars off the road in order to build more cars... This movie had no plot connections, no likeable characters, and where did that growl come from?!?! AUGGHHHH!!! Do not watch this movie, even if it's because people say not to. It's just that bad.
