This film is the biz! The "Plot" is at best flimsy, but if we are honest, there is no plot. The acting is appallingly poor to the point of being offensive and the special effects are less than special.<br /><br />This film is a must! It is utterly crap and absolute genius. It is the kind of movie that ranks alongside eternal classics like Plan 9 and Tarantula. There is a fight between two reptile Dinosaur type beasties that is straight out of the Chewits ad of the 80's with the monster eating the leaning tower of Piza, the Taj Mahal and the Empire State Building. It is so 5h1t that you simply must see it.<br /><br />Go forth and scour the bargain bins of the local petrol station. Visit Charity shops. Trawl the internet. Find this movie.<br /><br />It is a piece of cinematic gold!
