No spoilers, It is hard to spoil something that is already rotten. <br /><br />All I could think is. "Wow, I bet George regrets doing this one." I am generally a fan of George Clooney, in fact O Brother, Where Art Thou? has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time and Oceans 11 was an entertaining movie by the same Director/Actor, But this flick stunk.<br /><br />I would comment more on the movie but it wasn't really memorable.
