Indeed a copycat as already was written. Makeup is nice, casting great, acting reasonable to good, but the movie itself is very boring. I like the genre but the music isn't very good, there is no climax building up and the story stretches along slowly. One of the few movies I had to use the FF function to get to at least a little bit of things happening, besides the no good dialogs. Furthermore, metal or hard-rock (whatever it's called) music is louder then spoken words which made me have to use the volume button more often. Loud music is no warranty for a climax and in this case it causes rather more of an anti-climax and irritation.<br /><br />I suggest you pass this movie or when you're really a genre-lover, wait until you get it almost for free. No exciting and sitting on the edge of the couch in this one.<br /><br />Still I gave this movie a 3 because of cast, acting, makeup and stuff.
