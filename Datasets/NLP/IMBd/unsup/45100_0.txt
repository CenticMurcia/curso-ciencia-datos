Smirnoff Ice is mentioned about three dozen times in this movie; it's even mentioned in the "Evil Alien Conqueror" theme song that's played at the end as the credits roll! <br /><br />For some strange reason, Tori Spelling wasn't originally credited in this movie, although her appearance as Jan is, in my opinion, the only thing that makes this movie worth watching. I've never seen her look anything less than fabulous, but her waist looks particularly long and slender in this movie. Unfortunately, the most skin she shows is her face and arms. Her most sensual and erotic scene is when one of the Evil Alien Conquerors feels up her hairy "unibrow".
