There is little to recommend this. It's a silly tale of some people trying to develop a remote control plane to be used in war. Most of it is a meaningless romance where spoiled people are holed up in the desert. One is trying to teach the others a lesson. Some gasoline is stolen, some bad guys come to mess things up, but mostly not a thing happens. There is a lot of screaming and pratfalls. The main character is pretty tiresome. The joke goes on and on and on. The plane, which should be the star of the show, is practically non-existent. It would be interesting to see what technology there was at the time. I'm sure the truth of that question would be much more interesting than anything that happens in this film.
