As someone who does his research, I find it hard to believe that Scientologists haven't done a mass spamming of 10-Star ratings to get this movie into the top 250. But then I remember there aren't enough Scientologists to counter common sense.<br /><br />The story is based off a book that can best be described as pulp. It's clich√©, over the top, unrealistic and the human hero is a self-insertion of L. Ron's on belief that he was the greatest man to have ever lived. And that's not true by a long shot, since I'm here.<br /><br />So anyway, the idea is that in the year 3000 CE humans are dominated by a malicious race known as "Psychlos" (L. Ron instilled a fear of Psychiartrists into Scientologists, or "Psyches" as he called them, claiming they were behind the concentration camps in Nazi Germany) and humanity has turned into a bunch of pack animals that eat rocks and rats. The Psychlos are using people to hunt for gold (again, one of L. Ron's batshit crazy beliefs) and misuse them and treat them like animals.<br /><br />That's about as far as I got. I watched about 45 minutes of this crap and couldn't finish it. What has is bad has already been said and is deserving of the critique.<br /><br />But take a moment to think about this. L. Ron wrote this...thing...and was meant to have written the 'holy' texts of the Church of Cashmaking, er, Scientology. If people are taking this as fact, then there is something wrong with them. As I said. I did my research. People believe this is going to be a real future event. Pathetic.
