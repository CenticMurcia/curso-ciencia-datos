This was a great 1933 Classic film to enjoy the great acting of Ann Harding, (Joan Colby) and William Powell, (John Fletcher). This film takes place during the great depression and Joan Colby is an older woman who has not married and her sister, Valerie Colby, (Lucile Brown) is planning to get married which sort of puts the pressure on Joan to do the same thing and not become an old maid. Joan takes an interest in John Fletcher, (William Powell) who is the owner of a Steamship business and at the same time a playboy with lots of women and his business is not doing very well. However, Joan is aware of John's way of living and she manages to trick him into marrying her, even though she does not love him and he has the exact same feelings towards her. After several months of marriage, this couple decide to get a divorce and end their so called marriage relationship. During these months of marriage, Joan is able to conduct business meetings with government people and is able to secure contracts for the Steamship business. John continues to play around, but Joan never gives up on John and the plot gets a bit complicated. From some of the background photography this film wants you to believe this story takes place in San Francisco, California. Enjoy a great old time Classic film.
