Of all the Humphery Bogart movies I have seen, The Two Mrs Carrolls proved he could make a good, creepy villain.<br /><br />After the death of his first wife by poisoning her with milk he had spiked, Bogie, who plays a psychopathic artist meets another woman and marries her and he intends to do the same with her as he is having an affair with someone else. The second Mrs Carroll gradually gets suspicious of his behaviour and eventually finds out what he did to his first wife and manages to call the police. She refuses to drink a glass of milk he gives her and the police then arrive and he is arrested at the end, keeping calm despite this.<br /><br />Although Bogie only appeared in one horror movie, The Return of Doctor X, The Two Mrs Carrolls certainly has horror elements.<br /><br />Joining Bogie in the cast are Barbara Stanwyck, Dr Watson himself Nigel Bruce (appropiantly as a doctor and a very similar role to Watson too) and Alexis Smith. Excellent parts from all.<br /><br />The Two Mrs Carrolls is a must for all Bogie fans and is certainly worth the Â£1.50 I paid for it. Excellent stuff.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
