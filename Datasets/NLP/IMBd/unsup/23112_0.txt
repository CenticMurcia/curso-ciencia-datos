What a tedious movie. Climbing a mountain with a backpack full of rocks would be more enjoyable than sitting through this movie.<br /><br />Characters interactions are completely deficient. Irrelevant dialogue is horrendous. Might possibly have been better as a silent movie.<br /><br />Story is so uninspired that I wonder if it was actually written by someone or if this is just some random computer generated stuff.<br /><br />Some interesting points : - After half an hour of watching this movie, you feel like it still hasn't started but yet, at the same time, you feel like it's been playing for hours. Adds to the supernatural value.<br /><br />- As pointed out in other reviews, it doesn't really have any scary factor but it might make you feel sick. If that's the kind of thing you're looking for...<br /><br />- The only real surprise, to me, was that the friendly black man, with supernatural open-mindness, doesn't get killed by an axe.<br /><br />Worth a laugh or two.<br /><br />I'd rather watch a movie about lava lamps.
