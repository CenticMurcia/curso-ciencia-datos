UNDERSEA KINGDOM must rank at the very bottom of the cliffhanger serials. Why`s it so bad ? Well it was shown on consecutive nights on BBC2 many years ago and watching every episode less than 24 hours apart it becomes patently obvious that the audience are being cheated . Every single cliffhanger is re-edited at the reprise , the worst example is an episode that finishes with a tank that has the hero strapped to its front smashing through a wooden gate of a fort , a loud crash , splinters everywhere there is no way our hero could possibly have survived the impact - then the following episode shows ( !!!!POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!! ) the people inside the fort opening the gate before the tank crashes through . This goes beyond cheating and remains the worst resolution to a cliffhanger ever . So give this rubbish a miss unless you`re interested in seeing Lon Chaney Jr in a cameo in the first episode or you`re wanting to laugh at some bizarre robots who are obviously men with a water boiler over their heads
