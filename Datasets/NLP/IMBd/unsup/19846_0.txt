OK i wont be long but i gotta say this, i watched this movie because of the other recommendations (i.e. The eternal sunshine of the spotless mind) but i ended up wasting one hr and a bit of my life. As the others stated, the movie has no point no story line and has absolutely no life into it...it does nothing other than selling sex like many movies these days but yeah besides that the actors seem to force themselves into acting, it just doesn't look natural. And i just want to restate what the other 2 comments say, what couple so young (oh btw Alexis Dziena looks like shes 15) already have problems like that...anyway i could ramble on and on but i think i got my point across
