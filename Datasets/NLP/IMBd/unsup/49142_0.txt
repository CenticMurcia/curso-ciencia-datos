I had the displeasure of seeing this movie at the Sundance Film Festival, and my sole purpose of writing this comment is to prevent any sane person from seeing it as well.<br /><br />When I heard of the premise about a mockumentary about the new-found patriotism everybody seemed to have after 9-11, I was definitely looking forward to The War Effort. After almost two hours of poorly done homosexual-dildo jokes (as if they could be done in good taste), horrible improvised "acting" performances, and overall immature storyline, I am questioning how this movie could even have been produced in the first place.<br /><br />Perhaps I am being too harsh. If you would like to see a movie that looks to be made by a team of middle-school kids, by all means, enjoy the show!
