I'm a big fan of the complete series of six million dollar man; and this episode is the best of all I've seen. I hope If they gone a make a movie of the six million dollar man, they respect the story and the tradition of this character. I'm only have 3 years old when I see for first time this episode and let me tell you that this experience is still in my memory. the character of big foot it was so real, Andre was the perfect actor to be this character. I'm only can say that at the present days, I can not find another character as Steve Austin (Lee Majors)in all TV's series, and I think that in many years we can see another one like the big one SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN.
