This little softporn flick seems to have a lot going for it: especially, it has (unsurprisingly) a visibly bigger budget and consequently better production values than contemporary hard porn, and contrary to most straight-to-video erotic thrillers it spares us any connections of sex with violence.<br /><br />However, this alone does not make a good movie. The production values only slightly exceed Ed Wood territory (I noticed a plastic chicken on a dining table), and the cinematography is at best irritating as the camera constantly circles around the couples making love. The couplings lack a bit of imagination and the leads lack charisma and screen presence.<br /><br />In Europe they made lots of films of this ilk in the 1970s, but this one is not up to their standard.
