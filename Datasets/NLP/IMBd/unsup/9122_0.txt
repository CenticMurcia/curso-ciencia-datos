As a teenager, my father and I would go to the local video store and rent a horror movie almost every week. After we got through all the flicks that we had at least heard of, we started on ones we never heard of. One of these flicks was "Screamtime." As stated, this film has three small stories in it. One was about a puppet that may or may not be killing people. This one is okay. The second story was about fairy's that protect this old ladies house and it was pretty dang good. The final one is the best though. It is about a family that moves into a house and the wife keeps seeing murded bodies that are not there. This one has a killer twist at the end that makes this movie worth finding and buying. You can normally get in on Ebay on VHS.
