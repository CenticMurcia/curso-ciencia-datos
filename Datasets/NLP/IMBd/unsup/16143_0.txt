BINGO, in my opinion, is a cute movie about a very special friendship between a boy and a dog. I thought that Hal and Natalie (David Rasche and Cindy Williams) were a little cold-hearted, but Chuckie (Robert J. Steinmilller Jr.) was a very sweet kid. Bingo was a sweet dog, though. He even saved Chuckie in times of trouble. Way to go, Bingo! If you ask me, that's one thing that made the bond between them so special. When Bingo was trying to catch up to Chuckie during his cross-country movie, I felt really moved inside. In conclusion, I highly recommend this movie to all you dog lovers or Cindy Williams fans who have not seen it.
