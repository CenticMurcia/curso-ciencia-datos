This film is a compelling exploration of the complex relationship between the mother-daughter relationship and the rearing of young women under duress. Set in the context of a unique Girl Scout troop whose mothers are in prison, the film explores the problematic phenomenon of isolated families with creative force. Spiro is a talent cinematographer who gives the girl scouts their own voice by teaching them how to use the tools of production to document their own story. Some of the most touching scenes come from the young women interviewing their mothers about the realities of prison life. Few films of this nature avoid the exploitation that might arise from documenting the troubled lives of those who get little support or recognition in society. Spiro takes great care to negotiate the fine line between representation and serving the community being documented. In addition, the striking images of prison life juxtaposed with girls at play are a powerful reminder of the film's for problematic. This film is definitely a must see.
