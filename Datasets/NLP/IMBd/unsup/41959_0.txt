I agree with the other posters that the husband and wife played their roles well. Other than that this movie was rubbish. It tried to be something interesting and provocative, but instead suffered from a lack of any meaningful plot, characters which one has a hard time sympathizing with, unrealistic Decalogue (give me a break, some of the conversations the characters have is so unnatural and ridiculous), and seemingly pointless side action. I can't believe someone said that this movie was better than American Desi. That movie was a lot better than this by leaps and bounds and portrayed the Indian-American experience somewhat more realistically, at least as per the reality that I have experienced. If you want a movie about the Indian American Experience try American Chai, American Desi, The Namesake, or Leela, but this is on the level of Fillum Star, Banana Brothers, and other similar movies long since forgotten.
