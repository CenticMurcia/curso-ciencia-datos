What a stroke of genius to have this film open the 7th annual Miami Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. Craig Lucas attended and was wonderful. In a time when being gay is mostly viewed as a normal part of our societal fabric (current Administration and Red States notwithstanding)this film seems to me to elude the "gay film" classification. It has a gay character, it has a bi character (yes Virginia, there are "bi" people) and they are central to the story, but they are NOT the story. (Shhh...don't tell anyone, but the gay character isn't the good guy - WHAT!?) <br /><br />For those who like their movies' plot lines all tied up in nice neat little bundles, with only one plausible explanation, "The Dying Gaul" probably isn't for you. This is a gem. Groundbreaking is the word that keeps coming to mind. It takes the psycho-thriller genre into the 21st century with only enough blood and gore to get it moved to the 9pm slot were it to appear on network TV (of course the gay content would probably relegate it to cable).<br /><br />Amazing acting by Patricia Clarkson, Campbell Scott and Peter Sarsgaard make this film so easy to enjoy. The cinematography is beyond words; the screenplay and direction, brilliant. Craig Lucas (Long Time Companion, Secret Loves of Dentists, and Prelude to a Kiss) has proved his genius extends beyond writing to inspired directing.<br /><br />Haunting and beautiful, this is a story as unique as the imagination of the viewer. Taken at face value there is an amazing film here. But for anyone willing and able to go below the surface, this is a multi-leveled film that deserves at least a 2 hour visit over coffee with a friend to explore the intricate, disturbing possibilities it conjures. BRAVO!
