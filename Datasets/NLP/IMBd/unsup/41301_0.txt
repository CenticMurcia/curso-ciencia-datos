Conveniently suburban prostitute, well-groomed, teeth intact? False. Primary ignorance, nothing primordial, except the sludge of wasted minutes irretrievably spent.<br /><br />Pennies in a fountain were at least wishes and not pimply teenage fantasy.<br /><br />Except for the water,<br /><br />They don't float, just watered-down, horny whitebread tomfoolery.<br /><br />Pancreatic, fumiliar scentiment. Redundant.<br /><br />How do you chasm truth? You meek it; that's all. I curse the day I ever met that 8-fingered freak. The over-sized spoon; the baseball cap - it tells you he can't possibly understand.<br /><br />This is your body. (dancing badly in soiled briefs and sunglasses)<br /><br />This is your tombstone. (STDs and philanthropic abortions)<br /><br />White picket fence hides herpes, lesions, erosion in the cloth of memory. Nothing is actual, clownish caricatures trump reason, reality. Let them rot with syphilis, so I can pretend I learned anything.
