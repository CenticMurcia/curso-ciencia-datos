This movie plays like a parody. The girls are brainless, and constantly make stupid choices (hmm? strange mansion? free bathing suits? let's go swimming!), and the ending, as other reviewers have mentioned, is baffling. The two thugs who corral the women here have mixed motives...are they thugs? good guys? perverts? The movie doesn't bother to tell us. In fact, it leaves out most of the things (e.g., character backgrounds and motivations...in fact just characterisation in general is lacking in this movie) that might make its story logical. <br /><br />In short, this is the kind of movie that sits on your head and squeezes it while you yell, "why! why! why!" Only watch with friends and only if you intend to do a "Mystery Science..." type riffing session during it.
