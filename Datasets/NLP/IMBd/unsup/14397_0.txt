In this one, Daffy plays himself as an actor tired of comedy roles so he pitches J.L. a script called "The Scarlet Pumpernickel" by Daffy Dumas Duck. The duck's the title character hoping to rescue the fair Melissa from the evil Porky Pig. The pig tries to get Sylvester to marry her to keep her from Daffy. Also involved is Elmer (done for the first time by Mel Blanc instead of Arthur Q. Bryan) and the Mama Bear from Chuck Jones' Three Bears cartoons. Nice humorous touches throughout with Daffy, especially, in fine form. I noticed Sylvester doesn't have any whiskers here. Essential viewing for any Jones fan or anyone who loves animated spoofs of old movies.
