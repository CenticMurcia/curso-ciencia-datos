The comments already posted for this film do not do it justice. It is a very low budget sci-fi film made by lesser known people and should be judged that way. To say the film shouldn't be made is plain wrong. How do people learn without doing? Small pictures should be encouraged, not made fun of just because they are not of the highest quality.
