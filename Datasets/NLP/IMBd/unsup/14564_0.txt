I saw the Lost World Jurassic Park twice at the movies.<br /><br />And this is one of the first games I ever played on the Playstation One.<br /><br />Good movie but the game was just a total boredom.<br /><br />The first of the game has you be a small Dinosaur and you take on Dinosaurs bigger then you.<br /><br />How smart was that? But to be fair the games didn't look too bad and the sounds was good too.<br /><br />But with bad controllers and bad game play hurts this game a lot.<br /><br />Also this game is too hard to have any fun.<br /><br />I say this was one of the worst games ever made and it why some games based of movies are bad.<br /><br />If you want a Video Game based on the Jurassic Park Films then I would suggest Warpath Juassic Park. That's a fun game.<br /><br />I give The Lost World Juassic Park a 3 out of 10.<br /><br />Good movie bad game.
