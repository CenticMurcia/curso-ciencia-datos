I was very excited when I was going to rent this movie. I started watching it immediately I fell in love with costumes, fabrics, sets, great production design; casting was pretty good most of Pirates Of The Caribbean team, and of course Cate Blanchett she was amazing in this movie, but Geoffrey Rush was very underused. I realized, what was bad in this movie is a director, everyone else did a great job. Continuity of events is often broken, confusing scenes at the beginning with young Queen and a doll, hard cuts between shots, loss of drama in events, it doesn't look like a feature film to me, it's more like Discovery Channel DVD to me.
