This is a moronic, illogical film that will dull the senses and dim the mind. Woo seems enthralled by Tom Cruise. It seems that the Cruiser walks everywhere in slow motion the camera lovingly following his every move. In fact there is a lot of slow motion on screen. And loud bangs. And pointless cameos. And an endlessly foolish plot. All in all, a gigantic waste of time.
