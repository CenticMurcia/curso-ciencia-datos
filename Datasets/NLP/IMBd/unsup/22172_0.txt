The best action movie of all time made by the action master himself. Woo put on screen caracters who are (as usual for him) very deep and who can say intelligent lines. Yes, there's a lot of blood, but it is important. All the people who dies there without a name represent the people living in Hong Kong who suffers a certain anonymity of living in the most populous city of the world. Directing this movie, Woo plays God, killing all those people like in this famous line from the movie: "Give a guy a gun, he thinks he's Superman. Give him two, he thinks he's God."
