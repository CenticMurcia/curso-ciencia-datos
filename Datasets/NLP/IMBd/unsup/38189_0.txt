This one was on AMC one night, so I resolved to watch it. My brother already said it was bad, but I still wanted to see it for myself.<br /><br />Sadly, my brother was right.<br /><br />Personally, I am very interested in the 1st SFOD-D (First Specialforces Operational Detachment-Delta.) or Delta Force. I know my facts pretty well. This movie, however, had none of its facts right. Here is a list of movie flaws.<br /><br />1. Why are all the Delta Force soldiers or D-Boys dressed entirely in black, rather than in fatigues. I know what D-boys look like and the gear they use in this does not make sense.<br /><br />2. Why are they using French weapons? I mean, these are American soldiers, not French men! They should be using their own weapons.<br /><br />3. Aside from all that, the acting was terrible, the script awful and the cast is bad too.<br /><br />In conclusion, DO NOT SEE THIS!
