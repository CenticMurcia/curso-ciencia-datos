Fairly accurate Historical Drama of the life of Marie Antoinette from when she left Austria (age 15 in 1770) to marry the Dauphin of France through her demise via guillotine (1793) in the chaos of the French Revolution. The beautiful Arch Dutchess, Princess of the house of Hapsburg, daughter of Empress Marie Theresa, Queen of Austria and Hungry & Francis 1, Holy Roman Emperor, foresees a glorious future with her marriage to the dauphin of France. Marie envisions palaces, magnificent jewels, breathing taking gowns & servants. All she dreams of comes true only for it to be swept away during the Reign of Terror. Norma Shearer brings her graceful elegance to the role of the Queen in this epic production, which is as vast & luxurious as the era it portrays.<br /><br />Thousands of yards of satin & lace, a then gigantic 1.8 dollar million budget plus hundreds of extras made this movie one of the most opulent epic's of the 30's & shall forever shine as one of the most glamorous ever made.<br /><br />Norma Shearer's nomination for an Academy Award was well deserved but, unfortunately she was up against another actress in equally powerful role & the award went to Bette Davis in Jezebel & though I love the movie Jezebel I wished Norma Shearer had won.<br /><br />Shearer's very powerful role was a great challenge which she met with great skill. Her delightful performance makes this a film to be cherished as we see her as a giddy youth while she enjoys being the dauphine, flirtatious nature with Count Fersen, loving queen to Louis XVI, anxious escapee during Flight to Varennes, horrified spouse when she learns of her husbands fate, terrified parent when her child is taken from her & dignified condemned prisoner as she rides in the cart & up the stairs to die are all moments is this wonderful movie than begin when the movie begins & wont ever end in your mind. Truly a magnificent actress in her most glorious role which she brought to life as if she herself lived the part, and who knows, perhaps she did. It's interesting to note that the leading actors/actresses within this movie bear a strong resemblance to the people they portray. In reality Fersen was fair haired, but the facial resemblance is uncanny to say the least. No doubt MGM's way of making the movie more realistic. Definitely among my 10 favorite movies of all time.
