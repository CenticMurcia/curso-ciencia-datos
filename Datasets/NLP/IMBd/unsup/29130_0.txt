Whats the name of the song (tune) that plays when Havilland enters Lee's room and starts going through his things. The song later plays when she returns to her home and reads Lee's letter and goes through the flashbacks of New Years. In typical R&B soundtrack fashion the song failed to appear on the soundtrack. I have looked for this song for a month and I cant find anyone who can tell me who composed the song whatsoever. This may not be the place to ask for a "music" question but I am desperate and it was the only song that I liked. I have watched the end credits to this movie over and over again only to find that the song was left uncredited. Please end my struggle.
