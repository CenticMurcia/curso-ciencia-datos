Very dull. Maybe you have to be familiar with "progressive" parenting and an "I'm OK, you're OK, we're not your parents, we're your pals" bland suburban childhood to get into this, I don't know. Which is fine to make a statement about, but I didn't BELIEVE the characters in the movie; it rang false. They could have done something more interesting with this. I didn't find any moments of poignancy, illumination or any sort of reason for me to be watching this. I watched "Me and You and Everyone We Know" after this, and that is more along the lines of something I like to see in an indie film and films in general- an alternative point of view, some subversive humor and symbolism you're not beaten over the head with. It isn't the ultimate masterpiece, but good, and I enjoyed it. This film is no "Donnie Darko," either. Just based upon its own merits, though, this film was a crashing bore and waste of my time.
