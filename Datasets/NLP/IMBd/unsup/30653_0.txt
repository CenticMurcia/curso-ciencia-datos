I'm 36 years old and have been going to the cinema for well over 20 years now. This is the only film I have ever walked out on. I've sat through some crap - but managed to stay until the end. Had I stayed until the end of this I fear I would have killed myself. Paul Hogan is a one-trick pony. Crocodile Dundee was fine for it's time - and it's even aged reasonably well. Croc2 was inevitable - and just about palatable. But IMDb won't allow me to type what I really thought about Almost An Angel in case it offends the readers....<br /><br />And now because of the 10 line rule I'm forced to sit here and type even more about the wretched film which is causing me to despise it all the more. Unfortunately I cannot score it 0
