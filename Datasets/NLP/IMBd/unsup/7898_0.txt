This film has a first rate cast including some famous faces like the wonderful and missed Madeline Kahn, the brilliant and subtle Barbara Barrie, the under-appreciated Julie Kavner, and Emmy Winner Edie Falco in the title role as an aspiring actress from Long Island. The suburbia has become the new it thing. Of course, suburbia is not as boring as we like to make it out to be on screen. There are some brilliant moments and casting of Barrie and Falco as mother and daughter is perfect casting. Kahn plays the bored housewife and loving mother who needs assurance from her husband played by Bob Dishy who is a school principal where Berlin's mother Sue works as a teacher. Kavner plays a cafeteria lady while Anne Meare plays his secretary. It's shot in black and white which is a departure from the normal color. The shots are quite first rate and the film has a slow but steady peace. The characters are realistic at least to my lifelong suburban eyes. I can identify with almost all of them.
