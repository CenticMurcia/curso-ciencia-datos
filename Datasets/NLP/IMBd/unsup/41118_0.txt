James Best and his friend arrive by boat at a small island in front of a storm. The island is the home to a scientist and his assistants who are working on prolonging life but accidentally create a race of giant shrews(?). Interestingly enough, these shrews look pretty much like dogs with cheesy costumes when they are shown walking or running, and in closeups they resemble nothing from this planet--they are just too weird to explain. Although all this was really cheesy, what I thought was funniest was when people were holding normal shrews and playing with them, as in real life, shrews are insane and would have probably torn them to pieces. If you look closely, these are actually mice (and it's a good thing for the "actors").<br /><br />This is one of 10 movies that come on a public domain DVD collection of horror films. Pretty much all the films stink, but at least this one is very watchable but bad--sort of like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. The campiness and silliness of the whole thing hooked my attention. The acting was generally pretty bad, though Best wasn't too bad. However, if you are NOT a fan of bad but fun movies, avoid the film--it certainly ISN'T Shakespeare!
