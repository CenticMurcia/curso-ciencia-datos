Mutant aka Forbidden World is one of the cheesiest and most amazing movies that I have seen. It contains nudity,gore, a cheesy monster and everything that a person who is in favour of b-grade movies requires to be entertained by a movie.<br /><br />It's indeed a rip off of Alien, but it's much better than Alien, Alien is a very boring film in my opinion, but I think that Mutant is just fantastically good! It contains one of the cheesiest monsters that I have seen. Imagine the monster from Carpertner's The Thing but much cheesier, and you got the this cheesefest called Mutant! <br /><br />When I saw it I was quite tipsy and I can only recommend that you do the same if you watch it. This film will surely entertain you if you are sober, but watching is tipsy is delightful! Make sure you are in the mood for a fun cheesefest, because Mutant is certainly a remarkable one!!! 10/10
