Gerd Oswalk made a "pretty" picture, but it certainly wasn't a "thriller", to me. So predictable ! If the story had been good, I'd have overlooked that.<br /><br />The "brilliant" comments before mine makes me wonder if we all saw the same movie. BUT, Robert Wagner ("Bud Corliss") DEFINITELY was not the "noir"-type actor, nor was Jeffrey Hunter ("Prof Grant") anything near the role he was assigned. Both of those guys were TOO pretty for their roles....guess that's why Hunter was wearing glasses most of the time. I thought Joanne Woodward ("Dory") was ridiculous and not nearly pretty enough; Virginia Leith ("Ellen") was lovely, but an actress?? Guess that's why we didn't see her again.......<br /><br />....someone compared this film as a companion-piece to "The Talented Mr. Ripley" WHAT ?? I have no idea how this film ended, but I guess Wagner got caught, huh? The scene in the "supply"-room was a hoot - and those rubber-gloves he ALWAYS had with him. AND, he even typed "Dory's" suicide-note on his own typewriter !! That was it for me. WOULD THAT STRONG, YOUNG MAN JUST SIT AT HIS DESK WAITING FOR WAGNER TO PULL THE TRIGGER ??? ...I left this film half-way....it looked beautiful, with all the stylish clothes the main character-guys wore (everyone else wore shirts) and the lovely autos, etc...<br /><br />ANYONE who compares this film to "Ripley" should be doomed to watch "Kiss" a jillion times. Double Boo !!
