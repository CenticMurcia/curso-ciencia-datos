Alterning elements from "Waterworld" and "Mad Max", this film is a pleasure to the eyes with beautiful sand landscapes from chilen Atacama´s desert. Besides, it´s a pleasure to the ears, with the outstanding brazilian diva Sandy and her voice. Go to see it now, but don´t forget to take a big glass of water before. I´ve got very thirsty at the end.
