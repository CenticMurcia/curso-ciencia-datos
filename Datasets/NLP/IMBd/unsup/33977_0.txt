I can't stand to start a movie and not finish, even if its bad, but this movie is agonizing to watch! The acting is horrible, the characters implausible, the actresses are extremely annoying, and the plot is clich√© and simplistic. Even the usually redeeming quality of partial nudity is negated by the fact that the girls are ugly. I enjoy a little cheese and a funny B movie, but this movie is worthless even for that. I got the DVD free and its about as valuable as an AOL CD. This movie isn't worth writing a review about, I do so only to warn you. I'd rather eat a turd than watch such a pitiful attempt at cinema. The fake blood isn't even the right color, its pink. What really ruins it is the ridiculous casting and character design, they had no idea what they were doing. The music is worse than bands that open for other bands at clubs with no cover charge.
