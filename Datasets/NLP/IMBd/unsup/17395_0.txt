Poor (as in no money) Ulises hangs out with his buddies, skates (skateboards), and makes murals using spray paint on available walls. He works with his father selling stuff at an open air market, and attends high school. One day he makes eye contact with Renata, a girl from an upper class family, while at a trendy mall. They follow each other around, and she kisses him. Thus begins this movie. Their unlikely romance blossoms amidst the background of their social differences, and is doomed from the start. The differing social worlds of the two lovers clash in a memorable fight scene outside Renata's private high school. Renata's sister is a closet alcoholic, her ex-boyfriend is bitter and jealous about losing her to Ulises, and is decisive in the film's ending. The Mexico City locales and musical soundtrack are terrific.
