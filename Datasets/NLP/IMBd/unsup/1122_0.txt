Shame on NEW LINE CINEMA for releasing such crap like THE MAN. SAMUEL L. JACKSON and EUGENE LEVY can do a hell of a lot better than this and they have. There is nothing remotely funny or entertaining to be found in this lame attempt to make people laugh. Wait! Excuse me. I did laugh once and I will tell you what at. The only time I laughed in this movie is when EUGENE LEVY's character eats red meat and then gets in SAMUEL L. JACKSON's car. Seems the red meat gives him gas and soon the farts are coming out left and right. The expressions on SAMUEL L. JACKSON's face made me crack up. But, unfortunately, that is the only laugh to be had. All I can tell you is DO NOT, I repeat "DO NOT", watch this movie.
