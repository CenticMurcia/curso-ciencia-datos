I'm really on the fence about this movie. Though the score is wonderful and melodic, it is often interrupted by cheap directorial tricks. The ballad "Isn't It Romantic" would have been lovely if it had been performed straight, with no flounces. Instead it is truncated, and for me, ruined by cinematic tricks. "Lover," a superb Richard Rodgers waltz, is sung to a horse, the late Jeanette MacDonald halting her rendition to make jokes with the animal! There are many other examples of film fireworks that fizzle. Perhaps Mamoulian was anxious to show how a movie musical could be superior to the stage, but for me all that emerges are unwelcome and dated film artifices that serve only to annoy. I get the feeling that Mamoulian didn't really like the score and tried his best to submerge it. Though I'm still on the fence, I really detested this film.
