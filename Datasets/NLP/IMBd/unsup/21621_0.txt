Many people on both this site and Amazon have claimed that "Life is Worth Losing" is George Carlin's worst comedy performance. One reviewer claims he has simply turned into a bitter misanthrope - but I don't think that's very fair. I thought "Life is Worth Losing" was indeed one of Carlin's harshest acts, but it was also very funny.<br /><br />His opening, "Modern Man," is a four-minute mind-bending string of words (similar to the opening of "Complaints and Grievances") which is hilarious and almost unbelievable - whoever hears this and thinks Carlin is "losing it" must be kidding! After this he begins dissecting American life and basically thrashing about the people of our nation with his words - labeling Americans as fat, mall-loving idiots. And some might be offended by this, but that's why he's George Carlin.<br /><br />Carlin may be getting older but I really fail to see how he's "falling apart" as a comedian here - I thought it was a great show and although it's his most bitter act I've heard, a lot of it is also totally true.
