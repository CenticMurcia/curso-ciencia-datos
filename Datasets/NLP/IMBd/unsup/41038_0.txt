***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Same old endless Gay Independent Film Plot. Gay kid fall in love with straight kid, all sorts of tired drama, gay kid dies tragically, The End. For God's Sake someone make a film with real gay characters that is uplifting or enlightening or how about, just interesting. I guess I can be thankful that the tired Gay Independent Film Plot of the 1980s is dead - Gay kid gets AIDS, all sorts of tired drama, Gay kid dies.
