I do love low budget movies, but this one is just awful. And not in the `good' awful sense that is usually accustomed to low budget movies. This is just pure and simply awful. The story, a bunch of not too bright kids get the great idea of going camping. Turns out they chose to camp in the hunting ground of the all dancing, all killing psycho fisherman, who runs around in the forest killing everything in sight. Humans preferred. I guess you can figure out the rest. These kids get lost and need to escape the evil clutches of the fisherman.<br /><br /> Usually I enjoy the humor of Troma, but this one is just awful. Not many laughs at all. And no uncalled for nudity either. No great ideas for the plot, no mindgrabbing gorie effects (there is a high amount of blood though), no good jokes.no nothing really. It's pretty much just a waste of time, and for Troma a waste of money. Of course, no true Troma fan should miss it. But others should try to avoid it.
