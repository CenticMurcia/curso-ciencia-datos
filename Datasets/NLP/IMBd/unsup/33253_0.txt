This movie is absolutely not enjoyable. When I read the DVD cover, it said: from the makers of ''Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Mummy''. Idiot that I was, I actually believed it. They probably hired one of the Orc extra's from LOTR to be able to put that on the cover or something.<br /><br />The movie starts out promising enough, some sort of mythological mumbo-jumbo story about an evil empire that worships the Minotaur. What's this? Full frontal nudity already? They don't waste time, do they.<br /><br />And the the movie starts. Very slowly. We meet some stupid kids who are on their way to be sacrificed. Some guy, high on drugs, uses his magic skull to get the women high. They proceed to tongue kiss his sister, and each other, passionately.<br /><br />Ummmmm. OK. What exactly was the point of that? Yes, exactly, to give the viewer a boner.<br /><br />Almost immediately after that, the sister seduces our hero and gets him into bed.<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />And then I turned off the DVD-player and went on to do something else. This movie is boring, uses cheap tactics to try and keep the viewers attention... it's silly and insulting. They butcher the mythology of the Minotaur story to make this... like somebody else said, it reminds me of a bad Stargate episode.<br /><br />Do not watch this film unless you are drunk, horny (pun intended) or enjoy watching bad movies.
