"Miracle Mile" is a very effective black comedy/thriller from director Steve De Jarnatt. Average guy Anthony Edwards takes a call in a public phone booth and discovers that the end of the world is terrifyingly near; thus begins a race against time as he must locate his girlfriend and get out of LA.<br /><br />Both leads, Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham, are quite impressive as is De Jarnatt's controlled direction. His use of cinematography and mix of comedy and drama shows his definite idea of where he wanted to take us. It's all topped off with a splendid Tangerine Dream score. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Saturday, October 5, 1991 - Video<br /><br />Steve De Jarnatt's great direction is a real bonus, as the tension he creates amidst all the black humour and drama is excellent. Anthony Edwards is perfect as 'Harry', and puts in a good performance. Supporting cast are also good.<br /><br />A very clever, well-filmed double-edged thriller, with a great soundtrack from Tangerine Dream. Still a great pleasure to watch even for the third time.<br /><br />Wednesday, June 3, 1992 - Video
