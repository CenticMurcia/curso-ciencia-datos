Andy Lau plays one of his most memorable characters. His love for film and manga plays nicely to the crowd. The use of 2 dialects in the film is nice. The third character (the girl) connects the two assassins in both story and dialect. In this movie you spend the time cheering for the bad guys and thrill their rivalry with the police and each other. In a showdown that everyone knows has to happen between the two hitmen you choose who you liked throughout the entire film and then see who comes out on top. An excellent film.
