A very good, intellectually and romantically stimulating and wonderful film directed and written by Julie Delpy, who also plays the main character, Marion, to Adam Goldberg's Jack; the two are a couple who spend two days in Marion's hometown Paris, before heading to their home in New York. While there, Jack finds himself strangely surrounded by Marion's exes, a language he doesn't understand and several dramatic and very comedic relationships. Marion evolves and revolves throughout the film. All in all, very comedic, very human (i.e. non-Hollywoodesque) and sympathetic. Straightforward acting, a beautiful script and many laughs makes this a winner.
