Peep Show surprised me. I saw it on one of the cable channels, and it was better than most of the feature-length films. It's a different take on "what women want" and makes good-natured fun of commonly held views. I got laughs seeing a woman pay to hear men say things she wants to hear, like "I'd love to go to your niece's Christening." Of course the men utter their comments without a lick of sincerity, though they do a nice job of faking it. And she not only believes them, her arousal level climbs the more she hears.<br /><br />I suppose some might consider this film women bashing but it's too light and too much fun to be taken seriously.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite shorts. I hope it gets aired frequently.
