This movie is amazing. i am only 15 and i think everyone no matter what race or religion should see this to see how awful things must have been. Robin Williams did a beautiful job jumping out of his funny roles and transitioning to such a serious role. it made me cry it is so heart touching. this is a beautiful movie. i would suggest it to anyone. This movie is about hope and dream and he made them come true. i cannot stress how lovely this movie is. just awesome. i didn't remember the name until i looked up movies he starred in and when i did it came to me by seeing the list. thats how much of an impact it had on me. i even think schools should show this movie. wonderful.2 thumbs up.
