(to some who have only seen the original doc, this review might contain spoilers) until just recently i did not know that the the version of Woodstock that i saw was a directors cut. anyhow i remember watching this with a friend in high school right before Woodstock 2 came out that summer. the music was pretty good, no really bad performances, but the movie was really hilarious, we were pretty much laughing all four hours of this movie.<br /><br />a brief list of highlights include: a hilarious performance by canned heat, which seemed to feature a singer who resembled a 500 pound gerbil on speed.<br /><br />another canned heat member who looked like the grown up version of that freaky little "dueling banjo" kid in deliverance.<br /><br />the unforgettably hilarious performance of Joe cocker, he seemed to be singing "with a little help from my friends" while impersonating a retarded kid trying to walk on a recently waxed floor with nothing but socks.<br /><br />and lest we forget the cringe worthy scenes of icky looking hippies running off into the bushes to have sex.<br /><br />as much as i loathe hippies and hippie cultere/beliefs, this movies is yet another reason why, if i was given the chance to travel back in time i would go back to the sixties. i mean, since the sixties our society has bandaged itself up and learned some lessons about radical politics, and our country is still full of idiots. but in the sixties the percentage of idiots was at a more extreme level(due to the counter culture) and i just think that to observe, and in fact be a part of such historical stupidity would just be the time of my life.
