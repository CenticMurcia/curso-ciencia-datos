I love this movie, it is one of my all time favorites. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12. My mother and I would stay up to the wee hours of the morning watching classic movies, and this was one of them. Not only was this a well acted movie, but it made such an impact on me even at a young age. No matter what your background, your ability or disability, race or age, all the characters of this film seemed to find each other despite all that. This film took on the prejudices against race, the disabled and confronted them with true human emotion. I highly recommend this film, especially to young people, I promise this film is not out dated it is timeless and it's lessons are as well!
