I've seen this movie at the Rotterdam Film Festival. A man is searching for a women he has met six years ago. Her name is Sylvia. For this purpose he returns to the city of Strasbourg. The movie ranges over a period of 3 days. The man, while searching through the city, visits known places, sits in a caf√®, observes his environment. He listens to the people, watches at them, almost staring at them, so that the audience even gets the feeling of being a voyeur. And people he is starring at even don't notice that he did so or just ignore him. I did not like this film. There is almost no dialog in this film. And the story line is very slow, too slow. It had the effect of a sleeping pill on me. I would not recommend it.
