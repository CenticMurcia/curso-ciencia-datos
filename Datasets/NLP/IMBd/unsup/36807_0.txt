I've never read any Jack the Ripper books.<br /><br />I've never seen any Jack the Ripper movies.<br /><br />I didn't even know the story behind Jack the Ripper until the other day. Then I saw From Hell. The title of the movie is ironic because it seems the movie itself came "From Hell." I will never get that 2 hours (and $8) of my life back. The movie was slow moving, incredibly predictable, and had a slow, drawn out climax.<br /><br />The scenery was amazing, and the special effects were fantastic. That much I'll give. Even the acting was good. It is just that the story stunk.<br /><br />Don't go see it. Rent it. Maybe even wait for HBO. You already know what happens anyway.
