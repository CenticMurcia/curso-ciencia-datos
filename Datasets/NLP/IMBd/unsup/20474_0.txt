Broad, flat comedy is straight off an assembly-line. While on his way to California to practice plastic surgery to the Hollywood stars, a doctor gets stuck in a backwater town and quickly falls in love with the lovably uneducated, unspoiled yokels residing there. Another ridiculous comedy posing as a sentimental valentine to Hicktown, U.S.A., based on a book by Neil B. Shulman. Michael J. Fox (looking bloated and sleepy) struggles valiantly through it, and supporting players Woody Harrelson and Frances Sternhagen give it a little juice, but this screenplay leaves everyone stranded in sitcom-land. * from ****
