John Carpenter has to be one of the best sci-fi horror helmers who's made so many great cult favourites. This one is one of them. "Escape From New York" may be quite dated but it still packs a punch! Kurt Russell's potrail as Snake Plissken, the war-hero turned criminal is great. John Crapenter's score is so good (got the remastered CD) and the apocalyptic tone & style of a ruined New York is one of the great things about this film. It doesn't even feel low-budget this film and watching this film in widescreen feels so good (one of the reasons why it doesn't feel low-budget). Rating 10/10, a classic sci-fi film directed by John Carpenter which can't be missed out on and can't be updated or remade. John Carpenter's films don't need to be updated or remade.
