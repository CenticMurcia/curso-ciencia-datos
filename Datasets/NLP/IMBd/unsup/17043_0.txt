I saw NAKED FEAR on Showtime last night; and, think that it owes a lot to its predecessors; both on film and in print.<br /><br />My first introduction to anything of this ilk, is the exceptionally well-written "Open Season" a paperback released in the 1970s upon which a film starring Peter Fonda was made. Unfortunately, that film is out of print; and, I've never seen it; but, the book was excellent.<br /><br />I did see 1932's "The Most Dangerous Game," which may be the original telling of this tale of human as prey and predator. I also rated that film 9 out of 10 stars, here on IMDb; and, feel that NAKED FEAR is a very modern adaptation of the story.<br /><br />Sub-par variations on this theme include 2000's "Hunting Season," which I rated only 3 stars; and, 1961's "Bloodlust," starring the Brady Bunch's Robert Reed as the handsome protagonist. I rated that one three stars as well; but, I think I may bump that up to four.<br /><br />NAKED FEAR exceeded my expectations in almost every element of the film. The characters were believable, sympathetic, multi-faceted. The action was fast paced. The dialog was fine. The score kept things moving along. The cinematography was gorgeous. The plot was plausible; and, gripping -- I was enthralled right from the opening scene.<br /><br />My only objection is the ending. Why did Christine Vasquez turn this into a wannabe "I Spit on your grave?!?" Couldn't she have just left it with Diana Kelper recovering in the hospital? Why did she have to go on a killing spree. It just doesn't make sense.
