Look. I'm a fan of Disney movies n' all, but the films are starting to get repetitive and boring. This film suffers from shabby acting, bad animation and a recycled plot line.<br /><br />The film's story centers around Chicken Little claiming the sky is falling, but it turns out that the sky is a bunch of aliens that attacks the town.<br /><br />Sounds kinda unique, right? But the film's plot line is the same as every other Disney movie. Introduce the characters, start the problem, come to a semi-climax, sad moment, the friends reunite and the problem's solved. This plot line, though can be used once in a while if it's done once in a while, gets tiring after a while. I'm sick of it.<br /><br />The voice acting isn't nearly as good as the other Disney films, and that was distracting to me.<br /><br />Like Hoodwinked, the animation is way too cartoony and really makes the film distracting to watch, and this film's animation was just stupid.<br /><br />All in all, this is a flawed film that I really didn't like at all. Want a good Disney show? Watch Toy Story. Or National Treasure. Or Pirates of the Caribbean. There's a ton of good Disney movies out there... pass on this one.
