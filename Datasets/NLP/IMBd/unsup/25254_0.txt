There are two kinds of b movies out there, the ones that are jammed together in the most cynical fashion to wrench out a few bucks and nothing more. then there's movies like 'Dead Heist' where you can just tell that people with little to no budget got together for love of making movies and had a great time in the process. The dialogue is foul and quite hilarious for it, and while the plot is meager at best, there is something infectious (truly no pun intended) about the way everyone involved gives it their all. The small town locations are put to good use, and the violence is never anything but comic book bloody. This movie is nothing but fun and that is all it was ever meant to be. By the way, Zach Hanner rocks.
