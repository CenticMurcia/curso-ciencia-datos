The eighth series in the Hellraiser sequels is pathetic with long drawn out slow shots to fill the movie's one and a half hour time space, it's hard to believe this film is by the same director who filmed Hellraiser VI and shows you exactly what can be made with no real plot if the producers think a profit is available. A vengeful father misses out on his sons life and takes out acts of violence on the people involved surrounding his suicide, maybe Vengeance would be a more appropriate title, the storyline is awful, it has no actual links with hell until the very end when Pinhead finally makes a short appearance. Lance Henriksen and Doug Bradley bring little to the film and are capable of much finer performances, the ideas are not new and have been done before similarly in The CLubHouse. Scenes near the end with Jake and Chelsea make you want to be sick, lots of cuts between the two the only dialogue being Jake!, Chelsea!, Jake!, Chelsea!, Jake!, Chelsea!, Chelsea!, Jake! the film is too slow due to a lack of everything and these should have been cut on the editing table along with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Hellraiser Hellworld is painful to watch and by that I mean really poor, cast with a stereotypical British actor in line with the current US trend it always seems to be a cockney or someone who has the Pride & Prejudice Mr Darcy, Mr Darcy accent, there are other areas in England apart from London, period dramas and Narnia, this film is very predictable and boring, the box and pinhead seem to have taken a back seat in the later movies and also people seem to just die instantly as opposed to being taken to hell or within hell, as IMDb user troyanov states, 'Lance and interestingly even Pinhead looks bored', probably due to their 'uninspiringly' crap dialogue.<br /><br />Should you ever find the box one day and open it the cenobites will come and take you to the hell cinema to force you to watch this movie for all eternity or perhaps the part where Pinhead says 'How's this for a wake up call?' looped forever. Just another Hollywood cash-in movie a sum up of the outlines: fear of adults, teens, rock music, partying, sex all round and some death scenes, if you want to make a movie like this just read the How To Make A Hollywood Teeny Flick For Idiots Guide.
