Kind of love sci-fi movie, this one is a must see for all ages. Lots of creative thinking that make this movie a wonderful experience for both adult and children.<br /><br />The story is great and the effects are excellent too. Too bad is that the inner part of the movie is not shown. The story should shown more on the body itself and not just a common red blood cells. Maybe the script/screen writer can expand it further by showing the audience how "brain" look like inside the head and human lung, heart, liver etc then it even worth too seen this movie as part of human entertainment.<br /><br />thumb up.
