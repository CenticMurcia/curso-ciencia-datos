If you have ever been down on your luck or know someone in that capacity you will most assuredly recognize and or identify with one or more of the characters in this great film.<br /><br />Acting was top notch. It moved along as if their were no three act structure. It was like a fly on the wall of a working poor family.<br /><br />Perhaps it was a little too real for me at times but I didn't allow that to take away from watching this excellent work.<br /><br />Real life is a struggle and the world is full of miserable people. Happiness and happy endings are very hard to come by. This film does not go the usual formulaic route and I don't know that I have ever watched anything like. I'm confident you will feel the same way. It's too bad that more American filmmakers don't have the guts to be this original.<br /><br />Are you still reading? Get to the video store and get this. It's a one of a kind experience.
