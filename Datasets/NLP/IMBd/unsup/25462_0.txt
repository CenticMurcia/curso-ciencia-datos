'The Fantastic Journey', along with 'Planet Of The Apes', 'Logan's Run', 'The Invisible Man' and 'Gemini Man' flopped in the U.S.A., but here in the United Kingdom proved enormously popular. They were slickly produced, boasting better special effects ( and lots of flashing lights! ) than our British shows could manage. 'Journey' had a most captivating premise. Trapped on a mysterious island at the heart of the famed 'Bermuda Triangle', a group of travellers venture from one dangerous time zone to the next, searching for a way home. Jared Martin's 'Varian' was from the future, and carried a tuning fork weapon not unlike Dr.Who's 'sonic screwdriver'. Katie Saylor made the biggest impact on me ( well, I was 15 at the time ) as Liana. She had a telepathic cat called Sil-L. Roddy McDowall's 'Willaway' fulfilled a similar function to Jonathan Harris in 'Lost In Space'. Hardly Hugo-award winning stuff perhaps, but 'Journey' was lively and entertaining and deserved a much longer run.
