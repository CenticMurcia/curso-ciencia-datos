As a Greek I have to say that if this is where Greek culture is heading, then Greek culture is in very serious trouble. The characters are wafer thin and the plot is a 95-minute extension of one joke that wasn't funny to begin with.<br /><br />Yiannis is a straight man in a gay world, who secretly goes to straight clubs and has fallen in love with a gay woman. On the surface it seems the message of this film is that when you reverse the roles 'gay people are just like straight people', which would be perfectly fine if: a) it were true that all people are alike b) society was progressive enough to have reached such idealistic levels Equally objectionable is Yiannis' 'seduction' of Sofia. Basically he gets her drunk and sleeps with her and upon realising her confusion, kisses her until she 'turns straight'. Though this certainly isn't the first film whose would-be couples are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts with nothing in common, this oral assault sequence that uses 'love' as a justification is something I find frankly disturbing.<br /><br />I can't begin to explain on how many levels this movie is wrong. Just because everyone is gay and the straight people are in the minority in this warped 'comedy 'doesn't make sick bigotry any more acceptable.<br /><br />When you re-invert the premise, fundamental biases in the ideologies of directional/writing team become patently obvious. Is prejudice OK when the oppressed become the oppressors? Is being gay acceptable 'as long as you act just like everyone else'? That's what this movie is trying to assert and it's not a happy feeling.
