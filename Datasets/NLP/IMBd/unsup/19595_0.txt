while this becomes a classic(10 years old already), i must say that i have seen this feature at least 5 times( not counting when seen it with company or parts of it).<br /><br />let's just quickly compare this to the more recent "Charlie Wilson's War". while generally on same approach towards politics Bulworth does not try to justify or give an impression of naivety( how naive can really be a politician that condones war for whatever reasons!?).Bulworth appeals to all masses as well since it very intelligently funny with certain scenes that literally will make you laugh out loud!. for example,the scene where the main character suggest how to solve the American racial problem, is RAW and i guarantee you that will make you wake up the neighbors. this movie combines EXTREAMLLY well many aspects of American politics that anyone can relate to regardless if you are in the office or not, poor or rich( even if there are some charming attacks at the rich class), disfranchised voter or not.if you are not pleased with today's politics overall then this is for you! Warren Beatty probably gives the best experience of his career.Halle Berry has only a supporting role in reality BUT she does have a political oriented speech that is one of the most outstanding speech ever given on the big screen, when it comes to class oriented views. the other actors do very well their parts , somehow being general stereotypes of some form but very effective and NEEDED here, in giving a clear imagine of how thing are, and not how they should.
