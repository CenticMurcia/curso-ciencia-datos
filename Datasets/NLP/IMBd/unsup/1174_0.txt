I'm happy to see that not many people have seen this... this... thing. At the same time it's strange that so many have voted it a 10. Then again if you enjoy watching badly conceived shows of old music, that you won't understand for the most part because of the foreign language, for one and a half hours then I guess this is paradise.<br /><br />Personally I think the movie is utterly pretentious and extremely amateurishly done nonsense. Several people walked out of the theater when I saw this movie. I really tried, I really did but I couldn't stand it either. This is a movie about some german music person that I had never heard of before. The special effects are worse than bad (take a look at the "flames" in the beginning). The female singer who looks like a guy, they film her hairy armpit in the middle of the screen for minutes. I mean come on people we are doing a movie here. There is a reason you have a make-up department. One of the dancers in a scene is rather bulky. I have nothing against people with "big-bones", but again we are producing a film. All these stupid things just turn the movie into a parody of itself. Avoid at all costs.
