Well, this episode was so full of plot holes that I have to comment about it. So the great pharmaceutical company is using prisoners as lab rats. Ahem. Why would they use a prison, if they can do all the things they are doing in this episode, like burning bodies in a crematory (crematory in a prison?), lying to everyone that they are from CDC without any prison officers of anyone else caring about it.. the list goes on and on. Because if they told the prison that they are from CDC and the prisons officers would confirm this and the CDC would say they are from CDC but they in fact are from that big pharmaceutical company, then it would mean that the CDC and the company are both involved and they wouldn't even need to lie.<br /><br />In one scene, there's U.S Marshalls and Mulder in a gas station where they discover a wounded clerk. Suddenly a yellow helicopter comes from nowhere, and 4 hazard-suited men grab the victim in a plastic coffin. No one does nothing, they just stare those 4 dudes packing their victim in and they don't ask anything, do anything, just stare like stupid rabbits. No one in law enforcement would EVER act like that.<br /><br />This whole episode was so full of sh it that I can't stand it. Usually there's even some kind of connection to reality in behaviors of law enforcement in X-files, but this was so stupid episode that it made me angry.<br /><br />OK, there is a good gross factor, but thats it.
