As a resident the Carolina Coast, one sees the appellation "Lowcountry" on many things including a goodly number of businesses and other entities both public and private. As a descriptor, it is both ubiquitous and quite accurate.<br /><br />Thus , my wife and I were quite surprised to see "Lowcountry Locksmith" on a vehicle in a film that was set in the Kentucky Horse country. I try to catch incongruities and goofs in films as hobby, but my wife spotted this particular one. Knowing that a good portion of this film was shot in the Beaufort, South Carolina area, we enjoyed a quick laugh during that scene.
