Nowhere near as horrific as it should've been. They deal here with a primal fear: being buried alive. But the film has no tension, no scares. Despite that, I could watch Adrien Brody all day. I'd love to see him, with his off-beat good looks, in a lead role. Maybe a buddy picture with Steve Buscemi.
