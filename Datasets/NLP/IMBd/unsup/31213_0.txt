I'm a fan of horror movies, therefore I was glad to find the Friday (late) night horror movie on one of the movie channels here. The only piece of information I had before watching the movie that it is movie shot by a teenager during thanksgiving dinner, during which some aliens attack the house. Well, I must admit - this is a brilliant movie. While it is occasionally not very believable, it sure DID give me a shiver every once in a while. The feeling of being helpless is so overwhelmingly presented in this movie. I gotta be honest and say that throughout about 60% of the movie I was almost sure it was real. The authenticity of the people who commented on the movie in certain scenes was really impressive. I think, however, that the little girl (Rosie McPherson) was just "too calm down" for a kid her age. As if the authenticity was not enough, the movie ended with the pictures of the "family members" as missing persons and a phone number was given (in case you've seen them). At that point I was dazzled - can it be for REAL? 30 seconds later I realized it is not real, since the actors' names appeared during the end credits. But folks, although it seems illogical that a movie like that can be shot with 2-5 shots, the special effects are very adequate and believable, and the acting is more than OK. It seems odd, however, that the mother was ALWAYS having a drink. Bottom line - other than a couple of glitches (which I am sure to find when I watch the movie for the 2nd and 3rd time), a really brilliant movie. Don't miss it. I give it an 8.
