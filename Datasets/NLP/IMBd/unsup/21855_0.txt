Let me start by saying I was not a fan of Dracula 2000, but was a huge fan of Dracula 2: The Acension. I waited for this film with baited breath. What would become of Elizabeth? Would Luke continue on as Uffizi's sidekick? What kind of final conflict would Uffizi and the fantastic Darcula (Stephen Billington) have? I was stoked. Then I rented the DVD moments after my store removed it from the distrubtor's packing. Well like my title says, it seems number 2 was a fluke. This film has none of the charm or cleverness of The Acension and more importantly doesn't feature Stephen Billington as Darcula, but Rutger Hauer (To his credit he appears to be having fun with the role). The direction is scattered and the ending is predictable and smacks of hopes for a Darcula 4. Elizabeth is all but an afterthought in this movie and has only a couple of scenes. There is a bright light in this, and that is Jason London. His character glides through this film with a dark humour that would make Joss Whedon proud. The DVD does have one other high point, a rather long but interesting "treatment" section that shows what Lussier and Soisson intended. It would have made, in my opinion, a much better film. Also, watch Alexandra Westcourt carefully, she isn't bad in her effectively useless role and with the right script could become an actual star in the future. This all said about the film, your mileage may vary.
