OMG! Why you not understand its absolutely new film? Its Fallout! FALLOUT! Not T1 or T2... Duhh... I hate people who put too low rating for this film. I'm sorry Are You DumbAss? <br /><br />Great action,great playing(I mean Sam Warrington not Christian Bale). Yeah story line is not good, but it no so bad to hate it! I'm not even a Terminator fan. I think its great start of new Termintor trilogy. In short, I had a fantastic time watching it, and definitely would be going back to see it again when it opens. Most of the Terminator fans would definitely NOT be disappointed with this installment, as it is chock-full of action, heavy on heroics, and breathtaking in scope. It will definitely have a long run at the movies, and will give Michael Bay a run for his money. Visual Effect 9/10 Story Line 8/10 Action 10/10
