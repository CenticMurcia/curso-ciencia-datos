Though I wouldn't expect it at all, this was indeed a good movie. It has his problems (the teenagers are annoying as always, the dialoguse have major problems and the werewolf is not done very good), but you can surely pass over. The very good points: 1. The werewolf is quite crazy. He tears apart his victims, he IS a beast. 2. The werewolf is talking! This is ingenious indeed, I never saw it before, and I saw a lot of werewolf movies. You may think at first it is inappropriate, but I assure you the effect overall is very good. 3. There are pleasant nudity scenes, great tits, and the werewolf even rapes one of the teengirls in her perfect ass, in front of her boyfriend. While rather disturbing, the scene is quite good and adds to the story. 4. The atmosphere is nicely done, quite dark, quite 80's and there IS suspense. I am surely recommend the movie as one of the few werewolf movies made good in the last decades, with Ginger Snaps Unleashed and Dog Soldiers being other two examples in the same vein.
