If you thought LITTLE MAN from the Wayans Brothers was a stinker, well this Bollywood musical made in Sydney Australia is dire-rear. And it is astonishingly offensive. Based or stolen from THREE MEN AND A BABY this awful rip off with wobble head disco tracks actually manages to turn already idiotic oafs into hateful cretinous characters in the appalling cruelty shown to this baby in this dumb film. Supposedly these three selfish stooges find a baby on the doorstep and then bicker relentlessly about having to look after the child... whining and slapping each other in-between pathetic songs.... and spitting hateful remarks at this tiny kid. Then after they have reduced you to gasping in disbelief the script calls for them to abandon the kid in a storm, where the director then chooses to show us the horrifying sight of a baby wet and blue lying in a sodden basket. So idiotic are the on screen antics and boorish enough, these utterly distressing and disgusting scenes remove any non existent interest and attempts at reviving attention in the rest of the film. These three idiots then decide they love this near dead wet baby and get her revived... so they can skip and romp around the landmarks of Sydney to our further head shaking bewilderment. HEYY BABYY is a travesty and an insult to the beautiful city of Sydney as much as it would surely be to any paddy worker in a mud cinema in India. Awful in every way. Made of course with support from our misled City tourism board.
