I'm not to big a fan of movies that make you laugh only with slapstick comedy... and this film surely goes beyond the silly. It made me laugh with some very good parody, with great situations and finally with very loveable characters. Its a smart comedy no doubt. I highly recommend it. The rythm is great... your never bored or know whats coming up next.
