The story here shows one of America's weaknesses. Vanessa Redgrave plays a woman fighting against immorality, fighting for her grandson to be raised, sadly, without a mom and a dad but morally. A lot of this movie made me completely sick but in the end, thankfully, there's victory! Overall, it wasn't very well made... just too short of a time to really give each side of the story and show exactly what's wrong with what's happening. One thing that needed explanation was Vanessa Redgrave's British accent, at times, slipping through clear as day... maybe her character was born in England then moved to America at an early age and the two accents merged? Uh... i doubt it. Anyway, i give this movie a 0 out of 10. It's really a shame we live in a world that gave us a true story for this to be based upon.
