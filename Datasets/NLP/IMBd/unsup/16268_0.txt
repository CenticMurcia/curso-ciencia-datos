Sherlock Holmes, Dr Watson and Inspector Lestrade investigates the killings of young aristocratic women in 19th century London.<br /><br />Ian Hart is fine as Watson (as he was in "Hound of the Baskervlles") but - Rupert Everett as Sherlock Holmes??? No, totally miscast - right down teaming with Charlton Heston as the detective in "The Crucifer of Blood".<br /><br />The plot is not too good either. Well, it IS a well-planned detective story. But it seems more like a plot for series like "C.S.I." or "Inspector Lynley" than for a movie about Sherlock Holmes. There is no Holmesian feeling at all.<br /><br />This said, I enjoyed it in some moments. It's in fact rather creepy, and the sets are beautiful. 3 stars of 10.
