People get really impressed of movies like "Team America", but this 30 year old movie doesn't even give space for competition. That something like this could be made 30 years ago is fantastic itself. They even started the shooting as early as in the late sixties. What makes this movie different from other movies in the same genre, is the characters. The details takes your breath away.<br /><br />I can't imagine how much time and effort Ivo Caprino has spent on this movie project. It is really a genuine masterpiece.<br /><br />Just see this movie. I haven't seen the translated versions, but if they are 10% as good as the original, it's worth it.
