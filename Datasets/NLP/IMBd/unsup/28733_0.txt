I really enjoyed watching this movie, as did my daughter. While she has not read the book, many kids there had. It was great watching a movie that had both been read and enjoyed by most of the children and parents alike. I overheard one kid telling their parents, I don't remember that part in the book, I think they added it for the movie. It was neat to hear both of the parents say, oh yes it was, I remember that. While the story line itself captured the attention of most of the children, I know that along with the story, the special effects captured that of the adults. They were excellent. At the end of the movie, the parents were saying, that was a cool movie. I will say that some of the younger children seemed to get a bit antsy during the movie, as it may have been a bit too much for them. But there were few. I personally, can't wait to buy it. Disney did the book great justice and then some. It is a must see for everyone.
