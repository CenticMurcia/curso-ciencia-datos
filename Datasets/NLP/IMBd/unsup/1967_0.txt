While this film is called The Chill Factor I recall seeing it on one of ABC's Movie of the Week programs in 1973 under the title A Cold Nights Death and never saw it under the title The Chill Factor. I do recall that the week it was shown it was averaging about -20 where I was living so that made it interesting to watch this film and know how cold it felt for the two main characters. As some other reviewers have commented this film seems to be unavailable as so many of the made for TV movies from the 70's are. Who knows the reason why is anybodies guess. It had a Twilight Zone type plot to the story. If you get a chance to see it by all means do. Compared to the made for TV films that are turned out now the ones from the 70's such as this one are vastly superior.
