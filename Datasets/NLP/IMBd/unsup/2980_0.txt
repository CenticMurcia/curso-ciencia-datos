Yes boss is a very sweet film.Its an innocent love story about two people who have lots of dreams ,aspirations.Rahul(shahrukhkhan)who is working in a company dreams big he wants to become rich and the only person who can fulfill his dreams is his boss(aditya pancholi) who is not exactly a villain but a casanova .But the story actually begins with Seema who like rahul dreams of becoming rich so what better than falling for a person who is rich and none other than rahul's boss .Rahul and seema become mere puppets in the hands of siddharth(aditya pancholi).As the story moves forward seema and rahul realize that they are in love .But they don't seem to express that.watch the climax part of the film its really interesting one.Shahrukh and juhi make a perfect couple their expressions are so beautiful that one cannot escape from falling in love with the characters.All and all good film
