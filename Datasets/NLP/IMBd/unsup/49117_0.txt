This was the first Swedish movie (except Josef Fares' movies and Vuxna Människor) that I saw from the beginning to the end. Not because it was exciting or incredibly interesting, but because our extremely boring Swedish teacher forced my class to see it.<br /><br />After have seen Tre Solar I have also come to the conclusion that she also had extremely bad taste.<br /><br />Why Tre Solar is awful: 1. The script was probably printed on an A3-paper, there are approximately 3 lines in this movie. 2. The props is horrible, maybe because of the low budget or a lack of inspiration. 3. The actors are showing a complete lack of knowledge about acting.<br /><br />All of this results in Tre Solar being an excruciating horrible and sad, sad movie.<br /><br />It is also sad to see that splendid actors such as Rolf Lassgård and Rikard Wolf chose to participate in this movie.
