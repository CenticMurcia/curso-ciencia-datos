This documentary explicitly details how Metallica went from being one of the greatest bands of all time, to a hollow parody of itself. Having a 50-something therapist constantly with the band, helping them explore their feelings, all on a documentary for all to see, showed how much of a slave these guys have become to their mortgage payments. I used to have tons of respect for James Hetfield, only to hear him whine for two hours about separation anxiety, fear of abandonment, and getting his feelings hurt by his band mates. That is not metal my friend, nor is any of your recent music.<br /><br />The scene with Lars and Dave Mustaine made me want to cut my wrists. I was just waiting for them to burst into tears and start making out.<br /><br />This documentary perfectly exhibits why we idolize people and bands like Led Zepplin, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, etc, who stopped producing material for public consumption long before they became completely IRRELAVENT.<br /><br />As far as the film itself, it does a great job of detailing where the band members are in their lives, and what they went through in making such a horrible album, but is about as useful and entertaining to watch as those surgery shows on TV<br /><br />Now, I'm going to go listen to Kill 'Em All a few times to try and get my soul back.
