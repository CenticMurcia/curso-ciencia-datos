In a visual style reminiscent to "Snatch" and cultural references similar to "Pulp Fiction", Mexico does an attempt at making a neo-noir smash hit comedy. It worked! Having a classic but very funny mix-up plot, you add excellent in-jokes and situations that crack you up all over the night. Average acting, like Tony Dalton's, added to Kristoff Racynsky's humorous persona makes this a very good piece of Mexican cinema. My favorite scenes were the cross-eyed "microbusero", the bar brawl and the "damned bird" that wont shut up. As it was expected, the dialog is plagued with cursing, sometimes being funny and others exploiting some curse words way too much. Anyway, the car chase scene in the Ztec stadium is beautiful. The only thing that kept me from praising completely was the ending. It was very disappointing. Tony "the cannibal" was a completely useless character, and all we see him actually do (the bar brawl not included) is him sleeping with Cabos' wife. I personally would have enjoyed him kicking Cabos' ass when he encounters him in the bedroom, instead of beating his poor friend up. That was more cruel than funny. And I would have loved to see the cross-eyed "microbusero" once again.<br /><br />With some minor flaws, this is the best Maxican film recently. Too bad the same production company was the same to give us "Km 31"
