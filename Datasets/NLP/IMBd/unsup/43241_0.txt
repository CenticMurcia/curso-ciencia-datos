OK, so this might be the worst movie I've ever seen (a smidgen behind House of a Thousand Corpses), but if you have had a few drinks and are among a few of your closest friends, this could be one of the funniest movies of the past decade. When the ants are closing in on our heroes, they actually take the same clip and show it to you three times - making the ants seem as though they are marching to the same place three times over. This, plus excellent (and when I say excellent, I mean awful) special effects, acting, and death scenes make Killer Ants! a great movie for a Friday night at 2 AM when you've had one too many drinks and you're ready to make fun of anything that isn't yourself. (PS. watch for the scary skeleton in the barn!)
