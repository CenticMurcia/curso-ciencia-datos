The Italian Job has all the good humor and buoyancy of the British TV shows of the sixties. Think the Avengers for instance. Except a TV show can play with nonsense and poor action scenes as a trademark, while in a 90-minutes bona fide caper movie it's bound to be a failure.<br /><br />Now you can watch the movie only enjoying the swinging sixties spirit it exhales. In that respect you'll not be disappointed. On the other hand if you're looking for suspense, tempo, a sense of rhythm, nice characterizations... you'll be thoroughly distressed as the movie has nothing interesting in it, save the trip back 40 years.<br /><br />In depth: the movie drags its feet to set up the action, editing in an almost random order scenes where the humor becomes increasingly tired as you get used to it. To put it in a nutshell: cartoon characters with a tilt at spoofing 007 nonchalance make their way in a world where everything is funny and simple. OK that's not a bad thing, but the comedy is fast wooden while the action suffers from it. How can you have a proper caper movie if everything is just fun and no hassle, and eventually not so important? Suspense is never even sidelined, it simply doesn't exist. The story only cashes in on the characters' good time to make things go forward. In the end a very poor movie if you're not a sucker for sixties nostalgia.
