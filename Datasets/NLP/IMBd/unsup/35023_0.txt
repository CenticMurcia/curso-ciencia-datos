My dislike for musicals is well documented and this one is no exception. Though this one did feature a rather funny performance by Steve Martin. Without him the movie would have been completely unwatchable. As it is, any scene without him is rather boring and lame. I just had the hardest time watching this thing. The story has some 50's style to it, and it may appeal to people who liked that age. However, it is a musical so it was not going to appeal to me.
