Not sure what a SPOILER for a film of this type would be, so if you're a "fan" or your film or literature teacher or girlfriend wants you to see this picture, you'd probably better skip my comments.<br /><br />Simply stated, this film literally bored me almost to tears. I kept thinking, "I'm just going to leave," but then I kept hoping that something would finally happen. Thankfully I dozed off, but then, tragically, I started to snore and woke up again.<br /><br />The local paper said, more or less, that a "Parisian woman gets caught in a monumental traffic jam and gives a ride to a freezing young man on the last night of her single life." Well, the traffic jam goes on for maybe 30 or 40 minutes before she ever meets the man; I was squirming in my seat by then, but determined to see it through. Interesting photography could have saved this part of the film, but the endless close shots of car hoods and trunks, roofs and windows was just oppressive. And the shots of the other drivers, or even the pedestrians were no relief, as they were as uninteresting as any mediocre commute. It makes a statement, but this could have been done in about 10 minutes, with much more time left to develop the relationship between the protagonists, had there been one.<br /><br />When the man finally knocks on her car window, there's a surge of hope that something is finally happening, but that quickly fades at the lack of chemistry between the two protagonists. The "ride" seems interminable and there's almost no conversation between them, so when they finally begin to show an interest for one another, you may find yourself asking "Why?" The man is not convincingly "freezing," by the way. He's not convincing in any sense. Just kind of lukewarm.<br /><br />The obligatory scenes of intimacy are poorly framed, as though the director either has no visual sense, lacks interest or feels apologetic about including them at all.<br /><br />Finally, well over an hour into the film, the couple visits a restaurant to have dinner, and the film seems to acquire some life, as they interact somewhat and look around at the other patrons having dinner. Maybe it's the other diners who contribute the life. Sadly, less than 15 minutes later, the film is over with little sense of completion at all. I don't think the director knew what statement he wanted to make.<br /><br />What the heck, if you've got nothing better to do, it's a nap!
