God awful David Mamet wannabe is so lame, it is truly a shame to see John C. Reilly involved with this giant pigeon droppings of a movie. Everything, and I mean everything about "Criminal" is totally contrived. The film actually is an insult to the audience's intelligence. Stupidity is piled upon stupidity, until an ending that absolutely confirms that essentially you have just wasted 87 minutes. Zero likable characters, zero believable characters, and a script that never should have happened, unless it's purpose was to leave the audience feeling frustrated, annoyed, insulted, and cheated. Definitely one to be avoided, unless you are a glutton for punishment. - MERK
