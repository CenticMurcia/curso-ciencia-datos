It's Monday, April 1 at the morning "Megaphone", the newspaper that's six months behind all big public events. Cub reporter Charley Chase (as Jimmy Jump) arrives to find the newsroom involved in "April Fool's Day" hi-jinks. Mr. Chase is the victim of several tired and true April fool jokes. For example, Chase drinks from a water dribble glass. Then, Chase sits in ink. And, Chase lights an exploding stogie. When the editor's wife telephones for help, after her house catches on fire, everyone thinks it's an April fool joke. Editor's daughter Blanche Mehaffey, whom Chase loves, wouldn't play a cruel April fool's joke on Chase, or would she?
