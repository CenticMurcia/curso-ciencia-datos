O.K, so it's not Shakespeare, it's not meant to be! You just have to take it for what it's worth, go with it and have many laughs along the way! I think you actually forget that they are men, well, maybe not, but it's an enjoyable film, to say the least! Most of the scenes are funny and I think all of the actors do a great job in their roles! I do have to say that I bought the movie because Ron Mathews is a personal trainer at my gym and my friend and I are hot for him! Even though he's straight, I think he has a wandering eye for my beautiful friend, who is also a trainer! It's nice to know that, even if Ron is in reality all straight, that he is comfortable with himself doing a movie like this and kissing men! And, that one scene will give me enough to fantasize about in the gym, especially since he's always fully clothed! Anyway, you won't be disappointed here! In the sense of "Too Wong Foo" and "Priscilla", you'll enjoy this one!
