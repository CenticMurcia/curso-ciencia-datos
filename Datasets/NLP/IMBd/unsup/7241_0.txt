This is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen. So what if the special effects aren't that great, or if the origin doesn't stick to the comics. Nicholas Hammond does really well as the wall-crawler. The rest of the cast does good too. The fights are awesome and so are the stunts. This is definitely a must see for any Spidey fan, like me. I give this film a 10 out of 10.
