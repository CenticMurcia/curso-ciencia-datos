If "Johnny Tsunami" is the feel-good film of 1999, then "The Other Me" has got to be the feel-good film of 2000.<br /><br />I like this movie for so many reasons, including that it's fun to watch, it has great music, and it teaches an important lesson without getting preachy. Andrew Lawrence proved that he can hold his own as not one, but two main characters, as well as proving that he is not just a pretty face in the camera. Everybody who is casted in the movie (including Brendan Jefferson) did a great job, too.<br /><br />When I saw this movie for the first time, I was amazed by what a good job they did, and when it was over, I want to see it again.<br /><br />The one thing that sets this movie apart from other D.C.O.M.s is that you can relate to Will Browning, because you know how he feels and what he has gone through.<br /><br />The message of the movie is that you have to be not just yourself, but your best self.<br /><br />I really love this movie, and I hope it goes out on Disney DVD.
