The fear of mutating into a small apartment, in a world where building is forbidden! Or the best metaphor for a fear of progress or "modernity", I've ever come across.<br /><br />One of the oddest things I've ever seen. Richard Lester must have an impressive budget for this. All the sets are ruins, but they are amazing ruins, cathedrals submerged in water, escalates to nowhere...a bed-sitting room in the middle of the desert.<br /><br />At some point in the past England lost WW3, the shortest and most nuclear of wars, which has left Englands surviving population of about 20 or so completely, if not near completely insane. Those that are not insane, like Dudley more in his balloon powered police car, forbidding people from any kind of re-construction (less the attacks be re-provoked), well these other people are suffering bizarre mutations..mostly into furniture.<br /><br />After a Lord transforms, slowly and hilariously into a full on bed sitting room, others begin mutating, into Cabinents and parrots.<br /><br />The life of a pregnant girl and her family who have been living on the subway (riding in perpetual circles), who decide to go back to the surface world, coincides with the story of our Lord the bed sitting room, which represents a real problem...not only is the man an object, hes the first new building, and sign of civilization in years. When he asks a doctor what he should do about it, "My advice, charge 20 quid rent, be mindful of drafts".<br /><br />Hijinks ensue, and though bleak at times (a few shades light of a dead baby joke), Richard Lester's madcap "The Bed Sitting Room", is one of those odd, clever, allegorical comedies, that's just too smart for it's own good. Too political and absurd in it's time, to have been properly appreciated. For people who like Monty Python, Alejandro Jodorowsky, or Steven Soderbergs "Schizopolis", of whom Richard Lester is the driving influence, this is the only post-ASPCA-slapstick comedy you need to watch.
