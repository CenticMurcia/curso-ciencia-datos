What is not too clear is if the TV show inside the film has been made with real actors or not.<br /><br />It says that it is different than the TV show "Est" but some of the sequences are the same. <br /><br />I have seen some of the clips of "Est" reality show on the web. They even had one with a dog! The dog was locked in the dark and kept for a month. The dog became gradually completely dominated. I have seen clips of "Est" with contestants asleep for a few minutes. If that was a preview, how long do they sleep inside the TV show for? It might be therapeutic to watch people sleeping for hours in the dark, especially if some are in the nude.<br /><br />Real or not real, "Complete Map of the Universe" is great. A CULT film! Does anyone know where to buy the full TV series of "EST" on DVD? It's not currently on Amazon.
