A very important film for Cary Grant. His role as Jerry Warriner in 'The Awful Truth' basically defined the actor Grant that we know today. Before this film, Grant's only films of real note were his supporting performances to that grand old sexpot Mae West in films such as 'She Done Him Wrong' and 'I'm No Angel' and roles opposite 30's female stars Marlene Dietrich in 'Blonde Venus' and Katharine Hepburn in 'Sylvia Scarlett'. Here, Grant comes into his own opposite the incredibly versatile actress Irene Dunne.<br /><br />In this classic 30's screwball comedy, Grant and Dunne star as Jerry and Lucy Warriner, a married couple who decide to get a divorce after some doubts over each other's faithfulness to the union. Of course, in the tradition of screwball comedy, their suspicions are hilariously jumbled and unfounded. <br /><br />This film really hits it's stride when Jerry and Lucy go to court to battle over the custody of their scene-stealing little dog Mr Smith. Lucy wins out in this round (with a little cheating), but there is still 60 days until the Warriner's divorce is finalized and havoc, inevitably, must ensue! <br /><br />Jerry and Lucy do their best to ruin each other's plans for remarriage, each conducting a series of schemes and pranks designed to help banish the other's partner. Jerry and Lucy are clearly meant for each other...but will love win out in the end or will Jerry marry haughty socialite Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont) and Lucy the oil-rich but dumb Dan Leeson (Ralph Bellamy)? <br /><br />This is Grant and Dunne's first screen pairing together, they would go on to make two more successful films after 'The Awful Truth'. The great thing about the Grant/Dunne team is the feeling of equality. Together, they represent a sophisticated, fun couple who are not afraid to have a laugh at themselves. Indeed, Grant and Dunne seem to be sharing a private joke with each other, that others (particularly the clueless Bellamy character) just don't get. Dunne is the best screen partner for Cary Grant - she doesn't have the beauty of other screwball queen Carole Lombard or the fiery wit of Katharine Hepburn, but she plays off Grant's wacky exuberance perfectly.<br /><br />A near perfect film with a near perfect script, 'The Awful Truth' is screwball comedy at it's peak, starring two great actors at their best.
