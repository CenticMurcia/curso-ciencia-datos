The quality of the film was much better than many of these that I've seen. Here are some observations. For some reason, every character is named after a Greek or Roman god. Ulysses is a dork. How could he have fought those battles with Hercules. During the brain freeze that takes up about half the movie, Hercules seems to be having a good time. What exactly caused the brain freeze? Did I miss something. There are a ton of fights. Armies attacking one man and losing, of course. Hercules is tempted but has an excuse in that he doesn't know who he is. As usual, there is an evil queen. Are there any of these movies that don't have an evil queen. I never quite got the whole thing with the two brothers and their fathers and the big conflict, other than they wanted to keep what they had. I must admit, I just couldn't get into it. I've had enough Hercules for a while.
