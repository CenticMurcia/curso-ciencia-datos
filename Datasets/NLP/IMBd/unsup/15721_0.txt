I saw monster last year, and tonight I just saw this documentary. Wow. There is so much more to this woman. Charlize Theron did a good job portraying Aileen, for a glamorous Hollywood actress of flawless beauty--of course it took pounds of added weight and makeup. But the real Aileen isn't as grotesque as Charlize looks in the movie--really. There is a certain charm about the real life woman that I saw in this doc. And a lot more anger.<br /><br />In this doc, we see the woman laugh and joke, she is quite playful at times. But then you look at her eyes change when she talks about her life and you can the whites and it is frightening. And sad. And raw, emotionally powerful. The real life woman she loved betrayed her. And another thing, Charlize has a deep voice, while the real Aileen has a high pitched shrilly voice. The real Aileen seems a lot crazier, a lot angrier. Like that girl in Freeway, a movie I just saw last night. Especially in the scene where she gets picked up and robs the john, and she says, "Cause I'm pissd off and the world owes me." Definitely the same kind of crazed anger and hate. Raw. That's all I have to say.
