I will confess to being bored by this film. So much so that I am amazed that I actually made it to the end. There was nothing there to maintain my interest. Colin Farrell was totally wooden, as was Jamie Foxx. The settings were beautiful, but every internal scene seemed to have been filmed in semi-darkness.At least the actors didn't fall into that awful American habit of inserting what sounds like 'full stop' every 3 or 3 words, but dialogue was still slurred and on occasions difficult to discern. Thank goodness for subtitles on DVD! The entire content of the film was just about enough for a 40 minute TV episode, but alas the film lacked the humour and self-deprecation of the original TV series. This isn't quite the worst film I've watched in the last 12 months, but it's pretty close. In summary : Style over substance.
