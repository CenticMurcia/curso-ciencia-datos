A friend of mine purchased this movie in a bargain bin, with a few others. Now, I am generally a fan of bad movies, particularly bad horror movies... This film however, left me aghast.<br /><br />I can summarize this simply, with the event that transpired after the film completed.<br /><br />Me:"I will give you a quarter to let me microwave that." Friend:"5 cents a second."<br /><br />The quarter was more then enough to put that poor DVD out of its misery. It then was aptly flung around until it shattered on a radiator.<br /><br />This movie is firmly placed at the status of "The Worst Movie Ever". And anytime someone brings up an alternative, I merely offer this one up as evidence. This movie has only a single place, that of forgotten obscurity, it is unfortunate that it was so bad, it has been wedged into my mind forever.
