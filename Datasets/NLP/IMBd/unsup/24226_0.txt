*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Interesting, entertaining crime drama set in the wild days of China's very own "sin city." Hence there's plenty of raucous nightclubs, chorus lines, Chinese gangsters, packed dancefloors and assorted inequities for every taste. <br /><br />With this backdrop, a young, orphaned moppet from the countryside arrives, and is put to work by his distant family.<br /><br />The story, directed by Zhang Yimou, is woven skillfully to encompass the many sides of its characters. A veritable tapestry of rich characterizations come forth. Of course, the darker side of organized crime, away from the spectacular show numbers and bounding bonvivant feeling, we are shown in gritty detail. For example, the seedy, suffocating quality of life that has become, in essence, living death for a gangster's moll. The country boy, in a strange way becomes her sounding board. The two finds themselves so desperately out of control of their lives, they exude anguish.<br /><br />In summation, the film is visually sumptuous, the performances are rather good (although a notable few are wooden) and the story line is clever. Recommended.
