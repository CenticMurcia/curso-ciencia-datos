When I was a kid attending Catholic school many years ago, my class used to show Davey and Goliath on the school TV. The show taught us to be good Christians without being overly preachy and shoving religion down your throat and it was really entertaining. Recently, I was channel surfing and came across the RISE channel, one of several religious channels that my cable provider carries (along with Prayer Channel, EWTN) and they air not only D&G, but also Bible Man. I heard about this show from the E! True Hollywood Story on Eight Is Enough. I took a look and...GREAT...GOOGLY...MOWGLI!! What in the world was I looking at? <br /><br />A wealthy Bruce Wayne-ish man played by Willie Aames (who did not age well; hard to believe that he was once a teen idol) going through a crisis of some kind decides to dress like a cross between Robocop and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars and fight wussy villains with light-sabers while spreading the word of God. If one wants to spread the word of God, wouldn't it be easier to be a preacher or volunteer at a church or something? To go from Eight Is Enough and Charles In Charge to THIS??? I know getting acting gigs after teen idol stardom is tough but Jesus Christ what was he thinking? I have nothing against Christian entertainment, is this really the best they can come up with? Kids want to be entertained, but I just can't see kids being entertained by this. If I was a kid, I would be puzzled by this. I know they mean well, but Christian entertainment doesn't have to be...well...like this.<br /><br />Just have your kids watch D&G and VeggieTales. Those will definitely entertain kids while teaching them the Bible at the same time. They just won't know that they're learning the Book.
