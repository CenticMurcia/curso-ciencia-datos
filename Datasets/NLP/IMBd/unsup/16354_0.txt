When Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created the character of Captain America he was an inspirational action hero. The movie does the same without the inspirational and action hero part. You do not sympathize with Cap because the actor is so stiff he is in no way believable. No wonder his brilliant father is a recluse. The Red Skull is only the Red Skull for about five minutes, then because I guess they could not afford to keep making him up so they make him look stupid for the rest of the film. It is a real shame it potentially could have been a great looking make up job. What was the point of making him Italian? To further separate this travesty from the great comic book character? And why was this pollution bill such a big deal?! It was an environmental bill that so angered the bad guys so bad that they kidnapped the leader of the free world! In case you did not understand what I was getting at, they kidnapped the leader of the world's most powerful nation because of an environmental bill, not protesting or boycotting or writing their Congressman or circulating a petition but kidnapping a prominent world leader. Avoid this movie at all costs.
