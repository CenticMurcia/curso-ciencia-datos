This crime tale is weird, suspenseful and filtered with off beat humor. Situational drama does little to help this well acted, but trying story line. The hardest part of watching is seeing Ann-Margret as an enabling granny that tells one lie on top of another.<br /><br />Marg Helgenberger is the movies brightest spot. Nicholas Campbell is on the edge and totally believable. Henry Thomas seems to have phoned his part in from a phone booth, sorry.<br /><br />A quirky little murder mystery that features brutal truth. Give it a shot.
