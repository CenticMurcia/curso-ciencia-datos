I rented this really wanting to enjoy this film, i like this genre,i think it had some strong actors,however i was disappointed it seemed forced it reminded me of "garden state" another painful film... <br /><br />It was full of moments where justin would deliver a supposedly profound line, pause, as if to suddenly inspire you,he wasn't a bad actor he just seemed very misplaced.<br /><br />I found rebecca to just be simply ridiculous she delivered her lines with the expressiveness of dried paint, she tried to be the quirky yet cute girl next door, then the dark broken stoner girl, roles few can pull off. How is it that this movie had so much acclaim? watching this movie simply made teenagers look like angsty,medicated,sex crazed fools. i felt the irony of keanu reeves character just over the top and to awkward. i feel as though this film had some potential. I also sensed and element of Imaginary Heroes,a movie that has stayed with me almost as a guide as to what this genre can truly but but rarely is.
