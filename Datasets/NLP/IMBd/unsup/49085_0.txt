Every stereo type is here. Russians are evil, Americans are wonderful, the rest of the world does not exist except as onlookers.<br /><br />Were we all really stupid enough to get on a bus, wait in line and go into a cinema to watch this? I noticed the special effects were made by people out of the Blue Peter school of special effects. A Boeing 707 lands with the Russians on board...The USSR at that time would NOT own Boeing aircraft, especially to transport their people around internationally.<br /><br />Awful film, skip it. A real shame so many BIG stars made this, I suppose the money was good.
