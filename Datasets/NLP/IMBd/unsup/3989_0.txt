OK so the story line is different but the characters are clich√© and the actors are appalling. Especially the lead actor (Kristine Blackport), she thinks too highly of her acting abilities and you can definitely tell! I'm really surprised that she is the lead actress in this movie, I mean it has independent written all over it, but still she is atrocious, many of the extras could probably have done the role/movie more justice. The music also doesn't help at all, it's annoying at best. The only thing that made this movie watchable was definitely the cinematography! It was artful and flowing and did the most towards helping understand what was going on, although the scene changes were a little jumpy, visually this film was great! Acting-wise it was beyond poor!
