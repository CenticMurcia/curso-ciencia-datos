This movie seems like the last chance for Mr.President G.W.Bush. He's hit from above, exactly from some upstairs floor of a building in Chicago, during a night in the next year. A hard day's night: the movie begins with some "protesters", as the documented buffoons calls the people asking for justice, THEN peace. Mr. President, rarely called by his name, justifies his killers: "the protesters"....something that recalls Jesus, rather than J.F.K. After 20 minutes, he's shot down. My god, again... No, this time it's just by fiction....something that Mr. G.W.Bush, accidentally, Mr.President, and accidentally very down as regards popularity in 2006, knows very well. He knows fiction at least as much as fiction was the Iraq mass destruction weapons, and their sites proofs that were shown to the Americans, and to the world. Fiction again with his Edipo's death year: 2007. Have you ever dreamed about some loved one's death ? A car accident, or some other sad ending ? Did it happen during a trouble with your loved one ? How did you feel once awake ? Well, go and make your excuses to Mr.President: you've just seen His best dream ever.....instead of explaining a lots of unpleasant questions, he's just dead.....by fiction, of course. The rest of the movie is your personal nightmare.
