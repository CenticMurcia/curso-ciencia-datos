This is one of the worst action movies i have ever seen, even Lundgren is mediocre in it!. It's not Lundgren's fault he tires his best with the very crappy material and manages to come out of this looking somewhat decent!. The dialog is laughable,and the action scenes are very tame and awfully uninteresting, plus the characters all sucked!. I was expecting this to be bad, but not this bad, as this is unquestionably the worst Lundgren film i have ever seen, and i LOVE Lundgren!,plus what was footage of Storm Catcher doing in here?. The main villains are laughably weak, and there is hardly anything interesting going on at all, plus this has got to be one of the worst Die Hard clone ever!. Dolph does not even have that much screen time, and he's supposed to be the hero?, and Meilani Paul is extremely annoying as the love interest, plus, this will have you snoozing. Avoid this one like the plague, there is absolutely no reason to see this, i suggest even Die Hard Lundgren fans(like me) avoid this as well. The Direction is god awful!. Damian Lee, does a god awful job here, with really bad camera work, bad shots during the tame action scenes, and did a great job at keeping it bland and boring throughout!. The Acting is terrible!. Dolph Lundgren does what he can with the very crappy material he is given here, however his chemistry with Meilani Paul is way off, and while he was likable, he just seemed to be going through the motions, however i still Love Lundgren , and he deserves better movies then this lousy crap!(Lundgren Rules!). Meilani Paul is terrible as the love interest,she was annoying and very unconvincing!. Alexander Kuznetsov is laughable as the main villain, and wasn't menacing at all. Natalie Radford is just as bad, i didn't buy her performance at all. Rest of the cast is equally as bad. Overall Please avoid this at all costs, no one should go through this torture!. BOMB out of 5
