When it comes to cardboard cutout villains Wincott is up there with the best.Almost as bad as allowing deranged cops to mete out their own justice. Michael Madsen will always be a bad guy to me, however this was a fair try at another style. Not a movie to recommend.Marvellous scenery though, and that was some RV so roomy! I did like Michele Scarabelli's performance she has the greatest eyes. The maps were confusing to me as quite a few of the place names were the same as here in England for example Berkshire etc. I had to do a double take quite a few times! To sum it all up if your'e at a loose end and can't get out and about for some reason then do rent this fella.
