WARNING: THIS COMMENT CONTAINS Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />OK, number one, there were a lot of mistakes and goofs, such as the concrete floors in the sub others talk about, and also, the "villain", the terrorist plotting to destroy New York and Moscow, doesn't seem threatening at all and could almost be on a comedy show. He's a terrible villain. Then, the aircraft fire missiles, and lo and behold, they turn into torpedoes! None of the torpedoes hit the sub, even though no decoys are fired, and yet the sub still takes hits. The same scene is shown underwater with the sub multiple times. And, the crew seems to die rather quickly from the virus, though the villain, Kretz has a vile of it crammed in his mouth and survives for a very long time. And Nadia (Natalie Radford)'s performance was not convincing at all. She seems almost pathetic. Overall, it was OK, as I've always been a sucker for submarine movies, but if you want a good submarine movie, get U-571 or K-19: The Widowmaker, as this one is quite poor, and the goofs are all too obvious.
