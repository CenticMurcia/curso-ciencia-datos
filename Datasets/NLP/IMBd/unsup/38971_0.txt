As with many sequels, this doesn't measure up to the original. In fact, I found this film - as opposed to the first one - very offensive. Of course, my beliefs had changed since first viewing "Sister Act." However, this film definitely irreverent.<br /><br />There are many irreverent remarks made throughout this film made by a number of people who just take the credibility of a real Believer to task. Yeah, the nuns are still "good guys," but don't fool yourself: there's a lot of secular bias in this script. Nobody in here, including all the Catholics, takes Christianity with an seriousness. Hey, if Hollywood takes it as a joke, it wants everyone to do the same. That seems to be the message of this movie.<br /><br />Also, as in many sequels they took a part of something that worked, and then overdid it the second time. In this case, it's Kathy Nijimy's role. She was cute and bubbly in a minor role in the original, got recognized for her performance and now has much bigger part. Unfortunately, they overdid all that giggling to the point where the woman is downright annoying.
