I am a HUGE John Wayne fan. But I couldn't watch this one all the way through. The dialog is so stiff and stilted and full of anti-communist cliches. It is so plainly a propaganda piece, I don't understand why the USAF wouldn't let it be released for 6 years. But after finding out Howard Hughes directed it ... I now know why he went into seclusion in his last days!
