With the DVD release of Lois & Clark I remember why I loved this series so much. It wasn't the best series on television, but it was very entertaining. I really loved to watch it and still do. But the weirdest thing for me is the fact I felt very nostalgic when I put on the DVD with the pilot episode. And I still can't believe the series ended nearly ten years ago already. This was one of the first (if not the first) series I really followed, pilot to finale. And now, ten years later (and 24 y/o), I'm doing it again. And that feels weird. There have been other series released on DVD that I followed, or are older than L&C, but this still was the first. What I liked about the series was how they managed to make it seem like they had a much bigger budget. The special effects are really bad from time to time, but with the focus on something else you really didn't care. There always was something in the show that didn't make you notice. And the fact that the story's of the episodes are simply fun also makes it very good. I don't know how else to put it, the story's weren't that good, but they were fun. And I think that's something that is discarded very easily today. A series or movie has to be really good to receive a high rating. I rather rate how much fun I had when I watched it. So "Lois & Clark, the New Adventures of Superman" receives another full 7 points.
