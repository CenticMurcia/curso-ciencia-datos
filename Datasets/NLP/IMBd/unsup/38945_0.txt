I give it a three. This movie is very unoriginal.<br /><br />Spoiler alert.<br /><br />The supposedly artistic scenes are unoriginal and seem like they are supposed to freak you out, but makes you yawn. Bodies struggling behind a sheet of plastic has been done over and over. Many unoriginal aspects in this movie.<br /><br />I am not drawn into the characters. It does not make me actually care what happened to Hanna.<br /><br />Vince Canlas's (Cain) acting was especially bad. Oz's last scene was really corny.<br /><br />What's that? You meet your sweetheart in heaven in the end? Yawn.<br /><br />Couple good things: Nathan Mobley's(Samuel North) acting wasn't bad.<br /><br />The scene in the junk yard: The actor that plays the first body out of the hearse looks like Johnny Depp. Yum.
