Which is why I rented it. An OK movie about a cop who "goes outside the rules" to track what he suspects is a serial killer. Like other reviewers, I laughed at stuff that was probably not supposed to be amusing just because Woods was so damn funny. He plays a fairly sleazy guy, which is what he does best. Charles Durning is also very good, as is Lesley Ann Warren, though I just wanted to slap her character a couple of times for being so stupid and whiny. The sudden, no BS ending is awesome--I love it when movies end with an abrupt blackout like that, and he gets a great ending line. I played the ending back a few times it was so cool and bada$$. This movie was actually surprisingly disturbing in parts, there's a really gruesome scene where Wood's character (I can't remember the cop's name, it was probably Jake or Jack or something snarky like that)finds a murder victim about 3/4 of the way through the film that really shocked me and gave me the creeps. Anyway, a good underrated film with a kick-a$$ ending.
