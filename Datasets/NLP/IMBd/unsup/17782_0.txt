I saw the show when I was a teenager and loved it instantly. And I still do, as I observed when I saw it again more than 20 years later. Sure, the environment and the tricks are looking a little cheap today, so what. Every show is aging. There isn't much action as in Star Trek, which at one point only seemed to discover planets with beautiful but strange women. Much of the action is between the characters, how to deal with fear,their situation and the loneliness... Love it or hate it, the show had something special. Till today I saved a huge crush on Martin Landau as an actor, I watch everything, even his weakest movies. And I saved a huge crush on Captain Alan Carter as a character of the show, I'd love to be an Eagle-Pilot! Forget that it's a 70s show and enjoy it.
