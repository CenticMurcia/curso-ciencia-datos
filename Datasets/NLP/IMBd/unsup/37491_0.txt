I was an extra in this movie it was my first and only stint in film, It was filmed inside the Albuquerque convention center and in white sands NM around 1993. I wish I was in the credits but they forgot to mention me despite my awesome acting skills. I'm in the first few scenes I'm a prisoner on the ship there is about 3 scenes were i can be seen if your quick with the pause button. The film was not a very big budget movie but I'm not really sure how much it costs to shoot. The reason I auditioned for the film is because I wanted to be a sand pirate but they ended up casting me for a prisoner due to my poor horse riding skills. The movie was originally made for the Sci Fi channel and VHS copies were scarce and expensive to purchase, however you can pick them up on ebay from time to time.
