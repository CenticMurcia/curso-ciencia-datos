A cigarette takes away 6 min of your life, this movie takes away 80 min of it. I cannot believe I watched this movie till the end, hoping the story would develop, it did'nt. Basically darkside blues takes place in the future where some corporate evil is up to their no good doings, and there are a bunch of rebels against them, and some mysterious guy appears out of nowhere, the end. I don't remember all of it, since I am trying to forget about this disaster. I would recommend anything else over this, yes even garbage pail kids the movie!
