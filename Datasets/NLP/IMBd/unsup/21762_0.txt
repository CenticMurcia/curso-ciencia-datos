This is one of those movies which determines who you want to hang out with and who you don't. In other words, if you are open to new ideas, enjoy movies which go outside the box, and are a free thinker, then Darjeeling Limited is for you. But if you are on the conservative side and more apt to rent a family-oriented, typical Hollywood melodrama, then this movie is not going to be your cup of tea. Because you see, Darjeeling Limited is creative, absolutely creative, and entertains from start to finish. The viewer of this unique, esoteric movie is treated with very visceral cinematography, which was breathtaking, from beginning to end. More than anything Darjeeling Limited is very much like taking a trip, namely in this case going along for a ride to visit exotic places, and interesting sometimes confounding people. Making this movie even more intricate are a host of family dynamics, quite humorously blown out of proportion or sometimes even exponentially exaggerated. There are also issues of grief, and hence part of this movie is these brothers journeying for some sense of resolve or closure. So in other words, it is a richly thought out script this movie is based upon. Most of all, as a viewer of these three brothers' often outrageous antics, I personally loved being a part of all of it, sharing their discovery of new places, seeing new people and above all experiencing their lives. And for those who have seen Darjeeling Limited and are still asking themselves what it was all about or what was the point of this movie, it is essentially an allegorical tale of how rewarding your life can be if you are willing to open up your mind, enjoy life and above all explore the world and the people around you. That is what this movie is all about---c'est tout! I must admit that I enjoyed this movie so much that I was dreading the moment it ended. I know this movie is way too cool for a sequel, but one can only hope.
