Very well acted war drama. Excellent cast, with Paulette Goddard particularly effective. Viewing the film gives one an insight into the mood of the country at the time. While revisionists have tried to make atrocities forgotten in their quest for political correctness, this film doesn't soften the ruthlessness of the Japanese forces.
