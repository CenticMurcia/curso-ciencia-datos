If you are looking for the type of movie usually associated with the name Dracula, this isn't it. There is no blood sucking, cross and holy water fearing, and no burning in sunlight. This is a wonderful account of the legend/history of the man behind the myth. Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula is a well-written, well-researched account of the legend of Prince Vlad III Dracula or Vlad the Impaler. His rise to power, his brutal means of torture and the loss of his wife to the madness that his ways caused her. Mr. Martin is a wonderful actor that gave his role as the Prince a 3 dimensional and more human outlook on the man who haunts history as a viscous and sadistic ruler with a taste for unnameable torture. Mr. Martin's supporting cast add fullness to the film and leaves little disappointment for viewers. Wonderful location shots and well-researched period costumes round out feel of this historically based film and add a touch of authenticity to the feel of the film.
