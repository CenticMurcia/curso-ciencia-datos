Total crap! A bunch of idiots, one is a fat *beep*. Please don't make any other films EVER! Please for the love of film! Keep these people out of film. I want to smack these losers for being so lame. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is even worse. No one in this movie ever has the appropriate reaction to any situation.I recently attended an Eyeball Stabbing Convention, and I must say it was most refreshing after watching this monstrous filth. fact of the matter is their is nothing to be proud of about being fat. Sure you can say I'm a fat-stoner thats the way i am, but fact of the matter is your unhealthy, your body is being pushed to the limit and your more than likely gonna die young. Hey all power to ya, but if you were really proud of your body you would take care of it and lose weight!!!!!
