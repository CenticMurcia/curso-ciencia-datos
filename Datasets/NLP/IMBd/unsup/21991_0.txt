Eddie Albert's 2nd nomination for best supporting actor in the 1972 film, "The Heartbreak Kid."<br /><br />One can ask how can a picture be good when its hero, played by Charles Grodin, marries Jeannie Berlin in synagogue at the beginning of the film, and by the latter's end, he is marrying Cybil Shepherd in church. Oy vey!<br /><br />Yet it happens. On his honeymoon with Berlin, he is taken back by the lovely Shepherd, love here is the obstacle. What is he to do with Berlin? Murder, is not legal we know.<br /><br />If that isn't enough, he runs up against Shepherd's father, played with a fine demeanor by Eddie Albert, who conveys the typical WASP feeling. How can this average Jewish guy win over a man, a typical WASP? This becomes the central theme.<br /><br />Jeannie Berlin was nominated for best supporting actress. Just look at her face filled with cream to cover that sun-burn that keeps her locked up in the room while Grodin cavorts with his love.<br /><br />A comic look at some very serious issues. Well worth the look.
