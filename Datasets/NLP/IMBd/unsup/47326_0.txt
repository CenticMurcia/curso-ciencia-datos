While PET 2 features the same director as PET 1, it is far inferior. Essentially what we have here is a zombie movie, minus the thrills. A veterinarian loses his wife to a freak accident and ends up moving with his young son to the town that houses the legendary and mysterious pet cemetery. Before you know it, once-dead animals and people are once again walking all over the place, raising holy hell. Anthony Edwards of ER fame is the vet and Ed Furlong is his son. Edwards is boring and Furlong is unconvincing as someone who becomes obsessed with bringing back the dead. The one saving grace here is Clancy Brown as a sadistic sheriff who dies and comes back absolutely delighted to be undead. Brown carries most of the movie, and is loads of fun as he slaughters the living and generally wreaks mayhem. The rest is hogwash and the story lacks internal logic (for instance, Brown kills the town bully and then revives him, but why?). The gore is stepped up a bit from the original, but this is because there are more flesh-eating dead people walking around this time.
