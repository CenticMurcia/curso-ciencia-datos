Movie earned warm heavy applause after its screening in the Dubai International Film Festival yesterday evening: the audience, a mix of Europeans, Middle Easterns, and Indians, showered the director and author and lead actress with questions after the show. I particularly admired the ending (spoiler ahead): sticking the "bindi" on George Washington's forehead - an excellent subtle invitation for a critical look on what drives work (and inevitably life) that the movie did not pretend to tackle head-on yet illustrated throughout: after all, placing the missing piece isn't foreign to Seattle. <br /><br />It is also quite remarkable that both authors are not Indian: asking my Mumbai-native friends for a reality check, they only confirmed the movie did indeed capture a good realistic snapshot of what India is like. At least in those corners explored. Quite impressive research efforts from the two authors. <br /><br />It would be a shame if this movie doesn't spread to more screenings in more theaters in more countries: although marketing it may seem a challenge in a monochrome world, it definitely can have many advocates among those who go and actually see it. It would be fantastic to work on spreading it by independent unconventional means then track its success: are we about to witness a new revolution in cinema marketing? I can dream on but then, myself neither Indian nor American, I cannot see how one must be either to absolutely enjoy this excellent piece of work.
