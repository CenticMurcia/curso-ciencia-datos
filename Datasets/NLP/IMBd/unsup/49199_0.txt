For a movie that goes for 90 minutes to last my group of friends 120 minutes to watch one must think it's pretty awful.<br /><br />We paused the film many times to talk about what happened but still ended up finishing the movie with no clue.<br /><br />The story was very nicely written but was all over the place. For some reason Hokkaido had been taken over or something and a tower was built... Why??? don't ask me What happens??? I don't know... it was nice but not good,. I may be writing a critique about this film but it was so confusing do not know what to write about. It was just so hard...<br /><br />Watch it if you need to fall asleep.
