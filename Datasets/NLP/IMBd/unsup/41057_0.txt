Believe it or not, I often like to watch low-budget bad movies. They often can be unintentionally funny with their inept acting, writing and direction. However, some bad films manage to be bad but not particularly watchable--they're just dull beyond belief. This is exactly how I'd describe PREHISTORIC WOMEN. Now you'd think perhaps with a title like this that there might be some sexy cave-babes, but frankly none of the well-groomed ladies looked particularly attractive--even if they all had nicely permed hair! And as for the men, apparently these cavemen almost all have smooth shaven faces and decent hairdos as well! They looked even less like cave people than Fred or Wilma Flintstone!! As for the rest of the film, although it was filmed in color, the print I saw was very, very muddy looking and ugly. And, most of the film either was done in pantomime or was narrated--creating a film that managed to be even less interesting than either version of 1,000,000 BC--plus, unlike the 1960s version, there was no Raquel Welch as eye candy! The only positive I can see about the film is that there was only one goofy looking dinosaur (a pterodactyl) and the rest of the animals were all tigers, panthers and an elephant with mammoth-like tusks added.<br /><br />Goofy grunts, strangely coiffed ladies and insipid narration, this film is a sure cure to insomnia. While not among the very worst films I have seen, it sure was among the dullest.
