The name for this movie sounded pretty cool, so i was expecting to see a fairly decent movie. Oh was i wrong, i could have read the words "Sonic Impact" over and over again for 90 minutes and probably enjoy it more than the movie itself. This movie is among the worst movies i've seen in years. STAY AWAY.
