What really had the premise for being a great "who-done-it" mystery, falls flat with a script that waned toward the end. The predictability factor came in heavy around the middle, and the plot of using a dupe to do ones bidding is pretty formulaic. Lou Diamond Phillips, who is a super and intelligent actor, can't carry the picture on his presence alone. Madchen Amick also performs greatly, yet can't save the script, either.<br /><br />While certainly not a turkey, HANGMAN never realizes its full potential, and the supreme lack of urgency or suspense didn't help. What the viewer is left with is a story that probably sounded good on paper, but fell far short on actual, physical execution. No pun intended. Recommended, but just barely over the mediocre hump.
