"Blood Lake" is one of those movies that has to be seen to be believed. I had already seen this a few years ago and have finally gotten the chance to review it. But in my review, I was wondering if I should judge it on camp value (like Plan 9 From Outer Space) or just on its own merits in terms of film-making style. I decided on the later, since this was purely painful.<br /><br />If there were words in the Webster's dictionary that could describe how much I hated this movie, I would definitely use them. However, there are not. The acting is horrid across the board. There are long sequences in which absolutely nothing happens (when I say "nothing" I mean nothing). Apparently, the filmmakers felt that the viewers could watch the characters playing cards for 45 minutes. It was more like 10 minutes, but it felt like 45. At any rate, a scene of characters playing cards (without some significance to the plot, in this case there was none) shouldn't last longer than 30 seconds.<br /><br />That scene was particularly frustrating (thank God for picture-on-picture) but the rest of the movie wasn't any better. The heavy metal soundtrack particularly made me laugh, mainly because it reminded me of the horrendous 80s rock.
