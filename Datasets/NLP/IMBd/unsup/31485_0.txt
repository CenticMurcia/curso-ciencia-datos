Yes honestly, i still feel that SWADES is Ashutosh's best film, Jodha Akbar does not had the soul to hold the movie till the end. the script was not as good as of Swades and Lagaan. Swades hold u till the end of the movie and Lagaan does because Cricket in Lagan was the main lifeline of the movie along-with script<br /><br />Hrithik, Aishwarya acted brilliantly along-with the entire cast<br /><br />Technically it is one of the best which came out of India Cinematography, definitely deserve a special mention along-with Choreography <br /><br />rating 7/10
