The basic idea behind this film as that a whole lot of messed up things happen...some a bit pointless, some are really, really weird, and a few are amazingly funny.<br /><br />if you're in the mood for a really messed up, yet really good movie, then this is your choice for the night.<br /><br />for the low brow crowd...lucy lui is naked in this<br /><br />seriously though, this movie was quite good. kind of sad klaus koch hasn't made another movie since.
