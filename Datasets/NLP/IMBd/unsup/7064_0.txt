"Visitor Q" sat on my shelf for about a month before I gathered the gumption to put it in one night and I have to say, what they hell was I waiting for??? I read some reviews that suggested this movie was far too disgusting for a regular Joe to view. I beg to differ. While definitely not "Mary Poppins," this film will be regarded as standard fare to the mature Italian horror and vintage exploitation fan.<br /><br />A really screwed up family is visited by a stranger. He bashes the father on the head, torments the jerky little abusive son, teaches the mother to milk herself and develops a crush on the daughter. The whole thing is filmed like a reality TV show and Miike was way ahead of his time on this one. I doubt someone could top him, even now. As usual, he throws in scenes that will disgust pretty much ANYONE but "Visitor Q" is missing the elements of stomach-turning violence and torture that we have come to expect from this director and I think this is one of his better films for the lack of that.<br /><br />So, grab a pizza, a few buddies, your mom, dad, and sister and watch this one on a school night! <br /><br />8 out of 10, kids.
