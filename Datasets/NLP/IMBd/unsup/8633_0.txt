Let me tell you how much I loved Cinderella III. I always thought that Cinderella I didn't tell me much about the prince, and how "charming" he really is, so I never found Cinderella I a fantastic movie. There was no manly fighting for love on his half, but in Cinderella III, he tried and fight for her. It was like, that's the Prince Charming I'm looking for. And because I still think like a kid, I say you should listen to me on this. Cinderella III rocked socks. :) I absolutely loved it. I would shout it out in caps about how much i loved it, but this site won't let me. It gave my heart a tingly feeling and everything! and... it was some-what of a thriller! wow. that's the word. even my little brother loved this movie... and he's a little kid so buy this movie.
