I spent 15 years trying to find this film before finally picking up a UK pre certificate tape of it.<br /><br />Well it was pretty much just as I expected it to be.Lots of soft core action with obscured viewing angles and action just out of screen etc. In fact you could be forgiven for calling this a soft core Ben Dover since the director Steve Perry went on to create the Ben Dover series and this plays exactly like a Ben Dover film. You do get the feeling that there are hardcore scenes that have been removed but I don't know of a stronger version.<br /><br />Not really worth the Â£50 I paid for it (uk pre certificate tapes are very collectible) but a worthy addition to my collection none the less.
