Well, it certainly is not the best CGI film I have ever seen. In fact, it is not even in the top 10, and that is just getting started. I am not trying to be mean, but this was not a good film. And no, its not just because they paired Chris Rock with Ben Stiller.<br /><br />Seriously, Stiller and Rock? Well I guess I can see how they would be locked away in a prison cell and have to fight with each other over pieces of bacon and raw fish, but not on an animated movie. Even though the thought of Ben Stiller trying to eat Chris Rock in real life brings me some small chuckles.<br /><br />Anyway, the CGI isn't well done. Not only that, but the characters aren't well developed. I still don't know how this pair landed in the zoo. Then again...<br /><br />Overall, not a good CGI film. "D+"
