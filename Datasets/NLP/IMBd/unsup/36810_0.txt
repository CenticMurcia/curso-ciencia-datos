From Hell wants to be everything. Sadly it is nothing, besides extreme violence. Seven had violence with style and for a reason. From Hell is like Dead Presidents (which is better, though it´s still pretty bad): graphic violence and that´s it. The direction is horrible and Graham shows us that she can´t act in a serious role. Meaningless and wannabe dark movie is what it is.
