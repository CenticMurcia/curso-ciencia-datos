You know, it's like a Spaghetti Western, but with ray-guns.<br /><br />This film was made in 1978, after Luigi and Mario figured out there was some money to be made in this Science Fiction stuff. so what you have is a ripoff of Star Wars with no budget for special effects or sets or actors. But they did have a bunch of people running around in really tight spandex. And some gal with a butch haircut who wonders why the captain doesn't notice her. Well, because you have your hair cut like a boy, you silly thing! <br /><br />They even had their android soldiers wield something that looked vaguely like lightsabers.<br /><br />I still think we should confiscate Italy's entire supply of blank film, just as a precaution.
