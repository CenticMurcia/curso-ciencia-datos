"Candyman:Day of the Dead" is an incredible pile of garbage.The script is not only awful,but extremely predictable with a totally pathetic ending(I won't go into it,but you might kick in your TV set after viewing it).The acting is really pitiful,with dialogue to match.OK,there are some nice splatter scenes(I like especially the sequence in the car when one guy is slowly gutted),but the rest of the film absolutely sucks.To sum up,"Candyman:Day of the Dead" is one of the worst horror movies ever made-bland,boring and mind numbingly stupid and gets 3 only because of some pretty good gore.I really like bad horror movies,but this is an insult.Avoid it at all costs.Not recommended.
