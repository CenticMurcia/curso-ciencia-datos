First I watched this cartoon 2 years ago, after three episodes I understood that this is stupid cartoon about stupid unreal people. First Cramp family. Brainless father, mother with soapy brain, aggressive Wayne, Lucien, who supposed to be smart, is just to obsessed with ecology, healthy food etc... Winkle family is another strange family, rich, fat, stupid aggressive father, Wendy, who is too obsessed with Wayne and hate all other children and people etc. Parsons family is just... just ancient, they have never visited school, they don't have paper, they live near Cramp family, but in a house made of junk near bog. If characters and situations from many other cartoons can be projected on real people, these are too unreal and not funny, that is the reason for not to watch this cartoon.
