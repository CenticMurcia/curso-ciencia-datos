while making this movie ?!! no plot-line whatsoever. someone falling in love, getting married and having a baby, husband dieing and then remarrying; is that what u need to watch in a 3 hr long, so called family drama movie ?! John Abraham, as good looking he might be, needs to learn little bit of dancing too if he wants to survive in bollywood; but then i might be wrong.. And Salman Khan definitely needs to learn acting. Rani Mukherjee, Amitabh and Hemamalini are just OK.. Terrible Audio (tune & mixing both). Rani Mukherjee has awesome voice but her expression doesn't match the dialog delivery. wouldn't' recommend this movie to anyone. even to the most bored to death ones !!!
