I had really been looking forward to this one but it turned out to be a complete train wreck.<br /><br />The casting of Dustfinger, Capricorn, Meggie and Farid was pretty much perfect, though. Mo was unremarkable, but then that's just how I remember him from the first book. Elinor matched the spirit of the character in the books quite well but the looks were quite off. Fenoglio was so-so.<br /><br />Basta and Capricorn's mother were ridiculous laughing stock and not inherently fear-inducing as they should have been. Roxane (who is never even fleetingly mentioned in the first book IIRC) had black hair!<br /><br />The script just rushed through the first 80% of the book in what barely seemed like half an hour, skipping anything that would have helped in either understanding the characters (or even the plot) or building up atmosphere, just to close with a completely tacked-on, contrived new ending that killed any hope for a (better) sequel. It's quite obvious from this that they're not intending to film the other two books or at least not in a way that will have anything at all to do with them.<br /><br />As rushed as it all felt it was really painful to sit through from quite early on. If I was that type I might have left the theatre half-way through it.<br /><br />Don't see this if the books meant anything to you!
