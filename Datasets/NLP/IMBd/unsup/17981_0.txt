I remember growing up with "Dennis The Menace" TV re-runs. I loved the black & white sit-com, but this 1990s movie version almost tops it! That lovable sling-shot-toting kid with the cowlick is an unlikely "menace" to retired postman Mr. Wilson, who wants nothing more than to be left alone. Dennis Mitchell always seeks out Mr. Wilson's company, but each time disaster strikes, usually causing harm to property or Mr. Wilson (sometimes both). Mrs. Wilson adores Dennis and often volunteers to watch him when the Mitchell's list of possible baby-sitters is exhausted.<br /><br />There is a sub-plot with a "bad guy" who, of course gets "fixed" by our hero. This is the perfect family movie. It's funny, sweet and makes you feel good when it's through. I showed this video to my 4th grade class (as a reward). I never saw a group of 10 year-olds enjoy a film like they did this one. Enjoy this wonderful film again and again, it's a gem!
