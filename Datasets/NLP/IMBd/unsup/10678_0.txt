Don't expect this film to be a major contribution to the art of film; just sit back and enjoy the silliness. Why bother to do that? Because along the way you get to see Mickey Rooney turn his sow's ear supporting role into a silk purse. As an eccentric who is obsessed with what he likes to call "the magic of the movies," Rooney lights up this film. Is he really as simple, gentle, and loving as he appears? Or is there a darker side to his character? Right up to the climactic moment of a wonderful monologue he delivers to two mesmerized kids, you're not really sure. Rooney has a great time with bringing to life a character that one would like to think resembles the actor himself. His presence makes an otherwise highly forgettable Disney product worth a look.
