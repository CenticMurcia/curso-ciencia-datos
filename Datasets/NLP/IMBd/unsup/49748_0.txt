This movie is the worst horror movie i've ever seen. Everything sucks; the actors, the plot, the lines, EVERYTHING!<br /><br />By the way, this is a Swedish movie, with Swedish actors, but they all speak English, and it sounds terrible... their grammar isn't exactly 'perfect'. Another thing i have to mention is that you can clearly see a cameraman in a scene where they're driving a car. In the extra-material, they even speak with the cameraman that screwed up the scene.. hmm?<br /><br />If you'r planning to see this movie, don't expect too much, just expect to laugh... a lot!, then everything's gonna be alright. ... but as a comedy, it definitely worth a peek ^^
