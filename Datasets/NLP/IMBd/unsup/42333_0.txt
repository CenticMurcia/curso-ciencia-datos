Seeing this movie after many since it hit the screens, I can only say that I am glad I did not pay to go and see it in the cinema - caught it on a free DVD recently! The plot holes are so large to be laughable. Was there a war on in Norfolk? Only bit I saw was an old mine warning on a beach that was too hilly and rocky to be Norfolk, let alone the lack of planes going overhead! The acting bears no scrutiny - accents wobbling left right and centre, or downright awful as in Sutherland's case. He was to repeat this role in another awful adaptation of Ken Follett! Michael Caine was in his prime in looks but at the depths of his acting capabilities. Lew Grade was trying to make world class films at the time, but this one like his legionnaire film is an utter disaster. A re-run of 'Went The Day Well' in the middle does not match the earlier wartime movie. And poor John Sturges - what an end to a career?! - as director! And I am still looking for the marsh that Sutherland was supposed to be warden of? Yes, Tom your 'Valkyrie' was a decidedly better attempt at good Germans than this long forgotten puerile rubbish.
