I watched "The Appointment" on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. It was not the worst Christian movie I have ever seen, but it could qualify for the Top Ten. (There are plenty of "Jesus films" that have bad actors, bad scripts, and bad special effects.) Anyway, "The Appointment" is a made-for-video about a woman who is told she has a limited amount of time to live. She is told this by a mysterious man who gives her a Bible. She says she gave those "fairy-tales" up a long time ago. If someone came into MY office and told me I only had a certain amount of time to live, I would call the police. Anyway, following this incident the lady gets paranoid and slowly realizes that maybe she SHOULD be saved. Unfortunately, she is a little too late.<br /><br />The ending isn't happy, but it certainly did not make any impression on me. It can truthfully be described as cheesy and laughable. The acting was stiff and the script was terrible. I recommend you NOT use this as a witnessing tool. TRUST ME.
