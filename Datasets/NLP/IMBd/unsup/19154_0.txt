This movie is worth renting for a few scenes, like seeing LL Cool J burst in and performing "Can't Live Without My Radio" during the Krush Groove auditions. Unfortunately, the storyline is weak, and the acting is terrible. However, if you're a true old school fan, be prepared for some classic scenes featuring the likes of Sheila E., RUN DMC, the Beastie Boys, The Fat Boys, LL, and so on.
