This movie was recommended to me by a couple friends. It was vehemently endorsed by other friends. So I rented this movie at their insistence. I no longer wish to speak to these people. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Little to nothing of the plot was believable. The casting was horrible. The acting was worse, and worst of all... <br /><br />*spoiler* <br /><br />Willem Defoe dressing up like a woman at the end to help the "saints" could be the worst moment in cinematic history. Any acclaim he has ever received from any other role should be retracted because of his awful portray in this film. <br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, don't. If you have, please tell me how best to forget this awful movie experience.
