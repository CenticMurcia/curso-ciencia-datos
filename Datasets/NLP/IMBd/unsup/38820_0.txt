I, as a rabid "Trekker" who really liked all of Gene Roddenberry's work, really hated this show. It was truly bottom of the barrel. I was amazed it lasted 5 years, though here in the DC area we only saw it for three, as it got dropped due to low ratings, I guess. The spaceship looked like a toy, the acting was, well not even acting, and the writing was set for 10 year old's. Kevin Sorbo, who I understand is as nice a guy as there is, must have done strictly for the money. I doubt we'll see this show pop up again in furhter syndication here in the states, though it will probably make it's way over to Europe where it will be a bit hit, due to the strange taste's over there.
