Story: A bunch of teenagers go to a camp and get killed. According to the people who made this film, it's a celebration to low budget horror movies, especially Friday the 13th. I love those movies, but I truly hate this one.<br /><br />Camp Slaughter has nothing of what once made the Friday the 13th movies great. 20 years later, the special effects are even worse, truly terrible. The acting never was a major factor for the success of Friday movies, but compared to the acting in Camp Slaughter, the whole crew should have gotten Academy awards. Neither does Camp Slaughter have any of the kind of self ironic humour that always where present in the older low budget movies. And worst of all: it has no originality what so ever. Everything in Camp Slaughter has not only been done before, it has been done much much better before. In fact: it has never been done worse. Camp Slaughter is not a celebration to Friday the 13th. It's a rip off that, if anything, gives the whole genre of low budget horror movies a bad name.<br /><br />And no, it's not even so bad it's good. It's just so bad it's almost unbearable <br /><br />Before seeing Camp Slaughter I had only given one movie the worst grade ever, a 1 out of 10. After seeing this, I'm actually considering upgrading the other movie, because I'm not sure there is another movie that completely lacks every quality in the way Camp Slaughter does. A movie couldn't possible be more pointless and boring. <br /><br />So terrible it's below the scale. Avoid at all costs.
