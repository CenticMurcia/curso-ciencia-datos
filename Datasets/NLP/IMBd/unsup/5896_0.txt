Having not read the book and hearing how great it is I was looking forward to seeing this one. The movie started off a little confusing and Eric Bana seemed a little stiff in the lead role and i was worried this movie was going to be a big disappointment. Gladly after about 15 minutes the movie settled into a very nice love story with a great time jumping twist and Eric Bana got better and better as the story went along.<br /><br />Some people found the time travelling too unbelievable in that what would happen if he was driving or how come the police were never looking for him? etc etc. You could spend all day picking that apart but i found it easy to just overlook and enjoy his time jumping journey. Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana have good chemistry together and with the good script they were giving did a very nice job. <br /><br />As far as time travelling love stories go this one was great and my gf and myself really enjoyed it and look forward to reading the book. If your looking for something sweet and different to rent I recommend this one :)
