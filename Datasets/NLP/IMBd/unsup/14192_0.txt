An undeserved BOMB of 1967, directed by A. Litvak co-starring the golden boys of five years earlier in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (GREAT FILM), with a great supporting cast - Pleasance, J. Pettet, Tom Courtenay, Charles Gray..etc., it was the wrong year to talk about NAZI officers being private pervert/murderers in a world that was concerned about MODERN issues...like who was Robert Wagner dating that Summer? <br /><br />A 7 out of 10. Best performance = Mr. O'Toole. Sharif is modestly intense as Major Grau to O'Toole's General Tanz (great names) with sub-plots that flow over each other like babbling brooks in Alice in Wonderland (during WWII) in Europe. It's really an incredible experience without being ART or TRASH or POPULAR or JUNKY-FUN. Does that make sense? Well, it if doesn't, go watch TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN or SCHINDLER'S LIST, or TAZA SON OF COCHISE, or THE PENTHOUSE or DUCK YOU SUCKER ....or even KING'S ROW - or God forbid - BOLERO) which did prove to the world that Bo Derek looked exactly like John Derek's first two wives in face and body - Ursula Andres & Linda Evans, but I'm straying from the film, sorry.<br /><br />Gripping, it covers a lot of territory in a HIGH-BUDGET setting (If this had been made a year later, instead of being pre-BONNIE & CLYDE, THE GRADUATE< IN COLD BLOOD, etc.) it would have been up for the Golden Boy Oscar come Spring, but that year between 1966-1967 (in films anyway) changed because of (what the great critic Stanley Kaufmann coined) "THE FILM GENERATION" was born. Young people in college or not, who lives were affected, not just by popular art (as the Beatles started out)..but into a whole majestic realm of thinking individually and still be a part of whatever movement touched your fancy. Sorry, I'm talking about America now and not the film. <br /><br />Well worth your time..a lot of uniforms (mainly Nazis) and there's no German actors in the film and nobody pretends to have a German accent.
