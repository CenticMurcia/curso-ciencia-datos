Finally the 3 DVD set of Jodhaa Akbar came out and it is absolutely worth the agonising wait! And there's an added bonus of a set of 12 postcards with images from the film, included with the package. Onto the film....<br /><br />Primarily as the director says on the 3rd DVD, the film is about the love story between Jodhaa & Akbar, then it is about the historical reference & the battles. The film grips you from beginning to end and you become involved and consumed by the whole story. There is no doubt Ashwariya Rai Bachchan is beautiful and effortless in the role of Jodhaa and it is captivating to see how well Hrithik Roshan portrays Akbar falling in love with her; his subtle expressions are heart stopping & he manages to convey his blossoming love through his eyes so well, you can see what a genuinely talented actor he is.<br /><br />There are some deleted scenes on the 3rd DVD & my favourite, which I wished they'd kept in the film, is when Akbar says to Jodhaa whilst out on a hunting trip............well you will just have to buy the whole package to see the scene in question. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. This is just my opinion and people will have their own but for me Jodhaa Akbar has already become a classic.<br /><br />My final praise for the film is for the music by A A Rahman & the lyrics by Javed Aktar. The music fits into the film perfectly and vice versa, especially when Akbar goesinto a trance whilst listening to Khwaja Mere Khwaja. Amitbah has said this is the best scene in a film in this decade.
