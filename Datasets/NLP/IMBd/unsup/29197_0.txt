This is one of the first 'surreal' films that I have seen. Phantom of Liberty for the most part is quite a normal film with a structured narrative and some quite well defined characters What makes it brilliant is the fact that one minute, its just a normal film and then a scene where a family sit at a table on toilet seats is thrown at us. Followed by each family member coming to another room to eat on their own. Distorting reality. Weird! Some parts of the film are so absurd they are funny. Such as an early scene where some parents look at pictures and deem them 'disgusting' when they are just pictures of buildings. Its very strange and humorous in general.<br /><br />The are minimal cuts in the camera work, shots flow together nicely. For example a two shot may not cut to an over the shoulder shot, but just adjust to it. A technique which I liked.<br /><br />I found this film to be quite oddly lit. Is often dark and light is used kind of sparingly. Odd, as the film sometimes almost looks like shades of grey through its darkness.<br /><br />I'm guessing that the criterion version is the way to go, I saw a version taped from TV about 6 years ago, which was at times fuzzy and grainy. Anyway, to sum up. A mad film that defies logic, is funny, shocking and engaging to the last perfect frame. Highly recommended!
