We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that. As to this movie, it is extremely wonderful for everyone especially the kids. We loved it. Dakota Fanning is destined to be one of the top actresses of all time and she is only 11? Every movie she makes is simply the best. She is one in a million. The supporting actors in the movie are equal to the task. Kurt Russell and Elizabeth Shue (It was great to see her again) are extremely pleasurable to watch. So go on your own or with the kids it is a lot of fun.
