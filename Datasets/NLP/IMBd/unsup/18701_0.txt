Ramon Novarro is quite charming in the title role of this little-known film. All of the other stars also do a superb job: Renee Adoree, Dorothy Janis, and Donald Crisp. It's amazing to me how natural and contemporary this film seems after 72 years. Novarro is funny, dramatic and quite believable in the title role.<br /><br />It just about breaks one's heart to realize that Renee Adoree died at the age of 35, about 3 years after the release of this film. If you enjoy her in this film, be sure to see her performance in "The Big Parade".<br /><br />Donald Crisp's role harkens back to his character in "Broken Blossoms", and his is the only performance in this film that teeters a little toward the melodramatic side.<br /><br />Viewers may also be interested to know that Novarro had attempted a legitimate singing career in opera and recitals, and it is his voice you hear in the overdubbed recording.
