Where to begin, OK easy. The gore was ridiculous and the "beheading" looked like it was planned by a third grader with no knowledge of human anatomy. The acting was bad I think, if any of them were acting and not just wandering through the picture. I believe that the middle portion of this was filmed by three different directors. Upon seeing what they had wrought all three committed suicide when they were overcome with deserved guilt. Along comes a fourth director with no conscience, probably one who makes the Disney tween shows, and he takes all three of the others' work and pastes it together. How else can one explain our "heroine" suddenly stopping and declaring she would find the others, but then abandon her friend and return to a simpering useless twit again. And the ending made absolutely no sense. Surprise who else is a killer, but then lets the girl go after she killed his brother, and after he killed a guy for facing his brother?!?
