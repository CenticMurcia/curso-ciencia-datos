I thought that the book was better than the movie. I felt like i was in the 1800's most of the movie. Some of the characters were not included in the movie. Though there was many negatives in this movie there was also some positives. These positives were. The movie had a good story line. A great climax, and rising action. It showed what the Jewish people had to go through. out of all the positives and negatives i give this movie an over all rating a 4 out of 10. I would like to thank some people as my closeing statement. I would like to thank my teacher Mr. Pagogna for introducing me to this title. I would like to thank the author for writing a great book. it grabed my attention right away.
