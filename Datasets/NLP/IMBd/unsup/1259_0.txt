I think it is a really good movie, though the ending was a bit too short and too fast, I would have liked them to spin some more drama and emotions on the fact, that Hannah had the experience she had in regards to Aunt Eva. I was a little disappointed by that. Like the feeling of something not ended. Too bad:), but otherwise a really good movie for people who like the more thoughtfully, slow and emotional movies. I really like the way Kirsten plays the role of Hannah. I'm not really familiar with her acting besides Spiderman, so it was nice to see her in another kind of role. <br /><br />I will definitely consider to read the novel, which the movie is based on. I'm sure it must be worth reading.
