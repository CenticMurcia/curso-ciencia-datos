This is a lot of fun. This is simple gag after gag moving along quick. Humor reminds me of John Waters, Malcolm in the Middle. I am not taking this movie one bit serious and I am not looking for art. We are just laughing every minute. The color and clothes are really great. And these TVs are some of the best (I have been with). The 10 line minimum is hard to live with. My comments are complete and I can not say more without repeating myself. The movie is still funny and still like I said in my comments. Quality over quantity is always a great policy. You have to be kidding. Um. The color clothes I like are many colors. Why are you forcing me to say more than I have to say?
