This is considered to be the weakest story of series two and it's not very difficult to see why . Coming after a couple of stories , one of which is considered to be a modern classic ( The Impossible Planat/Satan Pit ) while the other ( Love And Monsters ) is one of the most radical pieces of television produced Fear Her was never going to be all that well received , but its Luke warm reception is to do mainly with the fact it's a very dull predictable story <br /><br />If you watched the " next time " trailer from the previous week then you'll know in advance as to what the story is about and therefore there's no suspense . You also can't help notice that because the plot was one of those written on the back of a cigarette packet efforts then there's so much padding centered around on dysfunctional family issues , in this case single parenthood . Really I often think some of the writers would be more at home working on EASTENDERS or CORONATION STREET . All this is bad enough but we've got a bloody stupid sequence of the Doctor carrying the Olympic torch ! It shows had badly constructed the episode was when you've got to include crap like that
