"Killa Season" is a film all about Cam'ron. It has nothing to do with characters , plot or even his album (which the movie is titled after) , instead it is about Cam'ron. Cam'ron is as interesting as a Mutant Ninja Turtle. The ironic part is that a Mutant Ninja Turtle would probably act better than he does in this movie. Cam'ron I guess is supposed to be playing himself , but he's not very good or convincing as himself which is sort of sad. Look at Eminem for example who played a character in "8 Mile" who was based on himself and he was terrific. Also,It's embarrassing when Cam'ron tries to show off his dramatic skills and even more embarrassing when he talks. "Killa Season" is pure garbage.
