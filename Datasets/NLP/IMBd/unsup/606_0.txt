I started watching this show when I was sick and there wasn't much to watch during daytime TV. At first I thought it would be bad acting because that is the case with a lot of soaps. But after a couple weeks I really enjoyed it and actually hated leaving during the day because I would miss it. The characters all are different, yet I feel like I can really understand all of their point of views even if they are conflicting. My favorite characters are Kate and Chelsea even though they aren't known as the nicest people at least they they are believable. I also admire Sammi because of her determination, meaning she is not one to give up even if she may hurt someone else. I think Kayla should change her hairstyle, it was better before.
