Hmmm.....now this is a real film. I thought these kinds of films were dead. Original Sin shows me that they are not and they are better than ever.<br /><br />I tell you, I absolutely loved this picture. It grabs you from the first shot and never lets go. Its s thriller, but it is also "a story about love, not a love story." It examines love and its consequences. It will show you what love is.<br /><br />The chemistry between Jolie and Bandera's is fantastic. You believe it. You believe that they are in love and will do anything to be together. Its fabulous.<br /><br />Go see it. You will love it!
