Good grief. Someone *paid* actual *money* to make this?<br /><br />If you want to watch people having sex, buy a porn movie, and be prepared to put up with lousy acting, ghastly dialog, and a plot (if any) that a two year old wrote. <br /><br />This is utterly bizarre. Lousy acting, ghastly dialog, a plot a two year old would have eschewed... and lousy sex. OK, someone wanted to make it, someone put up a budget, all this I understand. What I don't understand is - why is it on my TV screen? <br /><br />(Except it isn't - I can surely find a channel with something better on. Even if it's white noise.) <br /><br />Click
