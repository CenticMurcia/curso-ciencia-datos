I saw this movie the other day on TV and my impression is that the director and the writer didn't know what to do. The action scenes are impressive by Hollywood standards, but that doesn't make something good. Craig is portraying Bond like he was already in all secret services, killed a million opponents, learned every small trick, but this is the beginning of how he became a spy (that is explained for only 2-3 minutes at the beginning and this had to be developed further). Also what is wrong with the director destroying the Aston Martin? It was always a car to admire and packed with a range of interesting goodies. The only purpose it had is to revive Bond. And the Montenegro scenes are ridiculous!!! There are no such modern and fast trains in the country (the average speed is 50 km/h), the city is a copy of some swiss, Bavarian or bohemian town and the beach is shot at some tropical island (there is no golden sand in Montenegro and the color of water is totally different). The plot is rather mixed up, everybody had a motive, but the change is so fast that it makes no sense, and at the end the secret guy comes up to take the prize. The timing for everybody is just perfect! Like some robots with orders. All in all I had to watch it to the end, because there was nothing else on the TV to switch to. 3/10
