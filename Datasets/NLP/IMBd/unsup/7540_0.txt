Frank Giorgio, the owner of a lobster place in Brooklyn is facing the possible loss of the business that has been in the family since the 1930s. To make matters worse, his own marriage has failed before his own eyes, as Maureen, his wife of many years has decided she has had enough, and moves out. Frank's life, as he knew it, is coming crashing down on him. One of the solutions for his problems is to sell the business to a franchise restaurant who wants the location, but being so proud, it is something he doesn't want to consider. His own sense of loyalty to the place his parents dedicated their lives to, plays heavily on his soul.<br /><br />All this is happening around Christmas. Michael, the son who has left Brooklyn to make a name for himself in Seattle, returns for a visit with his fianc√©e, the gorgeous Kerry, whose family is rich and might be interested in investing in his father failing business. Michael is torn between his own ambition about the company he has established in the West Coast, or come to the help of his old man.<br /><br />"Brooklyn Lobster" was a rare surprise to find the other night on cable. It's a story written and directed by Kevin Jordan, who evidently knows what he is talking about, since it appears it has some biographical slant to it. The film involves the viewer because the situation at the center of the story feels plausible. It's a different kind of story without following any formula.<br /><br />Mr. Jordan was lucky in finding Danny Aiello, an actor that always projects honesty in his work, to impersonate the older Giorgio. Mr. Aiello is one of the best reasons for watching the film, as he pulls us into the story without any effort. Daniel Sauli is also good as Michael, the son who has left, only to come back and finds out things are not good at home. Jane Curtin, a rarely used actress, plays Maureen, the wife that has decided to move on, rather than to stay with Frank, yet, she still stays close to home.<br /><br />This is a film that feels real from beginning to end thanks to the solid writing by Kevin Jordan and his clear view of a family in trouble.
