Personally, I find Foyle's War very well done for a war time series and a police series for that matter. I also like the characters' personalities. Foyle does not use foul language nor does he raise his voice along with other main characters. Sam's character is actually uplifting as a chauffeur and her being helpful to Foyle. For most police series I rather watch British series such as Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders, New Tricks, Rosemary & Thyme, A Touch Of Frost, etc. rather than those hyper tension ones that American networks are bringing out.<br /><br />I watch it with my wife on either TV Ontario or WPBS from the US. we like it very much.
