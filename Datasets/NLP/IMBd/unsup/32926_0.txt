What a shame... when you have a child actor who is capable of stealing every scene, why not feature him in more scenes? Why not only pick vehicles that'll showcase the incredible talent the kid has? What a riot Spencer Breslin is but unfortunately this movie did not do very well in showing that or showing enough of it. No, the movie wasn't totally about him but golly gee whiz, it shoulda been Â‘cause he out-acted and was funnier than anyone else in this movie. Through the first third or so Kid Breslin wasn't really funny much at all. The relationship shown between the brothers was bordering on creepy and was really UnAmerican for the most part... 99% of siblings of that age difference in America just do not act like that. As the movie progresses Spencer's character changes and is pushed out of the spotlight. For the final third of the movie when he's back he's much better, funnier and it is a delight to watch him. He's so funny and for that reason alone I'd recommend this movie and see it again myself. Couple downfalls - the actor who played the dad was not an American. Since this was filmed in New Zealand they used a lot of local actors and the dad was one... and he tried to do an American accent and half the time failed to execute it perfectly. Really an embarrassment. What's interesting is the actresses who played the mom and the blonde girlfriend, along with the dude who played dad, were on, at one time, `Shortland Street' - the most popular soap opera in New Zealand. But in this movie only the dad, to me, clearly appeared to be acting American... he just couldn't pull off a U.S. accent in all his speaking scenes. Terrible. Also very UnAmerican in this movie was the high school band all dressed up in spiffy suits... looked very out of place for what appeared to be a public high school... actually, it did appear to be in place for a high school in New Zealand. AHHHHHHHH.... friggin' producers just can't get it together to film more American movies in America where they should be filmed to give Americans jobs. No, instead they have to go thousands of miles away where actors are cheaper and production is cheaper. And in going that far you have potential to have little things out of place such as what's happened here. But those things didn't mess with the movie too much and what is basic, the story we have in this movie, isn't too bad. I enjoyed it. Wasn't outstanding and I thought it was kinda similar to `Wish Upon a Star' which is seen on The Disney Channel. A.J. Trauth was pretty darn good but for the life of me I couldn't understand why his character would rather be a freak skater instead of the high school football team's quarterback with the hottest cheerleader in school for his girlfriend!??! Beyond me, truly beyond me! Overall this movie's worth it for Spencer Breslin but that's about it. It flows well, it's interesting and it's very family friendly but it's nothing that's very memorable. My grade for this: C
