This has to be one of the WORST movies of all time. The ten minutes that I watched, (which is all I could stand), was a complete waste of my time. Whoever spent money to make this tragedy should have to pay people to sit and watch it. Has to be the WORST film I have ever tried to watch. Do NOT recommend watching this. This has taken one of the best movies and turned it into a complete mockery. The actors do not help this movie either. I do not have any idea what the director or actors/actresses were thinking when they agreed to make this very poor example of a film. The film should be burned and all record of it's existence should be deleted before someone else makes the mistake of trying to watch it.
