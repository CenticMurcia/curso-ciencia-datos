I watched this movie several times because it didn't flow well at all but it had some great information in it. The beginning seems about one subject and suddenly it becomes an entirely different plot. Maybe the writers and director didn't want to spoon feed the audience into anticipating everything. <br /><br />The whole film had a home movie quality about it but there are some very good performances in spite of this. <br /><br />Maybe someone will remake this and fix the problems. I wonder which story they will go with?? Really though, either story in this film is worth watching. And it could be fixed where the first story could move into the second smoothly. That would be my preference. If they did that I would watch it again to see who plays the surprising characters in that one. There are several characters that are very much worth watching.
