I gave it a 2 because the actors were OK, the actresses quite pretty and they seemed to make at least a half-hearted effort.<br /><br />The rest of the movie however is awful. There's little suspense other than the odd shock, the plot is poor, the script awful and the production value horrendous.<br /><br />I've tried really hard to be generous with this one but have found it difficult. It's also quite perturbing to see Jerry O'Connell's brother in this movie as there are flashes when one thinks it's him, but then the realisation seeps in that it's just someone who looks like him!<br /><br />Avoid. Don't even waste your money on renting this one.
