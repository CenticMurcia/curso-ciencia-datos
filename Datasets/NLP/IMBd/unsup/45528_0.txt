C. Sheen's character gets laid off within a day of discovering a SETI-like signal; he expects his girlfriend, who obviously doesn't give a hoot about his work, to be interested...she isn't. He buys lots of gear, gets a job doing satellite installs and secretly wires the customers dishes into an array so he may continue his work. I think C. Sheen was on amphetamines or something like that for this 'performance'; the overacting was laughable. I wanted to like the movie but couldn't pull it off. The dialog was fairly stupid as was the annoying kid who hangs around Mr. Sheen's apt. Sheen's colleague and a woman he meets while investigating are both murdered but old Zaminski (Sheen) is allowed to wander around breaching security at JPL and an installation in Mexico, unscathed. The Mexico installation was interesting but not enough to warrant seeing the movie. This movie had potential...just too bad it was thrown together haphazardly.
