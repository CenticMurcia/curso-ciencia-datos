Having just watched this absolute GEM HOW COULD IT NOT BE PICKED UP !!!!!! It is exceptionally rare for me to find a program that is laugh out loud funny - but this is it!!! Adam West was born to play this role The sheer absurdity of the deductive process is fantastic. If only I had the capacity to commission the series myself!!!! This could have been family guy!!! Any chance Conan and friends could be persuaded to try and resurrect this one?<br /><br />Turning up to the audition dressed as the character was inspired. Could have cameo appearances from Burt ward, get teamed up with Leslie Nielsen.<br /><br />Definitely an opportunity missed by the networks here in my opinion
