I adore all other versions of Charles Addams' creations. But this one is the worst. Hearing what others had to say, I told myself that a movie can't be that bad. Well, I was right. It was worse.<br /><br />Tim Curry is a great actor. As long as he isn't Gomez.<br /><br />Daryl Hannah, I won't get into it. She was trying too hard to be as good as Anjelica Huston in the role.<br /><br />Nicole Fugere was decent in "The New Addams Family." Nicole and Alice Ghostly (Grandmama) were the only two characters who didn't make me want to kill them.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad movie if you like to make fun of a movie while you watch it.
