Darkplace is absolutely fantastic!!! Some may not get it, but for the ones with a brilliant eye for comedy and attention to detail, this in my books has yet to be beat. I love the office (UK) but this just pips it at the post. So many subtle strokes of wit and genius are hidden under the mask of the pretend fake cheap sets etc.<br /><br />Little nuances of dialogue, and facial expressions that could be easily missed by the casual viewer. Amazing quotes, and the setting is so authentic.<br /><br />Some cool quotes...<br /><br />Padre to Dagless " You're the most sensitive man i know. And I know god!" Sanchez. "Its egg in soup, serve that with a pork-pie/sausage roll." Thornton reed" And I've worked with Lulu! and 5 other people." I have just realised that merely writing down these quotes will do little to prove its comedy. Its all about the delivery of the lines and the comedic timing. Every single line of dialogue uttered by Sanchez and his actor alter-ego Todd Rivers, is pure gold. I'm glad he made it into the rather weak "IT crowd" in series 2, he truly made that series worth watching. The brilliant music video played in episode 6 "Red hot lover" is worthy of recognition alone. It even beats the "Rick rolled" video of Rick Astley on the web. Hilarious! I truly hope that Darkplace gets a much needed second series. Man to man with dean learner was good, but it suffered a lack of Sanchez.<br /><br />I also read rumours that a movie of Darkplace was getting made. I really hope this comes true.<br /><br />Come on channel-4, MORE DARKPLACE PLEASE!!!!!!!
