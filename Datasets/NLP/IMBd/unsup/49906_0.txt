Fay Dunaway and Brenda Vaccaro are the only real reasons to watch this movie. Those two women steal the show. <br /><br />Helen Slater as Supergirl was an okay choice, but it was her first film. She's come a long way (acting wise) since then. Still, it isn't her fault. <br /><br />The story is trite and the action sequences are muddled with silly attempts at comedy. <br /><br />The romance subplot was mind-numbingly ridiculous. <br /><br />Even Jimmy Olsen from the Superman films (Marc McClure) had a few schmaltzy scenes. <br /><br />This is so-not a good movie.
