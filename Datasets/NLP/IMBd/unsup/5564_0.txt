The television show is somewhat enjoyable, but I have some issues about it. First, the show's main character is in a sad situation because he is working for the devil. Second, demons and fallen angels are never righteous because of their natures.<br /><br />However, some of the plots are enjoyable because they remind me of the Ghostbusters movies and cartoon series because the characters used "vessels" to capture demons and send them back to hell. It is a similar pattern to the way that the Ghostbusters captured spooks through the use of ghost-traps.<br /><br />Therefore, I hope that the second season of Reaper helps to show that the characters have an encounter with God and Jesus Christ.
