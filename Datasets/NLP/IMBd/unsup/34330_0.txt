Poor production values, poor acting, and a poor script can do nothing for the success story of Meat Loaf. In recent interviews, Meat has made statements to the effect that he didn't know WHAT he had put on tape, until Rundgren came on the scene and did his production wizardry...here we have Todd's role reduced to saying something like "More motorcycle sounds!" two or three times. By the time his story is run through THIS blender, it comes out more like strained prunes than Meat Loaf!
