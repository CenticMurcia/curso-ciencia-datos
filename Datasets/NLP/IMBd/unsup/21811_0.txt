An interesting look at a house of drughead punks/homeless types in late 1970s/early 80s Australia (someone said Melbourne eh? That'd figure...certainly wasn't Brisbane! :-) ) Kinda like the Sid and Nancy of Oz, including the bittersweet ending. Although it's been years since I saw this film, and it's not available anywhere in the States (although I did see a copy in a Sydney video rental place...anyone wanna sell me one?) I distinctly recall Michael Hutchence's gloomy smackhead character experiencing THE most realistic acid trip at a party I've ever seen on film (and trust me, that's sayin something). Pretty plot less, yes, but worth it just for that scene.
