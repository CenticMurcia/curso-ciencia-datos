This is my wife's favorite movie mostly because of John Travolta. But is also has a massive appeal in a lot of other areas.<br /><br />Grease's charm lies mainly in the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is happy to be a goofy musical about a time that never really existed - it presents the 50's like a silly cartoon but makes it work and takes you along for the ride. Just sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />Parents be warned - there is more vulgarity in this movie than its sugar-coated surface would let you believe. (Trivia - Sonny mumbles something at the principal in dialect Italian. Any guesses? He ain't complementing her perfume).<br /><br />I love Grease - its ham-handed, corny, silly and 100% pure fun. ***1/2 out of ****.
