I really love Modigliani's work, so I was excited to see this movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it turned out to be disappointing. While Andy Garcia is a good actor, he's an unconvincing Modigliani-- he looked much too clean, well-fed and robust for (most) of the film! The music was bland, terrible and out of place- instead of heightening the experience, it transformed most scenes into cheesy, sentimental, and trite. The ending was far too drawn out, and it only made the movie more clich√©d and sentimental. Jeanne talks about her intense love for Modigliani at the beginning and end of the film, but we really hardly even get to see that-- her character is flat. Consequently, these "dramatic scenes" of her love for him come off as contrived and ineffective. Another thing I didn't like was the way the characters spoke. As a reviewer mentioned before, they switched from different languages and accents at the drop of a hat.. which was weird. From American English to European accents to European language. It was annoying. <br /><br />But, I liked Elsa Zylberstein as Jeanne. She looked just like a Modigliani painting. A good scene was the one where Modigliani and Picasso visited Renoir, as was the scene at Picasso's exhibition where one of Modigliani's paintings was shown.<br /><br />But, overall, I feel that the movie was trying way too hard to be dramatic, artsy, and decadent and it really didn't accomplish any of it. I thought it was a rather contrived, emotionless effort that didn't do much justice to the artist.
