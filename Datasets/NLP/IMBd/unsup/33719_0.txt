As far as slasher flicks that cast Santa Claus as a mad killer are concerned, this is a passable yet forgettable offering from actor David Hess (in his one and only directorial effort). One of the main problems, which detracts a lot from the tone and atmosphere, is the lack of snowit would have complemented the killer's exploits perfectly, yet there's none to be found. Also irritating is the insufficient lighting during nighttime sequences, in which the action is sometimes impossible to make out. However, "To All a Good Night" is a cut above most derivative slashers, even though it starts out with the mandatory sex-obsessed sorority girls (plus one cute wallflower) and assembly-line violence, it gets progressively better as it goes alongcreating an adequate atmosphere of dread and giving its surviving characters a bit of personality and humanity.
