You tell me that this is good comedy? It may be so, if you accept that acting like a stupid moron, trying your a** out to make people laugh, may be called some sort of comedy, maybe. But we are talking about cinema, not some street circus. This is a plot less piece of crap filled with cheap jokes, bad acting...in fact everything in this "thing" is so bad, I can't even dare to call it a movie<br /><br />it may be inspired from Romanian reality, so what? I may take a picture of a dog crapping and will be equally better, I may even call it a metaphoric and elitist movie...<br /><br />Sad, very sad
