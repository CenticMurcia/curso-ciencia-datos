although Long Time Dead has nothing new to offer to the diserning horror fan it isnt at all bad. When you think about it there arent that many films that involve Ouiji boards which is quite suprising when this activity is one of the most terrifyingly mysterious known. It is also nice to see another good British horror. If you like this then be sure to get hold of Dog Soldiers which is even better. There is some nice ( that is not really the apt word!)moments and even a good twist or two that for a change the viewer does not see coming. Not a cheerleader or token dork in sight. Long live british horror. 7 out of 10.
