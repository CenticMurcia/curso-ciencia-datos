I just finished watching this movie. let me start by saying that I usually dont comment on movies, unless they are exceptionally good or exceptionally bad. normally I just leave a rating. I'll admit, I downloaded this movie purely because Liv Tyler was in it. My expectations were not all that high, just that it have something resembling a plot, decent acting and that she look good in it. Well, they got one of those right, and it damn sure wasn't the acting or the plot. what kind of high quality **** are these people smoking and where can I get some of this stuff. Okay, the main story line of this movie is that this kid stole over $9000 dollars from his employer. this is not a spoiler by the way, it occurs in the first five minutes of the movie. The only form of punishment that he is subjected to is that he has to sit on the couch. no police report, no termination of employment, as a matter of fact, the manager tries to commit fraud to cover up for this guy. Horrible acting, one of the basic 14 or so plots floating around in hollywood, just the names and places substituted. I gave it 3/10, just because of the fact that liv tyler appeared in her underwear, and that you get to see rene zellweger in skimpy clothing, but that was being liberal. I just don't like giving anything a real low score. I dont know what else I can possibly say that could be considered positive. don't waste your time. later.
