My family and I watched High School Musical 2 today. Our cable company allowed us to watch it beginning today. I have to say, I am not usually a fan of sequels, since they are not usually as good as the original. However, this was not the case for this movie. The music is awesome and the storyline was pretty cool. I love the fact that the movie begins with them in school right before summer vacation. It made me wish that my summer vacation was just beginning. Anyway, the movie was great because it seemed like it could have really happened. I will not spoil the details, but there is betrayal of friendship and fighting between siblings. I hope everyone who reads this will watch it!!!!!
