This movie is awful, but it's SUPPOSED to be! Without wonderful cheesyness like this life (and movies) would be a far duller experience. Naish and Chaney, obviously short of cash but always the professionals, give this movie the class Adamson knew it would. That's why he hired them. Chaney's character is sort of "Lenny with an axe", right down to the puppy dog he carries around, and Naish couldn't give a bad performance if he were unconscious. This is a wonderful movie for lovers of the "so bad it's good" school.
