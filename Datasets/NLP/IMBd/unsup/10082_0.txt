Totally generic, forgettable trash. Boring story and terrible animation (typical of Hanna Barbera). Not much different than the equally forgettable TV series, except with this they got "celebrity" voices. Hanna Barbera should never have been hired to make a robot cartoon. There was a reason Transformers is remembered and loved and Gobots gone and forgotten-- the difference in quality of their respective television shows. Both were good toys, but Transformers had fun stories and great animation (for its time). Gobots was standard Saturday Morning schlock. I strongly suggest get the DVDs of "Machine Robo: Revenge of Cronos" (currently out on Region 1) instead and see how the Gobots & Rock Lords should have been done.
