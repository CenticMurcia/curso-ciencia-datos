Loved the story line. Photography good for the era. This is one of the better silent films because it had many dialog cards. I would recommend this one to everybody. If you liked the first talky version of "Lost World" or the original "King Kong" you will like this.<br /><br />This is the story of a scientist who returns from an expedition from the Amazon with a wild story about finding living dinosaurs is meet with ridicule by both the scientific world and the press. Trying to raise people and money for another expedition to rescue a member who had been cut off and left behind, he finds himself with a very unlikely crew. After arriving they themselves become stranded. See the movie to find out if they get rescued or not.
