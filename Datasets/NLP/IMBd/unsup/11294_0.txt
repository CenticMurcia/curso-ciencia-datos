This story of great Americans who fought to preserve out safety and way of life, illustrates that like George Washington and all of the Founding Fathers..We must continue to believe in and have faith in the God that inspired the creators of this nation.. Alan Hale who plays the priest always amazed me. He could do broad comedy and then give heart touching performances as he does in this film. Before Charlton Heston, there was Raymond Massey who made a career of portraying historical characters beautifully. Finally Dennis Morgan who plays flying ace Scott made many great movies and this is one of them. Why he has become almost totally forgotten remains a mystery to me.. A wonderful, inspirational film..I totally recommend it.. John Wayne Schlatter
