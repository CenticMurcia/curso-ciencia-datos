Dasgupta's Kaalpursh is easily one of the finest films to come out in Bollywood. A mind-blowing astounding film. What a film! A film which isn't a commercial in any aspect, yet your gloved in it. Any award given to this flick will be insulting it. Two Thumps Way Up!<br /><br />Performances: Mithun Chakraborty is a Legendary actor of Indian Cinema, My favorite actor. His performance here once again proves that he's the best in the business. Rahul Bose is outstanding, he's an actor who has the potential to go down as one of the most natural actors of Indian Cinema. Sameera Reddy is effortless. Others are also Good.<br /><br />'Kaalpurush' is outstanding, mind blowing film, Which is rich in each and every aspect. Bravo!
