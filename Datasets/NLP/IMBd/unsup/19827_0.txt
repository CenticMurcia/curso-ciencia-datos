Jeff Chandler's performance as Luke Darcy is a classic. He's a megalomaniac, but in some ways you're drawn to him. You know he's a bad guy, yet you're struck by his intelligence and charisma. The line "I'm giving you your dream, and don't worry about me, I've got Kansas." is a classic and it tells you he's got to be stopped. I wish this movie was on DVD, along with his other fine films Broken Arrow, and Pillars Of The Sky. As noted, He might've been able to tackle roles as a character actor had it not been for a tragic mistake during back surgery at the young age of 42. I have always been a fan of Jeff Chandler, and wish more of his films were on DVD.
