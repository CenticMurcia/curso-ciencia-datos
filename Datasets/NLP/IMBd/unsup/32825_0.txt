I found this movie, brain numbing more then anything else.<br /><br />The director tries to portray Gosling as an intelligent underachiever with the wrong mindset, which is very hard to believe when they have Gosling slur out lines that you would think to hear on an Episode of "South Park", and to believe that he could have intelligent people listen and believe what he's saying is outrageous.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also terrible, i really cant comment much on them other then saying that most of them would have been best suited in daytime TV dramas.<br /><br />The action scenes suffer from the same disease, not believable, with fight scenes more at home in a B class movie.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie if you wanted to see something with depth and intelligence.
