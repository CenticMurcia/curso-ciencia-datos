The year i saw this film i was awed by the aspiring vision of what possible immortality could achieve. Seeing Robin Williams in a robotic role such as this,gave a point of view on the world even though he did not realize it in the first place. His family Being loving and caring although one daughter thought otherwise,gave the audience heart,devotion,and a push towards one doing better,or at least becoming the best a person can be. Through the ages of two hundred years,Andrew martin has seen and done it all,to be human to others as he was thriving to be recognized as such. The splendor and special effects was top rate although done not too complicated,which gave a crystal clear view of the surroundings. Streets with people dressed to accommodate the day,with flying transit cars or buildings so clean you can eat off of them. Using a clean fun environment was a beautiful sight to,rather than seeing gutters littered with derelicts,and yet in this movie no such thing exists. I have to say the thought of no villains or chase scenes or bad guys with guns was a fresh approach. I thoroughly enjoyed this film in its entirety,as for death scenes well all i can say its a part of life that everyone must endure in their lives sooner or later. Kids would understand about the meaning of life since a person named Andrew martin has shown them,that even androids come to a decision about their existence and why its important to take the love you feel for another with you. This film is meant for the entire family,its a wonderful teaching tool about life,love,feelings,friends,and family. As one becomes human,so does one become whole.
