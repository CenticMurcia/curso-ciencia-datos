I love animation from the Fleischer Studios, along with Disney,Rankin/Bass, Hanna/Barbera and Studio Ghibli from Japan; this is a excellent film, and beautifully animated from the very studio that delight us with KoKo the Clown,Betty Boop,Popeye the Sailor and Superman. My favorite characters from the film are Princess Glory, she's really beautiful and I should tell you that this film is the reason I love her singing voice actress - Jessica Dragonette; Prince David and Gabby the town-crier, he's very funny. The film also has an excellent soundtrack with great songs too.<br /><br />I was quite intrigued with the story of Gulliver and his adventures in the land of Lilliput,I had watched the Mickey Mouse cartoon "Gulliver Mickey" from 1934 and the version with Sanrio's Keroppi the frog; I think I would like to read the original novel sometime; I love literary films both animated and live action. In short, Gulliver is great fun, and should be enjoyed by everyone in the family - young nor old.
