Recently the Atlantic Film Festival was on in Halifax, Canada, and a friend and I decided to see this movie. The only information given to us was a little blurb in the itinerary for the festival and so I was unsure as to how this documentary would tackle this hot topic. A little worried that it might be a bit dry and perhaps take the stand that one way is right and everything else is wrong, I nonetheless was excited to see this film.<br /><br />The film focuses on the church's view on homosexuality. It tells us the story of 5 families, all with some tie to religion and/or politics, and all with a homosexual family member. Unlike many extreme points of view, this documentary simple looks at the church's take without slandering it. Instead it use a controlled 'here are the facts - you decide' method to convey the message. With the use of music, cartoons, humor, heart-felt and heart-ache moments, a splendid film is created that truly every person should see, straight or gay, Christian or atheist, etc. etc. <br /><br />As the credits began I overheard the two strangers to my left over the roll of applause saying that it should be shown in every high school in North America. I must agree with them, and may I also suggest putting it in every church too.
