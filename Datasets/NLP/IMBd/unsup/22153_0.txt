I thought Hometown legend was a really great movie. Although it and the town were both fictional, it truly captures the feelings about football in Alabama. It is life. Every Friday night, the whole town supports their team at the high school football field, no matter how small that town is or how bad their team really is. It's a great thing. <br /><br />I also thought the religion parts and especially Rachel's prayer in the beginning say it all. The two things in the South your mammas teach you to believe in are God and your high school football team. Everyone supports their team, and football is everything. The movie shows that wonderfully. It was a great movie, and really brings out the feeling of high school in a small town. <br /><br />Yes, the accents were a little extreme and fake at some points,(maybe I just notice it because I grew up in Athens?) but for the most part I loved it. I think whether you are from the south, are never have been here, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.
