The stars could all have performed the musical as written--the most accomplished, acidic, and cynical of Rodgers and Hart's output, thanks to a great book by John O'Hara, but Columbia just couldn't leave well enough alone, although it certainly didn't take away half the score and replace it with half-baked numbers by Roger Edens, like MGM did to "On the Town." At least Columbia just subbed a few other R&H numbers that are always worth hearing.<br /><br />Sinatra was close to perfect for Joey Evans--although certainly no better than Gene Kelly would've been; both Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak were equally attractive, although since the only musical number that Rita has to put across is "Zip," in an incredibly bowdlerized version (robbed of its intellectual heart) I wonder why her voice had to be dubbed. Would it have mattered if it weren't pretty?<br /><br />The fact that this show, one of the most downbeat of all Broadway productions, was turned into yet another sweetsie-poo Hollywood confection (and of course moved from Chi, of which it reeks, to San Francisco, of which it doesn't) is yet another tragedy in the history of taking Broadway musicals to Hollywood, which, with the notable exception of "Oklahoma," just means that the show got butchered. It loses its edge about halfway through, when Joey starts being nice, Vera starts being nice, the puppy is nice, and everyone gets to live happily ever after--what a precious moment!!!<br /><br />Hollywood was better at making its own musicals--"The Wizard of Oz" and "Meet Me In St. Louis"--are head and shoulders above any Broadway adaptation from MGM (whose musicals generally stink) and both Warner Bros and RKO, in the 1930's, make shows that put any of the "spectaculars" in the shade. One Fred and Ginger number is worth about 70 Marge and Gowers.<br /><br />Oddly enough, Columbia showed that it could do a pretty good job with an original musical--one with Rita and Fred Astaire that contains some great original songs by Jerome Kern and at least one terrific dance number with Fred and Rita, "You Were Never Lovelier."<br /><br />What Columbia did to Rita shouldn't ever have happened. With the right handling, she would have been a truly immense star, rather than the pinup girl she was fated to be at the studio most famous for the three stooges.
