Mr.Pegg and Mr. Moran musta had some bills to pay.This is the worst kind of predictable"feel good" tripe imaginable.Immature boy gets girl,immature boy loses girl to rich successful mature boy and then proceeds to mature to win back girl.Also this film tries to have it both ways,there are plenty anti-American digs lobbed about whilst the film repeatedly has tons of product placement shots for Nike.Gotta laugh at that.Not a complete waste but most of the gags are flat and "been there before" kinda stuff.Shame Mr. Pegg seems to be rotating to this kinda tripe,it would make a "nice" double bill with the almost equally as awful "Hot Fuzz"
