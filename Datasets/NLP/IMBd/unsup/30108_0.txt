As always, I have to wait a year or two before getting into watching a television series. A show needs to give me a good reason to watch next week.<br /><br />I really wish I could've seen "24" from the beginning. I only saw bits and pieces of the first season and I liked what I saw but did not stay with the show for various reasons. While watching "24" for the past two weeks, I kept on thinking about the first time "The Fugitive" appeared on television in 1963 and how that show was called innovative. "The Fugitive" and "24" mentioned in the same breath? I think that it's a valid and complimentary comparison. <br /><br />I believe it'll be very hard for "24" creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran to sustain the pace for many seasons. I never thought I would ever say this but I hope "24" doesn't stay on the air for a long time because the power of the show comes from its innovative 24 episode arc: a day in the life of agent Jack Bauer.<br /><br />One last point: this is Kiefer Sutherland's best role in his career. Many of his movie roles don't hold up at all to his complex role of Bauer. You can be in the movies for many years but your best role might come from the so-called small screen and that's the case for Sutherland.<br /><br />Update (May 22, 2005): I just finished watching the season finale of season 5 of "24" and despite a few missteps within some seasons, the show is still an exciting thrill ride. Kiefer Sutherland has signed for three more seasons and I'm looking forward to more shows. <br /><br />I've always felt that past regulars which includes Dennis Haysbert, Reiko Aylesworth, Xander Berkeley and guest stars including Shohreh Aghdashloo gave Emmy-award worthy performances but, unfortunately, Sutherland has been the only actor nominated for 24. Maybe for the concluding season, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Gregory Itzin and/or Jean Smart will finally break through the annual snub from the Emmys.<br /><br />Update (August 28, 2006): Congratulations to "24" for finally winning Emmys for Best Drama Series, Kiefer Sutherland for Best Actor in a Drama Series and Jon Cassar for Best Directing in a Drama Series.
