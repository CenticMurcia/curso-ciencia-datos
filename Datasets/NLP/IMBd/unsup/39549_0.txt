If you want to see a truly bizarre '30s flick, catch this one. Wayne Morris and Priscilla Lane star as a couple who work in the city and then move to the suburbs. He keeps working, she stays home. She has a maid. She picks him up from the 5:15 train each day. She hates it and leaves him and goes back to work in New York. Then she informs her husband and the world she's leaving for Paris with a friend. Morris chases after her. The friend, by the way, is Bogar before he became a star. This film was a programmer, slotted in as a second or even third feature on a single bill. Morris is a horrible actor and thoroughly unconvincing as a businessman. Lane channels Ginger Rogers throughout, which is unsettling. Bogart merely treads water. And the film is poorly written. While it was billed as a comedy, it is more of a drama -- with cartoon music constantly playing in the background. Filmed almost entirely on the lot, it gets a little jarring during a brief car chase, the footage of which doesn't match the rest of the photography. If you watch it, take it for the curio that it is. Better yet, watch a BLONDIE flick instead. Better plots, better acting, more believable. Blondie was played by an actress named Penny Singleton, who just so happens o appear in this flick.
