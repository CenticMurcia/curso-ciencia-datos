Two things i learnt from watching The Man last night, one is that Samuel L Jackson literally will do any film, regardless of how under written his role is. Does he even read scripts any more?, you have to wonder when you see drek like this. Secondly i had it confirmed that film makers need to realise that a great supporting actor in comedies, is not leading man potential. Eugene Levy, nice fella who tickled us pink as Jim's dad in Amercan Pie, simply isn't strong enough to carry a film, especially when his co-worker Samuel is bogged down by a meandering dull and unoriginal script {Piddock & Oberman you should be ashamed}. Luke Goss tries his best at villainy but Blade II seems a very long time ago now, whilst to under use Miguel Ferrer is tantamount to a treason of cinema.<br /><br />Unimaginative dirge, 2/10 for sympathy.
