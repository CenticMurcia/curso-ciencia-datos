OK, first of all, most of this movie sucks. But about 15 minutes of it is the funniest thing I've ever seen. And I'm not just saying that. It is THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN <br /><br />There's a lost reality show called "Dont get Caught" where they take 2 contestants and give them assignments to steal things from certain stores. If they get away with it, they get a point. If they get caught, they get nothing. <br /><br />I don't want to give it away, but I'll give you a taste of the assignments: Go to a restaurant and steal everything on the table, steal 6 dvds and 2 dildos from a porn shop, steal a fine Italian suit, steal a car from a carwash. <br /><br />I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. It's all real life stunts with hidden cameras. <br /><br />Has anyone heard anything about this show? The movie says they sold the idea to some station in Europe. I would LOVE to see more episodes.
