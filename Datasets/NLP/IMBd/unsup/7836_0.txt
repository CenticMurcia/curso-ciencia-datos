This is a story of a girls quest to become a Musketeer like her father D'Artagnan. It's very entertaining and suitable for the whole family.<br /><br />We all like Susie Amy who plays Valentine D'Artagnan, very much. Thought all the young musketeers were great and it was a lovely contrast with the older characters, their fathers. I am a big Michael York fan so it was good to see him back as D'Artagnan.<br /><br />It could be a bit storytelling at times, but that is needed for younger viewers. The fight sequences could be slightly repetitive and many of the action movies are, but they were well done.<br /><br />Think from reading other information, this wasn't filmed as a movie but as a TV mini series so it is quite long to watch in one sitting.<br /><br />But all in all, what you'd expect, not difficult to follow but entertaining viewing for the family.
