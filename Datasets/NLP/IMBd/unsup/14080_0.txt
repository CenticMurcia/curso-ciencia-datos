I don't think there is any kind of constructive criticism I could offer to a movie who's star actor is Tim Thomerson (not that I don't like him, I'm fond of his rather over-looked talents.) Everyone else has pretty much covered what a waste of a movie this is, I'll just have to add that save for Tim Thomerson, the acting is downright horrible!!! Not to mention a weak plot, undeveloped characters and just plain bad production. I think the 10 min. beginning sequence and eye-sore CGI effects sucked up most of this movie's budget and that left the production of this movie to be slapped together with whoever and whatever they could find. <br /><br />It's sad when rabid horror-movie fans give up on a movie and hope for sex on screen to save it. Potential as MST3K fodder is the best light this movie will ever see...... 1/2<br /><br />P.S. However did this movie even get the rating is has?!!! 18% voted a 10 as of this date?!! May all who positively view this movie disintegrate under the laws of artistic ability!!!!!!!
