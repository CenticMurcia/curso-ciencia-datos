What a delightful moment when you fully understand that you do not belong to the masses of mysticism loving, astrology loving, lame brained losers out there. This film proved beyond a doubt that the fairies have left mankind forever. I can see it becoming a great cult film because there are so many people who desperately need to be re woken into life. Of course the real sadness is that his awful film will not grant them that wish either. In fact it is exactly for this reason that it will become a cult film - because it does not deliver on any level. I would suggest that the makers of this film take a long vacation, a long way away from their usual haunts and let time heal their unfortunate souls if that is indeed possible. I feel sorry for the great fairy tales of history and the great writers like George McDonald who must surely be agonizing in his grave. In conclusion I would like to state that the society in which a movie of this nature receives such a large percentage of approval is in some very serious need of mental health medication. A large tablet needs to collectively swallowed by those who find this stuff in the slightest interesting. As I said, perfect fodder for the Democrats who are so removed from reality that they should use this as a campaign opener. Lieberman loses the democrat nomination - need I say more. Poor world if the Democrats regain any form of power in the USA.
