I cannot put into word how bad this film really is. It has the sappiest story line I have ever seen, the editing is horrible, and above all, Jeff Goldblum's performance is just beyond bad. He shows up every 20 min. or so and acts amazed, I know that is the only emotion he can act out but it does get annoying.<br /><br />Anyone wanting to join a lawsuit I am filing against the makers of this "film" to compensate me for the cost of the rental and time lost feel free to e-mail me!!!
