At first the movie seems to be serious. A powerful wraith is unleashed by some archaeologist guy who has an inflated vision of his own importance. Then some dinosaur bones are found. And some poorly animated aliens show up--they know the monster or something. Soon, things are going downhill fast. Either it's a parody of some other loud sci-fi's, or it's just downright insanity.<br /><br />The satired movies include (but or not limited to) Godzilla (97 version) and Independence Day. Also some demented legend stuff. A big ugly creature with a propensity for smashing helicopters goes on a rampage, and then winds up in a city somewhere. Another rampage. I love the cheap CGI insertions over old footage: while a 50 foot monster battles jets with rockets and buildings are being destroyed, directly below in the background, calm traffic is rolling back and forth like this happens every day. Many buildings are blasted by fire, but subsequent shots show no fires anywhere, lol. Also, scenes where the thing casually dodges missiles: priceless.<br /><br />Corny lines are numerous. Action is dizzy and non-stop, and clich√©s are everywhere. The movie just mocks itself, and it's good enough for a few laughs.
