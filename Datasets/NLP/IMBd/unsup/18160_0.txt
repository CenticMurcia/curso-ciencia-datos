OK, I haven't read all the comments yet but I was kinda disturbed of the low rating this movie got. I think it's one of the best Lovecraft Adaptations ever made. Yeah, "Re-Animator" was much more fun, but it didn't stick to the misanthropic atmosphere old HPL used to build. "The Dunwich Horror" is much more disturbing, although it bears all characteristics of a seventies movie like the soundtrack and the clothing, but it still works. Yeah, it's a B-Movie, but It's very well made, from the great title sequence to the vague depiction of the "Monster". I don't think any subsequent movie got closer to the insinuating style of that fascinating weirdo called H. P. Lovecraft.
