this movie was great i was very touched by how the boy loved this girl so much and he was not willing to give her up and she excepted him for who he was and she did not look at him by how rich he was. she discovered herself by seeing this boy it was a great movie anybody English or Spanish could understand this movie great!!!!!! this movie showed true feeling when she started to look at him she did not take him seriously he thought that she was a young beautiful girl he would draw pictures of her and spray paint he name on walls to show her how much he loved her near the end it got very intament she showed her love to him a lot and was very comfortable
