George Waggner directs this John Wayne classic. Soon after the Battle of New Orleans, in the early 1800's, a Kentucky rifleman(Wayne)and his fighting buddy(Oliver Hardy)linger in a settlement of French, homesteading in Alabama. The frontiersmen duo saves the community from a strong assault by land grabbers. Action packed and well photographed; and an attention holder throughout. This film is well worth watching again and again.<br /><br />Wayne and Hardy work well together and make an interesting team. The cast if full of talent: Vera Ralston, Philip Dorn, Anna Logan, John Howard and Marie Windsor.
