Now, a movie that starts with the elimination of two Bambi killers can't be all bad.<br /><br />The premise is this: A know-it-all Ranger (Robert Pralgo) and his much smarter partner (Dione J. Updike) are trying to kill a predator before he gets a passel of hotties and hunks going up the mountain. At least we get a go show out of the hotties skinny dipping in the river.<br /><br />The chase is on and bodies are being torn apart. One by one they fall prey to the wolf-man until there is .....now, you didn't think I would tell you who wins, did you? Nothing original, but still worth watching. Great wolf costuming, and four great hotties in the river. Most gore was blurred, so it wasn't bad.
