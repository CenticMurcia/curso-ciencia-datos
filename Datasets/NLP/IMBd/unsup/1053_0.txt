Very few votes so far, but I can't understand why they're so low. This is an excellent, throughly entertaining documentary that lets you make your own mind up about a very interesting individual's teaching methods, and the results he gets.<br /><br />I guess a lot of people just didn't approve of Paul and, as such, have given low ratings to register their disapproval. Idiots. How would you have come to feel so passionately about him if you hadn't seen such and insightful documentary? Speaking of which, this is one of the best I've seen in recent times. A love of the music involved will enhance your enjoyment I suppose, but it's not really about that. Check it out.
