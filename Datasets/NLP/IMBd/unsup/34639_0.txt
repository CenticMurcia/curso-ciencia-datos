I'm not sure why I was asked to watch this film, but I don't think I will ever watch it again. At least, one can always hope. It was recommended to me by a young man who freely admits he could not stand it despite his love for George Clooney.<br /><br />We have George Clooney as a psychologist who must go into space to examine members a of a space crew orbiting the planet of Solaris. Most of the crew is dead and then his dead wife appears. The remainder of the film seems to revolve around flashbacks of his wife, which are boring and seem to go nowhere. A great actor like Clooney and with the creative genius of Steven Soderbergh? How do we get this level of horse apples? I also want to mention George Clooney's tush. Because this film has the tush roughly three times. And while I respect Clooney for adding to the realism, I'm very sorry for the Clooney admirers who have to sit through this just to see a firm, shaved tush.<br /><br />But seriously, I should have known this film was a dud as soon as Corey Feldman showed up. In his first scene, he's listening to Insane Clown Posse (Because obviously in the future everyone loves rapping clowns). And throughout the film, he acts like a lunatic with wild gestures. It looks exactly like David Duchovny's impression of Jeff Goldblum from Saturday Night Live's "Celebrity Jeopardy". Only in this film, Feldman is supposed to be serious.<br /><br />If you want to watch this film, promise to let me know how you liked it because I would rather not have suffered alone.<br /><br />(You should also be aware this film a is a remake of an older film with much higher ratings.)
