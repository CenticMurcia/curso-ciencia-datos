This is where John Hughes started turning over his work to other lesser directors, with mixed results. Pretty in Pink is basically a cinderella story with a laughably unbelievable ending, apparently re-shot after the studio reacted in fear to what was originally there. In the original she did NOT get the 'hot guy'. Which would have been much more interesting. Featuring good performances from Jon Cryer as the "I'm not gay" friend who is clearly gay, and Molly Ringwald in the thankless title role.<br /><br />Another great sound track, and great supporting performances from James Spader et al. When it came out, this was the 'bomb', but it hasn't aged well I'm afraid. One of the lesser of the "Hughes cannon".
