Before I review this film I just want to tell you, I'm not of of those people. Those people that go to movies like this just to write about how stupid they were, I enjoy some silly light hearted movies, I love a good Sandler comedy but this was just plain bad.<br /><br />I kind of knew Zohan would be bad inside but I still wanted to see it, I loved Little Nicky even though critics trashed that. So I thought Zohan might be quite misunderstood as well. Boy! I was wrong. You Don't Mess With the Zohan was a shoddy and obnoxious attempt at a comedy movie. It is utterly silly and tries to get you with shock factor but ends up being just plain weird. <br /><br />It gets a four because while it mostly reeks of bad, it still has some good jokes in it, the beginning to film promises a very odd and refreshing new comedy and the first 5 minutes will tickle your spine. But then it just gets odder and odder - to a point where it's almost unwatchable and through this try hard weirdness it still produces some lovable Sandler comedy. And while rear, the occasional joke is very laughable.<br /><br />The plot seems promising, but totally fails on content. It wanders to far from the plot and ends up to be so silly it's offensive, it's tries to throw random jokes out like Family Guy. It fails miserably and in result is a very messy, unco-ordinated film. Plus it's completely stereotypes Middle Eastern people. It's like the writers didn't get the memo that everyone is now supposed to be equal. And for overseas people watching, it completely reverses America's efforts to appear more open minded and equal.<br /><br />In summary, Zohan is while occasionally funny, 99% of the time a very messy, silly, outrageous (not in a good way) film. Go see it if you like to laugh at other races and enjoy very brainless toilet humor.
