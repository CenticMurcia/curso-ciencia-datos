why are zombies running now? must we break all rules? anyway...this movie has a horrible script...period. Also the camera work and editing were wayyy off. the zombies looked OK but bill looked like he was wearing a Halloween mask. People are talking about good gore in this film. WRONG. Good gore can be found in the Living Dead series...this my friend is horrible gore. I did kind of like the eating of the hand part but it was shot in such a weird way. i give the writers and the director a little credit just because this is a rather knew idea. There really is only so far you can take a zombie flick but these guys managed to give it a different spin. Still...that can't save such a horrible film and a half crap horror film. Watch it for originality but don't buy it or spend any money on it. If you find some homeless dude asleep in the alley clutching a copy of death valley...it might be worth the steal...but i warned you.
