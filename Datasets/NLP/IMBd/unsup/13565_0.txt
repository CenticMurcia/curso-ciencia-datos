I'm 12, so you can see this review from a pre-teens point-of-view. I also commented on Magnolia, if you want to check it out. Bicentennial Man was an excellent movie, it was great for children and adults (at least in my opinion). It's a movie to watch with your parents, if you're my age (and close to your parents...*smirk*) or younger, and it's a great movie to watch by yourself or with a friend. Just don't watch it with, like, a 4-year-old, because they'll get really really bored. I love the futuristic stuff, always have! Rent it, if you're about 15 or younger, for a sleepover or a small party, or for by yourself. Othwerwise, only rent it if you're hangin with a younger bro, sis, niece, nephew, kid you're babysitting, etc. Parents, don't hesitate to watch it with your kids, though. It's definitely not a baby movie. There's only two parts that I can think of that mention sex, but little kids won't "get" it and it's not bad at all, unless you're *MAJORLY* protective. I mean, it's no "Dirty Dancing", give it a break :). Um, they swear, like, two times in the whole movie, that's why it's rated "PG". There ya go.
