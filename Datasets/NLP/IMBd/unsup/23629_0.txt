Actually this came as a reaction to carmenjonze-1. I really wonder how someone can be disappointed by this film. Granted, it's in the Big Chill vain, but it features a fabulous cast in top-notch form, real attitudes, compact characters, and quite a few memorable scenes, even if it doesn't do justice to JL Curtis. Yes, it's more verbal than visual, but that's not necessarily a bad point, considering it leads to comments like "wounded animal convention" or Eliot's rationale for not going' out. All in all, I find it quite entertaining; a gem of a story about everyday people in everyday situations. And yes, again,it's not Bergman. But if you're sick of films that blackmail your interest in a once-in-a-million character in a once-in-a-trillion-situation, then you could definitely give this one a try.
