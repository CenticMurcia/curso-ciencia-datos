Lifeboat is another fine film from it's director Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcok received the second nomination in his career for Best Director at the Academy Awards for 1944. The film was also nominated for Best Cinematography from Glen Macwilliams and Original Motion Picture Story for John Steinbeck. It's a great character study and is basically a stage play set at sea with a fine cast including Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Walter Slezak, Hume Cronyn, John Hodiak and Canada Lee. I've always enjoyed this film and have seen it many times. It's a well acted script adapted from a good Steinbeck story by Jo Swerling and Ben Hecht. All Hitchcock films are good and offer something different in each one. This is a little stage restricted and has no performances to absolutely wow you but it's worth checking out if you've never seen it. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10 and recommend it.
