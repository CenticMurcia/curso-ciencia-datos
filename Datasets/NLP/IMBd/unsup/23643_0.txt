The legendary performer plays Alonzo, whose act in a gypsy circus involves throwing knives - no mean feat, since he happens to be armless. He longs to be with his gorgeous young colleague, Nanon (a very young Joan Crawford), and because she is turned off by the thought of male hands on her body, he poses no problem for her. Alonzo, however, is harboring more than one secret, and will not take kindly to being denied a romantic union with Nanon.<br /><br />Truly a strange and intriguing little picture, "The Unknown" showcases the stars to good effect. Chaney commits very strongly to the character and is no less than believable. The way in which the film-makers, led by the great director Tod Browning, convince you of his handicap (as well as immersing you in a lurid and potent atmosphere) is quite impressive. Norman Kerry, who'd acted with Chaney in "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and "The Phantom of the Opera", is engaging as the equally lovesick strongman Malabar, Crawford has a good presence on screen, and John George is solid as Cojo, a sidekick to Alonzo.<br /><br />The film packs some memorable moments into its very brief (50 minutes) running time. Highlights include a sequence with Alonzo blackmailing a surgeon into operating on him, as well as a striking, violent conclusion. The makeup effects are excellent; the extra thumb that Alonzo has is quite convincing. Overall, the film is powerful, and touching as well as creepy.<br /><br />It served as a good introduction for me to the talents of the director, cast, and the silent film format. I look forward to watching more films of this type in the future.<br /><br />8/10
