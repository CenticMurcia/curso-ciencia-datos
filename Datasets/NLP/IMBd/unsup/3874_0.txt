Now, the previews made this look like a very interesting movie, a bit raunchy, and a bit sexy, but all in all, it sucked out loud. I did not laugh, nor did i crack a smile. Comedy central is my favorite channel, but they did not suceed in making a origial movie, and i question my loyalty to this channel. If you want raunchy, hilarious fun, then i would suggest you watch the man show, which airs a new episode every sunday at 10. 1/10
