"Frühling auf dem Eis" shows a large number of well known Austrian actors and the ensemble of the Vienna Ice Revue, world-famous at a time when I was young. I know well all the skaters from their appearances in the fifties, especially Eva Pawlik, starring in "Frühling auf dem Eis". I can well remember that she was not only a wonderful sportswoman and actress but also a doctor of philosophy. All Europe loved her in the fifties.
