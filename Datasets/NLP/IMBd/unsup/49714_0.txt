I have to agree with the comment above about the rampant illogic. When Mrs. Sawyer conked one crook near the end with a toilet tank cover, she could have finished him off and taken his street-sweeper shotgun. She did neither. I agree also with the comment about the crazy lawyer who tried to be a one-man tactical team. I don't understand how three thugs with semi-automatic pistols would yield to an old man with a bolt action hunting rifle. But, once they did, why didn't Mrs. Sawyer grab the weapons they tossed on the floor and arm herself and her husband? A few talented actors, but a script without a sense of direction, so it was a waste of time.
