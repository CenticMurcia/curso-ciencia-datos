Start with a budget of $16 million (in 1987). Add Brian De Palma and David Mamet, chuck in Sean Connery and Robert DeNiro, then slowly add Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith and Billy Drago, and whaddya get? THE UNTOUCHABLES! This testosterone-driven movie is my all time favourite, and as it was the first gangster movie I ever saw, it was a perfect introduction. By the time they were filming the climatic shootout, the film was $8 million over budget. The studio told De Palma "Forget the stopped train,forget the helecopter shots, just make it quick and simple." The end gives no evidence of this.
