i first saw this movie in the mid 80's as referred by a co worker, and i scoured the TV listings for about a year until i found it, was not available locally on /through video, i thought this movie was fantastic, remember the time frame when it was made. the story contains truth through mostly folklore, as to the speech and language abilities of the actors of the day. even the comedic twists throughout the story, are never seen in todays productions,the production values for the era should be considered in video and cinematography class, again just a classic especially that it's in black and white.i wonder why the American film institute doesn't research these older films and have tribute during awards night, pick them via month of production or anniversary release dates. as a matter of fact i think i'll watch it today.
