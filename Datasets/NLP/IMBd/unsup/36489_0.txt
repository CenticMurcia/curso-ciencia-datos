Coming attractions are part of the movie going experience. Their purpose is to excite interest in the upcoming film, thus "possessing" you to spend $10 to go see it. I'm okay with this concept! BUT, I expect my reaction of the preview to at least somewhat resemble my reaction to the movie. "Possession's" preview describes an amazing journey into the depths of love, transcending time, making Shakespeare look like the writer of "Not Another Teen Movie", and uses Enya to further add atmosphere to the scene, with her chilling emotional sound, filling your stomach with a mixture of magic, desire, and most importantly a NEED to see the movie. So I did, and what I got was a plot as riveting as dust, with a love (for lack of a better word) story as romantic as a date with the pope. Not even the acting was able to redeem the nightmare! Which made me ask the question, "HOW IN THE WORLD DID THEY GET THESE AMAZING ACTOR's TO SIGN ON?" And then it hit me, they must have shown them the preview first.
