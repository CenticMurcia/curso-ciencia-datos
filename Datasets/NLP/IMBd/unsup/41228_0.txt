I owe a great deal of thanks to Neil Simon for this awful movie. After 15 minutes I walked out and went in to see the only other film at the duplex, an unknown called LOCAL HERO! WOW! One of my all-time TOP 5 FILMS! It was a stark contrast between this tired old c**p and the brilliance that can be achieved in movie making.
