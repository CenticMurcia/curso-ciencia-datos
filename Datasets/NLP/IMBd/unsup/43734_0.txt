This film is unmitigated excrement! If you like watching a 94 minute brawl through a scrapyard then watch it. Otherwise avoid. I have to write at least ten lines to get this comment on the board. I don't think I can come up with that many ways to say total rubbish, but here goes. 1. Why is it that after the nuclear holocaust, every city in America turns into a car breaker's yard! I've seen so many films where this has happened. Come on, Post Nuclear Americans, have you no civic pride? 2. The guardian of humanity's future, a woman who holds the only viable fetus on Earth in a little glass bottle, is called Mary. Now that's subtlety for you. 3. The sleazy, wheeler-dealer trader in the basement is an Arab. Now there's a surprise! Actually, the more I think about this film, the poorer I realize it was. I'd better stop now.
