I fell in-love with this movie from beginning to end,the first time i watched it i closed my eyes in the beginning when i saw the horse "Sonador" fall,i cried through this whole movie and at the same time,had a wonderful smile on my face..Dakota fanning is just wonderful, all of my favorite actors in this movie, i wish it could have been longer and shown more of "Sonador's" recovery etc,,but the last 10minutes,the last part of the race i could feel the uplifting experience of "Sonador"across the finishing line,a baby could watch this it is just that compatible for families.this movie deserves an academy..so needless to say whenever it comes on,and i have also taped it, i have to watch it again and again.just to see the bad guys in it,if there are such things in this,loose...I fell in-love with the sheik when he spoke to Dakota about her horse winning,i would have loved to have seen them all sitting together tho at the races.the sheik the cranes and the wonderful Spanish horsey handler..it did my heart so good to see the Prince,stand up and acknowledge "Cale" and "sonador" in the winners circle...thanks for letting me express these feelings..god bless to all.
