When Maurice is on his way for the city with his new invention (and horse), he gets lost i the forest. When he is trying to find a way out wolfs attack. The horse escape and Maurice runs into a castle. When he goes in, he find himself trapped again. In the castle lives a big beast an he's NOT happy with the new visitor, and puts Maurice in prison. Meanwhile the horse ran home and Belle (Maurice's daughter) make the horse led her to her father. <br /><br />Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's best movies, with humor and true love that will teach you not only to love the outside, but the person in other people. Are you more the the fun parts, you still won't be disappointed. Character like LeFou, Lumiere and Cogsworth makes you laugh time after time, and parents can also find them self laughing of the sweet Chip. And lets not forget the evil in this movie, and his name is Gaston. Not scary, but VARY selfish and he won't give up for the things he want (okay maybe that's scary). <br /><br />So lets all sing along with the movie, and see it (again).
