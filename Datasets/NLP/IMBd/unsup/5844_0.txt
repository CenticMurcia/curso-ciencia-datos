After watching this film, all one can say is wow!! Robert Duvall comes through big in this film about the life of a fascinating man who makes a mistake and decides to start off anew. Duvall spent many years writing and trying to get his film picked up and all efforts came to no avail. Duvall ended up financing and directing the film himself which makes the success of the film all the more fascinating.<br /><br />Duvall plays the Apostle E.F., the shouting, ranting, Jesus-infested man who has lived the church for his entire life. Every word he speaks is Jesus, everything he does is Jesus and everywhere he goes, he goes with Jesus. All seems to being going well for him until his unsatisfied wife leaves him for a younger man, taking along his beauties (children) with her. <br /><br />This film is a delightful story of a man most people know or have met at some time in their lives. Duvall did well to keep himself on screen throughout the film so that the audience could get a good idea of who he was and how he reacted to different situations. This movie is my favourite of 1998 and is recommended to all.<br /><br />8/10 stars.
