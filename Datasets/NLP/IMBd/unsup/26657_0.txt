This movie is excellent. For the 41 people who did not like this movie go rent the Porky's series and lock yourself in a room. After you get through the first scene with Winona and Gena Rowlands it is all gravy. Not that the first scene is not better than most movies it is just not nearly as good as the rest. From there are on out it is a four start film. This movie gives you everything. Great acting, great writing, great directing, and Tom Waits great soundtrack. You have Roberto Bergnigni doing his thing. You have comedy and drama. This film towers above most films on its premise alone. Great charachters who are more developed in their short sequences than most cardboard hollywood cut outs are in their entire movies. If you like Jim Jarmusch then you have seen this movie. If you don't know who he is watch this film and if you like it see the rest of his work because it is excellent.
