While many people in their film ratings consider "turkeys" like Dungeons & Dragons and Plan 9 the worst possible movies, I don't agree - these kind of movies are interesting in their horrible, absurd execution, acting and script.<br /><br />In any case, "Sweet Home Alabama" is not spectacularly bad, but it's certainly blend and not original. I consider those kind of movies the absolute worst. As for the "comedy" part, forget it. There are no crazy jokes to light up this grey mass. The movie is based on a love affair. Even worse, it's based on two men in love with the same girl. (!!) I know many girls have excellent taste in movies, so don't take it the wrong way when I call this movie a chick-flick. <br /><br />Reese Witherspoon plays an annoying character. She could probably play some good supporting roles, but as the main character she is just very "un-fascinating". A girl who drools over expensive rings - I can't really put into words how little attractive that is. The character is, in other words, not deserving of the attention of two men. Which again makes this movie even less interesting for men.<br /><br />When you have "everyday" movies like this, ie. not in historical, sci-fi or other spectacular settings, and especially if it's a (*sigh*) LOVE STORY - you need really, really good actors, original characters, and several funky plot twists. None such here.<br /><br />Again, this movie is the worst kind - cliche, plain and boring. Which is why I gave it a "5", even though it's one of the worst movie experiences I've had in years - to separate it from the more spectacularly junky experience of a "sub-3" movie.<br /><br />I won't tell you how the movie ends, but to put it like this: I probably could tell you without signing the "SPOILER ALERT".<br /><br />In any case: Avoid this junk.
