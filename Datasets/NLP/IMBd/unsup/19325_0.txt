The film would have been good if they stuck with the castaways finding ways of surviving and beating the creatures they encounter and just generally showing brains but--Noooooo! A lot of squabbling by a group of in shape folks just off a beach and time to time I see Bruce Boxleiter (sp) who's barely unrecognizable in his constant sullenness. He looks like he's saying to us the audience: "Know it's a stupid movie, here for the money." I didn't even stay to see the end for two reasons--the giant ape print--Big King Kong rip-off clue from a mile off--and the utterly disgusting natives who crop up more and more. I had hoped they were a hallucination or popping in out of another dimension (that would've added a twist)--but no. I said "Time to go." and turned on Court TV.
