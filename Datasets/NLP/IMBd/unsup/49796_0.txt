Considering the subject matter, you already know whether you will agree or not with this film. The damage here is how bloody boring the thing is, and how one major interviewee has actually accepted money from Moore to aid his (get ready for it) sick wife that her insurance wasn't covering properly. His name is James Kenefick and the story is on the daily IMDb news feed. Check it out for yourself, but so far all this film proves is that Moore is a charitable human being. As for the rest of it, nothing we haven't heard before from various members of the pretenders to the documentary throne. Just ask yourself why all of a sudden medical industry people are so nervous about Moore. Could it be he has a point? Conservatives get cancer too, and it seems more and more of them are seeing Moore's point enough to cash his check.
