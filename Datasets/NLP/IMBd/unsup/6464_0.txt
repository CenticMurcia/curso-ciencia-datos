Takeshi's third film (after "Violent Cop" and "Boiling Point") seems to of hit the right note in blending quirky humour and sudden violence. He plays a yakuza who is getting tired of his lifestyle,and is considering retirement.He attends a high profile meeting with other gang leaders and finds out his next assignment is to settle a gang war in Okinawa.This is of course,not what it seems, with a hit-man sent over to wipe out Takeshi's gang.This does not quite succeed and a violent confrontation ensues. A beautifully photographed,oddball gangster film which manages to see-saw the viewer's emotions.Beat Takeshi's passive persona always seems to work in this kind of film.
