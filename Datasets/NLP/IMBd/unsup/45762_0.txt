As a Portlander, I always get suspicious if a movie gets filmed in Oregon: "The Postman" was probably the worst example, but there have been others. By this logic, "Untraceable" should suck.<br /><br />It turns out that the movie's main problem isn't acting or continuity goofs or anything like that (although I should affirm that I believe that there are a few too many movies about people looking for killers). It appears to be the possibility that the movie glorifies spying. Could it be that someone is trying to give the government some good PR in the wake of the NSA scandal? The right wing always says that it wants to get "big government" out of people's lives, but always turns around and spies on everyone.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't recommend this movie. Starring Diane Lane and Colin Hanks.<br /><br />PS: what I mean by "Arthur voiced Elmer" is that there's a character named Arthur James Elmer. We Looney Tunes fans know that Elmer Fudd's voice was provided by Arthur Q. Bryan. Yes, I know that it's totally unrelated, but just something that I notice.
