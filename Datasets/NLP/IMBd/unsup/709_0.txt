This film was clearly tailor written for Robert De Niro. Not only is he the finest character actor of his generation - perhaps even the finest since James Stewart - his Italian background which he has portrayed so well in films in the past such as his 2 Oscar winners, The Godfather Part 2 and Raging Bull, comes through excellently, and adds much credibility to the role.<br /><br />At the same time, Billy Crystal's natural sarcastic manner is a great anathema to De Niro, and even the role of the usually poor Lisa Kudrow as Crystal's wife is well cast.<br /><br />One of the most subtle and funniest [certainly for Hollywood] comedies of recent years, the digs at the stereotypical mafia image are both cutting and cynical, but damn funny at the same time.<br /><br />The whole concept of a psychiatrist for a mafia racketeer is funny enough as it is, and with the natural chemistry between Crystal and De Niro, this really is a rare, off-beat treat.
