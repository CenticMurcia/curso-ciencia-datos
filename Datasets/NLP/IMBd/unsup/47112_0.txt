why are all "black" films exactly alike? it's like they all use the same black dictionary to write scripts. does anyone know why everything is so foggy in the beginning. i don't think i've ever been in a hospital with a foggy hallway. anyway, this film is very self righteous. "i was here with your father doing god's work"? what does that even mean? how can you say what god's work is? is god your homeboy? also, you can basically tell how the movie ends about ten minutes in to it and no one in the movie can act very well.<br /><br />however, i don't think this movie deserves to be on the 100 worst list. it's boring and predictable, but not that bad. Plan 9 isn't even on the list, that deserves to be on there way more than this film.<br /><br />p.s. to the people that posted before. the reason this movie got bad reviews on here is because it's a cookie cutter film, not because we dislike christians. honestly, i couldn't care less about Christianity and this film solidifies the fact that i won't be walking in to a church anytime soon.
