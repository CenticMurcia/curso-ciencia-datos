I saw the original "High Noon" more then 100 times. In fact I re-scheduled my first marriage so as to fit it in. I consider "High Noon" (1952) to be the best movie I every watched. As for "High Noon, Part II, The Return of Will Kane" I firmly believe that it was a true waste of valuable film and a gross waste of money in making it. "Plan 9 from Outer Space," often talked about as being the worst movie ever made, was, in my mind, a far better movie, although I think its director, Ed Wood, would have brought considerable talent to the making of "High Noon Part II."<br /><br />Bottom line...compared to, "High Noon Part II," "Plan 9" was a monumental screen success and money well spent by the Baptist community in producing it.
