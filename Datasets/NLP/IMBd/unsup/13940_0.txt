In the first weeks of the Second World War, German crack pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, captained by Hans Langsdorff, inflicts heavy damage on British merchant shipping. Discovering the Graf Spee's position, Commodore Harwood consults with Captains Bell of the Exeter, Woodhouse of Ajax and Parry of the New Zealand ship Achilles, gambling that the Germans will head for the River Plate before returning home.<br /><br />A fierce battle rages throughout the following day, with Exeter suffering heavy damage. The Graf Spee escapes under cover of nightfall to neutral Montevideo harbour where, after frantic diplomatic negotiations, foreign minister Doctor Guani, acting under the Hague Convention, allows Langsdorff 72 hours to carry out such repairs a will make the vessel seaworthy without enhancing its fighting ability.<br /><br />British Naval Intelligence meanwhile spread rumours of an advancing fleet awaiting the German ship as soon as it leaves port, although only the still damaged Ajax and Achilles are within striking distance. As the deadline approaches and the Graf Spee moves out of the harbour, the entire crew transfer to a German freighter as a series explosions engulf their ship in flames. The British bluff has worked - Langsdorff has scuttled his vessel, believing escape impossible.<br /><br />Anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film, please write to me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
