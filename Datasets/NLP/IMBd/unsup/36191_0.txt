First of all, Alex Sanger and Karen Craig should be loathed and possibly incarcerated for ever writing this. In fact, everyone involved here deserves a, if not physical then atleast a verbal, lash or two.<br /><br />The plotline; Mila Kunis (yes, That 70's girl) plays Rachel Newman, who, thanks to the fact that the writers who obviously never quite understood the original flick, as a child witnesses the final murder of serial killer Patrick Bateman. After growing up, she attends the FBI Academy for serial killer profiling. However, it soon becomes clear that she is quite the psycho herself and starts to hack 'n' slash her classmates that seems to pose a threat to her. Very soon it's just a brainless teen slasher, and not even as a teen slasher is it worthy of your time, however little your time may be worth. Fast forward.<br /><br />There are not many highlights in this movie at all. If you have seen American Psycho, do not, under any circumstances watch this, the flagrant script is enough to eject this straight-to-video release. I don't think that the original screen adaption surpassed the book in quality, but for this sequel the term "art pollution" comes in handy. Heavens no.
