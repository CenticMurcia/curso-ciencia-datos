Well you all should know the plot line by now, from the other comments.<br /><br />I decided to pick this one up to see if it held up over the years, since I hadn't seen it since the theatrical. Wow 27 years. And I have to say, I laughed just as hard as I did back then. This movie is well worth looking at again. The quotes go on and on. I still say "That Barney Rubble,..what an actor".<br /><br />And when Michael Keaton is driving and flipping off the cops, come on, what is not to love.<br /><br />Everyone is great in this movie, Winkler, Keaton, Long, Belzer, when I was young I dreamed Shelly Long would make me eggs.<br /><br />I could go on and on.<br /><br />Comedies today should take note of the brash classics of the early eighties.<br /><br />Also just look at 42nd street before Disney took over.
