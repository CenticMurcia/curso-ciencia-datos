It's always a pleasant surprise to encounter an 'oldie' movie such as this. As for first impressions, I have the feeling it's an idealist's wished-for 'dream of a perfect world and perfect people' that never quite comes true, unfortunately, for many in real life. At times the story seemed a bit too melodramatic and predictable at every turn yet even so I enjoyed it<br /><br />Barbara Stanwyck as Norma is always able to carry a dramatic role superbly. Fred MacMurray as Clifford certainly does give a true rendering of a situation many married men find themselves in sooner or later, of facing middle age and the feeling of being boxed in on all sides.<br /><br />Well worth adding this one to your collection.
