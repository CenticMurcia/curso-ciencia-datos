Silly cheesy horror movies, man how they make a Saturday night. You can pretty much tell from the box it comes in whether it's a dud or a gem in hiding. This one was of the former persuasion. The actors were capable and the overall production quality was good. But the STORY - that's where this falls into the toilet. It's not scary in the slightest, it's just a ripoff of that classic short story "The Most Dangerous Game" where a guy is trapped on an island trying to avoid some killer (there's even a pit trap just like in that story). In this case it's six people trying to avoid a killer<br /><br />---Spoilers follow ---<br /><br />who is revealed to us pretty much at the beginning of the movie in a flashback. They spend the rest of the time doing the stupid things people in every horror movie do - split up into smaller groups of 1 or 2 to make it easier for the killer to do his thing instead of staying together. You expect this in this genre but you at least want some tension, drama, or at least a "boo" moment or two. There's none of that here. Each person is dispatched very matter-of-factly without the slightest scare. The ending is incomprehensible and makes no sense - I didn't understand what happened to the two who got away and I didn't really care. Pass this one by, folks...
