I was laughing all through the film, particularly when those who made it took themselves seriously. They presume that the South hated Blacks and from that hated women, would side with the Nazis, and develop an atomic bomb to put Japan it its place. No doubt popular ideas in the alternative reality worlds of Massachusetts, Vermont and Minnesota but laughable among thinking people.<br /><br />Gross historical error - the movie portrays Central and South America as not knowing slavery. I guess the native peoples weren't around to give their perspective on things - like being forced into slavery and worked to death by the conquering Spanish and Portuguese. Nor was anything said about Brazil having slavery later than we did.<br /><br />Nothing was said about Canadians sending their slaves to what is now Michigan (then still held by Britain) to avoid emancipation. Nor was anything said about serfdom in Quebec (when you buy and sell land you get the people who work it as well) that existed 'til about the time of our Civil War.<br /><br />I disagree with the idea that the Civil War was fought over slavery. How could it be when you had slave holding states battling other slave holding states? Duh! Since we have fewer slaves and are on the road to full emancipation we are morally superior to you? Right. However I do see slavery inflaming passions.<br /><br />And if the Confederates had won, who said that they would stay bound together? A founding principal was free association with free departure from association as the right of the sovereign state.
