I saw this movie when it first came out and I loved it. Each scene is as beautiful as a painting. It really evokes a mood that stays with you. Everything about it is perfect, costumes, photography, writing, etc. The soundtrack is great, majestic, moving. I caught it a few times on TV, and it captured me again. It really does transport you to another time and place, you can feel the cold, and smell the air. Lothaire Bluteau is so sad, seems lost, but believes he is doing the right thing. The Indian sex scenes are interesting, that is something that is not often depicted, the freedom of their sexuality. This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it.
