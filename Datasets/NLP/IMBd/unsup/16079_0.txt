I netflixed Godzilla 2005 and started to watch the movie with the Commentary on, because there was no Japanese language track. No Japanese track was a disappointment to begin with but then as the commentators just glad handing themselves about there edit's, re-written dialog and complete disregard for the original film I realized this was just a ruined film. They went for Camp of the old 50's sci-fi, which you can't write camp. You can only play it as straight as possible and the silly things pop out. For instance, how the one researcher is racing to the scene and two plant workers are just strolling by, not at all aware of Godzilla. Also they cut important scenes because they felt the audience wouldn't get it. Don't dumb things down. Or try to explain things that don't need explaining. One of the worst things is the suped up sound effects. A tell tale line of commentary was that when they said about the original subtle missile hits to Godzilla were more real and the suped up ones sound more fake. And they kept repeating this is a movie that shouldn't be scary for kids. Like they were tring to tone it down into a comedy. I love the camp of the Godzilla movies that comes from this straight serious movie that is just unbelievable. All they needed was Raymond Burr as an American reporter to totally ruin a good Godzilla movie.
