There's a decent enough slice of science fiction lurking somewhere in this story but it's well hidden in a low budget TV standard shoot-em-up production.<br /><br />The fact that the director felt it necessary to supply 3 screens-worth of background information at the start demonstrates that he doesn't have a lot of faith in the quality of the screenplay. Lots of machine guns and explosions punctuate the unimaginative dialogue. The actors do their best but they don't have a lot to work with.<br /><br />The film does have its moments and from time to time begins to develop relationships between the characters, but the director seems determined to keep rushing on to the next unremarkable action sequence instead of allowing the viewer any kind of emotional engagement.
