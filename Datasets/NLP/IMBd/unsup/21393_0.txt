It is such a shame that very few films like this exist. It is a poignant coming of age film that does not revolve around sex. Angus Bethune's transition into his teenage years is about fitting in, and being comfortable with yourself, NOT about getting laid. Perhaps it's just me, but this seems more reflective of the concerns I had growing up than other cheap laugh Hollywood films. Great movie. I laughed, I cried, I had a good time.
