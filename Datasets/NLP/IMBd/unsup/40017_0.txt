I recently rented this movie, figuring it would be cool, but what do i get???? JUNK! The classification of this movie as being "HORROR" and/or "THRILLER" is absolutely laughable! One expects "horror" to be blood and/or guts gushing out on-screen, but the only real "blood" is from what appeared to be a dead animal? But, even that is just a split second of viewing, to leave it rather questionable, as to if it was just a paint can.<br /><br />Now, on to the "thriller" part......well, this is laughable too. I was on the edge of my seat, just waiting for the movie to end! There isn't anything to get all excited over in this movie, besides waiting for it to end.<br /><br />Save your money, and rent a good movie, like........Hellraiser movies. Now, those are horror movies!
