I never seen the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but the remake looks very interesting & entertaining. Leatherface character is now a legend in horror movies. When he took a face and put it on himself, you feel very uncomfortable in your chair.<br /><br />The sequel of the remake shows the beginning of of cannibalistic, inbred psychopaths family, who kill teens in Texas... Two mos important characters in this movie is Sheriff Hoyt & Thomas Hewitt (Leatherface). The torture them more, than in remake, who been released 3 years ago. Actors acted very creepy, but entertaining. They been so real. They accents makes you feel like in Texas. Acting was nice too. The emotions of teens was like it will be in true life. Dean & Eric fighting ,becouse they are brothers & they will give their life, if other will survive...<br /><br />Sadly, the ending was surprised. They all dead, in other hand - it looks logical. If Chrissie would be survived, she tell everyone about it and the family would be masked and we don't knew, hot the remake comes out...
