Let's not waste too many words on this piece of junk, as I certainly don't want to be the one responsible to raise any interest and make more people suffer through it. "Shark Attack" is an unendurably stupid movie with no redeeming elements whatsoever: unoriginal plot, lame and overly fake action-sequences, no tension dull characters and  worst of all  absolutely no sense of humor! I usually like B-creature features but there's nothing as pathetic as an animals-revolting-violently-against-humans premise that takes itself too seriously! The completely untalented Casper Van Dien stars as a scientist (yeahhe sure looks like one) who travels to an African fishing town because the increasing amount of shark attacks there and one of the victims was his old high school buddy Marc. Upon arrival he discovers that another scientist is trying to genetically use the sharks for the developing of a cancer vaccine. Breeding sharks for medical reasons, hmm Now where have we seen that before? Oh yeah, Renny Harlin did the same with his "Deep Blue Sea" and that wasn't a very good film neither! Some of the dialogues are so bad they hurt your ears and the acting is really lousy. There's no horror here, neither, unless you consider the dissection of several shark-cadavers to be grueling. The James-Bond style climax is ridiculous and the concluding moral of the film is that animals can't be mean-spirited by naturehumans always the evil driving force behind everything. Yawn! Better watch "Jaws" again, even though it's for the 200th time.
