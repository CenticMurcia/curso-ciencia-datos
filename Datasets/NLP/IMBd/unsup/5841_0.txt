This movie felt too natural to be a film. Duvall gave one of the finest performances I have ever seen. His insight into this preacher's soul was amazing and inspiring. This is Americana encapsulated for all to view.<br /><br />Hollywood would have made it bigger than life, I liked this because it was as small as life. Life is full of sordid details and imperfections. Duvall chose to portray the good with the bad, and enabled movie-goers to experience what comes from powerful stories portrayed by a wonderful supporting cast.<br /><br />I found John Beasley's performance the strongest I have seen from a supporting character, possibly ever.<br /><br />If only Hollywood and the movie moguls could make more human stories like this, life would be too sweet. While nothing blew up, this movie had action and power in it.<br /><br />The story leads in ways I never expected to be led. In the time of high predictability in movies, this one had small surprises, some good, some bad - all very real!<br /><br />Kudos to Duvall for going that extra mile on his one way trip!
