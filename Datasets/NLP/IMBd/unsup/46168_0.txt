this movie was the worst thing i had ever seen in my life. It was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring and i was hoping it would get better but it only got worse and worse. The people in the audience were just as upset i could see them getting out of their chairs and leaving the others stayed but it was a dilemma for them they got up and then sat back down. After an hour and a half i had enough and left it had seemed like 6 hours had gone by. I hate how they had to incorporate every single detail it was like watching a book the fact that it had subtitles made it that much harder to focus. I mean like there was five minutes devoted to a man walking??????????. Omg is all i can say that was the worst movie of all time grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
