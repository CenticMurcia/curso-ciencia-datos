Unwatchable horror flick about a group of teens who are invited to a wax museum and are viciously attacked by monsters is just as dumb as the other B-horror movies. A wasted cast and an unsatisfying premise are enough to make this movie extremely pretentious. Very typical and totally empty. A movie that's not worth watching and should be avoided like the plague.<br /><br />0 out of 5
