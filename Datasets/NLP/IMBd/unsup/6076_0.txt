The way documentary and drama are mixed is excellent. The data on which the documentary parts are based are up to date and well-researched, and the dramatic parts are credible and give a good impression of life in Rome in the Flavian era. The voice-overs switch between first-person (Verus) and narrator; towards the finale, the narrator follows the texts of the Roman poet Martial. A very good counterweight against implausible fiction like Gladiator and The Arena. (By the way, the actor playing Verus' friend and colleague Priscus played a gladiator in Gladiator as well.) I was charmed especially by the Latin dialogue between the characters themselves. Well done!
