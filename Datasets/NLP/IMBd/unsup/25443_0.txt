'Whiteboys' is not a wall-to-wall comedy, although most reviewers think it's supposed to be. True, it starts out almost like a parody or satire of white gangsta-wannabes, but it develops a true context for these characters and their behavior, and then it takes them to Chicago to contrast their ideas with the reality of drugs and ghettos. Almost every review has criticized this film for not sustaining the initial gag of white gangstas in rural Iowa, but these characters aren't simply jokes. They're developed through both humorous and serious scenes, amusing but thoughtful dream sequences, and the all-too-real Chicago experience at the end. The film's messages about racial identity should be listened to by more filmmakers and TV producers. This is a well-paced comedy with a context that is never boring to the thoughtful, open-minded viewer
