Pants Pants Pants Rubbish Rubbish poor poor very boring and a complete waste of money. Pants Pants Pants cliched terrible script and dialogue which was from the start impossible to deliver and wooden the performances didn't help. Wanted my money back, tried to get it back and was given it back when I said the quality of the tape was so poor it looked like a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy recorded off a machine with dirty heads that were fifteen years old. A complete waste of video tape that could of been better used recording a shopping channels content. Avoid like the plague. Pants Pants Pants!
