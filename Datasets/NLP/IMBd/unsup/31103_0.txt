This is the basic western of man meets girl, looses girl.<br /><br />The cast is second to none. Mini Series on TV Sam Elliott plays Hugh Cardiff an ex-Buffalo hunter. With his shooting skills he starts the following the shooting competitions.<br /><br />At the shooting competitions he meets Ben Johnson and Timothy Scott, the 3 become good friends.<br /><br />The threesome get into trouble and help each other out. <br /><br />For a historical flare, the threesome even meet Wild Bill Hickok and go into business together. <br /><br />While long for a movie, if you like to just sit down and watch one for a couple/three nights this one is a great one.
