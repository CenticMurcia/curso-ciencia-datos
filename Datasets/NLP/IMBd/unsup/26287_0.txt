I thought this movie was really awesome. It portrays the reality in a really hilarious way. There's great potential in the budding actors. All of them did a great job especially Kal Penn. Its a must-see for all the "Desi" people in America. You won't stop laughing for a single moment. You can even identify with some of the characters. Don't just sit there reading this.... go watch it!!!
