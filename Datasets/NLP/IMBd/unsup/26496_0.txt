I was pleased to find this gem of a film and appreciated its subtle, quirky and "watch"able (no pun intended) take on OCD and how the choices we make affect our lives.<br /><br />It reminded me of Hal Hartley's films- most notably "Trust" - tho these characters, at least Emily, are not quite so dysfunctional and there seemed to be a slightly more positive vibe (or rather less bleak outlook) to this film than Hartley's. Or maybe they seem similar cuz of the synth music ;) which was perhaps my only major criticism of this film which had good acting, camera-work and editing. Being an indie film shouldn't preclude you from having cohesive musical themes for characters or situations across the movie tho. Some of the music felt out of place. But that's my own personal pet peeve.<br /><br />Overall the movie certainly struck a chord for me at the parallels between Emily and Nick and their kinds of stealing and internal drives. And despite wanting a romantic ending for them - the way things turned out *felt right* as their motivations and ultimately their integrity were wholly incompatible and Nick deserved his fate. The parallels of Nick being a criminal like her father left had me wondering about the real truth about her father's life and her happy memories of him as it was obvious the OCD came from her mother's side.<br /><br />There were a few loose ends to this script as the Austin reviewer said but they weren't enough to sway me away from liking it. I also liked Michael Nouri's small role as the amusing & warm psychiatrist- a nice casting touch.<br /><br />I say watch out for Thomas Trail he's up for a promising career! I will certainly look out for more of his films.
