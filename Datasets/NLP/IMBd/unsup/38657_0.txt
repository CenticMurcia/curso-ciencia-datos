Seriously, every reviewer on IMDb has crud for brains. It's a complete piece of bile tripe.<br /><br />The entire thing is shot in black and white, the acting is supremely sub-par, the camera work is crap. Forgivable in 99% of the indie films out there that are carried by a story. Or even engaging dialog. This movie has *NONE* of it.<br /><br />The vignettes are standalone (although the bit with the RZA, GZA and Bill Murray was referential), pointless and trying too hard to capture absurdist humor.<br /><br />The use of Black and White does not provide deep arty scenes, or work as an illustrative device. The only reason to opt for black & white is so that Art House snobs will accept it as "brilliant".<br /><br />I am a fan of deadpan absurdist comedy, I really am. In fact one of the biggest selling points was Steven Wright.<br /><br />This is not a comedy. There are half-hearted attempts (Chick who is looking at handguns, Bill Murray "hiding out" drinking a pot of coffee straight, etc), but it falls short. Waaaaaay Short.<br /><br />Look, I revel in "bad" films. I forced a friend to go and see "Slither" in the theaters. <br /><br />I have a collection of zombie movies that, if moved to a physical medium, would crush a small child. <br /><br />I enjoy the likes of Kafka, HS Thompson, the Vandals, Monty Python, Firesign Theater, Hedberg, etc et al.<br /><br />This movie is a failure, epic and tragic.
