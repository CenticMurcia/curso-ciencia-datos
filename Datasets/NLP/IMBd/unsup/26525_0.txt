What a team, Legend Christopher Lambert and the truly awesome Vernon Wells in a movie together, and such a classic movie as well. This is a film of Mega proportions to the highest extent and both actors perform to the highest standard in it. Wells plays Maddox(what a name, i bet he thought of that himself) who likes beating people up and raping young men(what a role, he obviously had some considerable influence after his role in Commando so he gets to do whatever he wants in movies) Lambert is class as always and the plot is genius, what more do you need apart from maybe Schwartzkshgjsfgnjsjvnjnnegger or Edward Woodward to add to the already masterful piece of art. This is a classic with no doubts.
