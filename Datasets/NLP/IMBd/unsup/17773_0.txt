Thsi television series is excellent. It will surprise you for its intelligence. It deals with the old Indo-European knowledge of life, death and the after-life. It balances though in many aspects the old -Orpheus- myths of the travels via the under-worlds to the finding of secret treasures, so precious the conductor should resign his fears: Europe, as you know, is a derivative of the old Indo-Europeans, enemies to Egypt, the Ancient Gnostic Civilization. -Space 1999- is a proposal for the correction of this sick mind: the European. As you know, Greece is an enemy to Egypt: they are both opposite cultures: one celebrates knowledge, the other celebrates carnal pleasure. -Space 1999- is a perfect resolution to this old dilemma. Enjoy!
