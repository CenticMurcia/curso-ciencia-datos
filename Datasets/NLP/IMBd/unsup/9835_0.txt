My son and I settled in to watch this movie last week and had a lot of fun. It's not going to win an academy award, but it still made us laugh... a lot.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good, there were a few good scares and I think it looked like a big budget movie. My son really liked the music a lot too. I don't really know much about that, but the quality and the story were great.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I was not expecting much after reading some of the posts here... but I decided to watch it anyway and was riveted! Talk about your low expectations being blown away. I guess I'm not a serious horror fan, but I do know when something is just plain, old entertaining. A lot of movies get made these days by studios and they don't seem to be able to make a good movie that often. This one, you could see that they really cared and gave it a shot. I've heard from my friends in Hollywood that getting a movie made is just about impossible. I'm glad they made this one!
