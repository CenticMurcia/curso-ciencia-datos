All right first I'll vent my beefs' with the film. Number one the makeup and gore effects were pretty bad, even for a no budget film. Plus there was no suspense, or zombie money shots. Second the soundtrack, which had a couple decent rock tunes, but also featured some really weird out of place techno music during a love scene, that was quite laughable. Number three and maybe this isn't so bad, the film only went barely an hour. Really a three rating is generous, the only good thing I can say is the women looked good, and Tiffany Shepis is always a pleasure to watch. Speaking of Tiffany, she has a lesbian scene in this film, that ends way to soon and shows little. Other then that, this film really should have upped the sleaze factor, as the brief nudity in the film was all it had going for it. Sorry to say skip this one.
