Bad writing, bad acting combine with high school cinematography to make this a waste of time and money. I rented this joke in a moment of insanity and regretted it ever since. Leigh Slawner grabs the credit for this drivel, and he's welcome to it. This little joke should have finished his career, but didn't, which is a real shame. The film is disjointed beyond belief and has no redeeming qualities. The only reason I gave it a three instead of the -10 it richly deserves is that there is a remote possibility that there may be a film out there somewhere that is actually worse than this. I'm not holding my breath.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't waste your bread renting this dog.
