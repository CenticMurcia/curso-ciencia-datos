I challenge anyone over the age of 5 to actually allege that they enjoyed this movie. I am generally not critical of people who have a different opinion than I, however, anyone who liked this turkey is either stupid or mentally challenged. This movie actually hurt to sit through. I hated hated hated hated this movie. If anyone is reading this post before actually seeing this film, run away from "The Vault." Watch reruns of UFC and PRIDE and see Bas before he became involved in embarrassing films such as this one.<br /><br />Spoiler (like anyone cares) Note: My favorite scene in this disaster of a film was when the bad girl gets blown up. She jumps in pain about two full seconds before the bomb actually goes off. Don't you love unintentional comedy?
