Little Britain is the best thing to come out of the UK in ages. Matt Lucas and David Walliams deserve heaps more credit than they get already.<br /><br />Everyone who thinks Little Britain sucks, have no sense of humour/ humor, and can't accept that Little Britain is funny even though it's not from the USA!!! When I watch Little Britain I can't stop laughing because the jokes are original and completely un-PC You should definitely watch Little Britain to see Vicky Pollard who is a ginger chick who can't make up her mind, and Lou and Andy (the guy who doesn't really need to be in a wheelchair and all the other hilarious characters.
