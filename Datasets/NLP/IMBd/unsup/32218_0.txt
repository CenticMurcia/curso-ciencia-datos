Just before Woody Allen began his march towards huge critical acclaim with Annie Hall and a definite move towards more serious work he put out this. It is a greatly interesting film as it challenges very interesting sexual boundaries in an irreverent manner without ever feeling too outrageous. The only one criticism I could having is that it is slightly uneven in choosing to display 7 different sketches answering seven different queries about sex as sometimes this feel as though the flow of the film is lost. However it is full of laugh out loud moments, especially What is Sodomy and the second last sketch, and stand out performances from Woody Allen, Mia Farrow, Gene Wilder and John Carradine. The other impressive factor about this film is that it still has a capability to be pretty close to the bone despite being over thirty years old despite not being anywhere as near explicit as predecessors which have covered sex during the following thirty years. Highly Recommended.
