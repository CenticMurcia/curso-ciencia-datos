Obviously inspired by the Saw series, and referencing the phenomenon of video watching (like YouTube), for negative purposes of course, this looked like an interesting horror thriller, from director Gregory Hoblit (Frequency). Basically FBI agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) works in the Cybercrime division, and one day she comes across a suspicious website called KillWithMe.com, where an innocent kitten is to be killed by some torture devise, and basically the more people watch, the faster it dies. It becomes much more serious when the next victim is obviously human, and in a much more deadly trap, and they are trying to access anything that will lead them to the creator and killer, but it is "untraceable". We the audience obviously see the killer, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), and takes a while for them to realise it is him, but when they do, after about one or two more victims, including Jennifer's good friend Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks, Tom's son), Jennifer finds herself the next, and eventually last victim of the deadly traps. Also starring Billy Burke as Detective Eric Box, Mary Beth Hurt as Stella Marsh, Peter Lewis as Richard Brooks, Tyrone Giordano as Tim Wilks and Perla Haney-Jardine as Annie Haskins. The gore is as good as you can get in the Saws, Lane is a good leading actress, and even if the story does have the tiniest glitches, it is worth a look. Okay!
