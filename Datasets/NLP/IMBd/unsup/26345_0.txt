This is an absolutely abominable picture. Abbott & Costello were never very good, even at their best. They are not anywhere near their best in this garbage. In addition to the usual supposedly funny situations that routinely happen in one of these "comedians loose in a harem" type movies, A&C manage to add more drivel. EXAMPLE: There are two really stupid scenes that take place in different jail cells where they encounter an obnoxious looney-bin character who actually reprises the tired and old "Niagra Falls, slowly I turned" routine. And, since this is an A&C picture, the bit, unfunny to start with, is naturally overdone. The second jailhouse scene with the fruitcake lasts about 15 minutes, which is about 14 minutes too long. What makes it worse is that the scene seems to last for an hour. I admit that I never cared for A&C but, it many of their films, I could find a couple of laughs. But, for me, there were no laughs in this turkey. Just, tired old routines that contributed to the boredom factor.
