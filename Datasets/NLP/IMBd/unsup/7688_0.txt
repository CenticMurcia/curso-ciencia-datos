The Simpsons: Road Rage is a quite good game. It has some flaws, but redeeming qualities as well.<br /><br />Characters- Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa, the whole enchilada of characters from classic animated show The Simpsons <br /><br />Plot- Basically Crazy Taxi, Simpsons style.<br /><br />Animation- Good for 2001, not that special looking for today's standards.<br /><br />Sound- Average. Not bad, not good.<br /><br />If you like The Simpsons and/or Crazy Taxi, definitely play this game. You will most certainly like it. Otherwise, give it a whirl if you can find it cheap, but other than that don't play it.<br /><br />8.5/10 or: B
