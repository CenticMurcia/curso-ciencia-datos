Geez! Unfortunately, I didn't connect to the IMDb to check on this before we went to the video store, these sharks (and their lousy producers and cast) chew away $4.00 from me. As it happens very often in a bad movie case, I found myself making fun of the movie and wondering how in the world there are not authorities to prevent these disasters from even getting to innocent hands like ours. My poor daughter was hoping for a "Deep Blue Sea", and she got the "Deep Goo Sh**".<br /><br />The people commenting here about this movie are so right about the spoofs they found out, that I wont repeat them. But it chocked me mysteriously that when the female star decided to go "to help" the poor people that were actually being eaten by the sharks outside, the producer magically omitted the at least half and hour or more that takes to change into a diving suit. Who she thought she was? Superman, that changes inside a phone booth in an instant??? Oh wait...there are no phone booths undersea!...Oh well.<br /><br />If you are in a bank account suicidal drill or just love Animal Planet (and I'm not referring only to the sharks), don't let us commenters stop you...go ahead and rent it... Don't say we didn't warn you.
