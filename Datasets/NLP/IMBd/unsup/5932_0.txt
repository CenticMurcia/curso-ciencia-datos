this film was one of my favourite childhood films and i loved it. it is really touching about the storyline, how she finds the garden and creates into the lovely garden it used to be. i would recommend this film to the girls aged around 4&10 even though i may be a little bit old for this film i still feel the same way i did for this film when i was younger. i was only 4 when film came out but i can remember watching this film over and over again and i would never be sick of watching it. i love this film to bits and i hope i always will.i hope that other people have enjoyed the secret garden as much as i have. words cannot described the way i feel about this film though.
