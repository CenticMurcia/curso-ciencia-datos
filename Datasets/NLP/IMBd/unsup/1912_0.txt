Some might call this movie bad, but I call it a classic. Most 80's movies that are deeply lined with the stylings and hip hijinks of the day died with the 80's. This one was ahead of its time. Though no one character comes off as completely likable as in some traditional teeny-bopper entertainment, the directors walked a fine line with their characters between "80's Cool" and "80's Geek" The directors could have chosen to just fully make these characters super-cool, which would be a big turnoff if you're watching the movie in some decade OTHER than the 80's, but OC and Stiggs aren't super-cool they are just two teens who entertain themselves, and look kind of hopelessly geeky doing it. The unexplained antagonism of the Schwabs was daring for its severity and its mystery, but the portrayal of the Schwabs themselves made it snap into place. It was literally impossible to feel sorry for the Schwab family. Overall I say this movie was a schizophrenic laughingstock seething with the brand of random existential comedy that would be used much later in movies in more recent teen escapades like American Pie. It also reached back and had a feel of Cheech and Chong in it. Its no wonder this movie drew the comedic all-stars that it did in Curtin, Dooley, Mull, Waterston, and Dennis Hopper. Kudos on the musical appearance of King Sunny Ade and the African Beats. I tell ya, there's no obscure 80's movie I'd rather see for the first time flipping through Showtime at 4am than O.C. and Stiggs.
