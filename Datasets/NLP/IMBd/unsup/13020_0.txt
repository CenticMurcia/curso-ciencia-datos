I do not really know why, but this movie really rocks - it has great atmosphere, really cool performance by Charlton Heston and it was very enjoyable. I was satisfied as much, as it was possible.<br /><br />I do however, have a doubts with calling this 'an adaptation' of the novel 'I am Legend'. There is no real connection - many elements were present in the book, but others were altered or added - and, in my opinion, those changes went that deep, that this movie stands on his own. Overall idea is other for the movie and for the novel. It is very hard to make a one-actor movie for 2 hours. That what is great in the novel, doesn't necessary look so good in the movie. That is completely different type of media.<br /><br />But for adapting the idea itself - About a regular guy fighting alone with the nations of creatures he doesn't fully understand - it comes closer than 2007 movie.<br /><br />So movie is great, give it a watch, but read the book afterwords - you'll be still surprised.
