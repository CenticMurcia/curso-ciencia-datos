This was by far, the worst movie I was ever conned into watching. This movie is degrading to such classics as Baller Blockin', The Monkey Hustle, and I'm Gonna Get You Sucka. It makes our people appear as if we were pale. This was obviously an attempt by the man to keep us down. I do suppose, in the end, we all have to dance to the man's music. Shout out to my wardies, Tre-B and Mookie. Check out that new janx from State Property ... "Still Public Enemy No. 1 Mixtape" You will then have a better understanding of what we actually endure. You see, da thang is this...The acting was awful...you could tell that it was not written by those of blessed with color. Anyways, Check me out wardie...im out.
