I don't really know what to think of Bulworth. It's supposed to be a comedy I guess, but by the time it's through, it becomes a serious drama. Warren Beatty tackles a controversial subject, it just seems to fall short. Watching Beatty rap is another story all together. I was embarrassed for him. This film is worth a look.
