I'm doing a very, very slow John Stockwell Film Festival, and of course, I had to see one as part of the process.<br /><br />I think liked his "My Science Project" a WHOLE lot better.<br /><br />This is barely even digestible. More than a little bit too stupid than not. The detective motif didn't really make much sense. If they were locked away in a bomb shelter as little itty-bitty kids, just precisely how was it that they were able to read the books that they got their detective kitsch from? Who taught them to read if there was no one else but them in the shelter? Just being nitpicky here.<br /><br />Apparently, money was saved by using the very, very, very, very cheapest film stock available at the time. Jeez, shooting it on video tape would have yielded a far superior quality visual. And even more money was saved by not bothering to use proper lighting. So much is so dark, i wasn't really too sure what was going on.<br /><br />It verges almost slightly on the edge of being almost entertaining. But it was done so klunkily, it sort of flops around.<br /><br />I'm impressed how Stockwell always talks out of the corner of his mouth. Not many actors do that. And he has his own unique style of enunciation that makes you wonder if he ever had to go to remedial speech classes and luckily the lessons didn't stick.<br /><br />I can't truthfully say i recommend this "movie" to anyone who isn't doing a very leisurely John Stockwell Film Festival like i am. It's VERY klunky.
