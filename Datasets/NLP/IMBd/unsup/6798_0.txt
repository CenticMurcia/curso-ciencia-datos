Being a Chuck fan for the past month I caught this on cable and wasn't disappointed. Chuck plays Josh Randall, a Hong Kong casino bouncer. I like to look at this as a unofficial prequel to Road House with Patrick Swayze. Mainly because total strangers know him because he's the greatest bouncer ever. Only in this movie he's a loyal casino bouncer, not some sellout to the highest bidder like Dalton in Road House. Plus Chuck isn't afraid to use a gun.<br /><br />Here are some memorable things to watch out for in Forced Vengeance: <br /><br />1. Chuck lives on a boat way out in the harbor. This is because Chuck refuses to sleep on anything but American soil.<br /><br />2. There is a flashback scene where Chuck has no mustache. He of course gets beaten to a pulp in this scene to demonstrate the power of facial hair.<br /><br />3. Chuck wears many cowboy hats in this movie. People like to step on them to make him angry.<br /><br />4. About 90% of the tough guys who Chuck beats the crap out of have mustaches. Almost all of these mustaches are noticeably unkempt and some are obvious fakes. This just goes to show if you don't follow proper mustache growing and grooming steps Chuck Norris will destroy you.<br /><br />5. Chuck fights a sea boat captain, and eventually is forced to shoot him because he's going to miss his ferry boat ride.<br /><br />6. Chuck catches a homosexual male prostitute in a bed sheet a douses him in lighter fluid and threatens to burn him if his lover doesn't talk and tell Chuck what he needs to know. Chuck then says the smartest man he ever met was a homosexual.<br /><br />7. Chuck is the only person who thinks it's mean to fire somebody, then force them to leave the premises without any pants.<br /><br />8. We, the viewers, are treated to the inner monologue of Chucks character. Either that or Chuck was using his telepathic powers to better educate me on what was going on at times during the film. Thanks Chuck!<br /><br />No need to thank me. So enjoy people!
