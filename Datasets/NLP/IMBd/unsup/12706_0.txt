This was also my favorite novel as a child as well. It may have been the first major novel I read.<br /><br />David O. Selznick had recently left Metro-Goldwyn_Mayer to set up his own studio. This was one of his first productions as an Independent producer, In choosing Anthony Hope's novel, he made a very wise choice. His casting was even better, he only had the very best available cast at the time.<br /><br />The dashing Ronald Colman as both the King & his cousin. The very beautiful Madeline Carrol as the Princess Flavia. Raymond Massey as the diabolical (wrong side of the sheet) brother of the King.(you could not say bastard in movies or print back then..C.Aubrey Smith as the older loyal aide. The lovely Mary Astor as a Countess who helps. David Niven (this may have been his first major role) as a younger aide.He showed much promise of things to come. & last but not least. Douglas Fairbanks Jr, as the dastardly Rupert. I think he stole the film from both Colman & Massey.<br /><br />Each & ever one of them plus others were about flawless under John Cromwells fine , polished direction., The Sets were magnificent, so good in fact, they were used in the 1952 version) I will also have a review of this version. The Music was excellent written by Alfred Newnan,The screenplay was wriiten by (among others) Edward Rose, John Balderston,Donald Ogden Stewart Ben Hecht & Sidney Howard.<br /><br />This film was one of the more popular films of its day, Even today these many years later it comes across as a wonderful exciting film.<br /><br />This was filmed in glorious Black & White by James Wong Howe.<br /><br />Today the loves scenes seem a bit dated BUT back then actors in a clinch did not look at one another, the camera had to catch there faces. This tale took place prior to WW 1, I just wonder if people did so much smoking, thats a minor quibble.<br /><br />For a peek at a classic from the 1930's SEE THIS.<br /><br />Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 96 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
