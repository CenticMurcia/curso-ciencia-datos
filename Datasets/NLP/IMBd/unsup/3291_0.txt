I'm a Filipino American and I have tried to watch Filipino movies but all have failed to entertain me. Filipino movies are terrible; terrible acting, script, directing, filming, etc. I was hoping that this movie would prove me wrong. Just like every other Filipino film, this movie is very unrealistic for a movie trying to be realistic. The dialogue is horrible and I was hoping that there would be a Filipino movie that uses Tagalog all the way through without any English words or any long English dialogue. The filming looks like it was done by a HD video camera that you can buy at Best Buy and the director was trying to hard to be 'artistic'. That's hard to explain, you'd have to watch it to know what I mean. This movie looks like a homemade movie/a documentary of the Philippines. The story is so lousy. I can't stress this enough that Filipino movies are horrible at story telling. They thought it would be clever that the antagonist knows every movement of the protagonist at every second. Now you'd say, "...What's wrong with that?" Again, you're gonna have to see how unrealistic they show this in the film. This movie isn't worth your time. You probably wouldn't even want to finish watching the movie but I forced myself hoping it would turn out to be a great movie.
