Simply awful. Yes, I 'get' it - war has shattered traditional notions of right and wrong, you can't tell the victims from the criminals, violence can happen at any time, etc.<br /><br />All of which provides a convenient excuse to make an entire movie of long, lingering, rape fantasies. A slobbering drunk accosts a young war widow on a train. A young punk with a knife threatens a girl on a bus. A man is held at gunpoint while his girlfriend is molested.<br /><br />Disgusting.<br /><br />
