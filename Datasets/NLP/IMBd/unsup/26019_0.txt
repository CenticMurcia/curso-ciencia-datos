this sequel to 2000's "Hollow Man"has nothing to do with the 1st one. the characters are all different.for me,this movie lacked the excitement of the 1st.i found it boring and drawn out for in many scenes.i just didn't find it compelling at all.it does not have any of the style of the 1st one,and,to me, no sense of urgency or distress.i didn't think the storyline was very good and the acting was good,but the actors weren't given much to work with.i thought the scope of the movie was too narrow,considering the subject matter.if you have an invisible man in a movie,you should expect some major implications and repercussions.i didn't see that here.it's true that many times,the sequel is not up to par with the original,but this one isn't even close.in my opinion,this movie is not even average.i give Hollow Man 2" 4/10
