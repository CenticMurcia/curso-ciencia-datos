I hate fact twisted into some overdone fantasy/historical fiction called epics. This is one of the worst. I am obsessed with Celtic culture and I look it up endlessly. I have no problem in creating epics with a touch of unrealism. It's fiction. I like adding spin to it. But I absolutely hate it when people take history and completely ignore facts to add their own "idea" of realism.<br /><br />Boudicca is one of my heroes. But she was usual for her time. The actress played her well, but the whole idea of Boudicca should have been left to true, hard-core lovers of Celtic culture.<br /><br />One day,maybe, someone will get it right. The actors were fine: the writing was WAY overdone. Stilted and unimaginative.
