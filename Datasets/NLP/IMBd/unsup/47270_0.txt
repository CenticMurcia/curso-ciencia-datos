It all seemed so perfect. Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones in a cat-and-mouse thriller. How could that go wrong?<br /><br />Well I still don't know how, but it did, big time.<br /><br />The movie opens up well enough. We get treated to a high-tech, Mission: Impossible style break in. A mysterious person watching from the shadows. The viewer gets right into it.<br /><br />Fifteen minutes later all of the suspense goes right out the window.<br /><br />The first key to a thriller like this is having characters who remain a mystery throughout the movie. Zeta-Jones spills the beans about her character in the said fifteen minutes, and Connery is merely an art thief that everybody in the WORLD knows about.<br /><br />Key two: A duel of the minds. You can't tell me for one second that you ever thought that Zeta-Jones could outsmart a stump of wood, let alone Connery.<br /><br />Chemistry, 0.<br /><br />Dialogue, repetitive and just plain stupid (ie. "You should take a look at the facts!" "Why don't you take a look at the facts?" "Why should I take a look at the facts?")<br /><br />Suspense, a bit. The robbery scenes are well done, but they always seems effortless.<br /><br />As far as continuity, this is basically a big wiffle ball of a plot.<br /><br />A rental if you're desperate... maybe.<br /><br />4/10<br /><br />
