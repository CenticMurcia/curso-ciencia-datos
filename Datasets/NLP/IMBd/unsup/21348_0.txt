This is simply a horrific film - not because it was a scary movie, but in how very truly bad it was in every department.<br /><br />Acting was mostly hammy, especially the Spanish cast. The boy whose mother leaves in the care of Clara the baby sitter, cannot decide whether or not he is supposed to be scared to death or be slightly amused when unmentionable things happen to his mother. Only the hero (played by B list English actor Michael Mckell) seems to be able to cope with a horrendously bad script. This however is slightly tarnished by his admission - in the "Bonus Features" interviews - that he has never performed a screen kiss before. The other cast interviews are really sad - all of them pretending they are in the best horror movie of all time.<br /><br />Worst scene of the movie: The extended orgy scene wins hands down, with the climatic re- animation of the drowned baddies (can't reveal more than this) coming a close second.<br /><br />The story itself is hardly original and is based on the novel by Matthew Costello. I certainly won't bother to read it now. However if the novel was a good one at all, the screenplay has certainly managed to mangle it.<br /><br />The only moment in the special effects department that lives up to schlock director, Brian - The Re-animator - Yuzna's reputation is a gleefully monstrous scene when the local constable is discovered hysterically self-dismembering! Thank you, but even that did not make the movie worth wasting 90 minutes on.<br /><br />AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE.
