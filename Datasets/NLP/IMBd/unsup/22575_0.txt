I had the previlage of seeing this picture at the Toronto Film Festival. This was a touching picture, that will bring a tear to the eyes of many. It's about a single man, who hears a German propoganda broadcast, and relays information he's heard onto others in the ghetto, how ever his words are relayed and sometimes distorted. Some of the imformation is correct others ficitional, thus this is how his character is created. He see's how it gives his people a sense of secuirty, how it boisters their spirit, and gives them a sense that thier might be hope for them afterall. It is set in the ghetto of Poland, during the wartime. Mr. Williams does a wonderful job, and really conveyes the message in this film. Highly recommended. Oscar material in my books.
