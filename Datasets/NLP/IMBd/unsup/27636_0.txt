In this story Tom and Jerry are decked out in western wear as the setting is a Texas ranch. Tom as a cowboy is quite smooth, as demonstrated by his cigarette-rolling ability and flawless lip sync, while trying to impress cowgirl kitty. Jerry, of course, must thwart Tom's efforts to charm-in ways that provide lots of laughs. A bull gets involved, and as usual there is much trouble for Tom.<br /><br />This is not one of my favorites, but by far still one of the better episodes.<br /><br />What they were doing at a ranch is unknown, like many of the settings we see them in. But it really doesn't matter; they're enjoyable wherever we find them!<br /><br />Apparently such a good episode that it can be found on both volumes 1 and 2 (disc 2 for each) of the Spotlight Collection DVD set.
