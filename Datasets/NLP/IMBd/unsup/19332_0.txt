I gave this film a 3 / 10 because at least it was in focus, lit, audible and none of the actors stared at the camera or off-camera people. So technically, at least, it was of acceptable quality.<br /><br />As for plot, character interaction/development, dialog and so on, it was mostly sewn-together cloth of movie clich√©s. As these shortcuts and symbols get relied on more and more our movies will become more and more stylized and incomprehensible to those not familiar with the language, like Opera or Japanese Kabuki and Noh theater.<br /><br />One of the newer and more annoying such idiocies is the "safe line." The explosion at the end is "limited extent -- 300 yards" says the Challenger character, and it's true: once our heroes have run 305 yards away, they can safely stop, turn and witness the event completely unharmed. Everything within a 300 yard radius in all directions (including up and down) is completely and utterly destroyed, yet the survivors can stand a few inches farther away and suffer no blast effects, no radiation effects at all. They don't shade their eyes from the light and heat and don't hold their ears to shield them from the noise.<br /><br />I have been seeing this kind of thing in more and more movies lately and I want it to stop, do you hear me? Stop it! Right now! (pant, pant, gasp) <br /><br />I feel better now....
