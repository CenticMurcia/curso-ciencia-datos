If any other director had as many figures of the time, and the budget to make this, they wouldn't have squandered it quite as effectively as Jarman does here.<br /><br />The concept sounds excellent. But the execution is appalling. "Acting" of the most embarrassing kind - think grown adults with the skills of 7 year olds. Bad. That's what we're talking about.<br /><br />This is a shameful film, one that would be forgotten about and rightly dustbinned in favour of thousands more worthy films that I'm unable to find on DVD. It's certainly put me off seeing anything else that Derek Jarman has had a hand in.<br /><br />I repeat, the apocalyptic concept sounds great, but if it appeals, go and see something better, like Alan Clarke's Stars of the Roller State Disco, or even Logan's Run...
