I could only watch about half an hour of this movie - it was so bad that I was glad I rented it instead of buying it. The audio was so poor that I had to turn the volume up just to hear it and when there was gunfire it almost blew my audio system apart! The dialogue was completely out of sync and the camera work was so poor that you could quite often see the overhead microphone appearing in the picture. The only good part of the movie is the few sexy women wearing mid drift tops but that was soon ruined as soon as they spoke. I guess I'm just not a fan of B grade flicks and this movie doesn't help! If you want to see this movie, wait until someone else rents it or pick it up in the $2 bargain bin.
