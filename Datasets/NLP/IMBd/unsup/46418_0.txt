The worst movie I have ever seen - simple as that. It went plunging past the "so bad it's funny" stage and descended into the deepest bowels of bad movies. The only time I have ever really felt that I wasted my money to watch a movie. I would rather have a TangÂ® colonic than be forced to watch this movie again. If you want Flintstones, stick with the cartoon!
