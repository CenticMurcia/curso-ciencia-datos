This seemed to be an attempt at bringing the classic Bing Crosby movie into the future. And by the future, I mean the 1960s. This is a mid-50s movie, but much of it really felt like it was in the 60s. The styles, the art direction, the camera shots, were, for this movie, ahead of their time. But for a Bing Crosby buddy movie, it failed. First, it was overly sexualized with sexual overtones and currents throughout the whole film. Secondly, many of the songs and dance numbers felt tacked-on to the plot (which started to wear thin quickly). The dialog and humor were sub-par, and the ending felt tacked on as well. The last thirty minutes seemed to be a rush to an ending that really failed once you got there. I think Bing gave it his all, and he never faltered. But trying to shove a classic Bing buddy film into this mold leaves you with a weird and tiresome movie.
