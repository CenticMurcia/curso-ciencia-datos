There were no redeeming qualities to this sequel. The plot was poor, the dialogue awful and what was up with Kuno's accent? In the first movie he's got really no accent, he's an American. But in the second...he's got this poor accent through out the movie. The dialogue and plot were bad...but the cinematography were even worse! The editing was choppy, the football boring...there was no tension in the film...and because of how annoying Santiago has become you don't even want to root for him either.<br /><br />Ironically, the best acting performances came from the footballers on the field, in the training scenes and in-game footage. <br /><br />And who thought it was a good idea to have Nick Cannon be in this movie? And as an Englishman? For shame. <br /><br />Acting: Terrible. Directing: Awful. Cinematography+ Editing: Atrocious Dialogue: Amateurish<br /><br />And who thought it was smart to have the characters go in and out of Spanish...then randomly go back into English?? <br /><br />If you're going to bring Santiago and his mother together...why not try and make it mean something?<br /><br />Worthless movie. Trust me, you should avoid this if at all possible. Move right to the third movie.
