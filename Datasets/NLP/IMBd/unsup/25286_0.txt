I don't know very much about French cinema. I know I like quite alot of the movies I see from there, but for all I know they make garbage (like everywhere and everyone else) and send only the good ones to the USA.<br /><br />I mention this only because it seems as though this movie made it here on star power alone. I love Binoche very much and since she doesn't exactly make six movies a year, I'm glad when I can see her at all. When the actors you really love make a movie, you see it. Daniel Day-Lewis falls into that category for me, too. Ever since "The English Patient" and her unexpected but deserved Oscar, I've been mildly obsessed w/her.<br /><br />So while I am glad I saw it, its far beneath her ability and talent, and ditto Jean Reno. It doesn't help that the settings are an airport lounge (at least in that other airport-lounge movie, "The V.I.P.'s", you had Margaret Rutherford and her pill-popping to enjoy) and a hotel room, and that's it. They just talk talk talk talk talk and none of it is even remotely interesting. 3/10.
