Samuel Perillo is Sammy in this movie, the skinny guy. I thought he was Jerry Lewis. I did a Google search and did not find anyone named Samuel Perillo or a picture that looked like Sammy this guy. Sammy in the movie talks, looks, laughs and dances like Jerry Lewis.<br /><br />Now I can see where Sasha Cohen (Borat) gets his dance steps from. The other man Duke Mitchell sings but looks nothing like Dean Martin. When I search the net with "Duke Mitchell" the only picture that comes up is this one Bella Lugosi Meets a Brookly Gorilla and it has "Samuel" Perillo" and "Duke Mitchell". Does anyone know if Jerry Lewis ever used the name "Samuel Perillo"? This is a black and white movie 1952 That I watched for free on Classic Cinema On Line. http://www.classiccinemaonline.com/1/index.Please tell me if you know. Thanks
