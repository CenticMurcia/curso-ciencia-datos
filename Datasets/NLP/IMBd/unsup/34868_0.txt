I took my kids to this movie today, and didn't realize it was not a rated G movie.<br /><br />After we left the movie, I looked it up and see MPAA Rating: PG for some brief language and suggestive humor. Not sure what that's all about, there was a protracted 1-2 minute scene with flatulence as the main character. That sort of stuff doesn't bother me so much, but there was other stuff in this movie that just didn't seem right for kids. For example, the "evil CEO" character has a mother that works in a scrap metal facility, and at one point the mother says something to her CEO son to the effect of "you don't want to end up like your father?" who they then show chained up and hanging around the scrap metal facility - a short segment of the movie which makes an effort to have fathers look bad I guess. Always good for a laugh I guess.<br /><br />It seems pretty common these days for movies that are supposedly for kids to have all sorts of adult topics, themes, and innuendo. Does Hollywood really think that the only way to get parents in to a kids movie is to have this covert subtext? Or is there something more sinister going on here?
