Awful, miserable film probably remembered as it was Joanne Woodward's first motion picture.<br /><br />This colossal bomb deals with a post-Civil war gentleman returning home to the south. He finds utter contempt from the people living there as he fought on the side of the north. What else should he expect- a ticker-tape parade?<br /><br />Van Heflin is our turncoat and along the way, having survived Vicksburg, he has gotten religion and plans to be a preacher.<br /><br />The heavy in the film is none other than Raymond Burr who does everything in his power to thwart the goals of Luke Fargo (Heflin) even if it means burning down the church or spreading horrendous gossip about Heflin and his sudden 18 year old charge, Lissy, played nicely by Woodward. Throughout the film,she appeared to be a tom-boy like character, who Heflin tries to tame.<br /><br />The problem with the film is that every time Burr strikes at Heflin, there is really no excitement. Even at the end, Burr just drives his horse and buggy away. A Gunfight At The OK Corral like ending was needed here.
