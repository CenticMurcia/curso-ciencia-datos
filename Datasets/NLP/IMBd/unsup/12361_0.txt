An aircraft carrier, (in an unconvincingly contrived way), goes back in time to the day just before the Pearl Harbour attack and does.... Er very little really? <br /><br />Other than a few people getting killed, (most of who nobody seems overly bothered about), one man from the future being left behind and a dog getting sent forward in time absolutely nothing of any consequence happens here at all.<br /><br />Now a film, (or more usefully), a series, where the ship doesn't go home but instead stops the attack and then deals with a crew that has to come to terms with living in a past where their irrevocably rewriting history... now that would be worth watching.<br /><br />Imagine the issues to deal with...<br /><br />How would the Roosevelt Government come to terms with this new found asset on their doorstep.<br /><br />What issues would it's Nuclear Arsenal have on both ending the war and effecting the balance of power afterwards.<br /><br />What interaction would 1000 navy servicemen with a knowledge of a possible future have on the world their parents/grandparents are growing up in.<br /><br />Altogether a far more interesting premise than the rather pointless one the film finally opts for.
