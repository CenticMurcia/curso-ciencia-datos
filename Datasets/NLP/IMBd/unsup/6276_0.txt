I liked this film as it approached the holocaust from a completely DIFFERENT direction. Most outside of Italy have no idea about this country's part in the holocaust, but it was quite different from what occurred in Germany. In Italy, Mussolini was supported by Jews and gentiles alike and it was only AFTER the war began that Mussolini began to implement antisemitic laws in order to please Hitler. How he and the people of Italy adopted this was amazing and rather sudden.<br /><br />The movie begins in 1938 and all seems well for the Jewish families portrayed in the movie. Much of the beginning and middle of the movie concerns Giorgio's unrequited infatuation with Mic√≤l Finzi Contini. Although this makes up the bulk of the movie, it is only the background for the more sinister goings on in the country. You see, as the years unfold, more and more restrictions are placed on the Jews and more and more of their rights are eroded. When this first began, the faith of Giorgio's father in their fascist government is unwavering--Mussolini is STILL his hero. However, as the movie continues, his optimism turns to pessimism until he and the Finzi Contini family are rounded up for deportation to the extermination camps by the film's end. Giorgio, it seems has escaped as have other members of his family. However, the exact fate of EVERYONE in the movie (except for Micol's brother) is left uncertain at the conclusion. I liked this, as life, particularly in the case of the holocaust, is far from certain and it seems to work well.
