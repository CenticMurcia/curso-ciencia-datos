Not only in the movie itself, but also as far as the reviews/voting/ratings are concerned here on IMDb. Of course everyone has their opinion on any other subject matter, that's why it's always interesting to read other peoples views, to see from which point or perspective they viewed the movie.<br /><br />Having said that, which could easily be seen as a smooth intro into this movie (I hope you'll see it that way), this movie has a political message, but it doesn't thrive on it too much. The movie's purpose is to entertain the audience and not to make them political activists. There's still nuances and (political) criticism to be found here, if you look closely.<br /><br />The whole movie is gravitated by Dennis Quaids performance. Of course this is an ensemble piece/movie and the other actors are great too, but he's the one, that grabs our attention the most. Which helps you go through the first 10 to 20 minutes of the movie. They're a bit slow (especially compared to the finale of the movie) to say the least. You can also criticize the movie for it's dialogue, the fact that it seems to go in different directions, once it starts, but then again, these things were all done on purpose.<br /><br />Try to enjoy it is what I'm saying and don't go into the movie, trying to spot every little continuity error. Here's where I have to point out one thing I read in another review. Again I respect the fact, that the reviewer didn't like the movie, but he was angry at the movie, because it was shot in Mexico, pretending that to be Spain. Well suffice to say, that the reviewer is from Spain, so he should know if that is true or not. But saying that's a bad/negative thing and asking, if Europeans would do the same is hypocritical. Because Europeans have done the same. German westerns shot in the former Yugoslavian Republic, pretending that was America! Or even the Italian (Spaghetti) Western mostly shot in Spain(!) also pretending that was the USA!
