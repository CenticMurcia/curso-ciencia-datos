Ed Burns scores some funny moments in this sophisticated look at love, sex and relationships. Dawson and Graham both provide excellent performances, and Burns is extremely convincing. A semi-doco style works very well and combines with good camera work to get the viewer involved.<br /><br />Great to look at - a very enjoyable movie.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5
