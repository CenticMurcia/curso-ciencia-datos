Four lesbian girlfriends go on vacation to a lakeside cabin getaway only to be accosted by Caleb, an extremely shy classmate of one of the girls, and his incredibly horny dysfunctional family. The chicks aren't damsels-in-distress for long as when they decide to get revenge, all hell breaks lose.<br /><br />Some editing and pacing issues hamper the movie from being as good as it seems to have wanted to have been, as does a lack of sympathy for any of the characters, and a tired lame sub-plot involving two cops who are merely obvious cannon fodder. The highlight of the film for me was less what was going on in the movie and more the great soundtrack score via Ministry's Al Jourgensen, which I just hoped would be in a better movie.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Carlee Baker, Eryn Joslyn, Eve Mauro, and Robin Sydney all provide T&A (Robin I saw topless before in "Big Bad Wolf", the other three are baring for the first time) There's also nudity in some of the extras (noted with an asterisk) <br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: Optional Intro by Al Jourgensen; commentary with Director Zach Passero, Actresses Robin Sydney, Carlee Baker, & actor Justin Stone; 19 & a half minutes of bloopers & deleted scenes*; photo gallery; Advanced trailer* & theatrical trailer* for this film; and Trailers for "The Oracle", "Love me deadly"*, "Blood Sisters", & "Witchery"*
