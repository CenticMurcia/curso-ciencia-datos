Until "Alien Abduction" there was a considerable unbridged distance between your basic high-end "soft core" movie and your basic poorly written/generally unwatchable feature (insert "Zoolander" here). "Alien Abduction" successfully links the two categories. Whether that is a good thing is up to the viewer.<br /><br />How I ended up watching this thing is more interesting than anything in the movie. Since the movie failed to attract much of an audience when released, its title was changed. The original title of "Alien Abduction: Intimate Secrets" was prefixed with "Forbidden Zone" which causes it to be confused with Susan Tyrell's cult classic "Forbidden Zone". Even the IMDb is confused and when you click the Amazon VHS link for "Forbidden Zone" you end up with "Alien Abduction". So trusting souls like myself end up owning a copy of something unlikely to ever be considered a cult classic.<br /><br />Not that it is a total loss, the missing link thing is kind of interesting and it is also interesting that this was pretty much an acting career killer for the five very attractive women featured in this film. Not that they exhibited much acting talent. Former Playboy centerfold Pia Reyes is probably the best to the lot. Meredyth Holmes gets the most screen time and has one of those strange faces that looks gorgeous when framed by a hat and rather ordinary otherwise (maybe her horrible haircut and dye job). Darcy Demoss has a lot more mileage on her than the other four and you wonder what she is doing in this thing. This was the last movie appearance for several of them and the remaining ones were out of the business a couple years later.<br /><br />The story is totally uninteresting which is unfortunate because the women are attractive and non-plastic. They spend most of their time in a sauna (shot in Romania) engaged in girl banter with towels wrapped around them. They describe passionate fantasies to each other that somehow fail to be passionate when cut in as flashbacks. It would have been nice if something sexy or erotic took place in these sequences but it doesn't. There is some amusement value in the fact that these sequences are staged on sets that were obviously created for other movies (the budget must have all gone for salaries). There is an alien subplot but no one should care much about it because even the characters treat it listlessly.<br /><br />At least Pia Reyes' fans will enjoy watching her.
