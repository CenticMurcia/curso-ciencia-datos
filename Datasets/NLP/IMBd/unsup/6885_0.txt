The week after seeing "Wordplay", I solved the Sunday NPR puzzle, (name a famous American in eight letters, six are consonants, all of which are Roman numerals); I didn't submit my answer because I figured if I could solve it as quickly as I did, it had to be pretty easy...there were more than 1200 correct answers sent in. My interest in seeing the film stemmed from my curiosity about Will Shortz, unfortunately the movie just rehashed most of his CV that has been previously published, with nothing new added. Absent that, I think the film makers did an excellent job in choosing to follow some pretty disparate puzzle addicts. I attended the movie with two friends, one who is no longer able to do puzzles because of failing eyesight; the other for whom doing the Sunday New York Times puzzle has become a religious experience; we were all equally enthusiastic about the film, although we were all rooting for different people to win the contest. Caveat: people who do not do crosswords themselves, and have seen one or more of the recent movies about spelling contests may find this less interesting than those who do puzzles. A definition that's been around for awhile, "Optimist: A person who does a crossword puzzle in ink".
