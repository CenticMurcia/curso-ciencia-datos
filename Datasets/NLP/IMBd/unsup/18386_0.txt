I have been watching this show since it premiered. I can safely say that it has been one of my favorite comedy shows on Canadian television. I will admit that the humor used is only sometimes "lacklustre," but for the most part, the jokes ARE funny.<br /><br />I know some of you give it a bad rap for being "stupid," and "retarded," but isn't that sometimes what we all need? People get tired of having to think, sometimes. We have lives, with jobs, and children, and friends, and responsibilities. When we watch television, we're trying to escape. We want something that is a little bit "stupid," sometimes.<br /><br />I'll admit that I'm not the most harsh critique when it comes to comedy. As long as it makes me laugh, it's gold. And this show makes me laugh. The first few seasons have been great, and although it has faded a little bit since the start, I will continue to watch this show.
