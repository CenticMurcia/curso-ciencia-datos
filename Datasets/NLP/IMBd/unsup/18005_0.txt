The story of the Pony Express is one of the most interesting and fascinating stories of the west. California at that time was totally isolated, and would get the news from the government many months later, thus many people would be for secession, because they did not believe they could be governed like that. There was no telegraph, so they decided to pick those skinny guys, the equivalent of today's jockeys, and make them alternate, also switching horses, so in ten days the express mail would get from St Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento. Now you might ask what Buffalo Bill (Charlton Heston), Wild Bill Hicock (Forrest Tucker) and a sort of Calamity Jane named Denny (Jan Sterling) fit into this and the answer will be marketing. Famous western names would please the crowds. I would have wished for a more serious film, but I can't deny the film is entertaining, fast paced, colorful and with a lot of action, The scenes where the pony express is shown are very good. I just was hoping for a more historical and serious film, but who knows, one day they will make it.
