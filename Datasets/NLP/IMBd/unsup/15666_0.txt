I was also surprised to see the low rating of this great little film. I saw it as a teen in the mid 80's on cable and, like so many others, was unable to stop watching this story through to its end. Even though it now looks so dated, I mean, no dot coms, facebook or cell phones here, the meat of the story holds true now, as it did in '84. The acting is fine and the issues are realistic. Speaking for myself, as a young teen-aged girl growing up in New Orleans, I could totally relate to the emotions expressed by the two lead characters, both New Yorkers, because the feelings were universal. If you're a female, you'll probably get it (and let me just say, I don't usually enjoy 'chick-flicks'). Like someone else has already posted, I, too, look forward to my own daughter viewing this film. It's still one of my all-time faves & whenever I catch it on TV, I still have to watch it, all these years later. I'd say it has stood the test of time.
