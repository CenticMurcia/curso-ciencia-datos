I watched this yesterday on Dutch Television. I had not been following 24 for quite some time and to see a movie was a great surprise. As an avid fan I really looked forward to this. I made my tea and cookies and was ready to enjoy.<br /><br />Obviously Jack Bauer kicked ass again, no surprise here, what the problem was was the poor ending. Not to mention the film only lasted an hour. It was too damn short, the ending wasn't a real ending. It didn't feel good. I think that you can't really make a good movie out of a series if that series requires 24 hours to make an entire story. They had the same eye for detail but not the time to make it fit. The action scenes weren't really fitting, I felt more as if the director said to himself: "gee, we're lacking some action scenes.. hmmm let's do another one and I don't care why I just want action!"<br /><br />It really didn't feel 24ish. I understand that it may sound strange, requiring a perfect film for a man who is the year 2000's Chuck Norris and usually isn't too complicated other than struggling with the dilemma of deciding to kick them with his left or right leg, but it just wasn't right.<br /><br />I'll look forward to a next season of 24, but I'll pass for another film.
