This movie was Stellar, as long as you're looking for something completely unbelievable, poorly filmed, with no concept and no plot. We enjoyed the fact that on a bottle of wine this movie was HILARIOUS, simply because it was so bad. Did anyone else notice the fact that the music never changed? The shark didn't look big, the water didn't look real, and come on, honestly? the sailboat with the giant shark? you've got to be kidding me. How did anyone think this movie might actually sell or be watched by anyone? It's terrible. It's called Megalodon but we don't see the shark until well after the fact, and they really don't seem to freak out about the fact that the shark is supposedly prehistoric but now lives in our ocean. The best part for me was when the half shark body floated across the screen. The whole movie was just so bizarrely bad, it was nearly surreal.
