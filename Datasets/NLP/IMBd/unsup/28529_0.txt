A friend of mine has the movie and so we looked at it. I really liked the movie. I really liked the part were the house Blow up when he picked up that grenade to throw it back out. Also when the guy was shot between his legs while on the roof--Cool. We all enjoyed it and liked it. I am going to get my own copy. Also since that time I have seen other movies that Victor Von Wright, has played in and they also were very good. Some may say other wise about this movie, however I have found that some people try to pick apart anything and everything. Nevertheless, we all enjoyed the movie and there were about 15 of us watching it. Good Movie.
