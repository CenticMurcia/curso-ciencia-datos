*contains spoilers*<br /><br />My friends and I were in the mood for a light-hearted comedy, as the previews seemed to indicate. It looks like one of those stories where guy gets dumped, meets nice girl, pulls himself up by the bootstraps, gets his dog back, and heals his heart. WRONG! The plot goes more along the lines of guy gets dumped, lots of people have sex or walk around naked, guy pathetically buys dog from nephew, plot goes nowhere. I have no idea how it ends because after an hour, we gave up and walked out. It was that bad. <br /><br />Weak storyline, predictable and uninspired dialogue, unimaginative (and excessive) nudity and sex for its R rating. Even if you view the movie as a drama instead of a potential romantic comedy, it still lacks depth and doesn't tie you to any of the characters. I found myself watching the scenes in the hope that just maybe the dog would be on camera- at least he was likable and interesting. No such luck. Watch some of the rainy scenes- you can see the sunshine in the background even in the big storm scenes. Altogether awful awful movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, money, or spot in your rental queue. Worst movie I've seen in years.
