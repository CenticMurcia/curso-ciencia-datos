Stanley Donen from the smarmy classic "Singin' in the Rain" directed this sleazy space adventure? What's next, George A. Romero remaking 'Dirty Dancing'?? Less surprising than the awkward director choice, however, is how silly and redundant this movie is... It totally lacks the originality, creativity and  especially  the credibility in order to become memorable science fiction. All it is now is an at times entertaining SF romp with a good cast and a couple of really nice gimmicks, but those hoping for another cool genre milestone will be sorely disappointed. "Saturn 3" stars Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett as a pretty much carefree space couple, stationed in a control base on one of Saturn's Moons. Their jolly lifestyle is about to end abruptly when the grumpy Capt. Benson (Harvey Keitel) comes to build an all-knowing Meccano-robot. In one of the most ludicrous plot-twists ever, the robot (basically made from pipes and wires!!) becomes obsessed with Fawcett's ravishing body. Not that we can blame anybody for wanting to jump Farah Fawcett (she's ultra-hot again!) but this premise is a little too stupid to build a complete, supposedly 'adult' science fiction screenplay 'round. Trained genre fans can play a game spotting all the other (and more successful) titles that heavily influenced the story. The list is rather impressive, with "Star Wars", "2001  A Space Odyssey", "Alien", "Zardoz" and "Dark Star" as the most obvious ones. Some of the dialogues Kirk Douglas has to produce are terribly cheesy and for some incomprehensible reason, Harvey Keitel seems to talk with a dubbed voice. Watching "Saturn 3" isn't a total waste of time, but there sure are better SF gems to purchase.
