Yes, I'm aware that Hal Hartley is an acclaimed independent film maker. I like most of his films myself.<br /><br />Yes, I'm aware that I'm supposed to like this film.<br /><br />That having been made clear, I want the $1.50 it cost me to see "Amateur" back! (Hey, it's been eight years and I'm not asking for interest or emotional damages.)<br /><br />I suppose it's only fair that I give some reasons for thinking that "Amateur" is a bad film. 1) It is too long. The story could have been told quicker. 2) Owing, in part, to the first reason, it is boring. 3) It keeps faking you out, making you think that something exciting is about to happen and you, the weary viewer, keep giving it that chance. It's kind of like an abusive relationship: despite being hurt time after time, you can't break it off.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that I could do a better job or anything like that. It's just that I had really high hopes for "Amateur" and those hopes were crushed.
