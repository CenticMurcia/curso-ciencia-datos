<br /><br />This is a movie about an English auctioneer who proposes to the daughter of a Mafiosi. Unfortunately this collision of two to three different languages and cultures was sadly neglected in the movie. The few times it considered it you would wish it had rather not. Just remember the painful scenes when Hugh Grant tried to speak American/Brooklyn/Italian slang. Or when Jeanne Tripplehorn laughed about the way Hugh Grant runs.<br /><br />Hugh Grant was occupied to deliver his usual acting in his main character. When watching it you can almost forget that he is able to be really funny and is able to deliver respectable acting as well. When an actor is only able to do one kind of character, who cares when it is done well? Did anybody blame Cary Grant for just doing this? Everybody who saw Maurice knows that Hugh Grant is able to act. He is also able to be funny as he proved in Four Weddings and A Funeral. So what was the problem with Mickey Blue Eyes. I reckon it was the script.<br /><br />Who can fight against such a story. And the Co-actors where at a loss as well. James Caan was vague and Jeanne Tripplehorn could also do better. Maybe it was not only the script but the director too.
