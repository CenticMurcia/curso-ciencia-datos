I never liked John Woo and this film is the epitome of bad movie making. All of John Woo's films are bad and in the same way. They have ridiculously overdone battle scene's and the rest of the film seems like it is on auto drive until they get to the next action scene.<br /><br />Christain Slater is a good actor but he is surrounded by incompetence and it simply brought him down with the rest of the film. The writing is awful and it has a tacked on and meaningless ending. <br /><br />This movie was terrible and pointless from beginning to end. I still have no idea how John Woo is still making movies, but one things for sure, he shouldn't be.
