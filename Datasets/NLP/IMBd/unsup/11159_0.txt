This movie (as well as the book and play) addressed sensitive issues that touch the lives of men, women and children everyday. However, theses issues are usually not openly discussed and are often hidden, which leads to mental and emotional break-downs or destructive behavior. <br /><br />The movie not only captured several issues, including sexual abuse, verbal abuse, abandonment, low self-esteem etc. It also demonstrated the negative effects of covering up the issues through lies, misplaced aggression and denial. I liked the way the movie displayed the effect that the revival incident had on each character that was involved. I was also touched by the positive and encouraging words offered by the minister which ultimately had an effect on the main character.
