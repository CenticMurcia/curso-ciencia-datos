Oh my god. This film is terrible. It's so bad that even giving it my time to describe how bad it is is really a huge and unnecessary waste of my time. Just about everything that can be bad about this film is... starting with the truly abysmal screenplay adaptation from the book, gruesome directing from Donner (how did he ever make Lethal Weapon on this evidence?!), awful awful ham acting from just about everyone but Butler, and a dismal clich√©d score that almost made me asphyxiate myself with the remote control in order to make it stop. <br /><br />$80m? Please someone tell me it's not true. A truly terrifying example of what happens when the studio are determined to make a cookie cutter that they think will make a few quid. Thank god it tanked, let's pray it taught a few people to actually read the screenplay before they make the film next time.
