Being a big Thora Birch fan, and seeing this DVD at FYE for $12, I figured it'd be worth a look. I thought Thora's scene was freaking hilarious... the poem was Shakespeare-esque. I also thought Dominique Swain was pretty good in her lead role... but the producer, Nicholas Loeb, was putridly pathetic. Were they so over-budget that he HAD to cast himself? And in the lead male role! I couldn't stand watching him. I thought anyone could be an actor. I was wrong.<br /><br />Still, because of the interesting plot, Thora's amazing scene, Swain's good acting, and my ability to chuckle at Loeb every other scene, I gave it a pretty high ranking in my book.
