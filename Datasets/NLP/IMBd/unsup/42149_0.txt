I rate movies 1 when I feel like turning it off, which was many times during this film. I didn't, though it seemed to get worse...<br /><br />He wins a grand, decides to get a date with Drew, the whole movie follows him throughout a very long 90mins and thats it.<br /><br />There were some entertaining moments, but a movie about a guy getting a date with a celbrity is all you're going to see and how knowing someone who knows someone else might know Drew.<br /><br />Eventually a website is made, which catches Drew's business partners attention, and Drew herself.<br /><br />Don't watch unless you want to see this excuse for a movie.
