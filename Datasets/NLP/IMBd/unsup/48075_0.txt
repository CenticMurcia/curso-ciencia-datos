This is bar-none, one of the worst films I have ever seen. The only reason I've given it 2 stars is because the actors in this film are very effective in their character portrayal. All the absolutely unlikable characters will remind viewers of someone they know. The neurotic parents, bratty kids, oblivious ditsy best friend, womanizer, smug arrogant boss and gay man conflicted about his homosexuality are all represented. As a fan of Molly Shannon and quirky off-beat movies, I was enthusiastic about seeing this film. As my husband and I watched this movie we kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did. The movie just rambled pointlessly as the main character seemed to undergo a mental breakdown. By the end of the movie, most viewers will be convinced that Molly Shannon's character is a real fruitcake. Molly Shannon effectively conveys the image of a lonely spinster lacking in people skills who insulates herself from the hurts of the human experience by replacing them with animals. Despite her fine acting ability, she does not salvage this disaster of a movie. The final scene unconvincingly tries to convince us that the main character returns from the brink of a murderous mental breakdown and has an epiphany of self-discovering. It was pathetic. <br /><br />(Also a minor factor in my dislike of this movie is the representation of animal lovers and activists as unstable and potentially dangerous.)<br /><br />Synopsis- a complete waste 2 hours. Read a book instead.
