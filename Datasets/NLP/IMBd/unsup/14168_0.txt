I must say that i am surprised... I have now for the last two months or saw seen all of the films that are related to this series and this ends up as the second best. The original will always get credit, with all right, for being original but it it really lacks when it comes to acting, score, makeup etc. Savini, John A. Russo and Romero have really added was missing in terms of casting and script. The movie also gains a lot from not trying to be shocking. There are scenes in the original version where the movie really became to pretentious in that aspect. A thing that surprised me during the movie was the fact that the comments from media was largely removed. I can understand why they wanted to remove the babble about radiation from Venus or what ever it was. I bet Romero really regretted this part of the original NOTLD (with good cause) since there has was no mention of this in the remake. I was wondering though how they would tie up the ending. I must say that the new ending was much more in line with what could be read between the lines in the original. Anyway, it is of course not perfect. The acting by Tony Todd is good and Patricia Tallman as Barbara get better as the movie progresses. This can be said about the movie too actually, the beginning is not as gripping as it should have been much due to Barbaras overacting brother. All in all 7/10, treat your friends to this version if they are not die hard for classic horror. I really can not think of anyone i know who would sit through the original.
