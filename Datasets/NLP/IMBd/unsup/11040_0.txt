Great movie. Funny and good twisted plot. You don't know what's real and what's not until the end which ties it all together. Entertaining movie for those who don't like the majority of average Hollywood movies you see with dull plots and you already know what is going to happen after watching the first 10 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br />
