Clint Eastwood's third coming as Detective Harry Callahan is once again a stylish, well-made, fast-paced and wonderfully strong police thriller that's definitely worth a watch or ten. Personally I've seen it numerous times but I guess when you love something as much as I love Clint and his works you're probably stuck with it. I do admit "The Enforcer" may not be the best sequel to "Dirty Harry" but it sure as hell is, like Callahan himself would put it: marvelous. Of course Harry says it when he wants to be sarcastic and I really mean it. Tyne Daly played Kate Moore, Harry's lady partner who had no street experience of the real police work. Late Albert Popwell had a different role in all of Dirty Harry flicks except the last one. He was the unlucky bank robber in the first movie and pimp in the second. This time he played Ed Mustapha.<br /><br />"The Enforcer" also included an uncredited cameo of Joe Spano who few years later got an excellent part of Henry Goldblume in the magnificent television series "Hill Street Blues". And let's not forget that Harry's Magnum .44 is one of the most important characters of the film. Plot is average and not as inventive and interesting as it was in "Magnum Force" but this movie contains perhaps more humor than any other part of the series and at least two of my favorite Dirty Harry -moments. Other one is the scene where Harry puts an end to an armed shop robbery and a hostage situation by driving a police car inside the store (very unusual police work and a crazy stunt you can only expect from Callahan) and the other one's when Harry blows away a tower in Alcatraz with a rocket launcher. "The Enforcer" is splendid, enjoyable, classic 70's action flick and a great forerunner to "Sudden Impact".
