Quality goreless movies are hard to find. How often can we watch people who are cut open, shot, guts spewing...? This movie has none of that. It is a precious story of realities dramatic in their own right, and inspiring without the gore of other films. I think movies should be inspiring... and Dreamer does just that. Inspire. Dakota Fanning is phenomenal. That child is far too skilled for her own good. She takes on the depth of the character and brings a reality to the screen rarely found by child actors. Kurt Russell for any 80's child is a classic and has wonderful chemistry on screen with his on screen daughter. Chris Christopherson, although shockingly older than he was with Barbara Streisand plays a role untouchable by other actors. The on screen relationships have depth, the plot stirs the audience, and for anyone interested in "good film" - this movie is a must see.
