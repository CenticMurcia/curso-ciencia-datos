This is one of the worst films I have ever seen and I have seen some rubbish in my time. The premise is 5 teenagers go to Ireland to try some magic mushrooms, they pickup the other token spooky Irish guy when they get there. Why bother going all the way across the globe to get high ? Anyway from the off one of the girls eats a mushroom that you shouldn't touch, so this is a big Plot signpost as to where we are going and whats going to happen. The teens get picked off one by one after the Token Irish chap tells them all a scary Moonlight story. Throw in the mix a couple of locals to try and throw you off the bait (i didn't work) and the standard make you jump moments, girl looks through crack in door somethings going to happen!! I'm just glad I watched this on sky and didn't waste any money down the Cinema.<br /><br />Avoid
