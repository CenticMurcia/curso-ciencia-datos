Frank (Walter Matthau) has just lost his beloved wife of 40 years. His son Robert (John Stamos), always closer to his father than the other two sons, is there to help him through the hard moments. However, Robert is very distrustful of marriage and has remained a bachelor, despite having a way with the ladies. This changes when a beautiful woman is transferred to work in the same NY accounting firm as Robert. Susan (Teri Polo) has just been separated from her husband in Wisconsin but, nevertheless, responds to Robert's advances. At the same time, Frank goes to a Hawaiian-themed party for the over 60 crowd and meets a wonderful woman named Florence (Carol Burnett). Florence is such an attractive and nice lady that Frank, despite his initial hesitation, decides to get close to her. Robert is thrown for a loop, not only because of his own need for Susan, but because he thinks his father is rushing things. Can Robert allow Frank to live his own life? This is a lovely film, very honest and true to life. Matthau, in one of his last roles, is great as the widower trying to navigate in very strange waters. Burnett, too, gives a nice performance as a woman with a very big heart. As for Stamos and Polo, they are two very attractive people who give their characters the needed depth suitable for two souls who have been unlucky in love and are uncertain which way to turn. If you have lost a parent and are struggling with the idea of your mother or dad finding a new partner, this is definitely the film for you. It has some great messages about the brevity of life and the importance of living every day to the fullest. But, even if you are not dealing with the loss of a loved one, this movie is an entertaining couple of hours. Don't be foolish and pass this film by.
