This film was absolute dross. The subject matter was not entirely irrelevant - I am sure that there are people out there like these people and I don't believe that cinema has to be representative of its country of origin. That said, dialogue was stodgy and stilted and it was full of unlikeable characters (save for the stuttering Michael Dorman, who was the only actor worth watching). Khan Crittenen, who was superb in Clubland, was as dull as dishwater (though I concede that it was more the script at fault than his actual performance). As far as entertainment .... well it's not at all.<br /><br />By all means go see it, if you want to waste your money. Better to wait till its DVD launch - it will lose nothing on the small screen, though it would be better to lose the show entirely.
