Even if I where bleep up betting the gee-gees in ISLE OF MAN coming home head down I could not sit watch this movie. LOOK what an original title there. Happy to see somebody made Big Brother into a movie. What's next? Girls Gone Wild at the cinema! Adam Rifkin made one dirty grab you by the nuts movie. NIGHT AT THE GOLDEN EAGLE. One of the best. This movie had to be made by little children with Mum's camera. Acting went below 2 bit. Any sane person would call this horrible rubbish. I am in full support of kriskoppy1961. A good shower is only way to cleanse yourself from this piece of cinema garbage. LOOK should have only cost 100 Euros to produce 50 Euros for Mum.
