"Planet Of The Apes" an awesome, classic movie... "Beneath The Planet Of The Apes" a little slower paced.. but some of the scenes with the mind controlling bomb worshipers are very interesting. "Escape From The Planet Of The Apes" In my opinion the best of the 5, cute, funny, tragic.. excellence.<br /><br />Then this came along, a mindless, boring movie. I understand the nessecity of this movie to continue the storyline, but this one gets real boring real fast. The Apes revolt from their masters in an elaborate war scene that seems to last forever in a 60's "future" town. This one can be skipped. (Coincidently, The next and last installment "Battle For The Planet Of The Apes" is well worth watching, and I'd recommend it and all the other apes movies over this one)<br /><br />
