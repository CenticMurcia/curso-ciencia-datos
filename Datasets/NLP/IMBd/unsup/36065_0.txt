This movie blew my mind. Seriously. I was watching it and about every 5 minutes Paul Walker would say something that would make my head feel like I was about to have an aneurysm. Do not watch this if you have any congenital heart defects. Or you will die. Or have diarrhea. Paul Walker is such a bad actor. Did you see that movie with Steve Zahn and that semi-truck? That semi-truck was the best actor in that movie and if he had been in this movie he would have been the best actor in this movie too. Only watch this movie if you have an IQ under 60. If you watch this movie with an IQ over 60, you will watch the credits with an IQ under 60. I can't do math anymore.
