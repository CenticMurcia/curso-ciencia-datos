this movie was terrible. i only purchased it because corinna harney is in it, but she doesn't even get naked!!! it always makes me laugh to see an indie movie like this with like 10 pages of glowing reviews- way to get your family involved, director guy!! <br /><br />anyway, the fact that baseball is the main storyline will quickly be forgotten here as the scenes involving baseball are strange and unfitting, seemingly edited very poorly or having little or nothing to do with actual baseball. corinna looks hot in it, but i honestly am mad at myself for buying this off of amazon, even though i only spent $1. 1/10
