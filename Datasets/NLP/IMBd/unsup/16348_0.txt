You haven't known mental anguish until you've seen this movie. In hindsight it is a major miracle that any studio would have touched any Marvel franchise with a ten foot pole after this stinker. Production values hover near zero, the dialogues make you cringe all the way through the movie and the whole story is beyond nonsensical, even for a comic.<br /><br />The only upside are a few female Italian bad guys in the latter half, but the price to suffer through to see them is not worth the admission. Watch this movie with a couple friends so you know just how great straight to video stuff can be in comparison. Give Eddie Murphy a copy for his birthday so he'll feel much better about Pluto Nash.
