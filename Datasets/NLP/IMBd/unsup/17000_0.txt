I love action movies, but come on! This was beyond the prediction land, you know exactly what was going to happen in each scene. I have to give credit, I had so much fun being sarcastic with this flick. Like the cheesy clich√©' slow bomb sequences, I was like "NOOOOOO!!!", or John Travolta's "Super Duper Bad-Ass Villain" technique was too good to be true! It's like that last fight between him and Christain was "Give me your lunch money!". Or John's threatening tape to the Pentagon with the images of the nuclear attack I was like "Actually that was some scenes from Terminator 2: Jugdement Day, but the real attack would be a lot like that, yeah. Scary!" Him commanding just $250,000,000, I mean that was a lot of money, but come on! He could have settled for another billion! :D This is your typical action flick with no real decent plot. Nice try, John W., John T., and Christain, but this just didn't work.<br /><br />1/10
