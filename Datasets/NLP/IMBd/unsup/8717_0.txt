This is one of my favorite movies of the last decade. I went to see this in the theatre simply because I had never heard of it and the starting time was right. I had no idea what was in store for me. My companions and I left this movie in silence, each of us running the story back over in our heads. We talked about it for hours afterward, each of us enjoying different parts most. I have since purchased the video and watched it two or three more times, still loving it each time.<br /><br />The story of the red violin's journey across time and continents is fascinating and engrossing. The film feels like four or five films woven seamlessly into one. The feel for each country and time in the story is crafted beautifully, and the scenery is breathtaking. The premise of the story being told through a fortune teller's predictions is clever, and the flashback/forward method is well done here.<br /><br />The only real flaw in this movie is Samuel L. Jackson. Don't get me wrong--I'm a huge fan of his work--I just believe that he was terribly miscast in this role. He just doesn't fit. But for a few moments when his superb acting absorbs me, I am distracted by his presence. Unfortunately, there are many scenes where his acting is flat, at best. I feel that just about any other similarly talented actor could have pulled off this role more effectively.<br /><br />To anyone who has not seen this movie--what are you waiting for?!
