Hey now, this is one of my favorite movies. A woman living in an isolated house near the desert (in Arizona) is having trouble with housekeepers. None of them seem to stay very long. But every time a housekeeper leaves, a new tree gets planted along the driveway? Hmm. Well, along comes Ruth Gordon, who seems to have lost one of her friends somewhere along the way and this house is the last place of residence. So Ruth goes "undercover" as a feisty and weird housekeeper to Geraldine Paige (who fancies herself to be quite the goddess, I reckon, expecting the housekeeper to light her smokes and fix her drinks). Ruth though, is in cahoots with her nephew, the dude that played a doctor on Emergency eons ago. So while she's sticking her neck out, he's got her covered. Or does he? Hmm. Anyway, this is a VERY well done and awesome whodunnit, with more than a few creepy overtones. Anyone that enjoys the late Ruth Gordon will delight in this. Highly recommended!
