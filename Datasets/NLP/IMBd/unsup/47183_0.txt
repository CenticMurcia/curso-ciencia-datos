I won't pretend "Simon Sez" is a good movie, but being a fan of bad cinema, I have to admit that I really, really like this movie. This is the kind of movie you scoff at when you see the trailers on TV for it's theatrical run. You pass it by without a thought when you're browsing Blockbuster Video on a Friday night. But one day you'll be flipping aimlessly through your cable movie channels and that's when this movie will get you. If you're into the whole 'B-Movie' thing like I am, then what more could you ask for? Dennis Rodman in a leading role, a supporting cast that comes nowhere near respectability, and an absolutely mindless plot padded with a bunch of action, sex and bad stunt doubles! If you're bored one day and feel like watching a movie that makes you cringe and laugh for all the wrong reasons, then check this movie out. If not, why are you looking at this page anyway?
