Its a movie, which combines successfully made music with flash-back scenes therefore it affects the audience easily.<br /><br />It makes you laugh and cry at the same time, at least while you're watching the whole movie. Words are not enough for this one actually. It should be seen by anyone, not only the teenagers but the parents or adults.<br /><br />Thanks to all crew who made this movie. You made me think that the Turkish movie industry isn't over yet. Now I see, we're still able to make fantastic movies.<br /><br />In the conclusion; its a good movie, well, second thought: one of the best, I might say :)
