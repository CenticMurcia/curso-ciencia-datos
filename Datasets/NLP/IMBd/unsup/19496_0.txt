The poignant story and sarcastic representation of the life and moral values of the sub-continent's red light area is captivatingly pictured in this great movie.<br /><br />The movie underlines the stark facts that depict how a poor and young woman gets entangled in the evils of prostitution. The viewers are compelled to admit the follies and bitter treatment meted out to an innocent woman who ultimately resorts to find refuge in the filthy side of the world. By, coincidence, the most respected, wealthy and influential elite of the city also finds solace in the company of this woman. But something is common in both, i.e., they have been rejected from their homes and yearn to find shelter (physical for the poor and psychological for the rich).<br /><br />The song "Chingari Koi Barhke" is a classic masterpiece shrouding the excellent screenplay and cinematography coupled with heartrending acting of Rajesh Khanna who has proved that he is a SUPER STAR given his spellbinding screen presence. His brilliant and mesmerizing acting in the boat in a moonlit night speaks volumes about the subtle imagination of the director. The lyrics and music of this song can reverberate the emotions of even an extremely self centered person. Whenever, one watches this song ......one finds something latently vibrant which stirs deep inside the soul. The trio of Rajesh Khanna, Kishore Kumar and Shakti Samantha supercharged the movie with this magically hypnotic song. THIS IS THE HIGH POINT IN Indian MOVIE MAKING. Believe you me, the direction, music, acting and cinematography in this song is very unlikely to be equaled in near future, given the prevailing temporal, crazy, puerile, showy, cheap, vulgar and synthetic direction, acting and main theme of the movies.<br /><br />Some of the very subtle and bitter human values and sentiments creep at the climactic end of the movie underlying the quintessential lesson for mankind to "do good and earn virtue".
