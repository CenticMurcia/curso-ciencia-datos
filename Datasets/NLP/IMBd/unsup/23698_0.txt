The best thing about this movie is that its title is numerical, so it shows up among the first DVDs on Blockbuster's "New Releases" wall. That's how I came across it: the synopsis picked my interest, and I wanted to see more of West Hollywood where the story takes place.<br /><br />I had my first doubt as soon as I pulled the disc out: the artwork is an amateurish drawing, likely created by a friend of the production, and features 6 guys in a giant Martini glass... but wait, isn't that movie supposed to be about "10 attitudes"?<br /><br />Regardless, the movie was unwatchable in an Ed Wood kind of way--the only reason I stuck through the whole thing is because of the occasional laughs my friend and I got at some of the most "dramatic" scenes. In spite of a couple of witty lines that enlighten about 20 seconds of this 80-minute wreck, it remains a quite atrocious viewing experience sunk by porn-level acting, music and editing; a whiny and uninteresting central character; atrocious camera work; not to mention plot holes the size of Julia Roberts' nostrils.<br /><br />The team behind this movie should be commanded for making it all happen on such an obviously tight budget... but everybody else, save your $5, you'll never get this hour-and-a-half of your life back!
