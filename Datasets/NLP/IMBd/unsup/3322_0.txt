This is probably one of the worst films on Nam I've ever seen. So unorganized and unprofessional that is the guys I served with acted that way none of us would have came home.<br /><br />I like Michael Pare's acting but not in this movie. The writer should have gotten his facts straight or at least talked to some real tunnel rats. Even a unit in the Army that served in Nam didn't act that way in Nam. Not that I ever saw, but my time was in the Marines and not a chance did a Marine unit ever act like this movie portrayed.<br /><br />zadziks from Antarctica gave it a 10, he has no clue or is getting royalties from the DVD sells.<br /><br />Pure waste of time.
