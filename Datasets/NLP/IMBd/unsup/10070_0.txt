The adaptation of Francisco Iba√±ez's comics is, no doubts, impeccable. Perhaps some people won't like it as much as I did, but I had great fun with this film, since there is a very funny gags mixture, where there is something outlandish and nonsensical every 30 seconds, typical of Fesser's movies. I also have to say that things that look normal in the comics, may seem nonsense in the film, that's another component that I liked. As I said before, there might be people who don't like it because it has the humor of "Torrente", but the film is exceptional, especially because of the visual effects. It is important to point out that the DVD is for sale already, where there are 2 discs with the movie and tons of extra content, so if you liked it you shouldn't miss it.
