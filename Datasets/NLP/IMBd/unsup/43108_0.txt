i saw this movie yesterday and during my sleep i dreamed that bush was gone for real. today when i woke up and found out he's still alive and in office, i had the shock of my life :-) <br /><br />but honestly, this film was well meant and everything, but as always you get pointed in the wrong direction. bush is not going to die from some assassin unless his puppeteers allow that to happen, which is totally unlikely. don't worry, he will probably survive us all :-D <br /><br />the only presidents or high officials to die are the ones exposing or opposing their masters. JFK, Washington and the others who were assassinated had something in common? hint: it was NOT al-qaida or bin laden.<br /><br />stop falling for the deception and start looking for the common denominator.
