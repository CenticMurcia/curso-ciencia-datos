That's what this film is. It's a salty doughnut. Imagine, if you will, that it's a nice sunny day, you're at the seaside, and you start to feel peckish. You would love nothing more than a gorgeous sugary doughnut. Your expectations of this doughnut are very high, for you know the delicious flavour of a sugary doughnut very well; and memories of your childhood trips to the seaside come flooding back at the thought of this Godly doughnut. So you go to buy one. You lift it to your mouth. You bite, and slowly, realisation begins to dawn upon you. It's salt. You spit it out in a fit of disgust, stamp it into the ground, and throw the rest of it into the sea. The doughnut leaves you psychologically scarred, and your trip is ruined.<br /><br />I expected Right At Your Door to be quite good. I thought it would be a refreshingly new break from the norm; a film that didn't overly promote the indomitable spirit of the American citizen, and clog up its minutes with all-too predictable pseudo-patriotic government speeches. To be fair, the film didn't do any of these things. The problem is that it didn't do much of anything at all.<br /><br />Right At Your Door wastes no time in getting straight to the "action" (I use this term very loosely). The first 10 minutes introduce us to the main characters, a loving married couple living out their quotidian existence in an average house in an average borough of Los Angeles. The woman goes out to work leaving the man alone in the house, when suddenly, SHOCK HORROR!!, a series of so-called "dirty" bombs explode and release a miasma of noxious toxins and lethal micro-organisms unto the unsuspecting and unprepared citizenry of downtown L.A.<br /><br />For me to go any further would likely result in me being blacklisted for revealing a spoiler, but really, this film is so predictable, that such a term seems to become somewhat redundant. The main characters act as you would expect them to do given the circumstances in which they find themselves. Really, from the time the bombs go off until the last 5 minutes, absolutely nothing of interest happens. The bulk of the film consists primarily of utterly pointless dialogue, both between the main characters and two similarly useless secondary characters who serve no purpose aside from..no..wait..they serve no purpose full stop.<br /><br />Though the primary characters may be readable, the authorities at first seemed to symbolise spontaneity. Seriously, I was expecting the LAPD or something, but these guys looked and acted more like an ill-equipped SWAT team that were completely indifferent as to the lives of the inhabitants of L.A, which was at first quite intriguing, but eventually got boring and began to suffer from "I know what you're going to do at the end" syndrome.<br /><br />The acting was dire, as was the script, as was the direction. I dearly hope that the actors in this film fade into insignificance as quickly as is possible, and that everyone associated with the making of this film hastily follows suit. 2/10 is generous for me.
