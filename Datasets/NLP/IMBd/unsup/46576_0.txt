'Christmas in my Hometown' is standard Lifetime TV holiday fare. Tim Matheson plays a well-meaning, but out-of-touch business executive at a tractor manufacturing company to one of its factories in Athens, Nebraska to determine whom to fire as part of the company's plans to downsize. The small, good-natured town (which surprisingly (or not) has zero minorities) of course, relies on the factory to support their families, as well as the life of the town itself. Posing as a representative from a farming company needing to fill tractor orders, he gains the trust of the town and in particular, a woman (Melissa Gilbert) and her young daughter who buys his story, trusts him, and then, along with the whole town, shuns him when they find out that he might be cutting their job.<br /><br />Filled with lots of sentimental tripe, it is predictable family entertainment from beginning to end, and interchangeable as far as Lifetime TV holiday movies go. But, nonetheless, it is an innocuous little distraction when you just need to put up your feet and watch a movie that might make you smile a bit during the holidays.
