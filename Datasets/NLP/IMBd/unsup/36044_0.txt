With Shirley MacLaine in a variety of different wigs and costumes (and a large variety of co-stars in the cast including Alan Arkin, Rossano Brazzi, Shirley's "Gambit" co-star Michael Caine, Anita Ekberg, Vittorio Gassman and a pre-"Being There" Peter Sellers), I was terrified this was going to be a replay of MacLaine's all-star marital farce "What a Way to Go!" Not quite, as Shirley is playing seven different women this time, in seven short stories about love and sex. The opening tale involving Shirl in a funeral procession is very witty, but the other six seem to progressively lose steam. Not the tour-de-force MacLaine's fans were probably hoping for, it does have some cute bits and pieces but suffers from a muddy production and tepid handling overall. *1/2 from ****
