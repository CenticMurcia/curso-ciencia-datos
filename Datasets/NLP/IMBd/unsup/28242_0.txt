Now I wouldn't say this movie beat my expectations, but it fit my expectations quite nicely. The beginning to this movie was captivating, but after a while it starts to lose it's flair. However Astro Boy's flight and fight sequences were actually well done and was fun to watch. I just really wished this movie was in 3D and it would have been one heck of a thrill ride, after finishing this movie it felt like it was made to be 3D which was a disappointment cause it was not...Bummer, oh well maybe in part 2 or part 3 where they might title it "Astro Boy 3D". But since this movie has a lot of action in it, Kids will most likely have a blast and adults will probably enjoy it. But it's just generic, which is fine but the outcome in every scene felt a bit flat because of it, like if you seen the trailer you will probably get the whole story down, but some of the sequences while being predictable was cool to watch, so it's sort of forgivable. The animation seemed a bit weak even if it's based on a science fiction anime, but the musical score was awesome to listen to while Astro Boy does his thing. I have no ideas why they would get some expensive actors and actresses to do the voice overs, when they could have gotten legit voice actors/actresses for less money and spend more on the animation of "Astro Boy". The movie had it's moments but as a whole, it was not that satisfying when it was finished. It was good effort but had the potential to be much more.<br /><br />7/10
