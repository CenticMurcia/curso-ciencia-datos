This so called romantic comedy sounded somewhat promising because of its twist. However, it was not. The movie is pretty dull, boring, and the humor is far and in between. The actors and actresses tried their best, but they couldn't save this movie even if they gave Oscar worthy performances. Granted, the movie is somewhat interesting at points, overall it just was not made well. I would only recommend this to anyone who is a fan of any of the cast (main cast). Other than that, just avoid it, unless you are finding yourself surrounded by horrible movies. I rate this 4/10. Rated R for sexual content (note: this movie does not deserve an R rating. The sexual content is minimal and the nudity is brief).
