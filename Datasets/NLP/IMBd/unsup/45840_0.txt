Hard to believe this kind of movie could have such success ! I saw this as a kid and was appalled. I remember one scene when somebody shoots a machine-gun at Norris for two minutes and not a single bullet approaches him ! Worse for an action movie, the pace is snail-like and there's not an ounce of tension.
