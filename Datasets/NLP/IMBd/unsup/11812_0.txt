I enjoyed Travis' film about the attempt of an assassination on American President at a anti-terrorism conference in Spain. It features good performances from Quaid and Fox as well Whitaker. I liked the way the director approached the idea and it was a good entertaining movie for the most part. Don't look for too much substance or for it to make an out of the ordinary statement, but its a good action movie of its sort. I liked the cinematography by Amir. Mokri, and thought it was edited well too. Overall not an amazing movie, but worth watching. Good job by production team -IMDB Rating: 6.7. sdfkjsdflkjsdflkjsdf sdflkjsldkfjsMY Rating: 8/10
