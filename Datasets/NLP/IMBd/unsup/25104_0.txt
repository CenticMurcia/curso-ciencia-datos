I am a 42 years old male who's first VHS movie purchase was Terminator back in 1984. That should tell you what kind of movies I like, so when I tell you that my eyes watered up at least four times during this film please don't think of me as wimpy.<br /><br />When the teaser ran for this on TNT during a commercial break, I had no intention of watching it, and had intended to turn he channel. However, as I held the remote in my hand, fumbling to find the scan button, I noticed Mario Kassar in the opening credits and Carolco Films, (both instrumental in producing the first Terminator film).<br /><br />I am also a Tom Berringer fan as well so what the heck...I figured I would give it a chance. Five minutes into the film, I was so happy I did.<br /><br />I've read a lot of the other comments here, and a few have made some unfavorable remarks about Wilford Brimley's narration. I on the other hand, think that had it not been for Wilford, I may not have stayed interested. What many people don't realize about film is that if there is a lot of "back story", a narrator is typically necessary to fill in the gaps, and tie up loose ends to certain scenes.<br /><br />Hence, I had no qualms about Wilford's addition to the film. The only problem I did have, is at the end, he refers to himself in the first person as if he was somehow part of the story, yet it was never revealed which character he was, (a good guess would be he was the lead Deputy).<br /><br />As for the film itself, I found the entire cast to be believable, interesting, and lovable. As stated earlier, I was holding back tears throughout the film. By the end I was almost ready to start balling. Everything adds up. There are no loose ends, or mysterious "contrived" solutions.<br /><br />For example, in the first scene, a town's person tells Tom's character that his brother went into the woods years ago and never came back. So later when, Tom stumbles upon a stockpile of personal items and I.d.'s and some (Lumberjack) dynamite, of persons lost or abducted over the years by the lost tribe (in an effort to protect their way of life) there is nothing phony about it when Tom uses the dynamite to collapse a cave leading to the hidden valley where the Indian's live. It all makes for a great ending that doesn't make you go.."Yeah, right....sure" with a frown on your face. You instead cheer and weep for joy.<br /><br />I have not come across such a touching "Western" since Duvall and Costner's "Open Range". I also had a reminiscent thoughts of "Last of the Mohican's (Daniel Day Lewis) while watching this film, up until the point when I realize that this lost Indian tribe was more civilized than the law enforcement agency of the local town.<br /><br />I think the core reason this film such a great piece of art, is the irony. In the beginning, the film set me up to think there was something in the woods, almost supernatural. I was expecting to see ghosts, and Indiana Jones like spirits chasing Tom through the woods. But none of that ever happened.<br /><br />Once I learned that this film had something to do with Native Indians, the discovery of the Indians went from being understandably and realistically tense, to making me recall real life history of the native Indian, such as Little Bighorn, to sitting on the edge of my seat wondering if the film will end with another modern day massacre, or if everyone will come out of this alive.<br /><br />The growth of all the characters involved, even the dog "Zip", is astonishing, and something to admire as well. I am not kidding, even the dog had enough sense to know when he had it good. Befriending a little girl and having someone to play with, as opposed to waking up in a bar with Tom drunk out of his skull, was something cute to watch.<br /><br />I've babbled enough. Bottom line is...go rent or buy this flick today!
