All the people reviewing this movie don't get the fact that the point of the movie was to make you feel stupid for watching a movie like this. The preview makes it out to be a great thriller/horror movie but, ironically enough anytime in this movie there is any violence they just pan away and the one time you do they just take the whole scene back almost out of spite or just to annoy you. The whole point of the one OC preppy guy talking to the audience was almost to point out the director knew what you wanted to happen and more or less did the opposite. The end of the movie when they are all on the boat and they are talking about fiction and non fiction seemed to me like the director was explaining that in reality the way the movie was played out is the way it would happen in real life and not how most standard horror movies play out. This movie is like the strangers but worse the main characters do nothing to save themselves (nothing smart anyways) so you almost do even feel sorry for them and you don't care and sit there afterwords wondering why you watched this POS but in this movie i think that was the point, the director wanted you to feel stupid for watching it.<br /><br />REGARDLESS I HATE IT SILL.<br /><br />P.S. if you want to get a better idea of what this movie was really trying to say then read some of ther loved it posts there's some good points.
