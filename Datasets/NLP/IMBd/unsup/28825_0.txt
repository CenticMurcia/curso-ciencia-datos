Three women review their past lives while they wait for news that will change the future totally for one of them.<br /><br /> But it isn't "Letter to Three Wives"!<br /><br />Putting aside the shameless use of the formula from Mankiewicz' masterwork, "Three Secrets" is an enjoyable, well-written drama. Another similarity to "... Three Wives", and one that I have no objection to, is leads Patricia Neal, Eleanor Parker & Ruth Roman being mature, extremely attractive women; not a teenybopper or nymphet in sight.<br /><br />A second movie that came to mind while watching "Three Secrets" was "The Big Carnival" with its media circus of cynical reporters covering and exploiting a disaster. However Wilder's film followed this one.<br /><br />The beautiful Cole Porter tune `I get a kick out of you' is well used on the soundtrack.
