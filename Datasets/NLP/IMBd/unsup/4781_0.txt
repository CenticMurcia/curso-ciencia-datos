even on it's own, the woods was a pretty satisfying horror movie: it was dark, the dialogue doesn't pain my ears, and the ending totally doesn't suck (though i'm not too sure how it made sense [?] still good though), and there weren't any bad performances! <br /><br />but the thing that really surprised and delighted me was Bruce Campbell's turn from his usual wacky schtick to a straight performance! i mean, i love Mr. Campbell, but i never actually realized that he CAN act! when i found out he was in this movie, i was expecting a cheesy cameo, but i was happy to get much much more than that. also, another important thing about a good horror: Agnes Bruckner and Rachel Nichols are not bad at all to look at!
