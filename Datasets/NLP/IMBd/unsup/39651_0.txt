I saw this alleged film when someone on a forum linked to it as "something creepy that will give you nightmares." I knew nothing about it, and when I saw it, my thoughts were: "That's not too bad for amateur internet stuff." Ya know, you see so much random stuff on the internet, I just figure a couple of guys thought:<br /><br />"Wouldn't it be bitchin' if we took Alien Autopsy, combined it with The Blair Witch Project, and set it to your cat chasing a laser pointer across your old Casio keyboard?"<br /><br />"Dude, that's so awesome! You ever try tequila in a bong?"<br /><br />Then I come here and find out this is some kind of professional production by a legit industry professional, and hear words like "genius" being tossed around.<br /><br />Oh my.<br /><br />"Rubber Johnny" has maybe 15 or 30 seconds of (marketing hype word warning) "creepy" imagery in it, repeated AD-FREAKIN'-NAUSEUM over a five minute or whatever running time. Those 30 seconds of "disturbing" "creepiness" are examples of two forms of lazy film-making: 1. Our unease at seeing a deformed person, in this case one that's naked, in a wheelchair, apparently in distress; and 2. Heavily filtered, unfocused, shaky camera work and motion blur combined with abrupt editing and the use of noise-bursts to shock you -- a gimmicky clich√© more often associated with "reality" shows on the Sci-Fi Network than with, say, something anyone would actually want to watch.<br /><br />Hitchcock used the shock-audio/abrupt-editing technique to great effect in the shower scene in "Psycho", but he was pioneering it, and that scene lasted only seconds. Just think how much impact "Psycho" would have had with 30 or 40 shower scenes! It positively makes your skin crawl, doesn't it?<br /><br />Even taken as a music video, it's not anywhere near as (yawn) "creepy", imaginative, memorable or compelling as old Tool videos. And the music is forgotten as soon as the thing mercifully ends.<br /><br />If you want disturbing imagery and general weirdness, watch David Lynch's "Eraserhead". While it's not the masterpiece some claim, the sophistication and maturity of that nearly 30 year old movie are light-years ahead of this forgettable bit of internet debris.<br /><br />My final verdict: It's not too bad for random, amateur internet stuff -- but not nearly as good as Retarded Animal Babies.
