if you're looking for a fun independent movie then give why we had to kill bitch a try. i first watched the movie with a friend who had seen it at school, and she loved it so much she shared it with me. both of us own the movie on DVD because we enjoyed it so much, and have in turn showed the movie to others who have also enjoyed why we had to kill bitch.<br /><br />wwhtkb is funny, witty and if you're like me chances are you know people just like the characters in the movie. why we had to kill bitch will keep you laughing, and perhaps even giggle at somethings you might not normally giggle at. the movie really has a great ending, that will provide some more laughter. round up some friends and go ahead and watch it. i look forward to more movies from nickel.
