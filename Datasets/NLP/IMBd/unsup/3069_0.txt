Honestly guys this movie the Mechanik has to be one of the most boring and pathetic movies i have seen in a while. I don not know how other people can rate this as a great revenge movie, it's cheap the acting just was so bad, i think the Wiggles could have done better!!!! This movie could have been so damn good only if the acting was better and had a lot more action. I must admit though that it had a good tag line but that's about it. I think only one man could have changed this movie around would be John Woo for the Action!!!! Beyond all honesty i would not recommend this movie to anyone, for the simple fact on how bad the acting and action scenes were. You would think that by reading other users comments that this sounds like a great movie but believe you me it's not. Better wait until it comes out on TV and then watch it.
