This is a low budget movie and it has it's flaws but I liked it because of the way it showed how loneliness, alienation and a bad upbringing can turn a man from being a quiet introvert into a peeping tom and then a murderer and then full blown insanity. Laszlo Papas has the unfortunate habit of mumbling his lines but maybe this was done so to deliberately display the ostracised nature of his character. If so, my apologies to Mr Papas. Belle Mitchell, who previously had appeared in House of Frankenstein and The Beast With Five Fingers, also stars as the landlady of the boarding house where the title character stays.
