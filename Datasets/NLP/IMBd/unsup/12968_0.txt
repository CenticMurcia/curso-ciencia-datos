I was watching this with my friends on a cold Christmas night, we were flipping through the channels and low an behold we stumbled upon this little gem.<br /><br />For starters we are presented with an all-star cast. Kal Penn, Jonathan Bennett, Donald Faison and the fat kid from Angus brilliantly portray what it would be like to go through the ULTIMATE Vegas adventure. The plot starts off rather simple as we are told that a group of guys are going on a trip to Vegas and bought the "Ultimate Vegas Bachelor Party Package". Well if simple means complex then this movie is simple. And if this simple means simple then this movie is NOT simple.<br /><br />The supporting cast is reminiscent of an Oceans 11 movie. We have Big Pussy, Chuck Liddell, Jaime Pressly, Daniel Stern and Kathy Griffin giving some very impressive performances. You are all wondering how what the heck are all these celebrities doing in this movie? Well if I told you then it would take all the fun out of the movie ;) The musical score in this movie treats you to a John Williams type experience as if you are listening to the Indian Jones theme for the first time. The way they incorporate the metal music with Chuck Liddells screen time was beautiful. Also I have to add there a twist at the end of the movie that even Rod Serling would have never guessed. Think Twilight Zone for Bachelor Parties 4 out of 4 stars
