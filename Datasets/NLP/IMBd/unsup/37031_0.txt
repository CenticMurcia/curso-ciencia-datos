John Landis combines with funny men Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd to bring us a rather silly film about two misfit secret service men who are assigned a very dangerous mission. In fact, unbeknown to them, they are decoys who have been thrown to the wolves.<br /><br />Our two leads do manage to create some funny moments, but they never really hit top gear in a movie which is consistently average. Both Aykroyd and Chase have been better, and both have had better material to work with I'm sure.<br /><br />Look out for a very funny cameo from one of the world's most loved entertainers. A definite highlight.<br /><br />Friday, April 30, 1993 - T.V.
