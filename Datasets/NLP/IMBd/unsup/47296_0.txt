Its barely a one out of 10! The movie was a complete disaster! The acting was watchable I'll give it that, but the entire movie was just too out there. I mean, this guy running around with an X Men style weapon.....nobody finds that just a wee bit on the stupid side??? I don't mean to offend anyone who likes this movie, but I am only stating my opinion. I've never read the novel that this movie is supposed to be based on, but according to other comments by other watchers, it was nothing like the movie. In my opinion, thats one of the worst thing a director can do to a writer. It makes me upset when they take a writers work and completely change the story to draw an audience. This sort of thing happened in Maeve Binchy's classic "Circle of Friends". It was a great book, then when was made into a movie, the story changed. The ending was even changed. Anyway, I don't mean to rant. In a short; "I've Been Waiting For You" is a great example of a terrible movie.<br /><br />~kolohehele
