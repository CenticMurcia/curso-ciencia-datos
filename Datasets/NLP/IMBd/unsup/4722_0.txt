<br /><br />This was a decent enough romantic comedy for the most part. Kate Hudson's performance at times conjured images in my head of Jan Brady, and I found that particularly amusing. However, the ending was a train wreck. I would have expected the female protagonist, a professional journalist, to realize the irony of her situation and react more maturely. I suppose that such an ending wouldn't have been exciting enough, so they went with an overblown Hollywood-style ending complete with a decidedly odd public confrontation.
