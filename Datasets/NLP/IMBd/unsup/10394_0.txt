The short film itself was an interesting concept. Unlike normal films that are meant to tell a story this was a well constructed film to ask very basic fundamental question. Security or Liberty. It's Nothing new, "The man who trades freedom for security does not deserve nor will he ever receive either." - Benjamin Franklin<br /><br />This isn't some crackpot theory that conspiracy theorist are trying to pull on anyone. These are the same rights that Americans fought and died for this is there Consitution, laws that over the years citizens have taken for granted. This film might not be realistic but the idea behind the way it trys to show the viewer exactly what one can loose by giving up ones rights for freedom. If you were arrested today for any crime you could use the rigths that were given to you as citizen of your country with the exception of terrorists. Terrorists? what are they? you might come up with an image of a Muslim man as viewed in the film. But this is mistaken perception "the patriot act" doesn't say inclusive to only Muslims it says Anyone who is against the government plan.<br /><br />If you don't believe me then just goggle "The Patriot Act" actually read it, they don't hide anything truly Orwell would be rolling in his grave at this bill. Also if you can get a hold of a German History Text book, and read the laws in acted during pre-WW2 Nazi Germany Era, they created there own Patriot Act, and finally introduced the gestapo. Secret Police to arrest anyone who was Ploting against there own government. <br /><br />We are all in a world of trouble and the players involved at the highest levels are never what they seem. I suggest for anyone who is interested in learning somewhat of the real truth visit Question911.com they won't show any of this in the media.
