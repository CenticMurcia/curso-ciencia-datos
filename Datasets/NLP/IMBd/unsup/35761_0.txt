Green Ice is a caper movie that was made long after the caper movie was in fashion. To say that it is a belated addition to its genre is an understatement. It has an attractive trio of leadings actors in Ryan O'Neal, Anne Archer and Omar Sharif, but they don't seem overly impressed with the material and turn in workmanlike performances at best. The film reeks of indifference.<br /><br />The story has American electronics expert O'Neal visiting Latin America and being recruited into a scheme to steal emeralds from a Colombian consortium. In true caper movie style, we get to see the plot as it is hatched and the subsequent robbery as it is put into motion.<br /><br />The attractive locations serve the film well, giving it a pleasant backdrop. However, events in the foreground are less attention-grabbing. The robbery sequence is OK, and there's a half-lively fight at the end, but these are scant pickings compared to the better films in this genre. The story never really builds up to a head of steam. It just ambles along without urgency, and the few enjoyable moments there are come and go all too quickly. The supporting performances are generally bland. This is basically a missed opportunity and a rather dull way to spend your time. If, for some reason, you're absolutely determined to see this film then do; if not, don't go out of your way to find it.
