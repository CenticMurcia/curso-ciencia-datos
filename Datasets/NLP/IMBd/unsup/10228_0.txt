When i fist heard of this movie, I thought what stupid movie, how could someone name this move a horrible name. And i thought i was going to be disappointed. Boy was i wrong.<br /><br />The plot is very Simple and easy, some guys rob a gaz station in the middle of the night, and then go back again to rob it, but find out the moneys not there this time. Leaving our 4 bad guys in a situation they must find and gather money in any means possible, while getting into some strange events , which turn out to be some great highlights for the film.<br /><br />The movie is very fun and mixes the Action/Drama/Comedy together real well. While some parts are a little silly and cheesy, and there are still goofs this makes for a nice movie to watch and keep in the collection one you could watch over and over and still be able to laugh. I definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of crime capers, like Snatch and Pulp Ficiton.
