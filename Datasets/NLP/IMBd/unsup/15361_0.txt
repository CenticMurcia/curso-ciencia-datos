An absolutely superb movie.<br /><br />The performances were believable without a doubt. Perhaps this is just coming from a male's perspective, but there is no-one in this movie you cannot relate to. Watch for similarities with "American Beauty", and, to a far lesser extent, "Cruel Intentions" and "American Pie".<br /><br />The cinematography is spectacular. Each scene's camera angle, lighting, et al, increase the mood tenfold. The ending is how all Hollywood movies should be. No wonder this one isn't.<br /><br />Issues with the amount of smoking and drinking they do, but then again, who didn't at that age? No gratuitous sex or violence, although rather large portions of both.<br /><br />Overall: ********/**
