I first saw this movie at a young age and it had a great impression on me. In this movie I saw where a man was willing to sacrifice himself for the common good, and the laws of democracy eventually prevailed. Also, years later, this one man's stand and dire predictions for the future all proved true. There was one time in the movie where the Army's top brass retired to the briefing room. In this room, it was discussed about whether or not to exclude certain testimony given in this trial. One of the commanding officers spoke up and declared that our legal system, even our society, is based on the fundamental right of a man to have the ability to prove his innocence.<br /><br />I am sure that there are some in the military that would challenge this movie because of the "going against orders" thinking. I have been in law enforcement for twenty (21) years and I know the importance of taking and giving orders. However, there is a time and place where questioning or going against orders to save someone else's life, or many lives, is appropriate. In closing, this movie hits this topic head on, deals with sacrifice and honor, and I think that any youngster twelve (12) and older needs to watch it.
