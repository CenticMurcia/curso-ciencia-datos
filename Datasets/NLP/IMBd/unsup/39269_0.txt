Four men with little or no acting skills pretend to be gangsters in this brilliant comedy.. oh thats right, its meant to be serious.. I forgot.. utter cheese from start to finish, bad acting, bad casting, bad movie.. was it filmed on a handy-cam? do yourself a favour and don't even borrow this film.. It will be a waste of your time. I want the 2 hours of my life back but its looking like a lost cause.. If you want to waste some time do anything other than watch this film otherwise like me, you will be left angry and vengeful.. <br /><br />Why would you waste your time making a movie this bad.. Its like a bad rip off of pulp fiction and reservoir dogs but lucky for them its so bad that Tarantino wont be suing them because he will be laughing so hard.. and why stop at robbing 500 million dollars? why not make it a billion billion dollars, or all the money in the world? don't give up ya day job fellas! hey did these guys write 'Hoboken Hollow' by any chance?
