I was really looking forward to see this movie. I saw the trailer and was ready for a real treat with Owen Wilson's comic character.<br /><br />It started out alright but never took off. This was an empty movie that leaves you empty, gives you nothing and leaves you wondering why the Hell this movie was made.<br /><br />Spiritual journey my ass. Nothing is spiritual about it. They are constantly smoking or getting high on both upper and downers. But that's to hide the fact that the movie has nothing to give. They are empty characters that are never fleshed out and the drugs don't add any dimension to it either. It just falls flat.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this movie and am deeply disappointed to have watched such a waste of resources on such great actors.<br /><br />The pretentious feeling of Life Aquatic is still there but this time no Bill Murray to save the day.
