This was a very pleasant surprise and an unexpectedly cool movie! I had never heard of Venus Wars before and I think it's a shame that the flick hasn't got more recognition, because it really is one good film. The action sequences are spectacular, the characters are interesting and the animation is fantastic. The dubbing on my version was actually not half bad although I would have preferred the Japanese version.<br /><br />Venus Wars is an original and very entertaining mix of over-the-top battles, politics and a love story, stylishly directed with both traditional animation and live action blending seamlessly. Top it all off with a soundtrack from Japan's answer to Dokken and lots and lots of gunfire and you have this fun and imaginative anime which deserves to be seen and recognized.
