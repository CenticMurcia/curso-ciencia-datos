I've "watched" this movie twice on SciFi Channel now. Both times I end up getting some badly needed household chores done around the condo, because this movie just doesn't hold your interest. It sounds like a compelling enough premise: genetically altered ants are transported into a city skyscraper and terrorize some unfortunate souls who got roped into weekend duty in the building's offices/lobby. It's just a very slow, suspense-less movie. And if it's going to be slow and suspense-less, you need interesting characters. These characters are as dull and lifeless as the movie. There aren't even any hot actresses (one of them is reasonably attractive). Finally, you can't even say this is a 2004 homage to the '50s cult classic "Them," because the ants are actually not really that big (about the size of a medium-sized dog). And since you never see more than three of them at a time, and they show no evidence of spitting poison or some other otherworldly power, you just feel like everyone in the movie ought to be able to beat the s*** out of these ants anyway and just go home.
