I enjoyed the first HSM even though I thought I wouldn't since my kids are in college and the Disney Channel is something I rarely watch. When I read that the second installment was going to be on Disney, I decided to tune in. Well...what a pleasant surprise! I think I may have enjoyed this more than the original- I have always been a fan of the Disney films from the animated features to The Parent Trap, but I am so happy that they have kept the tradition of 'family films'. Any family could sit and watch this delightful movie without fear of inappropriate scenes or language, how refreshing- Maybe some of the situations are predictable, but who cares...the story and music is still very cute and entertaining! I think this is an adorable movie that the whole family should see!
