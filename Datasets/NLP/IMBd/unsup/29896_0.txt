Dan Chupong, the star of DYNAMITE WARRIOR, would give even Tony Jaa a run for his money (and a film featuring the two of them together would no doubt rival Bruce Lee's showdown with Chuck Norris in WAY OF THE DRAGON for one-on-one action). Chupong, as the rocket-riding hero, has outstanding direction by Chalerm Wongpim to thank for making him look so good. Leo Putt as Lord Wang brings some much-appreciated comic relief to what in lesser hands could've been an overly-grim slug fest of the "mechanical martial arts" variety (wherein the standard katas are performed by actors whose expressions never change). DYNAMITE WARRIOR is a superlative blend of super-heroic feats, Thai martial arts techniques, and magic. There's a schizo sorcerer, a monstrous, man-eating henchman, jumping monkey and leaping tiger underlings, spectacular stunts that need to be seen to be believed (Jackie Chan would be impressed) and rocket-riding. This one more than lives up to the promise of the trailer. A ten-plus. We may very well be seeing a new Golden Age of Action Films.
