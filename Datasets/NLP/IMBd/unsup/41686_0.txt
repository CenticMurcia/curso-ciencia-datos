A group of plumbers use their vacation time to inspect houses that are claimed to be haunted by ghosts. The audience follows them through the houses with their technology and expertise, leaving us to be the judge.<br /><br />I watched a few episodes of "Ghost Hunters" on a recommendation from a friend (who believes in ghosts, although his girlfriend doesn't). I was told it was pretty spooky and that it might show me that ghosts were possible. I don't think him and I watched the same show.<br /><br />Two men are trained as plumbers with no scientific background. They use such devices as thermometers and video cameras to detect ghosts. I heard them say things like "it's cold here, must be where the ghost entered" and "I feel really scared and uncomfortable in this room". How is that in any way convincing?<br /><br />The evidence was really nothing special, either. A cold room means there's a ghost? I'm not sure what that's based on. A flash of light is a specter? A bad feeling is a presence? The closest thing I saw to any ghost in this show is a door that opened and closed on its own. Nothing floating, no voices, no spirits. Just a door that opens and closes, which I didn't find very impressive. Doesn't air pressure do that in houses all the time?<br /><br />If you believe in ghosts, you might find this show pretty amusing. If you don't, I don't think this is going to be the kind of program that convinces you. There were some good moments as far as drama goes -- they are very soap opera-like in how they deal with girlfriends -- but the actual ghost hunting is rather weak.
