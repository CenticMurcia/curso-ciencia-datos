3 out of 10<br /><br />The weight of water has a wonderful photography work, really amazing takes, and it's perfectly filmed. However, there's still a problem: the plot is the most boring and poor script, this kind of movie could have!<br /><br />I try to classify movies as they manage to get what they want, example: John Woo's a better tomorrow is far better than The Matrix, just because, even though a better tomorrow is just about nonstoping action, unfolds in its essence something deeper, and it amuses at 100%, meanwhile The Matrix, tries to get you into a new level of action cinema, tries to do a more reflective exercise in the audience, and that's something impossible to get just by splatting on, between gun shots, the basics of the Platon theories (the myth of the cavern).<br /><br />When adding this theory to The Weight of Water, I just found a HUGE LACK in interest, thrill or drama. As The Matrix, the plot tries to get the movie into a new level, but it falls far deeper than the Wachowskies film. The reflection comes from the monologues/voice off of the characters, but the action is so simple, that makes that reflection a giant JOKE!! From the first 10 minutes of the movie, you can fairly guess the end, and found myself predicting a walkthrough of the movie. However, the whole movie doesn't stink, there are parts of imaginary flashbacks from one of the characters, that are quite interesting, but doesn't succeed in keeping the interest for the movie. The acting is pretty good, but in comparison with the overall story, makes a very funny reaction (I found it more a comedy than a drama).<br /><br />If you are interested in very beautiful Norway-like landscapes and ain't worried about the plot, watch it, at least you'll have a few laughs, if you're time is worthy, then pass out and better watch a Kitano movie.
