I must say give the filmmakers and cast credit for making a sincere effort to bring a relevant social drama to the screen. It is also good to see such films that would otherwise be overlooked get made with limited funding. Nevertheless, "LIft" is proof that an adequate screenplay, a capable cast and a worthy subject manner do not always turn into good movies. Much of the action is stilted, and the dramatic scenes are ruined by amateur directing and theatrical acting. The film feels forced and there are plot twists which seem to come straight from "Guiding Light." I think, however, films like this need to be viewed and studied for those of us who are chasing the unicorn that is filmmaking. On paper, and perhaps even in the editting room, this may have well appeared to be a good film. Alas, a good recipe and the right ingredients do not always guarantee a good pie. Just as there are films which would have seemed awful in a board room but turned out quite good, this one simply falls short but a worthy effort nonetheless.
