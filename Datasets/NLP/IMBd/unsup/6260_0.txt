I rented this movie with no knowledge of the film or the comments here only the brief summary on the back of the DVD. I was glued to the screen through out the entire movie. It drew me in got my interest, peaked my curiosity and then left me hanging. There were so many questions left unanswered that it makes me hope and want for a sequel or at least a website with the back stories. I hopped online as soon as it was over to try to find the answers that i so desperately wanted from the movie. Why was the doc killing himself when he knew the consequence of alchol? why was his wife so angry with the two guys? What happened to the one that did not make it? and on and on. I think another 15 minutes would have been sufficient to wrap up the loose ends. PLEASE LET US HAVE THE ANSWERS WE SEEK!!!
