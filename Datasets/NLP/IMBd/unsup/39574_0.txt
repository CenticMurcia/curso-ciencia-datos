I've long hated this film. For a long time I only owned Lethal Weapons 1,2 and 4 and only bought this because it was dirt cheap and people always moaned at me for missing it out, even though they understand that it is a rubbish film.<br /><br />Shane Black is gone, in fact he walked away from Lethal Weapon 2 when they refused to make it as dark as he originally wrote it. But at least Riggs and Murtaugh were still Lethal Weapons, THAT was the whole point in the films being so called right? Lethal Weapon 3 might as well have been called 'Inoffensive Family Friendly Safety Weapon'. There is hardly any action in this and what action there is is nothing more than very, very boring and unimaginative gunfights. There is not a drop of blood and without the not so abundant f-word there is no reason for this not to be a PG-13.<br /><br />The bad guy is weak. I'm not kidding you there. His ultimate goal is not world-domination or to seize control of the drug cartels or holding the government hostage. No, Mr Lethal Weapon 3 Bad Guy wants to...build a housing estate. Well, if that ain't the most vilest of all evil plans I've heard of. Sheesh, what a bad man, he truly deserves to die.<br /><br />The lame plot about the stolen guns is a thin excuse for Richard Donner's anti-NRA propaganda (he used to be a member but turned his back on them in disgust around this point). As well-intentioned as this may be, it doesn't belong in a film called Lethal Weapon, especially when you consider the gun violence in the 2 previous movies.<br /><br />They try to make it funny, into an action-comedy. But it's absolutely rancid. The witless, irritating dialogue is overwritten and annoying and Joe Pesci's character is in desperate need of a slap. What is with the blonde hair and earring? A lot of this film could have been cut down, at 121 minutes the anorexic plot long outstays its welcome. There are just so many pointless scenes and distractions. The subplot about Murtaugh (the character is supposed to be 55 but Glover was only 44) retiring is just done to death and it's so slow. What is this? Some family drama? And am I the only one who's noticed that EVERY character says 'sonofabitch' about a million times in this film. Plus Danny Glover shouts 'RIGGS' every 5 seconds. And don't even get me started on Michael Kamen's rubbish score. The saxophone thing totally overbears on every scene and becomes highly distracting. And when he's not using this completely inappropriate sound he's nicking music from his own Die Hard score.<br /><br />It's because of movies like this that Last Action Hero got made.<br /><br />The new 'Director's Cut' DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a faultless picture. The Dolby/DTS 5.1 soundtrack is loud and forceful but hardly dynamic. There are no interesting features (not that I care). The R1 DVD comes in a horrid snapper case but the R2 is a sturdy keepcase.
