This was a decent movie, but the one thing that annoyed me the most was that the phantasm was hardly in the movie. The phantasm didn't try to kill batman, and it didn't take long to figure out who the phantasm was. It also didn't seem like a very big challenge for batman either. I was hoping for batman to finally meet his match. I didn't get that. Joker was also the only villain we know in this movie. There just didn't seem to be any surprises in this movie. Just a movie filled with flashbacks, action, and batman moping about his parents. All batman movies are the same. Batman begins is like this movie, but it's better. This just seemed like another generic batman movie. Go see batman begins.
