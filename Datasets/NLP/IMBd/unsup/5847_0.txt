In my honest opinion, I believe that a person who gets lost in his/her own little world can suddenly find salvation without even realizing it.<br /><br />That's what it was like for me, my salvation came to me in stages, and this was the very first one.<br /><br />My Mother had passed away a year after this film came out and I had not taken it very well, not very well at all. For a year, I went into complete solitude, intoxicated night after night, day by day.<br /><br />But in August 1999, something happened to me. There I was, sitting on my living room floor, drunk out of my mind. Too drunk to get up and retrieve the remote control that was just on the other side of the room. So, I laid there, on a single mattress, slobbering all over myself like an idiot. <br /><br />The Television was stuck on a free weekend premier channel, so I watched whatever came on. If I didn't like what was on, I would pass out drunk, only to wake up later and start drinking all over again.<br /><br />Even though I had a few moments of sobriety during this particular binge, it still never occurred to me to pick the remote which was still in the same place.<br /><br />11 PM rolls around, I'm drunk again, and that's when I heard Robert Duvall saying a prayer in the opening scene of "The Apostle" From that moment, I was hooked. By the time the movie ended, not only was I sober, but my mind was made up to begin what turned out to be a four year journey that eventually lead me to where I am right now.<br /><br />October 15, 2003 was the day I became Born Again, and my life has gotten better and better ever since.<br /><br />For those of you out there who feel lost, sad, confused with how your life is going, or if you're just interested in a good character study, or even if you're just a fan of actor Robert Duvall, watch this movie and I promise you, it will change your life as well.<br /><br />And That's All There Is Too It....
