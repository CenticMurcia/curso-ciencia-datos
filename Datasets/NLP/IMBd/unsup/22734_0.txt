I think there will be a diversity on how people view this film. The story is slow, and there are many songs in it which extends the movie even further. The acting in this movie is excellent. Especially Ranbir Kapoors, his acting is wonderful. It's different than the 'typical role' men play in Indian cinema. If one likes poetry, they will indeed enjoy this movie. Basically, the movie is about Ranbir trying to win a women's heart throughout the movie. However, the climax in the movie is weak, but, the movie manages to pull it off. I don't recommend this movie for people who didn't enjoy movies like Devdas, Black, Kamoshee, or those types of movies. It's a different story, very emotional, and touching.
