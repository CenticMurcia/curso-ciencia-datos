Angus, this is one of my favorite movies. It has such a good story, and the actors were picked perfectly. The first time I saw this, I was amazed! I said "That was great." The story of being brave and living with the life you have taught a good lesson. Charlie Talbert Was great for Angus, as was George C. Scott for Ivan. Ivan was part of the comedy, as was Troy. James Van Der Beek was perfect for Rick Sanford, and Ariana Richards was well-picked for Melissa. The story made me think. I liked how it was through the thoughts of someone who was unpopular, and was picked on and had jokes played on him. I liked how his Grandpa told him to "screw em!" And I also liked at the dance how Angus told Rick off, that was a good scene, and the rest of this movie was just as well, filled with laughs, and pity for Angus and Troy. This is a great movie to see. I definitely recommend it for anyone! 9/10!
