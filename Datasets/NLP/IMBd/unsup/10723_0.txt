This is much more than just a camp movie and great songs and production numbers, although it is all that. It does a great job of dealing with a number of important issues for today. One of these is the challenge of a profession in the arts. I loved the way it dealt with all of the issues it raised. For all of the criticism from the other reviews, I found this movie did a better job of raising all of the issues it raises and getting me to think about them, but more from a personal standpoint, and not from so much of a societal standpoint. We each have a role to play in each issue and we each have the challenge of deciding what we are going to do with each. Part of it is understanding other people. This movie showed a lot of different people and the importance of respecting all of them, even if what they are doing seems to have obvious problems.
