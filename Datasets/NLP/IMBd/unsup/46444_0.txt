STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /><br />When he was very young, Sean Davidson (David Bradley) watched his karate champion father get brutally gunned down by a bullion thief. Years later, under the guidance of a typically Japanese master, he himself has become a martial arts master. He finds himself invited over to a Caribbean island to compete in a martial arts tournament where he meets series veteran Curtis Jackson (Steve James). Together, they must team up to battle an evil drug lord into genetic engineering-and ninjas.<br /><br />Dudikoff's out, Bradley's in, only for the last time in the final part of the AN series. But, if the last two films weren't really much to write home about, this is the dampest squib out the lot of them.<br /><br />The plot is just an unimaginative, apathetic rip-off of the last film. James, in sadly one of the last roles I ever saw him in, applies a fairly charismatic presence to the proceedings, but Bradley isn't up to much as the main hero. A cool 80s soundtrack and some good fight scenes makes things a little better, but really not much. *
