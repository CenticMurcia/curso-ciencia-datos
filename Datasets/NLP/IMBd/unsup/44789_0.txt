It's unfortunate that a film with a good cast never really becomes as good as it might. The idea of women working during the war in the war production plants was critical to the war effort, and the attempts at coping with an almost unbearable life situation with women workers sharing a house while their husbands are overseas was common enough to have true dramatic value; yet, this movie never seems to reach its high potential.<br /><br />The reason seems to be in the incredibly poor script, not so much in terms of plot, but in relation to what seems to be substandard language. It's unfortunate that the actors are saddled with such lines as: "If I see you looking sideways at another girl, I'm going to hit you over the head with an axe handle," "It's okay, mom, he's going to marry me," "Why don't the mice pay their share of the rent," "You don't carry a mop length-wise...you carry it like a fishing pole," and "I'm going to beat those rugs until they sit up and yell 'Uncle'."
