Writer Melissa Bank has been compared to Helen Fielding (the author of Bridget Jones' Diary) because of her skillful and funny portrayal of the challenges and problems modern women face.Her short story collection The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing received very good reviews and it was immediately acquired for being taken to the big screen.Unfortunately,at the difference of Fielding,Bank did not have any luck for finding a screenwriter who would effectively translate her "voice" to a movie.Suburban Girl is a truly tedious romantic comedy.<br /><br />This movie is an absolutely insipid combination of Sex and the City and Bridget Jones' Diary which has absolutely uninteresting characters.Besides,Mark Klein's direction is horrible because the movie completely lacks of any style,rhythm or natural flow of scenes.<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar does not help at all with her artificial performance.I have been a big fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer,and I think that there was a perfect combination of character and actress in there.But,on all the movies she has done after Buffy,she seems to be lost,like we can see on this movie.Besides,she does not have a good chemistry with Alec Baldwin.In summary,her weak performance damages the movie pretty much.<br /><br />I honestly suggest you not to invest your time on this tedious and completely uninteresting romantic comedy.Instead,read the book or do something which makes a better investment of your time and money.
