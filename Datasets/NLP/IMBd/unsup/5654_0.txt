Although the plot is rather ordinary, this film is generally much better than most blaxploitation entries, thanks to hard-hitting direction, powerful performances (Kotto is a standout), thoughtful script and multi-dimensional characters. However, it is recommended only to those with strong stomachs, since it is exceptionally violent and bloody. (***)
