This is a horrible movie. They make the Muslim family look like they are bad people. This movie makes the American family look like they did not do anything wrong. First of all Jason should not even mess with this family to begin with. He disrespected her family. They are a royal family. This is a very bad movie because Muslims should stay with Muslims. Americans should stay with Americans. As you can see, they divorced in the end. The Muslim royal family are trying to protect their daughter from the American. He took her away and did not get penalized. He should of been sent to jail for life. He married her in a stupid chapel in Vegas (SIN CITY). The Muslims should have disciplined Mariam before she came to the country of America. Now she went from being a princess to an American divorced girl. If she would have married a Muslim, she would stay married. She did the wrong decision. It reminds me of the movie "Not without my daughter." Another bad movie, she was acting so stupid. She stole the kid and ran away. What a bad women. People make her a star. How ridiculous!!!!!!!
