The location was a poor choice, and this ruins the movie right off the bat. I live near the area where Roger's Rangers once roamed. Fidor should have done a little research. Most of the trees are deciduous...maple, birch, oak, beech, alder...with some evergreens mixed in. Nice views in the movie, but there are no snow-capped peaks in Vermont during the summer(the retreat depicted in the movie took place in Vermont). For that matter, the historical retreat did not take place in summer, but in fall (October). The part that made me laugh the hardest was the pile of lizards for the wilderness stew. There aren't any lizards in the Vermont woods...lots of snakes, but no lizards. Major Rogers would not have let an unbalanced comrade in arms run off into the woods to die. He was fiercely protective of his men, and this nonsensical scene is not historical and does Major Rogers a disservice. Perhaps Fidor meant to convey the harshness of the life, but this scene reveals his complete misunderstanding of who Rogers was and of the brotherhood that characterized the Rangers.
