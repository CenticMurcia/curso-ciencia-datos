Professionally acted, directed, filmed, and well-written "Gold Rush" movie set the standard that others have copied but never topped. Dietrich is impeccable, actually better than her great performance in Destry Rides Again. Scott turns out to be surprisingly stretched with a touch of seldom-seen whimsy. Wayne, of course, take a role he is perfectly cast for, and makes it better still. Samuel S. Hinds and Harry Carey give standout performances among a uniformly excellent supporting cast. The stunt works and the fight scenes are enduring classics not soon forgotten.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, the Spoilers should be considered as much of, or more of, an essential John Wayne classic performance and movie that must be seen by any fan or student of Wayne and his movies than other over-hyped films from later days, such as The Searchers and The Alamo. To watch it is to enjoy it.
