*********Spoiler******************* The Secret of Singapore Sling is revealed! I saw this fine masterpiece of modern post-morbidness and cracked open the perverse brain candy shell to uncover the hidden meaning.<br /><br />The big clue is when the mother and daughter discuss the rules of servants. If you look up the 3 laws of Robotics established by Isaac Asimov you will discover the similarities between "robots" and "servants."<br /><br />1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br /><br />2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br /><br />3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br /><br />The women talk about "servants" following laws like these. They are really talking about how THEY too are "servants" (aka robots) trapped by these rules.<br /><br />Now take note of the women's spastic movements and bizarre speech patterns. And the Singapore Sling character.. he spends a lot of time motionless and never speaks.<br /><br />They are all robots.<br /><br />They are robots struggling to re-enact the Laura storyline (from the classic movie released in 1944) so that they can learn about humanity.<br /><br />As robots they do not understand things like nuances in speaking.. natural human movements, and human sexuality.<br /><br />A further clue is when they are eating. Robots cannot eat! Thus they force food in, and then regurgitate that food back up. Without discomfort except for the regurgitation process itself. And they do not realize how this is not standard eating behavior.<br /><br />And finally, Singapore Sling "himself" is seen rusting... asking about water supposedly. No he was telling them that he had become wet from the outside and his lips were rust covered. Look closely, those are not swollen lips that need water. Those are rusted lips that needed to be polished and cleaned.<br /><br />The woman does not pee on Singapore Sling, she tries to kill him with water released from a valve because she does not know what else to do.<br /><br />If you watch Singapore Sling with this secret uncovered, it becomes a movie that makes sense, and you can delight in seeing a story about robots trying desperately to re-enact a movie they knew about, to try to learn to become human. The water outside and in the pool is the constant threat that keeps them trapped inside.<br /><br />The tragedy is that a robot cannot become human and thus at the end Singapore Sling decides to bury himself and deactivate instead of living the lie.<br /><br />Watch it again with your Isaac Asimov books hand, and enjoy it for what it is... a fascinating study of humanity as seen from an alien perspective.
