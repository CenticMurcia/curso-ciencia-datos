This film is about a man who is afraid of sharks. He decides to work in a marina so he can put himself in as much danger as possible with other marine life.<br /><br />One day, a gigantic rubber shark decides to enter the park to see the sights and stuff. Brody Junior realises this and spends the rest of the movie in the water.<br /><br />Anyway, after all the nerve biting tension and thrills, the shark is destroyed and they all live happily ever after in 3D.<br /><br />It's strange how a film can claim to have three dimensions when every character in it only has one...<br /><br />This trashy, thrown together mess is an embarrassment to the series. How far we have come from great dialogue, great performances and iconic thrills to this piece of nondescript tosh.<br /><br />Then again, it was directed by Alan Smithee's uncles cousins brother in law, twice removed. So the results were inevitable.
