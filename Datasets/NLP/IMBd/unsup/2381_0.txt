I cannot believe all of the bad reviews that this movie is getting! It is clearly the best sequel in the whole series! It may have had a bizzare ending, but it left you to come up with your own answer. Like one great philospher said, "When the end is upon us, that is where the beginning may arrive." I have my own answer, but I could go on for hours about what I thought the ending meant. Great movie, great sequel, long live the tall man!
