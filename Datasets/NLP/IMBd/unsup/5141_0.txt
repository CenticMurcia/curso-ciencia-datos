Purchased a DVD with three (3) films and this film was one of them, so I decided to see just what this film was all about. Earle Edgerton,(Tom), Judith Resnick (Laura) and Martin Barlorski (Dan) all made just this film or maybe two after this production. The star of the film was Burt Young,(Gimpy),"Nicky's Game",'05 who is a great character actor and is presently making great films. The background has scenes from Coney Island, Brookly, N.Y. and even Nathan's Hot Dog Stand is shown with Gloria Spivak,(Dumpy Gal) who made only this one picture and faded out from stardom. All I can really say it was a Big Joke to watch, horrible horror film and it made absolutely no sense at all. Oh, I forgot to say if you like lots of Teddy Bears to hug, there are plenty in this picture.
