10 Attitudes!<br /><br />This is by far the worst acting performances I have ever seen in a movie. These actors ineptly try to portray gay life in L.A., but with laughably bad dialog and very unconvincing performances they accomplish to make a movie that is essentially un-funny, un-touching and unfulfilling to watch! To top that of the direction is in my best judgment not existing, the sound is very badly recorded and many times it is very hard to distinguish the dialog from the background noises. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the idea is okay and I think that in the hands of someone more capable it would have turned out to be a movie worth watching!<br /><br />I would recommend this film to no one with a pulse and a measurable IQ!!!
