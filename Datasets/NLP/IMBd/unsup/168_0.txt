This is an astoundingly good movie.<br /><br />I'm neither a big Claudette Colbert fan nor one of Orson Welles -- I find her usually too cloying and chick-flickish and him too morose and self-important -- but they are fabulous together in this wonderful film. The characters treat each other with great respect and dignity, the dialog is marvelous, sensitive subject matter like war is dealt with honestly and non-ideologically.<br /><br />The "triangle" of Welles, Colbert and Brent is very good. Added bonus: Jarrod Barkley from Big Valley in his first role (he looks exactly the same 20 years earlier).<br /><br />I don't know why TCM gave this only two stars. Perhaps it's not trashy enough for their devolving ethos...<br /><br />Ten Stars!
