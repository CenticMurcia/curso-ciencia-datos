This is the made-for-tv pilot for Miami Vice, a cop show which made popular chain smoking and wearing shiny suits without socks. <br /><br />The pilot begins with a flashback, explaining that New York cop Ricardo Tubbs (Phillip Michael Thomas) comes to Miami seeking revenge of the "Columbian," a drug czar which becomes the man behind many of the Miami DEA's investigations and the guy responsible for killing Tubb's brother. Soon to becomes his partner is Maimi Vice undercover cop, Sonny Crockett (the gorgeous Don Johnson), an honest cop with a collection of badass sports cars and an alligator named Elvis. In the pilot, Tubb's and Crockett's on-going investigation into tracking down the Columbian exposes inter-agency corruption. Even if you have not seen the series, this is a good movie in itself as a just a cop/crime/mystery movie. It's harmless 80s fun.<br /><br />This marked the beginning of a popular television show that lasted five years (1984 to 1989). Unfortunately, the second Miami Vice movie, Miami Vice II: The Prodigal Son (actually it was just a collection of the shows) which takes place in New York (and this second movie model the scenes for Glenn Frey's "You Belong to the City," which appears on the Miami Vice soundtrack and Frey made a few appearances as well).
