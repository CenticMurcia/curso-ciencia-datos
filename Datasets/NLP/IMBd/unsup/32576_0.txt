Barry Levinson is a clever director. Mr. McAvoy is a clever actor/screenwriter. In this case they combine for three wonderful ideas that would carry a short story or a half-hour sitcom episode marvelously. There is not enough here to sustain a movie, however. So after the first half-hour, An Everlasting Piece runs out of steam and attempts to reach the finish line with smoke and noise. A movie that begins combining wry whimsy and clever wordplay with offbeat characters quickly degenerates to a laboured farce that plays like a three stooges marathon.
