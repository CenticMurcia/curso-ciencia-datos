I like Sean Astin and Vinnie Jones but they could not save this film. There is little if any explanation as to how the Time Travel device works, the actors just throw out the terms String theory and worm holes. Astin says he shaved a rat and sent it back and it came back harry... Who the hell did he send it back to, himself who didn't know the rats was shaved? The dialog is written for a comic book and there are so many small logic mistakes it really distracted from the story. There is also this spinning camera effect used during the gun fight and in the bus bathroom which is nothing more than distracting. I hope Sean Astin doesn't become the next star to finish one of the best movies of all time (LOTR) only to end up making crappy B movies like this one.
