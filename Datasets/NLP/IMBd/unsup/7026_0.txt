Well about the plot and the characters, you'll just have to see, it is fairly well done movie, lots of good scenes, although some bring up thoughts of deliverence , but don't come close to 'Squeel like a pig boy'. Anyways Good Movie, makes you think what family will do for you. But don't take my word. See it. Good waste of time like most films.
