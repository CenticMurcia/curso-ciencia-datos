I would gladly give this show a 9 except that I can't stand the Ulles.<br /><br />This show is a masterpiece, traveling the globe, hitting as many fun points as they can pack in to a small TV segment. Watching it in HD makes you feel like you're there and makes me want to travel so much more.<br /><br />However, the husband/wife team that have been selected to follow leaves something to be desired. While I'm pretty sure they were selected to represent the "typical" traveler, that's not entertaining on TV. I want my hosts to have some incite, some fun facts, interesting stories, deep reflection. The Ulles just think everything is "amazing" or "cool" or "wow". And the wife is afraid of heights, yet about half the things they do require heights and she just exclaims how scared she is every time...and how happy she was she ignored it after they're done. Ugh. After the first 10 times you'd think she'd learn.<br /><br />Ditch the boring unlovable couple and keep hitting amazing destinations.
