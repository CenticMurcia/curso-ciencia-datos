It's good and well worth seeing if you have some free time. The special effects wasn't the best, but were quite good in places. The acting of the main villain wasn't good and was sort of letting the rest of the film down. He was trying to do an accent but wren't pulling it off at all. I liked this because it has a goo story and the acting of Patric Stuart was superb, he was the real hero of the show. I think that the show is let down by the advertising, I saw it as a two-part mini series what what used to fill the time slot. It deserves more than that as it is good, but sadly not everyone thinks so.<br /><br />It's a good story and well worth watching, even though it was mildly let down by the acting. I fully recommend it and you should look out for the brilliant acting of Patric Stwart.
