I had watched this movie years ago and for some reason I taped it. I watched it again recently and wondered why I taped it. I do love vampires but there are guidelines for vampires such as not walking around in daylight. These guys (and girl) do that.<br /><br />The main good vampire is Jonathan Hancock (I'm thinking Harker) and the villain vampire is Vladimir (I'm thinking Dracula) and they look and talk totally different. Vladimir has his Dracula accent (sort of). Anyway near the end of the movie you find out they are brothers. Brothers!! I didn't know Dracula had a brother!! Wow!! You find that out before Jonathan kills Vladimir. I do like it when Jonathan cries after having to kill his brother. That was touching.<br /><br />My favorite line in the whole movie is "You don't want to live forever, do you?"
