Freakazoid was one of the best, albeit underrated, cartoons of the 90s. If I could find it on tape/DVD somewhere, I would buy it--no second thoughts. It was original, random, and absolutely hilarious. It breaks my heart when I drop a Freakazoid reference and no one around me gets it. I want my children's children to be able to see this show. The plot rarely matched up with anything else that had previously happened in the show, and that's what made it great. The villains were bizarre and neurotic, most notably The Lobe. Anyone else remember the Norm Abrahm episode? Genius. Freakazoid was also chalk-full of random catch phrases. I still catch myself saying "Ah nut bunnies!" from time to time. If you're unfortunate enough to never have seen Freakazoid, find an episode or ten, drop what you're doing, and watch. You won't regret it.
