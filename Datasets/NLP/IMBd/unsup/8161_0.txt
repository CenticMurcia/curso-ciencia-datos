I just watched this movie seconds ago, I waited for the DVD release so that I'd be able to re-watch it as often as i want.<br /><br />Disturbia is a "thrill-of-your-life" story about a teenage boy named Kale who lost his dad in a car accident. After a year, he was sentenced to three months house arrest after punching a teacher in the face for making a comment about his recently deceased father. He began spying on his neighbors after days of boredom. All hell broke lose when he began to suspect that his neighbor is a serial killer. He gets his Asian friend and a gorgeous hot babe involved with his investigation, and soon the dirty old man, a.k.a. the suspect, realizes he's being watched... Then.. I don't feel like telling everything here... so watch the movie! This movie is very intriguing, I mean, what if we DO have a killer as a neighbor... Wouldn't that freak you out? This movie is not too scary or hair raising type of thriller but it is a MUST-SEE-MOVIE... I recommend it!!! So enough with the reading... and get a copy of this or whatever... flip it, put it in you player.. boom baby... just let it move you... and in the end... you'll just tell yourself... "What a great movie"
