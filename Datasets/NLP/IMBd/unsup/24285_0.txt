Robot Chicken is the 2005 series made my awesome comedians Seth Green and Matthew Senrich. The show is 10 minutes of what is available on the television from spoofs on reality TV to the discovery channel. The show is fantastic for its random and clever humour that has made it famous and liked all around the world. The show has maintained itself in the 3 seasons it has gone for and while not going for long has shown great potential. This should go down in the same line as Family Guy and American Dad and while it will not win any Oscars (It has won awards though) it is a worth while show. Overall the show is great and I hope it goes on for years to come. The show has just reached 50 episodes and I hope it gets to 100. I rate this show 84%.
