This "movie" is just a joke. It leaves out all of the completely damning money evidence. The evidence presented for the Nortel money was completely left out. The defense attorneys looked foolish and even incompetent when cross-examining the prosecution's witnesses.<br /><br />While this is fascinating in that people actually believe that he is innocent, it is in no way a balanced look at this trial. The defense manages to put up a smoke screen that might work in California but it certainly will not work in North Carolina. As it is 2010 now, he still sits in prison and will remain there for quite awhile. I don't know what this director though he was getting into when he made this movie, but he did do a very good job in making a case to the completely uninformed.
