Talk about stretching the truth... this pseudo documentary is just a bunch of news clips and rantings, where common knowledge is presented like some big mystery nobody knows. This Alex Jones guy is as wacko as they come. The best part of the whole thing was when he thought up the genius idea that cartoons are brainwashing the youth of America and then showed a clip from the buzzlight year cartoon, of buzz getting an eye scan for ordering a pizza...absolutly hilarious! another thing, I never heard anything about the swat team killing kids at columbine, your the first person to mention this, I'd really like to know where you got that nugget of information. Micheal Moore did a 2 hour documentary on the tragedy and didn't mention it once, maybe he is in on this whole tyranny thing to right... or maybe its because your a liar.<br /><br />No really they are out to get you alex, big brother is watching you, and I hope to god that they stop religious gun nuts like you from making money off shoddy journalism and horrible tragedies ever again. shame on you and your bulls***.
