This movie is absolutely incredible. It essentially includes every crap and clich√© about "badass Americans" (Go! Go! Go! Shoot! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!) Approximately 1/3 of the movie takes part in pubs in meaningless macho pilots discussions "who had bigger balls", "who has bigger balls" or "who will have bigger balls" (including pretty blonde - which is actually pretty intelligent - and she is general's daughter too - and she is amazing female Apache pilot - of course with some stress syndrome which makes her somehow less usable than real U-S-A macho pilot). Approximately 1/3 of movie scenes do have BIG U-S-A FLAGS in background with big U-S-A talks in foreground ("terorists" making fun from "flag-wavers", letters of dead soldiers pathetically read by officer and such patriotic-anger inducing crap). The last 1/3 of the movie consists of explosions and poorly animated Apache sequences. It is very strange for such hyper patriotic movie but it seems to be pretty anti-patriotic sometimes as officers do smoke Havana cigars (isn't it still illegal in US?). The pilots seem to be pretty inept too, because multiple Apaches are shot down with RPG-7 which is actually anti tank-short range weapon. It is pretty hard to hit helicopter with something like this, essentially the target must not maneuver at all and shooter must be very good too. These "U-S-A" ace pilots do fly like sitting ducks and are constantly shot down with bunch of guys with wool hats, AK-47s and RPGs. Let's hope these terrorists never get hands over actual anti air weapons, or the "U-S-A" is doomed I think... Well this movie seems to be parody of itself. I think it was written by some anti-American leftist propaganda intellectual, as it is really poor, stupid and technically complete inept. No, I do believe no American is actually so stupid and inept as these "U-S-A heroes". I do hope that filmmakers have been used as practice targets because this is really an incredibly huge insult to Apache pilots.
