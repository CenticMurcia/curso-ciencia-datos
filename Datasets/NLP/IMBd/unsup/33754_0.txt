They left soon after. I should have too.<br /><br />All I can say about this film is a perfect cure for insomnia...show this to a chronic insomniac and they will be out like a light in a couple of minutes.<br /><br />An A-list cast should have turned out something much more interesting than this bore-fest. Thank god I haven't read the book...
