Sometimes there are movies that just don't deserve to be called movies and sometimes there are cameramen who just deserve to be shot. By some weird twist "Route 666" isn't a movie and it's shot by a cameraman who should aim at something else with a tool that looks nothing like a camera. I guess you already know the what I mean so I will start the review here if it's OK with you. OK? Good.<br /><br />"Route 666" is an abomination that suffers from being a bit more abnormal than it's low budget flick companions. Why? Well, I guess it can have something to do with the retarded storyline, horrible actors, useless FX and the cameraman who makes the "action"-sequences look like something that's been filmed from a washing-machine during an earthquake. I could start picking at every little fault that "Route 666" suffers from but I don't have the time. Just don't watch this movie okay?
