This film was well designed, produced and implemented...<br /><br />The actors playing all the characters were well selected and did a magnificent job in this movie...<br /><br />This film may seem ordinary and living in a fantasy to the western world but it is quite factual..<br /><br />Working for the Takhur is common and fearing him is even more true...<br /><br />The film displays corruption as it is happening in India, it is very visible, everybody knows who is getting bribed, why they are getting bribed and who is bribing who... ...this is quite different from the western world, were bribes are issued but are rarely seen...<br /><br />This film touches on a hard subject rape and I would say paedophilia... This film makes you wanna sit up and watch this film without moving a muscle.<br /><br />Omp Puri or takhur, tries to justify the act by saying the whore never gave them any and because the were intoxicated they could not tell the difference between a 9 or 90 year old. Rape has no excuses!<br /><br />There are some issues of how Sanjay Dutt really managed to kill all those people but I'm content ignoring that... it is a Bollywood movie after all.<br /><br />Superb performances and great delivery and end product. Well done!
