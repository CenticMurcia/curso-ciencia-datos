When I first got a copy of this film I was so excited. A film shot in my area, by a local film group portraying a realistic group of problems and people. Instead I was treated to yet another Cocknee Mocknee crime film, the same as all the others to be released in the last few years (except with even more silly running about, badly filmed gun fights and many many jokes from The Simpsons) Rarely have I found myself laughing so hard at not just bad acting/script/directing (take your pick) but also the preposterous presumption that this is what present day London was really like. The writer has obviously never travelled the streets at night or picked up the local paper to see the harsh reality of such a crime ridden area. The last two-bit crook I had the misfortune to meet wasn't a likeable cheaky chappy. Still it did make me chuckle a couple of times, laugh once and cry lots when after ten minutes discovered it still wasn't over...
