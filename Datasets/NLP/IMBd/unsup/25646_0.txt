This movie has little to recommend it. The characters look and act like people from the Eastern Suburbs transported to the West (where is Melldale? No guts for a real suburb? Villawood and Merrylands are some filming locations). The writers of the film script obviously are not in touch with the Western Suburbs of Sydney - and it would be a gross over simplification to homogenize it all under the label WEST.<br /><br />The film is very negative, full of negative characters which do not reflect the hard working folk of the "West". Another reviewer, ironically, suggested a movie script for Easties ... as if a decent movie wasn't possible about the Western Suburbs - which are more diverse and multicultural than the relatively homogeneous Eastern Suburbs.<br /><br />That said, the movie is interesting as a fantasy in its own train wreck sense - the characters spiral into darkness and despair, get murdered, suicide or end up in jail - though is this all the West can lead to? (I, a proud Westie, along with Harry Kewell, must be an exception) One senses the writers have an ax to grind.
