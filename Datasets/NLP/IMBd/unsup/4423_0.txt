This is really not a good film. B minus maximum, but I think its more of a C film. The story and the actors are no good. Although the director seems to have seen Star Wars numerous times (or why the hell are the dwarves running around like monks for). Also this is banned in Germany (what for?) there is just a bit of blood and no gore. This really is an enormous piece of crap. One or two laughs though.<br /><br />To people interested in the story: (SPOILERS AHEAD) This film is about a graveyard dude who crunches dead people to a height of 3 feet, revives them and then uses them as slaves in some sort of 'other galaxy'. Think that is a great story? Then rent this. (SPOILERS END)<br /><br />4 out of 10<br /><br />(Oh yes did I mention that the effects totally suck (from a 2001 point of view. For 1979 they were great, but as the film is bad, this really makes the film worse. In a good film bad effects do not matter that much.)
