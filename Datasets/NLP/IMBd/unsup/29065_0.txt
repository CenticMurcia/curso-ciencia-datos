Cowboy Bebop has proved to stand the test of time, for myself at least, and keeps getting better with each run through.<br /><br />Set in a futuristic world where there are colonies throughout the entire solar system, Cowboy Bebop tells the stories of the bounty hunters, or "cowboys," that reside upon the ship the Cowboy Bebop. Our main character is Spike Spiegel, a very suave character who doesn't seem to take life too seriously until you start to dig into his past with the infamous "syndicate." Next in line is Jet Black, the owner of the Cowboy Bebop who used to work as a police man and is now a bounty hunter just trying' to get by. He's another cool cat who's the wise and "aged" one of the rather motley crew. Then there's Faye Valentine who seems to have the most interesting story in that she can't remember her past at all until she finds a few lost artifacts from her original time. Then there's the comic relief: Edward the hacker and Ein the data dog.<br /><br />Combined, this posse seems to have some of the strangest luck and it's told beautifully throughout the episode. The way it's told, it seems to have an amazing knack for conveying some pretty deep ideas in a rather playful manner. Nothing that I can think of can really compare to this style.<br /><br />What really takes Cowboy Bebop over the top is the music. Yoko Kanno masterfully blends jazz, funk and a hint of rock to really add to this atmosphere Cowboy Bebop creates. I've actually bought a few of the OSTs, a fine addition to anyone's CD collection.<br /><br />If I could, I'd give this anime a 9.5/10, but unfortunately I can't do that on IMDb, so I gave it a 9.
