I was given some old videos and this Mascara was with them, i just put It on and really enjoyed the whole Drag and Transvestite theme, with The Lovely Eva Robin's as Peppa.... watch and enjoy something a little Different from the normal every day films.<br /><br />I didn't expect to see such good actors as Michael Sarrazin and Charlotte Rampling in a movie of this theme but they play the parts very well and convincingly.<br /><br />For me Eva Robin's portrayal of Peppa was touching and I felt great sorrow for the character and found her strangely intriguing.<br /><br />Murder mystery and a Love story with a different theme what more could you ask for?<br /><br />I would say give it a chance and you will enjoy, but if you don't like the drag and transvestite theme then steer well away.
