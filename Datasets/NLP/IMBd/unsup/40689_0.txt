I used to like Robin Williams. As time has gone on I've come to realize that perhaps I don't very much. When he's funny, he's hilarious. When he isn't. . . it's embarrassing. And CLUB PARADISE is one of the worst films he's made, which is saying something. It's hard to imagine that something so bad could have been directed by Harold Ramis (usually a rather reliable director/writer).<br /><br />The cast all look awkward and the jokes are forced and unfunny. I think CLUB PARADISE is probably one of the only comedies I can think of that doesn't even really entertain on some sort of level. No, it's not totally awful, but it's not amusing which is a huge flaw for any "comedy." 1.5/5 stars
