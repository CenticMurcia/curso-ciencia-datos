Excellent film. Shows the realities of abortion and the trials and tribulations of the women who had to endure these situations. True to life and accurate depiction. Hopefully will help others to understand why some women choose to abort. It is not a decision made lightly or without conscious. And the film depicts how important it is for abortion to be legal. How even when it is illegal it still happens.<br /><br />Very educational. A definite must see. Especially for those unsure of how they feel on this issue.<br /><br />Excellent casting. Very emotional plots.
