This is Cecil B. DeMille's third picture on extramarital relationships, following 'Old Wives for New' and 'Don't Change Your Husband.' I haven't seen the first one, but 'Why Change Your Wife?' is just like 'Don't Change Your Husband,' except the roles of wife and husband are somewhat reversed. So, if you like this film or that one, I recommend you watch the other. On the other hand, it's too formulaic, predictable and cheap for me. The light humour is enjoyable, including the witty intertitles, but otherwise it's too fluffy and superficial, just as with 'Don't Change Your Husband' and many other DeMille flicks.<br /><br />An exception to the light mood is the excessive climax. Additionally, Thomas Meighan is lacking as an actor; for instance, in the opening bathroom scene, he glances towards the camera or director. It's too quick to be breaking the fourth wall, so for whatever reason that's in the film, it's a poor reflection upon Meighan and DeMille. As well, Sylvia Ashton plays the wise observer to the play, as she did in 'Don't Change Your Husband'--she's our surrogate. And, once again, DeMille expresses his fetish for exotic clothing and lush interiors. For a while, DeMille might have become a good filmmaker; he made this picture after that.
