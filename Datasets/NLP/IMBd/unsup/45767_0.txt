Greetings again from the darkness. This is the garbage we get in January. Ridiculous "thriller" from director Gregory Hoblit, who has a string of elementary psycho-thrillers: "Fracture", "Hart's War", "Fallen" and "Primal Fear" (the best of the lot). In "Fracture" Hoblit managed to waste Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling, so there was little hope with Diane Lane and Billy Burke.<br /><br />In Hollywood, success breeds imitation, but it helps to throw in a little creativity. Borrowing from "Silence of the Lambs" and the "Saw" series, this one just substitutes a psycho-cyber killer played by Joseph Cross ("Running with Scissors"). Hmmm, let's see ... which is more intriguing, a brilliant, clever and playful world-famous psychiatrist who out-thinks the FBI or some young techno-geek played by a Doogie Houser look-alike? Please.<br /><br />If that's not bad enough, instead of Jodie Foster battling her inner demons while chasing Hannibal Lechter, we get the always beaten-down Diane Lane and her cohort played by the lifeless Billy Burke (who, by the way, seems to be this generation's Jeff Fahey). Shortcuts and gimics rarely combine to generate a world-class thriller. This one isn't even worthy of its Portland location.<br /><br />Tom's son, Colin Hanks gets a grown-up role as an FBI agent and Mary Beth Hurt gets to raise an eyebrow and roto-til a garden, but the only real point of interest here is Lane's daughter played by Perla Haney-Jardine, who real movie lovers will recognize as BB Kiddo from "Kill Bill Vol 2).
