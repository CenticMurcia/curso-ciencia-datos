Aside from being a total rip-off of the Halloween series (escaped mental patient returns home; a sibling is attached in the plot line; the killer wears a mask and coveralls, doesn't talk, appears and disappears, gets purposely rammed by a car, etc), the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the whole crazy hitchhiker part; the main character escapes by jumping out a window), House of 1,000 Corpses (the neon lighting and the whole "horror ride" setting, the hitchhiker looking like Baby and wearing a cowboy hat and having an annoying laugh), the movie itself was clich√© to hell! I was able to say lines before the characters because it was so obvious where the story was going (i.e. "they were my cousins"). I was also able to say, "insert tedious cheap scare... now" and it would always happen. The script was awful! The characters were saying the cheapest one-liners and moronic high-school dialogue that I had to wonder how it got greenlighted. Someone else wrote that it reminded them of an episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark - and it really did! The reason why for me was because it seemed like little more than a cheap Canadian kids sit-com slightly vamped up with some gore and a few breast shots. Did it seem a little strange to anyone that the whole ride was connected to a few wires? I mean, flip one switch and you have endless fog, strobe lights, music, etc? The ending was obvious too. Did the same people make this that made that Gawd-awful Canadian TV version of Carrie? I'm disappointed Christopher Young's name and music were attached to this. Looks like that girl from the Sopranos and the kid from The Sandlot have nothing to look forward to in the way of acting careers, although it wouldn't surprise me if there was a sequel, what with the way it was all set up. Hey Lion's Gate, I want my money back, and how about paying royalties to John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper and Rob Zombie while you're at it?
