Fabulous Movie. I suggest watching this cult epidemic in order too, and yes you either love it or hate it!<br /><br />Many well defined and colourful characters all with a key role in a movie that just keeps you glued to the screen. Many great one-liners too, a definate must see, although perhaps not your average family movie!
