This movie starts out with Steven McKray ( Casper Van Dien ) wanting to go to Africa to investigate a series of Shark Attacks near a remote village called Port Amanzi that has scared the town's tourism and driven fishermen out of business. As our hero visits an old friend, Dr. Miles Craven located in the town he learns his close friend Marc Desantis was killed by a Shark.<br /><br />Steven McKray a expert marine biologist learns that Marc Desantis sister Corinne Desantis ( Jennifer McShane ) is also in town and meets up with her at the Hook & Net bar where they meet hostile fishermen, who blame American scientists for the Shark Attacks. They soon both find out that Marc Desantis might not have been killed by a Shark after all and both begin to investigate.<br /><br />This movie is more about Steven McKray and Corinne Desantis looking for the reason why someone killed Marc Desantis and why sharks have turned so violent in this remote village called Port Amanzi. The director in my opinion should have focused more on the shark attacks because in the movie there isn't enough to satisfy the audience, even though the sharks shown in the movie are actually real and cool to watch, the movie lacks any thrill or scary moments when the main cast actually comes face to face with the sharks.
