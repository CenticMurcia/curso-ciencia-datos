I really love this simple, unforced comedy about a boy named Gregory (John Gordon Sinclair) who falls for a straight talking female footballer named Dorothy (Dee Hepburn). That's it. That's the set-up. Director Bill Forsyth, who also wrote the script, populates this, his second feature, with characters we can relate to so easily that watching them trip over their hormones makes us care and feel embarrassed for them.<br /><br />Forsyth's first outing, "That Sinking Feeling", also gave us very real characters and placed them in situations not far removed from the everyday. The director's third feature, "Local Hero", added a dash of surrealism to the naturalism.<br /><br />For me, though, "Gregory's Girl" strikes the most perfect balance and is never less than highly engaging. The director's use of small children is wonderfully surreal, as are his characterizations of various school teachers, a soccer coach and Gregory's almost invisible dad. Robert Buchanan, who plays the lovable Andy, also appeared in "That Sinking Feeling", and here turns in an unaffected, terrific performance as a horny youth who longs to travel to Caracas, Venezuela, where -- it's a "well known fact!" -- the women seriously outnumber the men.<br /><br />The film's resolution is appropriately low key and Sinclair's comic timing is textbook stuff.
