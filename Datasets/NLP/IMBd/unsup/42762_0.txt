I have seen this movie in about 1988 or 1989. Typical 1980's bullshit. Apparently one tried to get some success out of a plot very similar to "The Delta Force", another patriotic piece of propaganda. Don't get me wrong, I don't like Arab terrorists at all, but the typical black and white portraiture of demonic Arabs and oh so heroic Americans is too silly. Well, the typical audience in the Reagan area probably liked it. Unfortunately those 1980's "The-American-Heroes-go-in-and-smash-those-Arab-bastards"-flicks got some timeliness in recent years and might even find some new audience that wows on it.
