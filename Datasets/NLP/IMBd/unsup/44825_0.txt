I bought this film cheap and boy am I glad I did. I don't think I'm including any spoilers by telling you it's the story of a mummy who wants to come back to life and spends the best part of 90 minutes trying to do so. The film is full of people you kind of know from other things, and I spent a much more lucrative time looking them up on Google than I did watching their performances. There's really not too much to say about the film - it's supposed to be based on Bram Stoker's novel, but there's no coherent story here. All the characters seem to be in different stories, and I don't know why it has an 18 certificate (except for a slightly explicit sex scene at the end). The horror is incredibly underplayed and every time you think the film is leading up to something, it shies away at the end. A dull horror film - can there be any worse? It's the kind of film you and a few buddies might enjoy whilst splitting a pizza and a few bevvies, but it's not even up there with the really good bad films. Lou Gossett Jr chews the scenery a bit, but even he seems to know he's in a prize thanksgiving turkey. A case of take the mummy and run methinks.
