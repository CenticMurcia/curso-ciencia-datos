That's a reverse scale to mean that it is so awful that it is actually fantastic. So my score of 1 means it is super entertaining. Get this: Tony Curtis's girlfriend finds a little lump on her back that ends up being a psychotic Oompa Loompa American Indian Shaman. Totally inept and unintentionally funny Exorcist rip-off, but sooooooooo dang funny. The Vista in Hollywood is actually showing this thing as part of a "So Bad It's Good" film festival on March 30th at midnight and apparently Stella Stevens is going to show up to say hello and impart some anecdotes. I think I will be checking that out...on the big screen where it belongs, baby....
