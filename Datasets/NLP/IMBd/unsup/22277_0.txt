The capable Raoul Walsh directs this wilderness drama with his usual aplomb and crafts a perplexing plot packed with puzzling twists and shadowy mysteries. Pursued is something of a New Mexico film-noir: a psychological thriller fought out in the prairie lands and rural country more commonly associated with straight rootin', tootin' Western shoot'em ups. The location aside, Pursued resonates more as a family melodrama and mystery film; something that the visuals and looping Max Steiner score rigorously reflect.<br /><br />Bob Mitchum is down in the mouth and down on his luck here as main-man Jeb Rand. Rand's a blighted soul saddled with a hazy childhood trauma which reappears in nightmares of gun flashes and twinkling spurs (I'd be perturbed if I had hallucinations of a pair of dancing cowboy boots...). Rand's rambling story is rolled out in flashback taking in the main overbearing threat to his life (someone wants our Jeb dead), family disputes and several other consequential unfortunate incidents. The sad eyes and lazy look of Mitchum are sort of appropriate for this kind of movie, and the story is further strengthened by the solid support cast of Teresa Wright, Judith Anderson and Dean Jagger.<br /><br />Pursued is a bit confusing and is a little lacking in punch, but it makes for an engrossing, unusual Western watch. The noirish elements and Jeb's tragic background and emotional obstacles make the movie more effective and add interesting angles to the action. It may be convoluted, but with the Mitchum on form in front of fantastic backdrops, Pursued is a prairie potboiler that's worth making a pass at.
