At the time this series was released in '94, I was 14. Most of my friends didn't like the show, but I did. This was a show that seemed as if it was well thought out, the writing scored huge points in my book. I really enjoyed seeing Robocop on his downtime or with a virtual friend (Diana). The show was interesting to watch and what kept me coming back each week was not the violence, but wondering what new wisdom the cyborg would hand out. With as much terror in the world, it's nice to see an alternative measure. I believe this show could do really well if produced today. I think a reunion episode is long overdue. <br /><br />If you enjoy quality television with great writing, then this show is for you.
