I watched this movie on ESPN Classic on Christmas day. I had never seen it before, and knew it was going to be sad. Because I knew what to expect however, I had just a few tears. The movie is classic 70's biography, the music, editing etc.. They just have that certain style. The story is a touching as they come. The Cappelletti family were extraordinary people. The kind of folks anyone would like to meet. The relationship between John and Joey, was special, and not the kind most siblings have. But of course the circumstances here, were anything but normal. I enjoy films about football very much, but the football is secondary here. Thats okay, it still tells you about one of the greatest players ever in college football. Most of all, you admire the extraordinary bravery of a young boy, who faces a terminal illness. He, his brother, and the story of the entire family will lift you, and inspire you. It is worth the tears.
