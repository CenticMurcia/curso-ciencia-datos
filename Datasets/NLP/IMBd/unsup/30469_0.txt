I saw this movie at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival "www.bifff.org" in March 2006<br /><br />This movie is a real kick in the face, a ballet of music, feelings and poetic vision of life. Something between David Lynch and The Yellow Submarine of the Beattles. <br /><br />The hero is falling into desperation and will meet god for a little interview.<br /><br />Please take that ride ! You will not regret it. This movie is full of pleasure and humor and you will probably cry or laugh ...<br /><br />Thanks BB
