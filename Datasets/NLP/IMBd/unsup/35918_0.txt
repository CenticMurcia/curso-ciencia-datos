An only moderately interesting idea - killer sheep on a giant Kiwi ranch - turns out to be a far less than great movie. They were obviously aiming straight for cult status here, but you can tell there was a decent amount of money behind the picture - the special effects aren't too bad, except for a fetal sheep puppet that reminded me a tad too much of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, and the makeup is very good. The film-making is quite professional looking, too, and the actors are all fairly good. So you don't get any of that fun cheapness you get from many of the better cult films. You can't laugh at it for being so bad it's good, because it's a little too slick to be that bad. That wouldn't matter at all if the script were cleverer, but there are few good ideas here. It's a horror comedy, but there are almost no laughs to be had. No scares to be had, either. Sheep are about the least frightening animal on the planet, which could make for decent comedy. But the direction is far too unimaginative. The film's worst crime, though, is the constant hippie jokes. Danielle Mason is cute, but you just didn't want to hear her talk, because you just knew she was going to say something stereotypically hippie-ish. At times, it feels like her whole schtick was written by Eric Cartman. Director Jonathan King is clearly aiming to be the next Peter Jackson, but he has started far behind the curve.
