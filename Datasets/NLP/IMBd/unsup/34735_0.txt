This is a cheapie folks, the tragic attempt at special effects is truly laughable, and the story line ( even for a B Horror movie )is really uneven. It is from the H. G. Wells story of the same name. Although I have not read the story I believe this must be blasphemy to it's original intent. Joan Collins leads the cast, some of whom can actually act in a story about a group on a free cruise from a company trying to sell land. Due to kegs of radioactive chemicals ants become large, angry and intelligent! This is good for some entertainment and laughs but not enough. It just leaves you bored.
