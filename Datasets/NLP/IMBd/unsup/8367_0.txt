Tim Conway & Don Knots are the definitive pair of fools. Here they are called upon to solve a double-murder. They receive their instructions from one of the victims, the "Lord" of a mysterious castle. The staff consists of various "freaks", all looking as though they are characters from a "fun house".<br /><br />The slap stick (which is happening every minute throughout the film) is often so silly that belly-laughs are assured. Although predictable (we know that nothing serious could happen to our stupid heroes), the entire show is rather amusing and keeps the viewer's interest.<br /><br />Tim Conway is credited as one of the writers. The DVD version includes many added features. Especially noteworthy is a full length commentary track running alongside the faded out action. Much interesting trivia is revealed about the entire production. Fans of the star comedians will enjoy this film, and the added attractions on the DVD will be a welcome bonus.
