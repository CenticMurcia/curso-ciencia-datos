Saw this film again last night after watching the original in the cinema 23 years ago, as an 18 year old! I never forgot it though and recently bought the video on Amazon, and enjoyed it even more, maybe as it brought back a nostalgia for the 1980s. I love the whole bizarre set up, the weird coincidences (for example the piece of newspaper stuck on his arm which talks about a man being ripped apart by vigilantes in the very area he can't get away from - and then the weird woman says 'I'll burn it off' - yet more reference to burns) Love the 'Berlin club', and the idea of the plaster of Paris cream cheese bagel paper weights - so evocative of that pretentious era! There were so many parts that made me laugh out loud. In fact, I might sit down and watch it again.
