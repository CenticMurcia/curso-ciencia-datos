I don't understand how this movie could acquire so many positive reviews. The fact is this movie is utterly predictable from the very first opening scene to the ending credits. Storyline, acting, and the music all serving up a feeling of I have seen and heard this many times before.<br /><br />The film portrays the internet as a place where surfers only enjoy seeing other people suffer. I guess to anyone not familiar or has used the internet would watch this movie and then happily advocate internet controls which would basically be a system controlled by government. Of course this is something to be resisted because the Internet has become the last bastion of free speech.<br /><br />I couldn't wait for this movie to end simply because I knew exactly how it was going to and indeed did pan out. I must also say that it wouldn't have mattered which character bought the farm in this movie because I couldn't care less about any of them.<br /><br />The message in this movie is that we have become a society with zero morals (which could in fact be correct)but the sickest of all are the internet users where the only joy they will get is to watch humans suffering live on TV or the internet. I believe this is an extremely cynical point of view and what this movie actually promotes is what it portrays to be against.<br /><br />The only thing this movie will do is simply add to the frenzy of calls to have the internet controlled by government who will duly oblige given the chance. Well they are already trying to get it done by spreading fear of identity theft and in general the gullible masses are now beginning to believe that the moment they input their credit card details in to a computer their immediately a victim of identity theft. But as well all know, or at least all of us who use the internet for many reasons including and what I consider to be the most important of all and that is to seek out the truth when it comes to news the internet is in fact the last bastion of free speech, well in Europe it most definitely is.<br /><br />My negative review isn't because I fear this movie is shocking enough to have governments reaching for the control switch. In fact the movie isn't shocking at all. Its just a plain bad movie from start to finish. If you like predictable poorly written scripts and movies with no character depth and sanitised death scenes you will like this. To me it stank to high heaven of a made for TV movie
