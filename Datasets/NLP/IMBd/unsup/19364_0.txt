I am definitely an amateur and may be a dilettante when it comes to being a serious film reviewer/critic, but this movie has SO very much to offer to the movie-lover, that it is a sad commentary on the state of our commercial arts that it remains largely unknown to all but the ardent silent/chaplin aficionados.<br /><br />The IMDb profile and the other user comments highlight many of the generally innovative and well-executed gags and set-ups but I thought I would provide a list of things to look out for that don't get so much attention:<br /><br />- the hungry tramp stealing bites of hot dog from a toddler; only chaplin and his tramp would need to add mustard to the illicit gain<br /><br />- though a famous shot for chaplin-niks, the brilliant harmony (aided greatly by the manic section of music) as both the thief and the tramp end up in parallel flight from the coppers, essentially for the same crime.<br /><br />- the entire aristocratic air of the tramp settling down for a hobo's breakfast; when the chicken clucks by and charlie runs off to chase it, there's a pregnant pause of expectation...did he get it? will it be his meal? No. Befitting and completing the emotional tenor of the tramp, all he desired was an egg. So rewarded, he doffs his hat to the offscreen chicken. A fair exchange thus completed.<br /><br />- I can hardly believe that in 50 or so comments, no one has mentioned the introduction of Merna to Charlie. When she reveals that indeed she is a performer in the circus, charlie glances at the poster-bill behind them both advertising the "Sword Swallower" With a mischievous grin and lilting eyes, he inquires as to whether this is HER role in the show. When she corrects him, "No, I ride the horses." he is so sweetly embarrassed by his misconstrual of her talents. A very sexually subversive, risqu√© gag for 1928.<br /><br />There's dozens more just like this within this film and if you haven't seen it, it is so worth the investment of 70 minutes of your entertainment time. It has heart, nobility, zany humor and madcap comedic antics rolled into one concise ball; not unlike the ball of paper made by the crumpled circus star, that the tramp kicks away in the end.<br /><br />a wonderful piece of film-making.<br /><br />pax vk
