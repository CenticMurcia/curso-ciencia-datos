That's about all of note in this otherwise forgettable film. At least, I hope it's forgettable. The songs are standard period fare, ponderous and somewhat shrill. Cary's frightening makeup makes him almost unrecognizable, but who could mistake that voice! Interesting as a bit of history, I don't recommend picking up the digitally re-mastered gold disc limited collector's edition (if it should ever come out).
