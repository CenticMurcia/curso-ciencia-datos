Ed Harris should stick to acting.<br /><br />This movie was so boring and so lame and annoying and filled with clich√©s that my friend and I, ended up fast forwarding after we had seen about 30 minutes. Nothing works here. The acting is wooden (especially from Zellwegger) the dialog is awful (these two "tough" gunmen actually talk about the color of drapes at one point in the movie, what the hell??) And the problem with two friends and one "attractive" woman is never really followed through. So what is the point of showing it at all? <br /><br />Talents like Jeremy Irons, Lance Henriksen and Viggo Mortensen are completely wasted here. Ed Harris looks way too old for his part and he cannot direct himself.<br /><br />The few action-scenes are dull and boring and short. And in the end where there is gonna be a showdown between Mortensen and Irons, it's over before you even noticed what happened.<br /><br />Stay away from this crap and watch Tombstone instead. Even Open Range is better than Appa-loser.
