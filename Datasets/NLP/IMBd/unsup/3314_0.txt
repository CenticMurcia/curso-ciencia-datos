CAVITE is an example of ultimate independent film, with a very short budget, a very simple concept, an exotic locale, a minimal cast, and a hand-held camera.<br /><br />The story is simple: Adam (Ian Gamazon) is called home to the Phillipines because of a family crisis. Instead of his family picking him up, he finds himself forced to follow instructions of a man claiming to have his family. There's no clear reason for the abduction, or what makes Adam a target; all Adam really knows is that his every move is watched, and the kidnappers have no regard for their victims.<br /><br />As Adam follows the obscure instructions, and the obstacles in his way, the audience can't help but be caught up in his plight. The hand held camera and jumpy editing style enhances the sense of desperation and time. The scenes of urban Phillipines, particular the markets and the squatter holdings are a vivid cacophony.<br /><br />Co-directors and Co-writers Neill Dela Llana and Ian Gamazon have done an outstanding job of making the most out of limited means. The economy of the film makes it both intimate and discomfiting, as Adam is an everyman who only wants his family safe and instead is completely at the whim of an omniscient tormentor.<br /><br />CAVITE is an absolute must for anyone who has an interest in film, as storytelling, in it's structure, and as an art form.
