Jump into your Ferrari and sail through the streets of Paris at high speeds early in the morning. The amazing thing about this movie, other than the fact that no one was ran over making it, is the fact that it was shot in one take. No cuts, fancy special effects or editing...just one man and a really fast car heading for a rendezvous with his woman. Seen on a big screen television with surround will put you in the driver's seat of one of the world's fastest production cars for a 12 minutes of "sitting on the edge of your seat" action. This is one of the best film shorts that I have ever seen and recommend it to everyone that I know.
