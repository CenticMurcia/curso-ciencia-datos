After THE BLUE ANGEL and MOROCCO, DISHONORED was a bit of a come down for me, in my opinion it is the one film that Dietrich made with Joseph Von-Sternberg that has the least meaning, Publicity hyped it up because it was released at the same time as MGMs MATA HARI with Greta Garbo, unfortunately for Dietrich she was no match for Garbo and MATA HARI wins hands down. DISHONORED is slow, Dietrichs costumes are awful and sloppy and her acting is at its worst, even Von-Sternbergs famous lighting and Visual brilliance is not there, i am highly surprised that it was a hit at all.
