In a mysterious forest in Thailand, many suicidal youths disappear and rescue teams can not find the way out even with compass. The ambitious reporter May (Rain Li) is making sensationalist journalism exploring the deaths in the forest. Her boyfriend and botanist Shun Shu-hoi (Ekin Cheng) is developing a means of communication with plants. Meanwhile, Detective C. C. Ha (Qi Shu) is investigating the rape and death of a woman and the main suspect is Patrick Wong (Tsun-wai Chou). Detective Ha contacts Shu- hoi requesting his support trying to communicate with the trees around the area where the woman was murdered. They resolve the case and Shu-hoi becomes famous; when May vanishes in the forest, Shu-hoi and Detective Ha seek her out.<br /><br />"Sum Yuen" is a deceptive and boring movie of Danny Pang. The terrible and laughable story is so ridiculous and absurd that does not deserve any comment. My advice: do not spend your time and money watching this awful flick. My vote is two.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Natureza do Mal" ("Nature of the Evil")
