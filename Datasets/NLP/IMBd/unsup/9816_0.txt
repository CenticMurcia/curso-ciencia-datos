And I don't mean about the movie. I mean about what happened on 9 -11- 01. I didn't have to be the brightest person on earth to note that the towers felt unexpectedly fast and soon, too perfect. To note that there were none airplanes remains on the ground where the tragedy occurred, both at the pentagon and Flight 93 crash site. This guys are trying to compiled all these questions many of us have, researching on dark and fuzzy ground and trying to make some sense out of it. They are not making everything up. They have people, testimonies, graphic material... and I can't say thats the true, but I can say that neither is what the media, controlled by the government has been feeding us from that day. So, I say give it a chance, see it. Then you decide what to believe.
