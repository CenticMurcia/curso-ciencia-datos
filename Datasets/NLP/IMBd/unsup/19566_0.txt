the only thing that bothered me a little was that not all of the singing scenes fitted in with the plot. other then that I am completely thrilled.<br /><br />the story is similar as in the first movie just the other way round. instead of loosing yourself in your friends you loose your friends searching for yourself. it still has this good ol'Disney moral at the end but it is pleasantly subtle.<br /><br />it is fun - some lines are hilarious - especially from Ryan and one of the funniest scene is definitely Sharpays & Troys rehearsal.<br /><br />as for the acting - aside from Zac, Corbin, Ashley and Lucas, they are mostly supporting, which is working fine for Kelsi or Jason or Zeke but not so much for Gabriellas character. Zacs dancing reminds me a little of Kevin Bacon in Footloose - mostly in his solo, but it is not a bad thing. and this role is yet another proof of his acting skills. Ashely is perfect in her role as drama queen but yet again Lucas stole them all the show. I totally enjoyed the scenes with Troy & Gabriella. they were so natural.<br /><br />this movie has some awesome dancing sequences but the best one is the Fabulous bit. <br /><br />and the music is even better then in the first movie. the final song is not as climaxing as should be but fits with the story nicely. IMHO You are the music in me is way catchier. Vanessa evens the score for a lack of character to play by snatching the best song - yet again. and she and Zac harmonize wonderfully - visually as much as musically. we even get to hear the rest of the gang sing which is a plus point. <br /><br />this movie is different then the first one but it has all what made its predecessor so memorable. great music, simple story, beautiful cast and a heart. Disney still has it. <br /><br />P.S. check out Chads t-shirts - they are hilarious.
