I wouldn't call this a screwball comedy, though. It stars out with Fredric March as a reporter who is demoted because his last story was a fake. He convinces his boss, played by Walter Connolly who always seems to play these kind of roles, to make a bigger story out of a woman dying of radium poisoning. He takes her to New York and show her a good time until she dies. But it turns out she isn't dying and she wants to tell March but her doctor won't let her or something like that. This movie is pretty short at only 75 minutes and it could of been longer. Fredric March is great as the reporter and Carole Lombard is also good as the woman who is faking her illness. This movie was directed by William A. Wellman who didn't too many comedies.
