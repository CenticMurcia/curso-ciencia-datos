After being disgusted by the first D&D movie, I went into the Wrath of the Dragon God with trepidation. Even so, I tried to keep hope that the producers would make amends for their previous failure. Well, they honestly tried.... The action and CGI was much better, however there were many points where it was unbelievable. The ACTING was greatly improved. The story fit the D&D feel a little more. Being an AD&D player for many years now, I was still let down by the rudimentary knowledge the producers seem to have about D&D. I wish they would find some REAL actors, have a REAL adult story, and REALLY know their stuff when it comes to the D&D GAME ASPECTS. There are so many great things that D&D has as a game that could be put into a great movie... too bad no one can get their stuff together enough to do it.
