cool movie; it keeps you in eye contact and bounds to its subject. I do not know how accurate it is historically but the film was more objective than I accepted. I was a bit prejudiced about the film at the beginning but as the movie continued I realized that I am wrong. I felt some exaggeration also.It shows turks as perfect warriors technically and very mysterious killers The figurine turks used in the backgrounds had actually a comic Azerbaijan accent and spoke very unrelated words in fight scenes I think the director used them since they knew Russian<br /><br />, so it would be more economic. there were many replicas copied from Hollywood film-making also such as focusing camera on objects very fast and too much mise-en scene.But usage of maps as a very dynamic part of film was very original and entertaining. The character Enver Bey who was a spy of Ottoman Pasha have been chosen as a person who looked like a Russian and spoke perfect Russian language but hiding him till the end of the film was not interesting and new enough for such a box office one in Russian Federation but I think it is worth for watching, good film
