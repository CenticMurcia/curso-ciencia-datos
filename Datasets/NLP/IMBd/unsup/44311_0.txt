Though the film had started with a good idea, there seemed to be no plot among all the running about and blood spattering. Also just when you think everything will be ok, it takes a new twist - everything then doesn't seem to make any sense at all.. and you just leave the cinema muttering "what was that all about". Would not recommend it
