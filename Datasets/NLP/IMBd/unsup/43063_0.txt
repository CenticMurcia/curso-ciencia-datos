Replace Sean with Ajay, Nicholas with Ashish (Awful replacement) and Michael Biehn with Sunil Shetty. The team that infiltrates the abandoned prison (Alcatraz in THE ROCK) is CBI task force instead of the Navy Seals. Additions: Laila (An overacting Isha) Sapna (Who is it?)and The Ever crying Neha Dhupia. End result: A messy remake of the Hollywood hit with Ajay Devgan making a Vain attempt to raise the the status of the movie. The Chief Minister of Maharashtra doesn't show any consideration about the hostages and giving 'Rachit' and 'Rahul' a chance to complete the mission. Why does Neha exist? Is Isha included only for her physical beauty? The quality of the movie does not matter with of without their existence in the movie. It is also an absurd time so show a villainous Pakistan when Indo-Pak diplomatic ties are underway. Better Luck Next time Ajay
