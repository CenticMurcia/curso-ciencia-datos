I hate when people say that about a movie, but hear me out on this one.<br /><br />This movie is so good, only a classic dubbed voice-over could do it justice, but I'll still try here. I first saw this movie 2 weeks ago(today is 25/05/07), and now I've seen it ten times, and own a copy. I had gone on a Kung Fu binge at my local video store which has a small but semi-decent selection when as I was nearing the end of their selection, and I picked this up. Now I have had these binges in the past, but with Kung Fu( NOT TOTAL WIRE-FIGHTING; The Real old-school stuff), once you satisfy the urge, you can go eons without watching, or wanting to watch another kung fu flick. Anyways, I'm at home and have 2 other rented kung fu's, 'Fists and Guts' and the 'The Bhuddist Fist', 2 very decent movies themselves. I tried to decide the best order to watch them, because it's hard for a mediocre Kung Fu Movie to follow a really good one. Since it had Carter Wong I thought well this could be something, but the title was too boastful for me to take seriously - It went in the player 1st, lead-off batter.<br /><br />30 seconds into the movie I stopped it, pressed eject, and bumped it up to # 3, the money spot; It just gave me "that feeling". Now I watched 'Bhuddist Fist' and thought it was really decent. 'Fists and Guts' was great too and funny(The fight scene in the Leper Colony is classic). Then I settled in for what I hoped was the clincher movie.<br /><br />From the classic intro voice-over which describes the nurturing and the nature of Carter Wongs character (not to mention why his voice is the way it is in the movie ), I had goosebumps and a grin.( sidenote - The "cheesy" dubbing makes Kung-Fu movies BETTER if you don't understand Cantonese or Mandarin, and if you have watched a lot and can understand the nuances of the voice teams{since they used the same general group for like 25 years}. The same people would be the voice of villains, the same were the heroes, the same people would be the avenger, the same guy would do the restaurant/noodle stand owner. Basically they help define the characters since Kung-Fu movies generally were always about the same types of characters.)<br /><br />So the movie starts proper and then Hi-Pei Killers come in and start kicking butt; Until First brother is called in. From that first fight to the very end, this movie is everything - EVERYTHING - an old-school "Kung-Fu Movie" should be. Great Lines ("Give this one 'The Quick Trip to Heaven'" - Classic), a killer pair of villains(Carte Wong and Lo Leigh - Awesome), amazing choreography (Yuen Woo Ping is so good), classic "trying to find the weakness training sequences", classic climactic fight sequencing i.e. vs. 1st brother > master > Grand Master, just everything.<br /><br />Thanks for listening, and this is just my two-cents, but this is a must own for every Kung Fu Movie Enthusiast.
