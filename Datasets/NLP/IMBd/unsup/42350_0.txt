I'm totally sure this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life. And don't get me wrong, i love Diego Luna and the way he works and acts but this movie, the director, filmography, the history it self was pretty bad, and i was just waiting for it to end. I was with my girlfriend and we saw it together. We are both Argentines and she loves Latin films but she totally agrees with me. Don't lose time and money, don't even try this one! Love's a Bitch, Nine Queens , Cidade DE Deus if you wanna give south America/Latin America movies a try but this one wasn't supposed to be even filmed My vote was 1 because there's no 0 Salutes
