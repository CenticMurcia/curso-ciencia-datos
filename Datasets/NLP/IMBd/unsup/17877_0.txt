Somewhat of a modern-day "And Then There Were None," as a group of people all meet at a motel, get trapped their in downpour that has blocked roads out of the place......and murders start happening rapidly.<br /><br />Not everyone dies in this movie, however, and there is a very neat twist at the end. The movie keeps your interest all the way but the bad news is that most of the characters are profane and unlikeable, especially the women in here. The "ladies" are brutal! <br /><br />John Cusack, as "Ed," has the most interesting role, followed closely by Ray Liotta's "Rhodes." Neither of those two characters had last names in this story.
