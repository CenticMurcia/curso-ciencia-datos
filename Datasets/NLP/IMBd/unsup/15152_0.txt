As a British Working Class person I have to say how disappointed I am of the reviews of this show. As I remember this was a laugh out loud programme. Yes it was written in an American format (like My Family), but it was excellent and hysterically funny.<br /><br />Basically Barbara Liversidge is not the easiest woman to get along with. She makes life hell for her poor husband Ted. She has two children: Neil who has loads of different girlfriends and Linda who is married to news reporter Martin Pond. Her friends are Jean and her husband Phil and her work friend Doreen.<br /><br />Each episode of Barbara was laugh out loud, probably the best ITV sitcom in recent times. Gwen Taylor had been excellent as Amy in Duty Free and Sam Kelly had been excellent as Warren in Porridge. The great Mark Benton was also excellent. There were so many classic episodes of this and tragically it hasn't been released on DVD or VHS. What a wonderful DVD set could be made if they released all 4 series.<br /><br />Best episode: So many greats but I'm gonna have to go for: Valentine, Series 3 episode 3.
