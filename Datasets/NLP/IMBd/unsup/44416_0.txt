I guess the first installment of this series was about being nice to people (and not blow them up). Come to think of it, so was the second one.<br /><br />Now the third one was, well, about being nice to people, whereas the fourth  I'm sorry. It's just too much being nice.<br /><br />At least JERRY WAS A MAN had an edge to it. This is pure mush.<br /><br />It's all about these mutants, but of course we all know it really isn't, but just to be on the safe side, we get a lecture on AIDS. It's about society being beastly to some people we could mention, this is a story about society being beastly to the less than perfect, the voice-box of Stephen Hawking tells us, and it's very beastly  just so we know.<br /><br />They're all aboard this spaceship (so you see, it really is science fiction) and everybody's having a hard time. BRIAN DENNEHY at least gets a big hand, and JOHN HURT is reminded that two heads are better than one, even though the other one is very small and seems to have originally belonged to KLAUS KINSKI.<br /><br />Of course, anyone not applauding such a noble intention, whatever its literary and cinematic qualities, is an insensitive brute, and here I go being beastly to a less than perfect piece of - Saturday evening entertainment. So sue me.
