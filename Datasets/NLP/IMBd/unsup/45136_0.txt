This hurts me to say, but this movie was terrible, and my man Freddie was just painful to watch. I was quite surprised, because I was really expecting to love this film.<br /><br />Fredric March, though perhaps better known for his dramatic roles, can also handle comedy quite well (e.g., he was fabulous in "Nothing Sacred", and even in the dreadful comedy "Susan and God" he was one of the few who made the film bearable). But in "I Married a Witch", there is just nothing that works in this film. It's not funny, and the story is both convoluted and flimsy. I don't know if the failure of this film is due to bad direction, or to the real-life animosity between March and Veronica Lake (though I do think Lake did a good job of hiding her dislike of March when the cameras were rolling), or what. To further add insult to injury, a young and stunning Susan Hayward is completely wasted in a bit part as an unpleasant, one-dimensional shrew of a woman.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Fredric March (and I am a huge one myself), please spare yourself the disappointment of seeing him flounder in a horrible story, and take a pass on "I Married a Witch". Really. Trust me. It's *THAT* bad! I have most of Freddie's DVDs, and I have several Freddie flicks that aren't available on DVD permanently stored on my TiVo for repeated viewing (Sign of the Cross, Death Takes a Holiday, Executive Suite), and I even have some ancient flicks of his on video tape (True to the Navy, The Wild Party, Dark Angel), and what did I do after "I Married a Witch"? I DELETED IT! On purpose! That should give you an idea of how bad this movie is! <br /><br />There are much better witch-themed films out there -- Bell, Book and Candle comes immediately to mind. For a wonderful Fredric March flick involving the supernatural, see Death Takes a Holiday. For Freddie in fine comedic form, catch Nothing Sacred.
