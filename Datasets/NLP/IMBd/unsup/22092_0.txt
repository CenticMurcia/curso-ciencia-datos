I'd been meaning to see this movie for about a year, before I was finally able to order it off the internet. I was not disappointed. I've never seen a Fellini film, but I'm definitely going to have to try sometime soon. I was utterly confused as to the story almost the entire way through, but I still grasped the concepts, and it really didn't matter. To appreciate this movie, you just have to suspend your beliefs for a while and watching this gorgeous movie unfold. I understand that the actually story is somewhat incomplete, as it hasn't totally been discovered intact. But, it's basic journey of these men is a sight to see. I was wondering if anyone else was struck by the resemblance of Gitone to Barbra Streisand? I noticed it almost immediately and thought it an interesting side note. Watch this movie. Don't try to understand all of it, just enjoy it, and be enthralled by Fellini's genius
