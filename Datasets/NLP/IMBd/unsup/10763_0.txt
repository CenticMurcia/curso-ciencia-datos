Decided to view this film simple because of the title and I was probably thinking about Lon Chaney and his many faces of Horror. Well, this film was a horrible mess and a big Horror to watch. I will have to say that Dana Carvey,(Pistachio Disguisey),"The Shot",'96 did a great job of acting crazy and I am sure it was not easy to follow the script. Jennifer Esposito,(Jennifer Baker),"Crash",'04, was rather cute and very attractive and gave a good supporting role. Last but not least, James Brolin,(Fabbrizio Disguisey),"A Guy Thing",'03, added his talents to this picture, but I began to wonder if Barbra Streisand enjoyed this film and her husband's performance. WOW
