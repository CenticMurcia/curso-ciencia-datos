Okay, so this wasn't like all the other National Lampoon movies, like it was hardly funny...at all. However if you go into it knowing that, then it's actually a great movie. And it's also a slow movie, just a warning, but I loved it. It's a movie I will always remember this movie and certain parts from it, there are many fabulous words of advice (probably more of a chick flick, I don't think most guys would wait this out) But honestly, don't just ride it off. I'm a teenager, I love the funny movies out like all the other National Lampoon movies, this one is just a bit more...real? Than the others? I would give it a shot for sure, when you think you're in the mood for it of course (:
