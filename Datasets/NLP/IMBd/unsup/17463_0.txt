Wow, if you're a fan of Miike's work and liked the "original" Ichi, you will probably love this prequel! It's almost hard to believe that it wasn't Miike himself on the director's chair. But as the assistant director in the production of Miike's masterpiece, Masato Tanno for sure knew what he was doing as the director in this prequel. He shows Shiroichi during his time at Highschool, where two other boys lay claim to the status of the best fighter of all Highschools in town. So, almost the whole film is about fighting. And these guys really know how to punch! Tanno's film isn't as strange and dark as its "forerunner", but it doesn't have to hide behind it. You can call it in a row with such great masterpieces as "Ichi" or "Story of Ricky". It's different but brutal and violent as hell. Acting was good, so was the camera work. But director Masato Tanno definitely did the best job of them all. If you have the possibility, you should rent it. If you're a fan of Miike's films, buy it - you won't regret! It'll blow you away!!!<br /><br />
