Hurcules in New York, 1970 2/10, Worst movie of 1970, Second worst of the 1970's, 1214th overall<br /><br />I didn't actually see this movie recently. However I did see it back in Jr. High. Recently while looking at IMDb.com's "100 worst movies of all time" I saw it and realized I hadn't ranked it yet. Let me assure you it is on that list for a reason. It is not a good movie, or even an adequate movie. Here are the only reasons I can recall that would make it worth watching. Aarnold Swarzenager stars in it, but they dub his voice to make him sound American, which is especially awesome since he's Hurcules who would have been Greek. Also this movie had a gorilla in it who was VERY VERY clearly just a man in a gorilla suit... that was fairly awesome. Anyway, those are pretty much the high points of the movie. I gave this movie a two because it never made me want to kill my self... but its still very, very bad.
