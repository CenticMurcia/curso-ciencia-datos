Not exactly evoking horror, but Boris Karloff is a sadistic master of an insane asylum. The charming Anna Lee lands in bad graces with the wrong people and finds herself locked away in a hotbed of madness. She is valiant in her efforts to expose the horrid conditions at the asylum. Running time is a short hour and 19 minutes full of creepy atmosphere and Mr. Karloff in top form. Also in the cast are: Billy House, Jason Robards Sr. and Richard Fraser.
