This was the worst movie ever created. I hate everyone involved in the production of this motion picture. I don't even want to call it a motion picture. I want to call it slow, mind-numbing pain pulsating through my cerebral cortex. I've never seen a movie that actually made me want to hurt something. It's so bad, I can't even describe it.<br /><br />Watching this movie is like choking on stale bread. And even less enjoyable than that. It's the most uninspired pile of crap I've ever witnessed. The director makes a cameo in the movie as the guy pissing on the side of a wall. And there are boobs in it. That's it.<br /><br />p.s. A guy gets his leg blown off too.<br /><br />This was all that stood out. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
