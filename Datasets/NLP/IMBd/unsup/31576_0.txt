I thought this movie was alright but nothing special. INteresting premise with a little girl who is traumautized after seeing her mother dead in an apparent suicide. Her father(Deniro) moves her out of the city and finds out she has an imaginary friend named "Charlie." He starts to get worried when she starts to recreate what she saw with her mom in the bathtub blaming him. She says she doenst' do it but her friend Charlie and of course the father doesn't believe her. Then comes the surprise ending which was very surprising but hard to believe. Such as why was she not afraid of her father who is the alter ego "Charlie' when her father is her father and also how did going to the country side bring out this alter ego which I'm assuming came about when he killed his wife.
