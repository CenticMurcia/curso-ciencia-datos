As Daniel O'Rourke said, you either love Little Britain or you hate it. I personally love it.<br /><br />My favourite characters are: Ray Macooney, The man with the spicy food in the restaurant, the woman who works at the university, Lou and Andy, Majorie Dawes,Mollie Sugden's bridesmaid, Sid Pegg, Bubbles and Carol Beer only to name a few. The characters I didn't like were: Kenny Craig, Dennis Waterman and Dafydd Thomas and the one I absolutely hated was the one where a young David Walliams fancies the Grandma.<br /><br />A great sketch show that is very popular amongst young children. I didn't like Little Britain Abroad though, it failed to make me laugh. Tom Baker is brilliant at doing the narration.
