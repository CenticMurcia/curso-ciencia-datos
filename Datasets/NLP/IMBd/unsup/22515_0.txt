I can watch almost all kinds of movies without any greater problems, but one of my pet peeves have always been poorly made horror movies. Some directors seem to think that this is the easiest genre out there, and that anyone can make a horror movie, but nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />Steel Trap is yet another really poor attempt at making a buck of other peoples original ideas. At first, I thought this would be something of a Saw type of movie, but it is more like a straight forward slasher. Nothing new here.<br /><br />The script and acting is OK at times, but those times are rare and really overshadowed by the sometimes down-right retarded decisions made by the characters. It's really not that difficult to attract say the police or fire department to a skyscraper in the middle of a large city.<br /><br />If you're bored out of your skull, I suppose this movie is better than staring at the wall or re-arranging your sock drawer, but if you've got anything, and I do mean ANYTHING, better to do, I suggest you do that instead of watching Steel Trap.
