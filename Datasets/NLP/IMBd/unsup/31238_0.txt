Cheap-cheap-cheap comic feature. An extremely bad, agonizingly unfunny comedy concerning urban family man Charles Grodin taking the wife and kids on vacation to an island resort, and not getting what he expected. Grainy, grimy mess is a most uncomfortable viewing experience. The movie actually manages to look worse than your average TV feature, with the limp writing at a sophomoric level and a direction that seems non-existent. Grodin, in desperation-mode, is obviously being wasted, but supporting performers Jon Lovitz, Mario Van Peebles and Phil Hartman don't even seem to take notice. <br /><br />A real dog; NO STARS from ****
