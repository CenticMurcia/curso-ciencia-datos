At First it was BORING but I started to like it as they got more more into the mystery of the tape.It did need little bit more but it was GREAT! <br /><br />They Need more people and needed to MAke more and more of the tapes till it goes international and Racheal and Aiden has to stop it before everyone sees it. <br /><br />I would say go see it if you like mystery that is not that Gory,Bloody Has lots of language, and Not that Scary. either see it by yourself or with a friend.<br /><br />But it Was Great!
