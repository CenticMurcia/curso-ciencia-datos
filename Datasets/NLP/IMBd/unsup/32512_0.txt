If this movie had been made in America it would have received much more objective criticism. But, for some reason, many film watchers think that they must automatically heap praise upon any foreign made movie because it's the "in" thing to do. I am not surprised by all of the undeserved superlatives and ridiculous "10" votes given to this mediocre film. This movie is watchable but that's about it. The storyline is so implausible and unrealistic that it should be labeled as "fantasy". All of the syrupy comments about the great "love" shown by the father are laughable.
