I really like this film more each time I view it. <br /><br />One of the rare films I know which takes their time to tell the story ... NO MTV-cut-style-frantic-cutting but lovingly dwelling on faces, persons, landscape etc. <br /><br />Yes, maybe some of the costumes aren't 100% correct, maybe some parts of the soundtrack do irritate with their loudness, but that to me are minor flaws! <br /><br />I really think they captured the "big picture" of Kristin's early life and her getting to know Erlend Nikulausson perfectly - in tone at least, even if some smaller episodes of course are missing from the film. And even the odd additions here and there I think do make sense in the context of the film! <br /><br />I just hope there WILL someday be someone who with equal skill and pacing takes the other two novels to the silver screen too! <br /><br />In short: one of my favorite films right now!
