I was very disappointed after seeing this movie. In theory this could have been a strong, political drama. Instead it became a pointless sequence of rather boring events. The camera is mostly handled in a documentary style. This gives the movie a certain realistic feeling but unfortunately, this does not endorse the story, simply because there is no story, no real plot, no evolution in it. The result is 100 minutes of atmosphere, trying to hide a very weak plot with no layers or subplots. It seems the director never asked himself if watching this film a nice experience. To me it was not.<br /><br />This film was not able to touch me (the attempt of being emotionally touching was way too obvious), it was not intellectually challenging (the message is simple and mundane), it was never funny and there was no real tension because it was very slow and the film leaves the public absolutely uninformed about the odds for some plot change. Which never comes.<br /><br />Summarized, this could have been nice as a short movie (30 minutes at max) that shows the story as it is: somewhat tragic, yet uncomplicated. As a viewer, I registered what happened, but the events had no function in the greater whole. They were simply events. Rather irrelevant ones, really. I almost fell asleep and to me it was a waste if time and money.<br /><br />Sometimes less is more. In this movie, less is just less. You have been warned.
