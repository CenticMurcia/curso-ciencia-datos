This is an extremely Poor Excuse for a Film,Batman or Otherwise.There are many Batman Fan Films out there and You'll find some Excellent Ones on Youtube like "Call Me Mr.J" and "Batman:Dead End".This Film looks like The Director tried to be Tim Burton or Christopher Nolan but was closer to Joel Schumacher.<br /><br />First,Lets look at the Illogical.How could a doped to The Eyeballs Junkie take down a Vigilante in Peak Condition.His Taser would not affect the Batsuit and,even if it did,Batman is an expert Escape Artist and a few Chains could not Hold Him for Long.He is also a Genius Detective.How could He make such an obvious Mistake as thinking a College Student was part of a Gang? Furthermore,how did The Police not figure it out? Of course the Argument could be made that it is illogical to apply Logic in a Fantasy World.So lets look at the other Flaws.The main Villain,for Instance.While I think I can see the Tragedy in a Superhero being killed by a no-Name Thug,perhaps a Reference to Bruce's Parents,The Villain does little else than Moan of His Lot in Life.His Anger is Justified to an extent but is Batman Responsible for His Subsequent Prison Rape and Drug Addiction? Then there's the Bat Himself.Here He cracks Spiderman's rejected One-Liners and displays a Cocky Attitude.<br /><br />On an Interesting Side note,This Film stars Louise Bale,Sister of Christian Bale,Arguably the Finest Actor to play the Role.That may Distract You enough to avoid the Awfulness of this Film
