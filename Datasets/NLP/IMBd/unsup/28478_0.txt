Donna Deitch has done a great job of conveying highly pertinent real life aspects of gay and lesbian recent history and modern life.<br /><br />With very tight scripts and damned fine acting from all players, it would be hard to go wrong, but Donna makes the whole film cohesive and attractive. I also really enjoy the stereo soundtrack.<br /><br />I've seen Common Ground several times, enough to be inspired to import the NTSC tape - and the only problem with it is that the left and right channels are reversed (it's worth swapping your cables around temporarily).<br /><br />Even though I know my emotional buttons are being pushed, I still enjoy every word and aspect of this film. It offers inspiration for younger and older gays and lesbians - and food for thought for our family and friends.<br /><br />This is high quality, gimmick-free and utterly honest film-making.
