Clearly not everyone will have the same taste but I really like this show. I like the characters, I like the plots, I like the acting and I like the special effects..and the car kicks much ass too. <br /><br />Is it perfect? That depends on your definition of perfect. It entertains the hell out of me so that's as perfect as it needs to be. I like surreal art and even more so, surreal movies, TV and music. There's also a nice element of humor that the cast does a great job of pulling off.<br /><br />Rumor is it's getting canceled but I have a hard time believing it. We're still in it's first season and I think it's getting better with each passing episode. The Sci Fi Friday night line up is outstanding in my opinion and Flash Gordon really brought i all together. <br /><br />I'm not loyal to very many shows but I'm loyal to this one.
