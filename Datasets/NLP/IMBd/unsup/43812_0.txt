I was disgusted with this movie. The characters in the movie were not believable at all, nor did they have any similarity to the people you find in other tellings of the story of King Arthur. What happened to the relationships between these people? What happened to King Arthur in this movie to turn him into such a horrible person? I have never been so disappointed in a movie character before. The King Arthur I know would not have been leading the charge to execute Guinivere. He should have loved her, but this King Arthur had no feelings at all except for hatred.<br /><br />And it wasn't just Arthur; there was no depth to any of these characters. There was nothing to make you feel any sense of connection to them at all. If you don't care what happens, why bother watching at all? This movie was just a waste of time.
