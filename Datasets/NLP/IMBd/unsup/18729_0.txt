This has to be the best movie of all time. Any future in which the properties of water change to become flammable is a future i can look forward too. Special visual and sound effects which compare to the likes of Space Invaders from Atari. However, I think the best was costume design of the monsters. It brings back memories of childhood from when my parents took me to see Dinosaurs Alive at the zoo. Reb Brown should win an academy award for his role as YOR. Only he can pull of such a great screenplay with classic lines like "Damn Talking Box". I can only hope that one day they make a sequel to this movie. I believe that it will be directed by this new and up coming star Ed V.
