Did I end up sitting through the original "Silent Night, Deadly Night" again or was someone just playing a cruel joke on me? Seriously, this is just a damn clip show! The first half of this "sequal" is a re-tred, showing lengthy scenes from the the first movie, strung together with narration by Ricky (Billy's little brother) who is being interviewed by a prison psychiatrist. His snarky mannerisms are enough to make you want to pound his face with a brick! Then, we get into his past, which is not worthy of the laughs it was obviously trying to gain and just annoyed me to the point of physical rage... Yes, I broke a LOT of things throughout the course of the "film". There's a scene where Ricky and his bimbo girlfriend are in a movie theater watching the original "Silent Night, Deadly Night"!! Was that suppose to be cute! And just a note for the apparent fans: "Garbage Day" is the dumbest line in all of horror history! I don't usually get so worked up over a film but this was just a pointless waste of time on an insurmountable scale that it is nearly impossible to comprehend... I mean, a chick watches this terrible actor drive a truck over her boyfriend multiple times and she THANKS him. Thanks him! Even if the boyfriend's a would-be rapist douche, you'd think witnessing a murder would alarm some random chick a LOT more. Don't bother with this crap...
