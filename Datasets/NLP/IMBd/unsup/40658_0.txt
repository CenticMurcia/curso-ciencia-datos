Alice Hoffman's Practical Magic isn't a very good novel. Hoffman has written about a dozen books better than that (The River King and Turtle Moon come to mind). Practical Magic -- the movie -- isn't even half as good as the disappointing novel. "What was that cr*p?" I thought after having seen the movie. They have mixed three or four different genres and the result is a mess. The movie's not funny when it wants to be funny, and it's funny when it's supposed to be 'serious'.<br /><br />Practical Magic is a complete waste of time! What are actors such as Wiest, Channing and Kidman doing in this movie? This is the silliest movie I have seen since The Mummy. (2/10)
