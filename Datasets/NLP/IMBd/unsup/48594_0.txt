The plot : a group of adorable animals have incredibly violent deaths . That's all . Wow ,I'm pretty sure than the creators of this show make lots of efforts to create something so sophisticated and complex like this . Now you can say "They aren't trying to make Shakespeare ,they just want to make something funny " And I would answer : I don't agree . Because ,this show isn't funny . You hear me : Isn't funny . The big deal with this show it's see the critters dying in disgusting ( and almost always in unrealistic and stupid ) ways. The characters don't have any personality or relevance .They just appear ,they walk .And they die . I didn't laugh any time with this retarded show . It's incredibly immature and repetitive . This is a cartoon that deserves nothing .
