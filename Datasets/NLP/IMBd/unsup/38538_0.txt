The only words I can gather for this movie are "the worst sequel ever made period." I can't find any positives about this movie. Quite seriously, I wish I could because I loved the first Pumpkinhead so much. What happened?! I know sequels normally suck, but they're not supposed to suck THIS much. I'm actually at a loss right now because I don't know if this or Boogeyman is worse. The movie kicks off with a hideously deformed boy being brutally murdered and then hung down a mine shaft. Now he's buried in front of what appears to be a witch's house. 20 mins into the movie and Pumpkinhead is created not this time by the witch but rather by some "thrill seeking teenagers" and I actually believe the group labels themselves as "thrill seekers" before they resurrect Mr. Angry. After Pumpkinhead is resurrected you might as well turn off your DVD player (or if you're old school, VHS player) and turn the movie into a novelty flying disc because then at least you can say that it's a GOOD movie (trust me, it glides real nice and cuts air like a hot knife through butter). The acting is beyond terrible. Remember Saw? Remember how the acting sucked in the beginning but got better as the movie progressed? The acting gets worse and worse as this one goes on. And the ending... oh buddy. If you remember how the first Pumpkinhead ended your gonna be on angry mofo because there's a very special something taken out that made the Pumpkinhead villain so unique. Overall, don't watch this. Rather use it as a clay pigeon, use it as a frisbee golf disc, or use it for self mutilation because you're gonna be wondering why you let this movie finish. Watch the first, but ignore this disgraceful sequel.
