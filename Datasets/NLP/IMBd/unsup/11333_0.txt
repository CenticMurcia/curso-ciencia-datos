OK just to get it out of the way I play D&D. Also I liked the First D&D movie (know well that it was going to be a bad "B" Movie)<br /><br />That being said, THIS is what I was hoping for in the first one. This is a very good fantasy movie with good plot, acceptable acting and good FXs.<br /><br />One thing that I really liked was that the writers actually looked into the game and took spells, gods and history right out of the books AND got it right.<br /><br />There is cheese as there will be in any sword and spell movie but it was funny and fit the characters.<br /><br />All in all I really enjoyed this file.<br /><br />If your looking for a fantasy Sword and magic with Dragons movie this is for you.
