During its 8 season run, this series made fun of every standard genre element. Some seasons are paced slower than others. If you plan on watching the series for the first time, you might want to start with any episode from the season 6 through season 8 range. Give it a few tries. This show will not win anyone over out of the gate on 1 viewing. But, once you see the genius of Red Dwarf, its hard not to love the show, every moment of it.<br /><br />Patrick Stewart, Picard of Star Trek fame, once commented about seeing Red Dwarf for the first time and wanting to sue Red Dwarf for ripping off Star Trek. Then ended up laughing at the scene before he could complete the call to his lawyer and becoming a fan of the show.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the best science fiction comedy ever done on television.
