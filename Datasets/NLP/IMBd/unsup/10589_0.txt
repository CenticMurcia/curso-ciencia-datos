did any part of this film make any sense to anyone at any time?? bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad film and no-one should see it. it made no sense at all but it was so funny. some of the best lines ever were in this film and the man who played duane was so twisted. i have the second and third films and this was the most screwed up out of any of these films. It ranks alongside zombi holocaust, mountain of the cannibal got, toolbox murders and the convent as the worst ever films and can anyone please shed light on the frog freak???? i didn't understand any part of this and why did they get away with it for so long.
