I don't really understand why so many people say that this is one of the greatest films. It is actually a pretty film, with an excellent style. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a good director and the film is not boring at all. However, is it a "wonderful film" as some say? I do not think so. The actors are (of course) good, but Jeunet shows us Paris as a marvelous place. And yet, I know what Paris is like, since I live in that city. And I can say that it is not the same thing at all. I do not say to jeunet to be realistic (and anyway he could not be realistic), but just to be fair with this place, which is not a real wonder.
