Jurassic Park had dinosaurs. Would you pay to see a dinosaur? -Yes, so would I. Westworld has robots which look exactly like humans pretending to be robots. Would you pay to see one of these robots? -No, neither would I.<br /><br />The whole idea is so fundamentally stupid I am left in awe. If you want to create a phoney American West (or Merrie Old England or whatever), why not just hire actors? If you wanted to visit a phoney American West (or whatever), why not go to a place where at least the people are real? The robots are less convincing and harder to work with than humans would have been; and they offer neither privacy to the client nor monetary savings to the entrepreneur, since there appears to be an army of human operators watching everything from behind the scenes. A whole squadron of technicians is required to get a mechanical prostitute to say, "Yes, squire." This is just ridiculous. Pay a human prostitute her flat fee and she'll most likely throw in a "Yes, squire" for free.<br /><br />Not just the theme park but the whole MOVIE could have been made without robots. In the end the robots rebel (sigh). But humans are capable of rebelling, too. There is, of course, a particular flavour to a robot revolt, but this flavour is absent from the film. The first few incidents that indicate that something is about to go horribly wrong aren't creepy at all - at that stage the audience is still stuck behind the first hurdle of, "What is the POINT of this theme park, anyway?"<br /><br />When things DO go horribly wrong it's curiously difficult to care. Clearly they were trying for the feel later captured by "The Terminator" - just as clearly, they failed. It could be because we have been given no reason to be even mildly interested in the main protagonist. We tend to forget about him entirely when he's not directly before our eyes. I forgot about him myself until just now. Who is he, again?
