A group of about 14 of us sat around recently to watch this new version. When it was all over, we all sat around and wondered how such talented group of people and big budget could produce such a laughably bad production?<br /><br />Wooden acting, effects just for the sake of having effects, and the ghost of Christmas Future... The 1984 George C. Scott versions black robed figure of the ghost of things yet to come gives a chill no matter how many times I watch the movie. This new version had us all laughing out loud. We expected to see Fozzy Bear or Kermit the Frog pop out from behind his giant red flashlight eyes. Very sad.<br /><br />If you see one version, get the 1984 George C. Scott adaptation. It is excellent.
