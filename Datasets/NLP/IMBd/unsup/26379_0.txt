This for me has got to me Mel Gibson's finest directorial effort to date. From the guy who gave us The Passion Of The Chirst gives us Apocalyto! Set within the decline of the Mayan world , it tells the story of a young native who risks life and limb to save what he holds near and dear to him. From the trailers one is intrigued and thats what has really wanted me to go and check it out further, Mel Gibson does a masterful job of doing research on the life , times and languages of the Mayan culture (how historically accurate it actually is, that is debatable). The acting , make-up , scenery was brilliant and extra kudos for the actors for making the interaction seem so dame real! Anybody who has seen Passion of The Chirst will tell you that Gibson has a small penchant for blood and this is no exception here as we are shown blood by the loads and no holds barred violence. Rahat Fateh Ali Khan (family member of the great late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan) lends his voice for a chilling a haunting score. My only complaint was that it was a little over 2 hours long so it does require a clear, rigid mind if you are going to watch it however the film moves at such a fast pace your mind won't really wonder very far at all. To conclude Apocalypto may at the end of the day may just be another action movie , but having said it is an action movie which is like no other and shall leave you feeling intrigued , something that action movies hardly ever do for me. I recommend this for people who want to see something different , trust me it will be an experience!<br /><br />APOCALYTO - 8.9 OUT OF 10<br /><br />'A great civilisation is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within' - Robert Durant
