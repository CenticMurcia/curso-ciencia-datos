Jonathan Usher (Judd Nelson) asks his college buddy (friend of 20 years, hasn't seen him in a decade) Devin Bayliss (Vincent Spano) to stay with him for two weeks. Devin discovers that he has to spy and get information from Jon's stunning wife, Lydia (Jennifer O'Dell, who bears striking resemblance to a young Rebecca De Mornay). Jon believes that Lydia is trying to make him go crazy so he'll be committed and then she will inherit his money.<br /><br />This film was very well written, directed and produced by Thomas Zambeck. I think it's a decent piece of work. It's got an interesting and original story. At times it's boring and some scenes drag on for far too long, but it has it's moments. Some scenes should have been cut down or omitted completely.<br /><br />The acting, considering the main players are unknowns, is very well done. That shows a good talent in the area of directing. There's a twist, sorta, for people who can't catch early on that it's a ploy done by Devin and Lydia. I predicted early that it was them working together and having an affair. That's not to take away from the entertaining film it is.<br /><br />I did enjoy the movie. I felt it did drag on a bit, but it was still entertaining. It had a very interesting opening. I liked the special effect where it was signifying a flashback using black and white, but it showed color in Judd's wardrobe. It reminded me of "Sin City".<br /><br />For the most part, Jennifer's good look and character's seductive advances, is the reason I stayed interested. Lydia's attractiveness is very important. I can't have sympathy and care for a character in danger of being killed off if they aren't good looking (or if they aren't good looking, their personality has to be good). Since Lydia was good looking, I was able to care for her character when she became in danger of being killed by Jon. Ironically, I found myself caring more about the well-being of Lydia and Devin -- the antagonists of the film.<br /><br />It's not a perfect film, but in it's defense, very few are. It must have had a low budget, which is the only guess I have as to why no big names were starring. The good things about the film is the overuse of the robe on Judd's character and the claustrophobic atmosphere of being in the house 90% of the film. Not to mention, Judd's hairstyle creates an intimidating look of "insane." I strongly think that if any of the actors in this tried to go for something bigger, they could become a top actor of modern cinema in very little time. I also think that Thomas' work on this is something that shows a lot of potential and talent. Over the next decade, I'm sure we'll see much more of him in the big blockbusters to come.
