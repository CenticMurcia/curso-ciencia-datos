I'm feeling guilty now. The comment I posted about Sharpe's Battle before wasn't objective. It was tainted by lust. I don't want to get a bad rep, so here's an OBJECTIVE comment, in context, for people who care about the quality of what they watch rather than just about the actor's looks.<br /><br />Sharpe's Battle does have a lot of strengths. For one thing, the dialogue's good. In other Sharpe films, such as Sharpe's Sword, there's something a bit fake about the interaction between the characters, but in Battle its much more convincing. There's also some really gritty fighting, particularly in the town towards the end. Sharpe's fight with Loup is excellent, although I do agree with another review I read somewhere here in that the expressions of the characters when they hate each other has echoes of lust as well. Perhaps we could draw a lot into this about how love hurts. Being over forty years old and still not knowing that much about love in the true sense of the word, I will refrain from stereotyping what I don't understand.<br /><br />The problem with Battle, in my opinion, is Loup himself. He's not a villain on the same scale as some of the ones we see around. Sure, he tries to be evil, but he just ends up being vaguely annoying. Oh, and why doesn't he attack Sharpe sooner? Surely he realises that he has him by the balls most of the time?<br /><br />My score of 8 out of 10 stands, but hopefully I've explained it a bit better now.
