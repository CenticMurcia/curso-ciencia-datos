Quite simply, this movie should have gone straight to DVD. All horror movies of the same Hollywood cash-in repetition should, but like many before it this had a theatrical release.<br /><br />I caught it on DVD, not in the cinema, and I wasn't impressed at all.<br /><br />For starters, to me, if you have a budget with which to make a film, why choose this concept. An island that has been completely emptied and overthrown by normal looking dogs, but which a few teens (played by adults) can survive on...It's daft, and I bet even the makers realised this when they played back their footage of close ups of cute doggies eyes.<br /><br />There are a few "jumpy bits", but you can make people jump with no budget what so ever, and this by no means makes up for the moody, unlikeable underdeveloped characters that I almost wanted to die. The lead role of Nicki by Michelle Rodriguez hardly pulled the film up, she seemed not to realise she was the one all quality, emotion and interest relied on and just fell in with the crowd of moody generic teenagers.<br /><br />The scenes in which the dogs physically and strategically attacked were laughable, they were basically things happening that no dog could ever do, (such as a plane being untied and drifting away) , with a few dogs sat around, cutely relaxing.<br /><br />Acting, bad (mediocre by Michelle R.), script, daft and unnecessary, music, generic unoriginal American "oh my god oh my god!" movie horror music.<br /><br />Don't bother unless you're forced. There's plenty of really good movies out there for you to watch, and they'll take the same amount of time and effort.<br /><br />3/10
