Now you know when a film has you and is entertaining. Usually for me the indications are....1) I'm not bored 2) I'm not yawning 3) i don't have to make an excuse to goto to the toilet even when I don't need to. This film did not have me doing any of these things.<br /><br />John Woo during the early to mid 90's had a range of good films in Hollywood before he went stupid during the 2000's. This along with Hard Target, Face/Off, Once a Thief and Mission Impossible 2 was one of them.<br /><br />From the get go this movie had Woo written all over it....the slow motion shots, the double guns, John Travolta, and the Mexican stand off - although this time with a gun and a knife. From the opening boxing match, to the underground nuclear explosion and the climax on the train this movie thrilled.<br /><br />Admittedley, as other commentators have pointed out...this is a run of the mill action movie which is elevated by John Woo, Travolta and Slater to above average. I hate to say this but I could watch this a second time and still not get bored with it.<br /><br />Overall, this movie did do it for me. Great to have a pizza and a six pack on a Saturday night DVD fest with the guys.
