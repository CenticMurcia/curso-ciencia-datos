i was very surprised that this film was as good as it was. it had some amazing effects like a guy getting his leg cut off and charlie (who was a very very cool guy) gets shot in the belly with a shotgun a couple of times and you see a massive hole in him. the final sewer scenes were great as was the bit with charlie in the market place. very good film.<br /><br />7/10
