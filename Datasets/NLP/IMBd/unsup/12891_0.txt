Though not a great movie,but very near, a very satisfying film about a summer at a California beach. Centering around Sam Eliot, a lifer lifeguard. This movie is most profound. Is Rick Carlson a child for foregoing responsibility or is he a martyr? On the surface , what seems like a shallow film takes us to the deep end of the ocean. Rick Carlson is perfectly happy and content being a lifeguard as opposed to being involved with more lucrative opportunities, that I shall not reveal here. He is as much a blue collar worker, albeit a chick magnet , being a lifeguard , as he is genuine , true to himself. Throw in a wet behind the ears Parker Stevenson as his sidekick, learning the ropes lifeguard and forever horny typical teen male, but harmless 'Machine gun', a regular on the beach and you have a fine cast of characters. Kathleen Quinlan, very young , is a confused teen , that seemingly has it all , but not. This is a psychological film , in many ways , and gets one to think. Going through life is not easy and this film has the characters pondering choices in their lives. A very '70s' effort and fitting that it is smack in the middle of this particular decade, none the less, a great film that takes you back.Salute to this great cast , including Anne Archer. I would be remiss if I did not mention her acting performance. Reminiscing has never felt so good.
