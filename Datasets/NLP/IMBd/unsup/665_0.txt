First of all our friend Mike is absolutely right about Elsa. I definitely recommend it, even if just to watch this goddess. :D<br /><br />Nevertheless I think you (Mike) should try to watch it again. Preferently not during Frightfest. The photography is quite good, and the landscape and historic placement are very good. The script is not really dense. But I think great films are made out of details and photography, and not out of phenomenal scripts.<br /><br />My "8" may be overvalued. I couldn't help. I love Galicia. I'm just disappointed with the fact the film is not spoken in Galego, but rather in English. I would give it "7". The bonus is for encouragement.<br /><br />If you liked this try to watch this short: "I'll see you in my dreams".<br /><br />Até à próxima.
