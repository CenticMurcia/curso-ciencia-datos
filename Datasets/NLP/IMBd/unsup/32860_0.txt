CSI has been my favorite show since it first aired. The plots are interesting, but the element that keeps me coming back every week is the chemistry among the diverse characters. The keystone character is Grissom. I hope he is only on a vacation, because the show falls flat without him. The chemistry is less than that between me and my ex-husband.<br /><br />The writers err in their assumption that they can make the new guy...Kessler?....interesting to viewers by giving him a mystery. Because he has all the appeal of a featureless cardboard cutout, I don't care why somebody is trying to get hold of him.<br /><br />Please bring back Grissom! SOON!
