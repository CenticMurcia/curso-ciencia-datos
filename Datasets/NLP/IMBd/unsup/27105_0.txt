The wonderful thing about this film is that it stands up to repeated viewings by default - You really have to view it several times just to understand what the heck is going on. The payoff is not only getting a grip on the ultimate battle between the black lectroids (good guys) and the red lectroids (bad guys), but you are also treated to picking up on new gags and jokes (actually more like bits of humor - to wit: Who in their right mind would build a jet car out of an Econoline Van???) and subtle plot devices which were previously overlooked. One criticism that makes this a less than perfect movie (although I rated it a 10 because it's just so way out there) is the audio track, which seems to be mixed way too low on my copy of the video, making it a struggle to hear what's being said over background noise, music, and tape hiss. Maybe this is just another of the clever plot devices to keep you tuning in to the adventure. By the way - does anyone have an extra Oscillation Overthruster they can spare?<br /><br />"Laugh while you can, Monkey Boy!"<br /><br />I'm out.
