Greetings again from the darkness. No doubt headed into this one with inflated expectations of greatness. While the basic theme fascinates me, the execution of the storyline just didn't quite keep my interest. Mostly I just kept asking why. Why do so few people realize what is happening? Why is BB attracted to Cate Blanchett's character (most guys would have run away)? Why is Cate's character attracted to BB (he seems quite dull)? <br /><br />David Fincher is a stud director with a resume that includes Zodiac, Fight Club and Seven. He seems to do what he can with Eric Roth's adaptation of Fitzgerald's short story ... I just felt it needed more detail and more happenings. Our only real glimpse of BB's travels are on the tug boat and those are probably the highlight of the film, next to the uniqueness of the make-up and special effects. Contrast this to the far superior Forrest Gump, also penned by Mr. Roth.<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays the role in a disarmingly quiet mode, while Cate Blanchett and Tarij P Henson go overboard. The New Orleans setting and other set design were outstanding. The flashback scene from the hospital death bed is given a nice twist with Katrina bearing down. Seems to be a movie many would enjoy, I had just hoped for a bit more.
