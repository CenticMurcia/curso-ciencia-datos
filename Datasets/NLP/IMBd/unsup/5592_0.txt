One of my friends (Alex Harkin) showed me this film and throughout the whole feature, it lacked story and entertainment. When going to see a film you always have a set expectation in mind and in this case I was expecting to be viewing a film about surfing. (The film was about a group of 3 guys who face different problems involving army enrollment, etc.)Therefore the feature "did not" define a genre. For people to be able to define "big Wednesday" as a "classic", i found hard to believe. To be a viewing a film that receives high ratings worldwide. Even thought the film had its moments of shining light, it was clearly evident that the majority of crap I saw over wrote it. When there was a surfing scene it was good, and I commend the film on that behalf. Though...NOT RECOMMENDED!!!
