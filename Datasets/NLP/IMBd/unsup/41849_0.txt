I gave this film 3 out of 10 - one star for the three attractive male leads. What does that tell you about it's appeal? The story was, to put it mildly, odd. There were moments in the film that made me feel extremely uncomfortable. The writing was awful. Half way through it felt like the writer was trying to devise a new lingo in hopes of having it catch on. I don't know, maybe there are people out there that talk that way, but I certainly haven't run into any. I would advise avoidance of this film at all costs, even if your tempted to check it out just for the pretty packaging. Trust me, it's not worth the rental. Go rent "The Broken Hearts Club".
