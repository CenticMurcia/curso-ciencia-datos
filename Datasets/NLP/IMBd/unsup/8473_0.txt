as is typical of reviews of most films at IMDb, 20% or so find films reviewed here as being bad. <br /><br />Hook is no different. I never tire of seeing this film. Sure Spielberg gives us his take on the story and the "what ifs" abound, and there are imperfections. so what else is new about film-making?<br /><br />do you see any films on this website that got a 10? NO!<br /><br />no one film will EVER please everyone who watched it. so what's the point of giving your opinion? it obviously won't change the film. your opinion warns others to "stay away" from this film. "don't waste your time" blah blah blah.<br /><br />point of my diatribe? take the wonderful parts and acting and visuals and music and whatever aspects of the film you like, and ENJOY THEM.<br /><br />there are wonderful bits and pieces of Hook, and whole scenes, and the notion that people can change and try to make life better for those they may have hurt, and so on.<br /><br />this film, if you have a heart, and some of you don't, speaks to that heart and moves it and makes you thankful for those in your life who really do need you.<br /><br />am i a sentimentalist? so what if I am! get over it. and get a life.
