Bloody, gory and well photographed slasher flick. Acting is atrocious, but cast features a score of knockout beauties. There will be a few empty chairs at graduation. Kim Taggart plays detective Vega, who is lead detective on a very puzzling case. A serial killer causes citizens of a small town fearful of opening their front doors...that is where he nails some of his victims. A group of popular high school students encounter a deranged killer that teaches them a few lessons. The number one person under suspicion is a traumatized loner at the school. The body count increases rapidly. Some pretty disturbing images may just be the only redeemable thing about KNOCK, KNOCK. Also featured are: Suzi Lorraine, Antonio Mastrantonio, Nicole Abisinio, Joli Julianna, Kat Castaneda, Anthony Palladino and Chris Bashinelli.
