This is the best Adam Sandler movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />I am no longer a teenager so I generally avoid Sandler's movies like the plague. Beside a couple of Penis-envy jokes this movie is actually a joy to watch in mixed company.<br /><br />Well worth your time.<br /><br />If this is some of Jack Nicholson rubbing of on Sandler I look forward to Sandler's next movie.<br /><br />Nicholson is completely over the top with his role.<br /><br />Rating 8/10 for a comedy. 10/10 for a Sandler comedy.
