I don't remember much of the plot of this one, probably because most of my memories of that experience are probably repressed. Until this point in my life, I didn't think it was possible to effectively torture someone with sight and sound alone.<br /><br />One of my college teachers showed this to our class for reasons which to this day I don't even begin to ponder. I do remember that perhaps a third of the class was asleep throughout most of the `films' duration. Personally, I'm not the type to sleep through ANY movie unless I'm extremely tired, but I did find out that choosing to stare at the ceiling or ground for three hours was at least as interesting as looking straight ahead to the projected image.<br /><br />Unfortunately I still heard it.
