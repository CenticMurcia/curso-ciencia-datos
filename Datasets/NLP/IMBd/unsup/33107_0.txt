Mick Malloy needs to crawl under a rock and expire. Crackerjack is the only movie I've ever walked out on. Boytown comes a close second for worst movie ever, let alone worst Australian film.<br /><br />Seriously, who is financing this crap? Please, to the AFC, FFC and any other financiers, DO NOT waste any more money forcing us to see Mick Malloy on our TV and movie screens...p l e a s e! 'the reason that the movie is so "Badly Acted" is that it's supposed to be taking the mickey out of the music industry'. No, the reason it's badly acted is because these people cannot act! An awful awful movie. Don't waste your money on this pile of stink.<br /><br />If you like this movie, I can recommend a good therapist.
