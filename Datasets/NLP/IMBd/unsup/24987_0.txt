A lot of people have forgotten how to have a good time over the years. This movie brings it all back with its witty humour and an original plot.<br /><br />Before Mike Myers began completely embarrassing himself with the third instalment of Austin Powers, he played many a great character. This movie is not to be missed. A 9/10 in my books.
