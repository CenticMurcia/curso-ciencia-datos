The British-produced Andrew V. McLaglen actioneer "Ffolkes," based on Jack Davis' novel "Esther, Ruth and Jennifer," gives Roger Moore a refreshingly different, change-of-pace role. As Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes, Moore is both ill-tempered and egotistical. He despises women, adores cats, and prefers to drink his Scotch neat. If Ffolkes claims that he can do something, he will-by the Lord God HarryÂ—do it! Everything about "Ffolkes" goes against the grain of the typical, well-mannered, saintly Moore image. First, the James Bond star sports a thick beard, knits when thinking, and refuse to be proved wrong. Evidently, Roger Moore had a grand time playing Ffolkes because this qualifies as his most robust, forceful portrayal in years. His face and his eyes are wildly expressive throughout all 99 minutes of this adrenalin-laced, nail-biting thriller.<br /><br />Davis scripted the action from his own adventure novel. Esther is the name of the transfer ship that supplies Ruth, the oil drilling rig, and Jennifer is the gargantuan production rig. Masquerading as journalists, the villainous Lou Kramer (Anthony Perkins of "Psycho") and henchmen Harold Shulman (Michael Parks), board Esther, brandish this hardware and hijack it. Kramer's second-in-command sets explosives throughout the ship and connects them to a detonator box that can signal the destruction of not only Esther but also the charges set on Ruth and Jennifer. As it turns out, Jennifer is the largest production rig on any sea, reputed to cost over $250 million dollars! Kramer warns British authorities, including a Thatcher-like Prime Minister (Faith Brook), that they have 24 hours to pay a ransom of $25 million in five currencies. If the British Crown refuses to fork over, Kramer threatens to blast Esther, Ruth and Jennifer, along with himself and his henchmen, and more than 600 innocent people aboard the rigs and ship off the face of the earth. The entire North Sea will be polluted and the coasts ruined.<br /><br />Andrew V. McLaglen, who helmed "Ffolkes," is a seasoned professional at making adventure epics. He began his career as a television director, making episodes of "Rawhide" with Clint Eastwood. Afterward, he graduated to feature films and made a string of rough & tumble John Wayne westerns, starting with "McClintock!" Among the others were "The Undefeated," "Chism," and "Cahill, U.S. Marshal." Between the Wayne oaters and "Ffolkes," McLaglen helmed the gritty Charlton Heston & James Coburn western "The Last Hard Men as well as two other Roger Moore yarns "The Wild Geese" and "The Sea Wolves." Most of "Ffolkes" was lensed on location in the North Sea where the story takes place. McLaglen seems to improve with his material. His war movies were exciting, suspenseful, and clever. They move at an incredibly fast pace and are no-nonsensical. Of course, believability is optional in the Davies' script. McLaglen and Davis both know that superior thrillers follow a formula in which things go from bad to worse before the finale. And our stiff-upper lipped hero doesn't have an easy time thwarting the nefarious, loud-mouthed Kramer.<br /><br />As for Ffolkes' nemesis Kramer, Anthony Perkins shouts and waves his pistol with his sinister, steely-eyed glare that is enhanced by his lean, ascetic features and dark, close-cropped hair. He is a man not to be trifled with. Audacious greed motivates Kramer and his cohorts to hijack the ship and hold the rigs for ransom. Ingenious, conceited, and menacing as Kramer is, Perkins doesn't have as much to work with in his characterization as Moore.<br /><br />As the British Admiral forced to deal with Kramer and company, James Mason turns in a crusty performance. Mason's Admiral Sir Francis Brindsen is a stalwart, career naval officer whose contempt for Ffolkes and the man's unconventional methods is matched only by his deep, abiding mistrust of anything that is neither military nor naval. Michael Parks, late of TV's "Then Came Bronson," is Kramer's second-in-command. His characterization is confined to his thick-lensed spectacles, a pistol, and a tan trench coat.<br /><br />Ffolkes runs a small but efficient group of mercenaries that he trains ruthlessly to perform miracles under the worst conditions. He concocts a plan that hinges on split-second timing and calculated risks. The only quibbles that I had with this movie is that it's miniatures stand out more on the small screen than on the big-screen. Michael J. Lewis provides a stirring orchestral score that ramps up the suspense. Nevertheless, "Ffolkes" ranks as a first-class, crackerjack thriller.
