Home in Indiana is a wonderful movie. I saw this on AMC when I was a kid and still remember it. It's a film about a troubled youth who comes to live on his aunt and uncles farm. At first he doesn't want to be there but then he makes some friends and eventually gets involved in some kind of chariot horse racing. The music score and talent makes this film a classic. Another movie called April Love, with Pat Boone and Shirley Jones , came out about 20 years after Home in Indiana and copied the premise of the movie. Jeanne Crain is the one I remember most in this film, I think it was her second film. I think Fox released this movie and I hope they release this timeless movie on DVD soon, along with other Jeanne Crain films.
