Car Wash seems to have been an idea for a hit soundtrack first, the movie was an after-thought. The story concerns a bunch of different characters who work at an LA car wash. The problem is there are way too many characters. By the time you can finally remember all of their names, the movie is over. And, unfortunately, most of the "comic" situations they encounter aren't at all funny. Richard Pryor appears in a glorified cameo but his comic talents aren't used at all. Only the final scene of the film in which Lonnie tries to stop Abdula from robbing the shop had me interested. Otherwise the film is as cluttered and messy as dead flies on a windshield.
