I love European films because of keeping their nativity and don't looking forward to earn money. Most of them are still an "art", not like Hollywood-made ones.<br /><br />And this one is the best comedy i've ever seen. There are everything! From tears, to freedom, from sadness, to boyishness. I couldn't stop laughing almost all the movie time (exept those, few sad episodes), and i couldn't stop laughing an hour after the movie! Excellent actors, excellent acting, excellent episodes, everything was excellent! I'm so exited, that i'll have to wait a bit of time, till i bring myself to watch another comedy. And i loved those few and short dialogs, because actors were so expressive that words were dispensable, to understand, what they want to say.<br /><br />I hope you'll enjoy this movie, just like i did.
