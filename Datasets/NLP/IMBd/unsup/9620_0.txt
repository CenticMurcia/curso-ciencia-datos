I really enjoyed this movie because I just sat back and listened. Dissection is no fun in film. This is a breezy romp rather than ART! I laughed and had a good time. I enjoyed Cary Grants early performance and adored Grace Moore's singing. Ailene McMahon was a regular Eve Arden pre the spunky Eve herself. The odd part is that Grace plays an Australian opera singer with her American accent while Cary Grant plays an American with his English accent. Miss Moore needs to find a way into the country since she doesn't have permission to enter the states. The border guards must have been much tougher in the 1930's! If you can get your hands on this film just sit back, relax and enjoy.
