Simply a great movie. Michael J. Fox trained with one of the greats, Johnny Petraglia for months in preparation for this movie. Fox went from a hack casual bowler to a respectable 175 average. Not good enough to actually throw the shots he was supposed to throw in the movie, though. The makers of Kingpin and Big Lebowski should have seen this one before making a mockery of the game. Any bowling lover should not miss this one.
