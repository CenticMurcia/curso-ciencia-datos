Bud and Lou in their first starring film enlist in the army to escape being arrested for selling ties without a licence. The police officer ends up as their sergeant.<br /><br />Meanwhile a spoilt playboy and his long suffering valet also enlist. The playboy's dad is an Army bigshot and therefore thinks he can escape doing his service. His Dad has other ideas and makes him stay to make a man out of him. Both men fall for the same girl. The Playboy has a lot to learn about Loyalty.<br /><br />This is a good Abbott and Costello flick that propelled the boys to superstardom. They perform some great routines and they are both hilariously funny. The Andrews sisters provide very memorable songs. The boys have great chemistry here.
