Watching this movie is a bit like eating cardboard. You can do it, but what is the point, no flavour and no nutrition.<br /><br />The problems are vast, but it comes down to one thing, there is no real story. Sure it is an interesting caper...Nazi treasure in Holland that several different people are after. But the problem is that you don't get into the motivation of some of them, and certain parties really don't contribute anything to the caper.<br /><br />There is no suspense, action is as pretty boring. The characters don't develop and there is no relationship between any of them.<br /><br />My advice, is if you want to kill a script editor and get away with it, just lock them in a room with this movie and a gun. There is so much potential in the movie that any decent script editor will kill themselves after watching this movie.
