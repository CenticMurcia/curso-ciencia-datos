Let's admit it. There are movies you see just to look at an actress where she is just more beautiful than she already is. 'Cat on a hot tin roof' is such a movie for Elisabeth Taylor, as is 'Gilda' for Rita Hayworth.<br /><br />'Un inconvenient woman' is just that kind of star-vehicle for Rebecca De Mornay (a fine actress most people will know as the evil babysitter in 'The hand that rocks the cradle'). It's obvious that director Larry Elikann loves her looks, and constantly lets the camera zoom in on her radiant face, her well-shaped hands with beautiful, (very) long red nails and her magnificent figure in perfect fitting coat and skirts. I don't object, and I bet neither will most other male viewers.<br /><br />But apart from Rebecca, is this a good movie? No, not really. Firstly, it's been made for television and it's aim seems to please soap-loving people. In fact it's a lush, 'kitchy' two-part miniseries and its sentimentality is almost unbearable. Secondly, the fact that this movie's subject (SPOILER)is a waitress who because of her social status can never achieve anything in a rich men's world, but who has a heart of gold can be enough reason to leave this movie unseen.<br /><br />It's a miracle that in this kind of movie all the parts are casted perfectly with remarkable performances by Jason Kobards and Jill Eikenberry. Only Roddy McDowell in his role as a gossip journalist is nothing more than a caricature. De Mornay is outstanding as waitress Flo and levels up with Kobards as her rich older lover.<br /><br />Just because of the great acting abilities by veteran actors in combination with Rebecca De Mornay at her ultra-sexy best I can recommend this entertaining but shallow movie.<br /><br />
