Mel Gibson has created a masterpiece. This was one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in MONTHS. Ya' gotta admit... Hollywood is running out of ideas... That is why we keep seeing not only sequels, but PREquels. Mel Gibson knows how to deliver. I am a 23 year old female who hates movies that seek to nauseate the audience with gruesome & bloody scenes... This movie did not do that though. It is no harsher than Braveheart or even Passion of the Christ. Apocalypto was fabulous! Sure, there were some pretty intense scenes, but the movie would not have been complete without them. It's what helps tells the story. Apocalypto is a TRUE piece of art, a TRUE storyline, TRUE acting, TRUE suspense, TRUE feelings.... The BEST movie I have seen in a realllllyyyyyy long time. Those 2 hours are the best 2 hours you will spend watching a movie. If you want a movie that will put you at the edge of your seat in suspense... a movie that gets you involved & entertains like none other - with an eventful & meanfingful storyline, see Apocalypto!! FABULOUS. I can't wait to see how Mel Gibson's next project turns out.
