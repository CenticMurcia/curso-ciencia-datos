Afterdark Horrorfest are the best B-Movies I've ever seen.It has it's crappers(The Hamiltons, Nightmare Man, Crazy Eights), but they make up for it with wonderful movies like Mulberry Street.This is yet another great movie in the Afterdark Horrorfest 8 Films To Die For series, and I would say probably my 4th favorite out of all of them.It was really well executed for a B-Movie, as are all the Afterdark Horrorfest films, and I couldn't help but be so sucked into the story plot and suspense.It may have been just a little retarded, funny even, and they left some things unexplained, but hey, I was expecting less, and got a lot.Overall, MOST of all the movies in the Afterdark Horrorfest films are great and VERY underrated, and I hope for these movies to be more recognized than what they already are, which is not recognized hardly at all, because they are some really spectacular movies, and I'm looking forward to the next set that comes out.
