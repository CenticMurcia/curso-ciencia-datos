Captain Hook's retarded cousin Ben Willis comes back to finish of everybody except Julie,in case this film would become a hit,you know.He immediately thinks of a plan so cunning,so genius,so brilliant...no wait,my bad,it's the worst plan ever.<br /><br />Willis apparently found out where Julie lives and where she goes to school.Immediately,he goes to get his son out of nowhere and gets him to go to the same school and make friends with Julie.Then he fakes a radio show(I think)and lets Julie and her roommate,played by Brandy of all people,win it by guessing the capital of Brazil(to win a trip to the Bahamas,is this still making sense to you?).Meanwhile,Julie's old boyfriend who now has the promising career of ah,fish gutter or something,has to be eliminated so Willis throws a dummy in front of his car and then doesn't kill him,making room for his son who got the weird pseudonym Will Benson(wouldn't it be safer to give him a name that doesn't contain Will,Ben or son?He should have given him a name that's harder to figure out,like John Killer)and they all head to the Bahamas.So Ben is now paying for their holidays or something?Yeah,that'll teach them.<br /><br />When they arrive,turns out it's the rain season.Why would a radio station give people tickets to the Bahamas in the rain season?Can't they just like,call the station and try to change the date or something?Freddie Prinze Jr.(he has a name,but unlike Ben,I don't still know)also heads for the Bahamas right after waking up from a coma or something to save the day and he kills Ben once and for all,after Ben killed his own son by accident,cos he apparently never watched pro-wrestling.<br /><br />So the happy bunch returns and then Ben attacks Julie in her apartment.I hate to be a wise-ass,but why didn't he do that all along?Why putting in the whole Bahama-thing,which actually complicated everything?On the other hand,I didn't go to psychopatic weirdo-university.My parents were all like,we think it's too expensive for learning so little. This movie is utterly insane,but amazingly,I still don't like it.It's just hard to enjoy a movie about Jennifer Love Hewitt not being killed I guess.
