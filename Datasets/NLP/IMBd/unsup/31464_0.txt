***Contains SPOILERS**** This episode left an indelible impression on me as a child. I remembered many details from it and was amazed when I saw it years later.<br /><br />IT'S WONDERFUL!!!! This Ray Bradbury story is extremely chilling and beautifully executed (pun intended). It's superbly acted--Pat Buttram gracefully heads a remarkable cast of actors. George Lindsey's portrayal of a mentally challenged man is sensitive and heart wrenching. William Marshall (Blackula, Dr. Daystrom from Star Trek) is deep and visceral.<br /><br />Each character is given a chance to say what they "see" in The Jar and it's an actor's playground and a audience delight.<br /><br />One of the reason I enjoy shows like this so much is that actors who were relegated to bread and butter roles that they could phone in (like George Lindsey as Goober Pyle in Mayberry RFD) got to show their tremendous range and versatility. These are NOT one note actors so give 'em more than one note to sing.<br /><br />If you see no other Alfred Hitchcock episode ever, see this one! They you'll be remembering it 40 years later!
