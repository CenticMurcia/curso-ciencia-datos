Spoilers <br /><br />The phrase Jennifer Connelly Wow can be found all over the internet. Hollywood had never seen the likes of Jennifer Connelly before. She is an incredible beauty. I write this 18 years after this movie came out and she still is the hottest woman in Hollywood. <br /><br />The movie depicts a boring guy played well by Frank Whaley who becomes an all night store clerk. During his first night in the store, he meets a beautiful woman who also has some boredom issues coupled with anger at her father. They get locked in the store, for the night. Along the way we find out that he tells tall tales about himself to make himself feel important. He is known around town as the "Town Liar". A couple little kids follow him around, because they think he's important. She knows all of this because of the rumors about him. Then she tells him he can change his life. She suggests running away together.<br /><br />Enter a couple robbers, one of whom is played by Dermott Mulrooney. The robbers hold these two captive and attempt to plunder the store. Frank Whaley's character comes through with a plan and foils and captures these robbers. Then he leaves town with Jennifer's character, but not before he stops in town to show off the woman he's leaving with. The little kids who had been following Frank character around, also say "WOW" when they see her.
