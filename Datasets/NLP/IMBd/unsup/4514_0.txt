While on some levels it was very nice to see this genre take an older audience and characters as opposed to twenty-somethings, I think it was a little too much gush and not enough substantial script. It was amusing to hear a 54 year-old woman talk graphically about sex and get in amusing situations that are normally reserved for "American Pie" types, but it was too sappy and WAY too over-the top. In one scene, they are discovered by her college age daughter as they are in the middle of coupling. In another, she is trying on a "device" when Christopher and his mother come over to visit. I do not fit into what I imagine is the target audience in age. I did, however, go with some people who were: They liked it even less than me. While sweet and comedic. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Sorry, try again. Wait. Never try... Never try again...
