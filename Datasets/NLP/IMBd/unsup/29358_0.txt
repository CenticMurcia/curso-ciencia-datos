SPOILER ALERT! A group of researchers travel to a remote island of the English coast to investigate the brutal murders of three Americans. They uncover a half-dead man, his completely dead wife and their cycloptic son. Also in the mix is an ancient ruin where sacrifices have taken place. A real piece of junk directed by Jim O'Connolly. The island, in long shots, is a miniature and the whole film is decidedly, and obviously, studio-bound. The cast is a bland mix of no-names save for Jill Haworth, slumming it after working with the likes of Preminger, Marais and (on Broadway) Hal Prince. Anna Palk, a Stephanie Beacham lookalike, adds some spark as a bitchy pothead. As bad as they come.
