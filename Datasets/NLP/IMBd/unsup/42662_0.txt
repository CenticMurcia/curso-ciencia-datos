Spoilers? Maybe...<br /><br />OK! Take a good company, darken the room, get some popcorn, and you will ready for the most incredible journey of your life! Imagine a chase begins by car, continues by truck, and ends by wheelchair.(Yes, I wrote: wheelchair!!!) This is one of the funniest movie, I've ever seen. Well... the only problem is, it isn't supposed to be a comedy! But if you have some free hours at night (at night the movie is better, remember: "Midnight Ride"), and you want to laugh with some company (three or five, maybe six people), try this film! Company is necessary, not because of the thrill, or something like that, just because if you're alone, nobody will believe you! So try it!
