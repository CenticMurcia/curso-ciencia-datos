First off, I've got to say this is half way ridiculous. This shows you how lazy these actors and actresses really are (Yeah Simon, I'm talking' to you!) because I think 3 or 4 were actually the "real" actors' voices. For example, Puss In Boots, the same actor that played him in the actual movie sang for this. On the other hand, Fiona's singing voice was not Cameron Diaz! Pathetic! Oh and my favorite, you vote for a bad one, supposedly "Simon" is singing, but what can you expect, it's not really him! What's the matter with that piece of trash? Does he really think he's that important to where he can judge but not sing? I think not! Wake up people! They could definitely do better than that! I mean seriously, even if Simon can't sing good, it would've been awesome to hear him attempt it! Bottom line, this was disgusting!
