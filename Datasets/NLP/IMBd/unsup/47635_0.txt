Interesting premise, but poor ending. Dean Stockwell explains to the family that the aliens can easily track them whenever they use a credit card, etc. The aliens find the family several times.<br /><br />Near the end, after the battle with the aliens at Stockwell's home, the family and Stockwell leave in Stockwell's car. Part way down the driveway, Stockwell passes the father a couple grenades and tells him to blow up the alien's cars, which the father does.<br /><br />The aliens can be clearly seen still standing around, alive and well, yet for some strange reason the family and Stockwell think they will all be safe from that point on. Why? They could see the live aliens in the rear view mirror.<br /><br />The family moves into a new home and the movie ends with a black car pulling up in front of the new home. Knowing the aliens were not dead, and knowing they had easily tracked the family earlier, it was no surprise they found the family again.<br /><br />One other annoying little thing seen so much in movies. When one of the aliens had been shot or otherwise injured and was lying flat on his back, Stockwell went over, squatted down and practically stuck his face in the face of the alien to check it (the alien) out. Gosh, I wondered what would happen next. Of course the alien suddenly reached up and grabbed Stockwell. Surprise, surprise!
