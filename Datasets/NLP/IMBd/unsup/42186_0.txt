I must admit, I had high hopes for this movie. I saw that Bob Saget was directing, and thought I was in for some ridiculous, dirty humor. However, this was not the case. Bob Saget played the sensitive, boring penguin and was quite disappointing. Besides this let down, the movie was just not funny. The low production quality didn't bother me, I just didn't find much of it to be funny. In the whole hour and ten minutes, there were probably 2 or 3 funny parts, most of them involving cameos. The only thing that saved me from giving this one star was the narration by Samuel L. Jackson, which was great at times. Don't waste your time or money on this boring movie.
