Going into Muzan E I was well aware that it's a nasty flick and that my copy had no subtitles. Well both are incredibly true. It's actually one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. During the first 15 minutes of so I was dying for subtitles. Nothing of great importance was happening visually, but there was a soft-spoken reporter talking pretty much nonstop. It definitely would have been nice to hear what she was saying. Anyways, it's not a difficult movie to follow and the story goes something like this: Female reporter investigating really nasty sex tapes. She eventually gets her hands on a big scoop, meaning a really, really nasty tape. Reporter and crew decide to delve deeper into the scene and nasty things follow. I was actually pleasantly surprised where they went with this film.<br /><br />Muzan E is a sick film, that only people with weird tastes should watch. I'd describe the movie as pretty gory, but the weird thing is almost all the shots are blurred so you can't see much detail....thinking back on this it was probably a good thing. Anyways, the movie starts off slow, but steadily builds up speed and your attention. If you're looking for a f'ed up film, just check out Muzan E. 7.5 outta 10
