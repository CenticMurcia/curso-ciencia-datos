This Mack Sennet produced comedy starred W. C. Fields and it was deliberately constructed like an old fashioned stage melodrama--complete with the same type music, sets and entrances. The concept was kind of funny, but after a while the single joke got kind of thin. However, there was an eventual payoff, as the ending of the film was terrific.<br /><br />The story begins with Fields singing an annoying and bad song about the evils of strong drink(?!). This is where the title of the film was derived, but about 80% of the short occurred after this and was unrelated to the song, other than the fact it was all told as a giant morality tale against vice.<br /><br />Not bad, but certainly not up to the standards of such Fields full-length classics as IT'S A GIFT and THE BANK DICK.
