not even close to a horror film. therefore, i'm not even sure why this was included in the brentwood DVD pack, but it was. so again, here i was expecting to be scared, when i was just plain bored. this about as much of a 'horror' flick as was Scream. i really hate it when it Hollywood misadvertises like that.<br /><br />this is way more of a suspense than anything. uma thurman fans will also apply, but will need to beware just in case. <br /><br />the film looks older than what it is. and i always found that weird how Hollywood also lock away films for years and then releasing them whenever. great score though.
