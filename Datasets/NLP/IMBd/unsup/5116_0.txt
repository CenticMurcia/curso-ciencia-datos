the Plot Summary is wrong ,the Germany militar from the third story of the movie is not in Brazil, he is located in Buenos Aires Argentina , anyway the locations doesn't look at all like Buenos Aires , there is no doubt it was filmed in other place , everything is wrong , Argentine people don't look like Mexican and do not sing "cielito,,,"(typical Mexican song) in the restaurants, the national music in Argentina is tango, very disappointing , i guess that the director didn't know much about this culture , and the person who made the plot summary didn't see the movie very well . i didn't see the other stories, just the last , and it was enough to understand is not a masterpiece from the creator of twilight zone , it looks too that people voting didn't found the movie like something great ,
