This was an awesome movie and it is highly recommended from me. Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel are outstanding in their roles as father and son. The story is this. When John (Caviezel) finds his dad's old ham radio in a closet he plugs it in not really caring about it. But when he starts talking to a guy who he dosen't know he becomes interested in him and minutes later discovers that he is talking to his dad, who has been dead for thirty years. He starts to try to convince his dad that it is him, his 36 year old son, but the dad does not believe him. The son suddenly discovers that he is talking to his dad 2 days before he dies! He tries to save him and talks to him about not trusting his instincs but suddenly loses contact and does not know if his dad had heard what he said. Plenty of twists and turns in this story to keep you into it. Quaid and Caviezel give powerful performances and the movie is facinating and awesome. Great idea from the director. One of the best movies I've ever seen!<br /><br />**** out of ****
