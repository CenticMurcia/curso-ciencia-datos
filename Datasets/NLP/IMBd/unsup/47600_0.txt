Garrison Keillor has wildly overestimated his talent as a writer. I'm a HUGE fan of the APHC radio show, but this is a poorly-written, meandering, boring movie that seems to be created solely so that GK can rub elbows with Hollywood royalty. I'm a closet News from Lake Wobegon fan (I have listened to all of them) and most of the dialogue and jokes were lifted from old "News from Lake Wobegon" segments. Maybe that's okay & maybe that's what you're after, but I was looking to be entertained and during this movie it simply did not happen. <br /><br />It had no story (a show being cancelled is not a story) and a weak, meaningless ending. The characters, while interesting, bear NO resemblance to the ones described on so many precious APHC broadcasts. These characters seem awash in a sea of bad dialogue as they search in vain for a story.<br /><br />And the posters who talk about how if I don't like this movie, I must "not be intelligent enough to understand it" are just flat wrong. I am intelligent, I love the radio show, and I can't figure out why anyone would like this movie.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but suffice to say, avoid this film.
