Getting better in some ways and worst in others. David Zucker started with Scary movie 3 after the Wayans brothers stop making sequels. Scary movie 2 was crowned as one of 2001's worsts movies. Scary movie 3 (DAVID ZUCKER)was much better than the 2nd part so we expected much more from scary movie 4. Scary movie seems to be divided into to parts: scary movie 1 and 2 directed by Wayans brothers and scary movie 3 and 4 directed by David Zucker. Two completely different styles. Scary movie 3 was surprising! Laughs since the beginning until the end but was too short.<br /><br />Scary movie 4 is just worst. Less laughs but the copies of other terror films as the grudge changing it into comedy is better than ever. Ana Faris is the best thing in the movie. Each time she is more stupid and her acts are excellent. I think no other actress could do it better. The parts in which Carmen Electra acts as the blind in the village are great. Much better than Scary movie 2 but worst than Scary movie 1 and 3.<br /><br />David Zucker has announced a 5th movie. I expect it better and a change in the style. A good movie to have some laughs.
