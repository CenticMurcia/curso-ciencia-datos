This movie was str8 fire, its mos definitely was ill as hell. Dope movies like this don't come out no more. They couldn't have picked better actors to play the roles given in this flick. It perfectly exhibited the life & times of this era. The acting was on cue & the psychological progression of a man going mad(2pac) was amazing, i love this movie and the soundtrack. 100% up & down, the movie was Ill. I watched this movie over 20 times & it never gets old. I only wish the movie could have been longer. The only thing i caught in this movie that was really wrong was at the end when Q is holding bishop trying to prevent him from falling...If you look very closely you'll see bishops arms is white..lol. They could have at least picked a black stunt man i laugh hard every time i see it. But other than that the movie is sick & worthwhile.
