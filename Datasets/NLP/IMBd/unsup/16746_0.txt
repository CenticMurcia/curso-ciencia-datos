With Simpsons becoming more stale every year, you can only feel sorry for Groening, watching his beloved creations becoming bland and unrealistic. His other show, Futurama was a remedy for this issue as it took his humour to a different level. It was a well constructed satire of how modern day perceive the future.<br /><br />The characters are well constructed and funny, though I think that the character we can all relate to is Fry. Fry just feels so real, he is not given a crazy persona just because he is a cartoon character.<br /><br />Granted the show had a similar animation as the Simpson's which may have created some sceptics (I was one!), But in the end it is a show which always had a fresh joke that very rarely relying on the characters traits to make it funny. It is a well written series which in some way captures the same quality of the 90's Simpson's episodes.<br /><br />I can't wait for the new 2010 series to start and I hope to see my favourite obnoxious robot, 'Bender' on my television screen again.
