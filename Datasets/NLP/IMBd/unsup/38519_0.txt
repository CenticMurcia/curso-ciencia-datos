For some obscene reason, I do want to see the Child's Play series. I think just for the sake that I saw the first one and something must have been special because I am curious how the series goes. One of my friends also said that I have to see "Bride" and "Seed" for the Chucky series, but I didn't want to see those without understanding maybe a few things I missed in the third or second Child's Play.<br /><br />Some silly deaths occur in this movie, like the teacher's. I mean, did anyone look at that as more of a porn movie than a horror flick? "You've been very naughty Mrs. Kettlewell!", slapping the ruler? You'll see what I mean. I just thought that it was very funny instead of gruesome and also very unbelievable. But then again, I wasn't looking for Oscar material. I need to get back into my horror movies, I miss them so.<br /><br />3/10
