I don't think I've ever seen a show suck so hard! She might be a single mother, but a mother with a lot of money thanks to her dead husband John Gotti who you can't say ever had an actual job... I mean when you're a mobster you really don't need a job at the local supermarket to put food on the table.<br /><br />So we have this millionaire widow who's bank account is full of money they don't deserve and who can't keep her kids under control while spoon feeding them... and after all of that whacking it on TV so that the rest of the people on planet Earth know our lives will always be more meaningful...<br /><br />Although I still don't know what's more painful.. watching this show or having the mob after you...
