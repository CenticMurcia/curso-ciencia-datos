Too bad this little gem was not seen by many in the theatres for it is truly a work of art. A man gets a call from a telephone booth saying the world is going to have a nuclear war in 90 min. Is it true? Anthony Edwards, Mare Winningham and Denise Crosby all do a good job. And the excellent soundtrack by Tangerine Dream makes it even better. The ending will haunt you for days. Rent this movie!
