When the comedy channel comes out with content like this, it makes me wonder why the Canadian government forces channels to have Canadian content. Because that is the only explanation as to why this show ever existed... As filler to appease the law so the Comedy channel would have "Canadian" shows on.<br /><br />Frankly the writers are probably the worst in the history of television. If I could send them an open letter, it would beg them to retire immediately and move to Slovenia where the locals might find their off-topic humour funny.<br /><br />The case is even worse too. Elvira Kurt is painful as the host, standing there saying line one liners and praying for the audience to laugh. She should never return to television in any way shape or form. In fact, she should be the one paddling the boat of writers to Slovenia. The rest of the case should swim alongside it, because they don't even deserve a seat in the boat.<br /><br />Bad, no name guests, bad questions, bad casting, bad writing. You'd have to live in a box to have let this show run for more than one season, or you really really hate your viewers. Your pick.<br /><br />If there is divine justice, god will strike down this show.
