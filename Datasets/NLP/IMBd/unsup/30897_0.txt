This is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but its very bad, people track down a weird radio broadcast of someone yelling for help to an old house, there is a little girl with a doll that plays bad music in what I am guessing is an attempt to annoy people to death.<br /><br />People die, badly, then the little girls grave is burned....the end.<br /><br />Oh yeah, I forgot, at the end one of the characters says "She was just a normal little girl till her dad got her that doll."<br /><br />WHAT? How could this guy possibly know this?<br /><br />Awful.
