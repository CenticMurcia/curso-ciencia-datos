Carolyn was my first crush as a kid! i loved this show,watched it religiously and got very upset if it was ever preempted. one of my favorite things about Skyhawks was that it was so realistic!{no magic,super-powers or talking animals!}just competent pilots with good planes that could be injured or killed if they were,nt careful. the characters were so real that i felt like i could actually fly over to San Marcos airport and actually meet them{and fall in love with one for sure!}cap was a fine leader,and all others were very professional airmen. Carolyn was pretty,brave,and man,could she fly! i have made a large collection of models of all a/c appearing in the show along with others{corporate jets,larger helicopters,and heavy jetliners}in skyhawks colors indicating"moving up in the world" and becoming a big operation. to fellow fans-some episodes can be obtained at toontracker on VHS/DVD,and i would pay a good price{in gold!}to have the entire series. one of my most cherished childhood memories,i would be proud to fly with them anytime,i still burn a warm candle in my soul for Carolyn and always will. keep em flying!
