Killa did a hell of a job with this flic. The plot was on point, and you've got to love this kid's swag. It's basically about Cam trying to get his money up by selling weed at first, but his connect, Gordo, gets him to push that white. Typical, right? SCCCHRRREEEECH! A sudden turn of events pop off when Flea's (cam) niece gets popped (shot). Then the film gets grimy! The acting was OK, but don't ask these close-minded Scorsese-addicts. There's more than one way to act....yet you wouldn't be able to tell by these bias responses.......Certainly worth ignoring.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next flic. The film ends with a cliffhanger, intelligently setting it up for the sequel. NOW.....I now return you to your regularly scheduled 'blind hate.' U MAD? :)
