Having seen the first 2 episodes of kingdom hospital, i must say that i am already really disappointed. At first it seems like a remake of Lars Von triers "Riget" but stray of from the original, which is a lot better and much more scary.<br /><br />I agree with PenGuhWin, the story works when it follows the original, but completely falls apart when they try to change it. It could have worked but it just doesn't. <br /><br />2 seasons of Riget was made and a third was planned, but it was canceled because some of the actors died.<br /><br />By the whats up with that anteater thing.?
