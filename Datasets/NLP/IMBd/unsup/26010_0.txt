While not the best movie ever made, I found the sequel to "Hollow Man" to be very entertaining. It kept my interest going except through one part (a chase scene) which seemed too long to me. (This is based on the original book "The Invisible Man" by H.G. Wells. You can read the entire book starting here: http://www.bartleby.com/1003/1.html .)<br /><br />Solid acting was the trait throughout the whole caste which helped to keep the almost thin plot going and believable. Christian Slater as Michael Griffin, Peter Facinelli as Det. Frank Turner, and Laura Regan as Dr. Maggie Dalton all played their parts very well. 8/10<br /><br />Also some very clever ... things happened ... which gave the movie a "notch up." :)<br /><br />-LD<br /><br />_____________________________________________<br /><br />my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33
