I first rented this movie looking for a few laughs. Take as either good or bad, but I've known a lot of kids just like this. Adolescence is a time where you seek meaning, and whether your friends wore black cloaks, Fubu pants or Dead Kennedys t-shirts, everyone looks for a way to stake out their own identity. This quest for self is usually masked behind defensive mental and emotional walls. Set this to the backdrop of a socially confining small Iowa farm town, and you're able to get past the sneers and narrow vocabulary of Flip and crew. The daydream scenes of champagne-drinking diamond-clustered thug videos (that are all too common these days) prove extremely funny mainly due to their ironically realistic portrayal of similar videos. The climax of the drug buy gone sour paired with the rat race of reflection seen at the end brings a decently snug close to a movie whose plot did not meander in too many directions to begin with.
