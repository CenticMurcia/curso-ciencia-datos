This is one of those fun fluff movies that contains serious subject matter, but it plays out more blas√©. A Florida couple (Joanna Cassidy and Greg Evigan) are reunited with their daughter (Tania Saulnier) who has been missing for 16 years. But not everything is what it seems in this one.<br /><br />Victor Browne and Tania Saulnier give more memorable performances than the two leads Cassidy and Evigan. Browne in particular added some good comedic moments. But all of the actors did a great job and the film is entertaining. The locations are very beautiful and the director, Rex Piano (who also directed another good movie, Blind Injustice), did a nice job, especially in capturing some great visuals. This movie is one that is fun to watch kicked back late at night while eating nachos and drinking a beer.
