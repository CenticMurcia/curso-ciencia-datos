I remember exactly when I saw this movie. I was at one of those dollar theatres that would show a bunch of movies that had already made the rounds and I had just paid to see "Bad News Bears - Breaking Training"... I could only watch it for about 5 minutes and it was soooooooo bad I was having trouble keeping my popcorn down. So rather than ask for my dollar back, I just got up and walked into the movie they were screening next door. I wanted someone to stop me so I could tell them how bad the Bad News Bears movie was but no one did. So that is how I found myself in the movie "The Cannonball Run"... It was really funny and I was delighted to have stumbled upon it. I really hate bathroom humor but the proctologist in the ambulance really cracked me up when he put his finger out when being told he would have to examine a patient. I would recommend this movie to everyone, but males will probably enjoy it more.
