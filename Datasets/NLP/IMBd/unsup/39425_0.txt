i live in Ireland and had been looking forward seeing this for up to a year. i thought it was a so called "movie" movie but it wasn't so i kept looking into it and thought it would be funny and entertaining<br /><br />and then when watching it recently i was excited and then watching it i was shocked by its stupidity<br /><br />boring jokes, unfunny views and Andy Milonokas. it was crap<br /><br />i loved (most of) the cast and thought they would make it, not even funny per se but entertaining.<br /><br />the only good bits were with Matthew Lillard<br /><br />i would not recommend this film to anyone with as brain or pulse and it was a waist of 75 minutes and 29 seconds of mi life<br /><br />1*/10*: unbelievably poor
