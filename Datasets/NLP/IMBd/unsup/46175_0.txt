Stupid - there was a line about 4/5 of the way through the movie where the girl says something like "Let's get away from here" and I just had to respond "That's the first sensible thing anyone has said in this movie". The idea that the characters would live in such a world just didn't make sense. For the main character a normal day seemed to include having a couple of guns shoved in his face, getting badly beaten up and generally getting threatened. Just so he could earn a little money playing pool? Well, there's more to it but that's only near the end. But otherwise this seemed the general lifestyle associated with the pool players. It was just over the top to the point of being silly.<br /><br />Horrible - what a bunch of unpleasant characters. As the movie developed I came to realise there wasn't one single character I cared about, so I lost interest. I didn't really care what happened.<br /><br />Unsatisfying - I persevered in case there was a twist. There was something revealed, if not quite a twist as such, and it was feasible but by that time I didn't care, it was all too stupid and horrible and my eyes had long since glazed over. And it just didn't seem enough to deliver much impact because of a sense of contrivance. It must be very hard to pull off a complex and fragile plan involving various highly volatile and unpredictable individuals without their knowing they are part of a hustle when you can never be quite sure from day to day whether you are going to make it through to sunset. Yet the main character pulled it off. Yes, in the end, somehow it all came together and in a frenzied shoot-out all the right people got shot and the hero got away the girl. Oh.<br /><br />The movie had promise. Some very nice textured visuals in the cinematography, a capable cast, a bold start which presented lots of intriguing questions. But it all fizzled. Not really worthy bothering with.
