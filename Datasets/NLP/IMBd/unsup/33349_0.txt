Many of the recent cartoons like "Bratz " "Trollz " or the infamous "all grow up "start to became annoying stories about pre -teens that keeps talking about stupid things that nobody cares about the drama of being a teen or their obsession to be "cool ". Well , "Rocket Power " was the first in start with this stupid tendency , and maybe for that reason it is the most annoying and boring cartoon of all the time . Seriouslly ,in what the hell were thinking the writers of this garbage? That just because the main characters of this show are a bunch of animated posers that keep surfing all the day people would consider this show "cool" ? could say many reason why I hate this show ,itis stupid ,corny ,poorly animated ,the music is horrible ,the characters are annoying and many things ,but I guess that would be obvious . I'm glad that when I was a kid I have better shows to see , this is just a stinker without redemption . I would give it a zero if I could . This sucks !
