1 night. 5 cab drivers, 5 fares, 5 different cities.<br /><br />5 stories pass between passenger and driver as one of the worlds best contemporary directors Jim Jarmusch takes us around the world and back, in stories about cultural adaptation, following your bliss, sex and death, and the depths of love and... pain, some in more detail than others. The last two with the priest and the "saddest story in the world" stand out the clearest in my mind.<br /><br />Alternately funny and reflective, but always entertaining, this is definitely Jarmusch' most accessible, and also one of his most compelling. Great film maker, and great moment for "world cinema".
