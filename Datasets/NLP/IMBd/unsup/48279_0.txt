While watching "Hellbreeder" on DVD, I was really trying to understand what was happening on the screen. I decided to stop the movie for a moment and read the cover of the DVD seeking a hint. However, the only thing that I could notice is that the directors and writer apparently were under effect of acid or LSD when they wrote and shot the film, and the images are probably based on a bad trip. This movie is simply awful, among the worst I have ever seen. There are very few lines, and the plot is a complete mess. Further, I can not understand why this flick is tagged "horror" - actually "Hellbreeder" is horrible and dreadful, a waste of time. My vote is one (awful).<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Labirinto do Inferno" ("Labyrinth of the Hell")
