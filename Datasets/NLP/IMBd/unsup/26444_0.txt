Craig Lucas' film is a piece of pretentious Hollywood crap, with the only saving grace that of the wonderful Patricia Clarkson who plays the "wounded" Hollywood wife in the film and delivers a very poignant and empathetic performance.<br /><br />From the first scenes between Peter Sarsgaard, Robert, and the handsome Cambell Scott, Jefferey, this film doesn't ring true to me as a writer in Los Angeles, as he heads to meet a Studio executive in such a nonchalant and unprofessional manner to discuss the purchase of his script THE DYING GAUL. That whole office scene is just too silly for words-even Robert's...Any writer would die to be in his position, let alone to be so uncaring about his script being sold to a major studio.<br /><br />The usual glamorous Malibu settings, sun setting over the blue Pacific, that limo ride where everyone is sipping champagne to the good life in Hollywood once you make it, just seemed such a boring clich√©. And the scenes where Jefferey keeps saying to Robert, "you're so beautiful", are beyond trite dialog.<br /><br />Yes, we all have lost someone we love to death, but the way these characters discuss, chat online and deceive one another is not bringing any empathy to their stories, nor for their audience. And the last scene is not a tear jerker, just a reflection of what deception and lies can create for your downfall.<br /><br />My recommendation, you want a shot of dark Hollywood, stick to the intriguing MULHOLLAND DRIVE for viewing, not THE DYING GAUL.
