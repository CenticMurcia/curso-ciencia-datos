The title serves as the antithesis of this movie's existence. It features a deep exploration into the depths of man's focus on racial division as a means of control. It walks the very divide that is inherent to any human; the divide we're genetically predisposed to establishing. What I witnessed was an atypical artistic melding of man and acceptance, forging a deep bond with the essence of equality; no racism, no anti-racism. I cannot adequately explain the premise without ruining the genius that is this movie, so I can't say much more than that! I can truly say that my life changed as a result of watching this film -- heck, it even proffered some hearty laughs along the way!<br /><br />Don't let the title fool you, it's something the whole family should see! <br /><br />10/10 - Christopher Poole
