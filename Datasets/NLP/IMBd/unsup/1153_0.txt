The first time I saw this movie I missed the first 30 minutes or so; I saw it fully last night and I didn't know the kid's uncle went to prison for 25+ years and the same with his mom! He could've been an artist and put his talents to good use. Q-Tip adds such sensitivity, you can't help but sympathize with his character. Absolutely uncompromising and downbeat; it's no surprise that the director also did several OZ series episodes. For those with taste in real-drama it's a good watch. The ending is heart-wrenching.
