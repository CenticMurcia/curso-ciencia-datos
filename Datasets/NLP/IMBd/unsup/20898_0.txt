This is the first movie Adam Sandler has made since Punch Drunk Love. Punch Drunk Love was one of my favorite movies of the last year, so it will be unfair to compare his past movie with this one. He made a good effort in this movie. His co-star is Jack Nicholson; Who just came off of making the successful About Schmidt.<br /><br />Anger Management is really about the stars. If the same exact story line were made into a movie with unknown actors, it would not have been so commercially successful. That is all right, I enjoy watching Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson practice their craft. Their acting abilities of intensity and humor are what made them so successful. These actors have the ability to turn a stale script into a good movie. I feel that is what they did on this movie. They made it better just by participating in the movie. I enjoyed watching them interact, and watch their chemistry. It is rare, but these stars made the movie good.<br /><br />It was about Adam getting assigned to an anger management class for a falsely accused outburst on an airplane, and he keeps getting falsely accused of anger throughout the movie. His anger management supervisor is Jack. Adam has to pass his program to have charges dropped against him. In the end it all ends up being fake. It was designed with the help of his girlfriend to give Adam a wake up call. The whole thing being a set up is kind of outlandish and impossible, but suspend belief and you will accept it, but then again I am the drunken_critic. 75/100
