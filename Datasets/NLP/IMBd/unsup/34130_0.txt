Sadly, this is about as close as the Discovery Channel comes anymore to producing educational programming. At least they TRY to make this somewhat educational, but this is really nothing more than a science-based sitcom/reality show. "MythBusters" is a lot like a less educational version of "Beakman's World".<br /><br />So many of the myths they supposedly work so hard to "bust" are laughable and incredibly obvious: Could a construction worker hang onto a piece of plywood and parachute five stories down to the ground? Does cola make a good toilet cleaner? Can a playing card be thrown hard enough to kill someone?<br /><br />I thought their myth about a postage stamp being able to bring down a helicopter was one of their most comical myths. For crying out loud, the wind does more to alter the position of the helicopter blade than the weight of a stupid postage stamp would!<br /><br />Why don't they just ask if the "Jaws" music is played when a big shark is swimming near you. If people are actually watching this show to find out the answers to these questions, these are some really dumb people.<br /><br />This show is nothing but a silly game. The myth that this was actually a worthwhile science show is now busted!
