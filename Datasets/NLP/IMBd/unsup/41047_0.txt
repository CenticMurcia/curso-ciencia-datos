Sorry, call me old fashioned, but I like to care about at least one of the story's characters! Unfortunately, Just On Time, has the feel of a moronic T.V. sitcom, and is so tedious it ruins the fun. Simply put - I could not feel the slightest bit of rapport with anyone in this boring film! It's such a juvenile storyline, but not the least bit funny. One can only hope people this dopey only exist in the writer's imagination!<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering, the word "Narcissistic" means: egotistical, selfish, self-centered, me-first, and that exactly describes the main character. There's more than enough narcissism in the world! I don't need to watch it on the tube, too!
