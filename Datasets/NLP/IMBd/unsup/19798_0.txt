This film holds the distinguished place of Worst Film Ever in my opinion! There are no redeeming features to this film, the acting, considering the cast, is poor, Anthony Hopkins and Matthew Broderick seem almost embarrassed that they have ended up in the film. The direction is terrible, and the script leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />Alan Parker should be ashamed he ever made this abortion, I was hoping for great things from this film, considering the pedigree of all involved. HOW WRONG COULD I BE?<br /><br />Is it any wonder that this piece of tripe has never been shown on TV? AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
