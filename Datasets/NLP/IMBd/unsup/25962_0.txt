Very well acted story about a family in divorce. It's not just about the husband and the wife; their sons get deeply involved.<br /><br />On the surface, the father is the bad person here. A great admirer of himself; an admiration which is shared by his oldest son, who becomes a cheater, both in school and in life, because of this upbringing. The younger son is more vulnerable, as confused as his brother, but with no real tools to deal with the situation. He can't really cheat properly.<br /><br />But as the movie goes on, you find both parents being the same egoists. This is a really dark drama, but it takes place in every-day-life. That only makes it more frightening.
