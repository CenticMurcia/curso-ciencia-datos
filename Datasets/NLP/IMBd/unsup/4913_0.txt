My God! You people actually gave this movie something higher than 3? This was a disgusting and queer piece of work. You can't even find what the storyline for this movie was in the first place! If you see yourself as an idiot, then go to Blockbuster and wow yourself with a film that could be shot in the 60s. Yes, you heard me- the 60s! You have a little perverted brother sleeping and washing his older sister, you have a nut for a dad saying, "Boom, Chick-a-Chick-a-Chick-a-Boom! Blah-dad-de-de-da-de!" Plus, when Toto's all grown up, he starts seeing another woman just because she's a lot like his sister who blew up! The weirdest scene by far was the Conclusion. It had Toto laughing and giggling as a pile of ash, it showed a chicken, a ship and a whole lotta things that are played in the song.I suggest that if you find this description amusing, you should watch the movie and decide for yourself.
