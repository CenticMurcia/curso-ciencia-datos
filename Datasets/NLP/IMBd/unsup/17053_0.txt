I have to agree with Eric Miller; this film is a GEM! A neat intro, all-star cast (for 1935) and an interesting story by the Great Stuart Palmer make this a top-notch film! If you're a fan of "Old House" films, this is a MUST-see!<br /><br />There is a "goof" listed for this film: "A room which has been locked since 1915 contains up-to-date (1935) fixtures".<br /><br />Whoever said that didn't watch the film closely, because they are incorrect! The locked room HAS NO visible lights -- the old man uses a candle when he enters with his niece. <br /><br />The room they must be talking about is the "trophy room", complete with mummies, skulls, daggers and all sorts of "weird" things! (Two different rooms).<br /><br />Norm Vogel www.normsfilms.com
