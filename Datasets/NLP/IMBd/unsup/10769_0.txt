You might expect a movie produced by Adam Sandler and starring Dana Carvey to be really, really bad - and you would not be disappointed with Master of Disguise. From an uninspiring beginning that leaves you wondering why you should care about any of the characters through a bunch of overdone slapstick and pre-adolescent humor, including an interminably-repeated fart joke, this one is a dog.<br /><br />The only redeeming qualities this movie has are the underutilized talents of Brent Spiner and the delightful, gorgeous and talented Jennifer Esposito, who pulls off the only decent performance in the film.<br /><br />Let's put it this way: Jesse Ventura has a cameo, and the rest of the movie makes his cameo a high point. 'Nuff said.
