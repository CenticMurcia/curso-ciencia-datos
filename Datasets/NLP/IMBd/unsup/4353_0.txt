In this excellent Neil Simon comedy, Jack Lemmon is up for a promotion at his company's (he specializes in plastic precision instruments) corporate office in New York City and he takes his wife Sandy Dennis along for a tour of the city. Right from the get-go, it becomes a living hell for the two. It all starts when NYC is fogged in and they have to fly to Boston. Second, they can't find their luggage. Then, they miss their train to New York. It only gets worse. They lose their hotel room, get mugged by a mysterious Graham Jarvis (as Murray), become captive of liquor store looters, get mugged yet again, Jack breaks his tooth on a Cracker Jack, he is accused of molesting a child, Sandy loses her wedding ring briefly, Lemmon has temporary hearing loss from an exploding gas main, and get caught in a anti-Communist riot. When it's all over, Jack gets the promotion but has to turn it down because he feels that the city life is too much for him and his wife. But one last disaster befalls the two one their flight home; their plane is hijacked.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is Neil Simon's best after The Odd Couple. Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis are perfect as the hapless couple who experience nothing but trouble in their 24 hours in New York. there are some brilliant and funny line that have somewhat become part of us ("I'm suing all of them, I don't care if I'm in court all year."). Overall, it blends into a very funny movie. Also, keep an eye out of Anne Meara (Ben Stiller's mom) in a cameo role as a purse snatching victim.
