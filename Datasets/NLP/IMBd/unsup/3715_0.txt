Pork Chop Hill is one of a small group of films that deal with the Korea War realistically. The other two are Men at War and the Steel Helmet. Peck's character is carrying out orders to take a worthless hill with peace on the horizon. The movie shows that the fog of war clouds and confuses everything. They are reluctant warriors in a war nobody wanted to win or lose. Lewis Milstone's direction in the panorama of battlefield is his trademark. The cast was made up of familiar faces, Harry Guardino, George Peppard, Norman Fell, Rip Torn, Kevin Hagen, Robert Blake, Woody Strode. What makes the film more interesting is that the Korea War had only been over for six years and Peck's character was still alive.
