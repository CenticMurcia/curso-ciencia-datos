It's a pseudo-science movie airing on the SciFi Channel. Do I really need to say anymore? Oh, I do! OK then.<br /><br />First off, don't just check your disbelief at the door, check everything....taste, common sense, hat, coat the whole nine yards. Volcano in New York is just abysmally bad. It has every clich√© character (and I mean every one) that you'd expect in a disaster movie. Plucky hero, mad scientist, corrupt city official, smart lady scientist that no one listens to, comedy sidekick that ultimately meets a grisly end, oafish law enforcement officer, etc. etc. They're all here.<br /><br />Add in the stereotypical science project goes wrong plot and "band of everyday heroes" that save the day and you've got a film that you could do yourself the favour and just NOT watch and still know what will happen at the end.<br /><br />Of course, from the SciFi Channel, you already know that the script will be dire, the dialogue inane and ludicrous and the characters annoying as hell. But the real star of the show are the priceless special effects. Intersperse real-world eruption footage, cheesy "Youtube" quality lava CGI and what looked jarringly like 9/11 footage (I kid you not) and you have an awful mish-mash of effects that fails dismally.<br /><br />And whilst I mention the 9/11 footage, am I the only one to think that using such footage was just plain wrong? It seems particularly tasteless to me and potentially horrifying for someone who actually went through the trauma of that day, let alone lost someone in the event. To use such footage to "jazz" up a movie seems beyond callousness. What next? A shuttle movie with actual Challenger footage in it? The least they could have done was cut out the three or four scenes from the movie.<br /><br />So then, rubbish plot, rubbish effects, awful dialogue and questionable stock footage. Anything I missed? Oh yeah. Dire acting. I forgot to mention that, but by now you probably assumed that as a given.<br /><br />Don't watch this. It's junk.
