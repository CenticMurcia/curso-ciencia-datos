An entertaining 'sleeper'. Unaffected child actors, talented cast, and a good story add up to a diverting and under-recognized film. There was not one lame performance - each added a dimension without cluttering up the scene. Give it a little while to get going - it does spend some time to lay the ground work, but I don't really see a way to short cut it without losing the genuine and unassuming quality the director manages to preserve throughout the events that unfold. No sentimental drivel to wilt audience interest either. It has subtitles for those who do not speak what I believe was Swiss German, but they were not annoying. I'm looking forward to watching it again.
