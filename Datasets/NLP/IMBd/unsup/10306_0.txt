Barbara Stanwyck plays a night nurse at a very strange household where some children may be in serious danger.<br /><br />Strong pre-Code film has (for 1931) strong dialogue, Stanwyck and Joan Blondell in their underwear, alcoholism, nymphomania, attempted rape, child abuse and Clark Gable (without his mustache) slugging Stanwyck unconscious.<br /><br />The plot is kind of silly but the film moves so quickly (72 minutes) that you sort of disregard it. There are also some nice directorial touches from William Wellman. The whole cast is great: Stanwyck is just superb in the title role--smart, strong and has no fear--she almost manages to stare Gable down in one of their fights. Gable is incredible as the bad guy--violent, brutal and very scary. There's great support from Blondell as Stanwyck's best friend and Ben Lyon as a bootlegger with the hots for her.<br /><br />A really great film--don't miss this one!<br /><br />Two of the many great lines: "I'm a nymphomaniac...and I'm proud of it!" "You MOTHER!"<br /><br />
