Robert Duvall's portrayal of E.F., Sonny, or whatever you would like to call him is simply amazing. Duvall has created an imperfect hero, a hero much easier to relate to because he has shortcomings and flaws. If you're looking for Billy Graham, you won't find him in this movie, but what you will find is a flawed hero with whom we other flawed human beings can relate to. If you don't watch another movie this year, at least watch _The Apostle_.
