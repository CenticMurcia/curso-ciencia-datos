Eating Out 2 maintained the off-the-wall dialogue and ridiculous characters that made it's predecessor hilarious. However, the near-constant semi-nudity was a significant detraction to the film, with some scenes approaching soft-core cable pornography. My straight friends were visibly uncomfortable during several scenes and even my gay friends could have done with less nipple biting and stomach licking. That said, there were several fantastic comedic moments in the film and, unlike other raucous comedies (think of the "American Pie" series) there was no endless parade of fart jokes and tired one-liners. Overall, it was a fun movie to watch, but probably should be one to catch on DVD so as to utilize the "fast forward" button.
