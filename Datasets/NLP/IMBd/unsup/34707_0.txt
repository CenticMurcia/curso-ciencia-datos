Grim Reaper starts as an exotic dancer Rachel Wilson (Chersih Lee) waits for a taxi to take her home, unfortunately said taxi runs her over instead. For no apparent reason although it's hard to feel sorry for Rachel since she was standing right in the middle of the road. Rachel survives & is taken to a nearby hospital where she meets a creepy nurse (Alice Ensor) & before she knows it Rachel wakes up inside a room inside the abandoned St. Joseph's mental institution where Dr. Brown (Brent Fidler) has collected several teenagers all of whom have had near death experiences. Insdie St. Joseph's the teens start to be stalked & killed one-by-one by a hooded figure that could very well be the Grim Reaper himself as he search for those who escaped him the first time round...<br /><br />Produced & directed by Michael Feifer one has to say that Grim Reaper is awful in every just about every way & it takes a horror film buff with high tolerance levels to sit through all of it's eighty odd minutes, as for those who aren't particularly interested in the genre you probably wouldn't last much more than twenty odd minutes. The script by Ellis Walker is a total mess from start to finish, there are flashbacks, flash-forwards, dreams, dreams within dreams, hallucinations, a confusing plot that doesn't work, a terrible ending that makes no sense & the whole film is just a narrative nightmare as you are thrust from one scenario to another in the blink of an eye & thus not really giving you the chance to take the already confused plot in since it chops & changes so much. The whole point of a film in my opinion is to entertain, if a film entertains me for it's duration & I have fun then I can forgive almost anything but when it comes to a film such as Grim Reaper which is such a chore to watch I find myself rapidly losing the will to live. Considering that Grim Reaper only lasts for a relatively modest eighty odd minutes & it feels like it goes on for literally hours one could quite easily come to the conclusion it's a really boring slow moving film. The plot revolving around several teens escaping death feels right out of Final Destination (2000) only there's no clever death's & it pretty much turns into a really awful teen slasher as the Grim Reaper becomes your average Freddy Kruger type killer. The ending is awful too, since when does dying for a few minutes enable you to travel back in time & change past events? A real mess from start to finish.<br /><br />Director Feifer does OK & to be fair to Grim Reaper it's fairly well made, I am not sure why there are no lights in St. Joseph's since it appears to be the darkest mental institution on Earth but as a whole the film is reasonably well made & photographed. Unfortunately reasonable production values still don't save it from being conceptually awful & a complete total utter mess. The gore levels are disappointing, a couple of people are stabbed by the Grim Reaper while someone has pencils stuck in their face & someone is sliced in half in an unconvincing totally bloodless CGI computer effect. You will notice a lot of comments for Grim Reaper saying Rachel is a stripper but she never takes her clothes off & is more of an exotic dancer.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 Grim Reaper was a reasonably well funded film & it show's with it's decent production values although as I have already said the film is terrible so that doesn't really matter. The acting is probably below average but not the worst I have seen.<br /><br />Grim Reaper is a really awful film thanks to a terrible script that is confusing, has a rubbish story & is as dull as dishwater. Definitely one to avoid if you can help it. Not to be confused with the Joe D'Amato Italian gore film Anthropophagus (1980) which was widely released in the US & UK under the title The Grim Reaper.
