This is a warning for everyone to stay away from this piece of garbage. The plot is simple. Jeff Wincott was once a hit-man, and after he died he was brought back to life to do killing for the government. This plot has lots of potential, but unfortunately it is totally wasted here. It just keeps getting worse and worse, and in the end I was supporting the bad guys, even though they weren't exactly the most charismatic bunch of people I've witnessed. Wincott delivered some great fighting and action in movies like "Martial Law 2", "Mission of Justice", "Deadly Bet" and even "Martial Outlaw", and that means that I got really disappointed when it turned out that this film sucked to the extreme on that level. Very bad fight scenes, nearly no action, and it sucks big time. I advise everyone to just pretend that this movie doesn't exist at all.
