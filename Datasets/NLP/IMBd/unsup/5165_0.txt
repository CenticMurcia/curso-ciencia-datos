In my opinion I didn't think Transformers: Armada wasn't that bad. I thought it was good. This was the first Transformers series I watched and I literally grew up with it. To me Transformers: Armada was sometimes emotional, heart pounding, and dramatic. I really like this show so much that I wanted to buy the DVD.<br /><br />So to all haters out there at least give this a chance for goodness sake. I think this was the best series c'mon at least they brought back some G1 characters.<br /><br />If you hate what I wrote then fine but watch Transformers: Armada give it a try. I gave it try when I first watched it.
