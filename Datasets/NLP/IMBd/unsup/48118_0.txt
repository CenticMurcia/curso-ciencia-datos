1st watched 7/5/2009, 4 out of 10 (Dir-Shisuke Kaneko): Complicated, slow and overly dramatic second episode to the Deathnote series based on a popular manga. In this one the main character, Light, is given a second person who carries his godlike ability to make people die with a 2nd Death Note book. The basic storyline, if you haven't seen the first, is the carrier of the Death Note book is able to write names in it and they die. Light was the initial character that held the book, and killed a lot of people who in most people's eyes deserved death anyone Â– and he was kind of looked at like a hero. Each person that has a book, also sees a God of death who kind of overseas them and is their companion. The second holder of a book is a TV star named Misa who worships Light. Light is also working with the cops and a detective called "L" in this one, to find out who's making these deaths happen(although no-one knows he carries the book and is causing it). Misa turns over her book to Light and things get really complicated. At this point in the movie I lost interest because of the many twists that the movie introduces and the way they try to explain everything in 2 hours. I think, personally, they tried to cram too much into this one and this is why it fails. Detective "L" is definitely a quirky and very interesting character and he's introduced more here but the massive overload kills the story. Also, the morality question is lost and also the humor that was in the first movie. All in all, this movie is a long experience that isn't as new or as interesting as the first one.
