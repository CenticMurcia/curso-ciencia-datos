I watched this thinking it would be a great journey. Rave reviews, awards, life changing, etc ... <br /><br />Good God. This was one of the most awful, insufferable Australian movies I have ever seen. And I *am* Australian. I don't like to dis movies made in my home country, but this movie most certainly deserves a damn good thrashing. Mindbogginlingly stereotypical, annoying and boring as watching sh!t fester. Good thing I didn't have to pay money as well to see it (Borrowed a friend's video). I'm glad to see by other reviews I'm not the only one who despised it, annoyed that my time and intelligence were so sorely insulted. Toni Collette's atrocious overacting (nothing personal though), especially in the unconvincing grief scenes did nothing to help this lamo movie, in fact made it worse and I only watched it to see if it got better. Needn't've bothered. The first part of it was boring as hell, then the second half was just plain God damn depressing. I was hoping to learn more about the outback and more about Australian geology and have more scenes with Toni's character's work (she was supposed to be a geologist), rather than this annoying yuppie chick, having major league hissy fits and non-stop winging.<br /><br />And the movie was just *starting* to get good, he was just starting to loosen up and enjoy himself and then he dies ... and it goes even more downhill from there than when it started - hard to believe but true. <br /><br />I was hoping for a sensual, spiritual and moving journey through the outback, not some b!tchy angsty crap that thinks it's good because it's got people screaming in it and call it acting. The "death scene" did not even seem convincing, at first I thought the guy was playing and going to pop up and scare her or something. It did not seem the water was that shallow where he dived - and with arms outstretched? If he was hurt the worst that would have happened is he would have broken an arm or wrist. What a cop out just to kill him off and get out of writing anything more intelligent or insightful. Who gets paid to write these idiotic movies (and gets them produced) when there are literally *millions* of good writers out there who struggle their guts out to get their stuff out there to knocked back at every turn? Very disappointed. This "Story" could have been great with more of a journey, more soul, feeling and more about the outback and what *real* Australian geologists do... As we Aussies say: "Bugger." Waste of time, talent and videotape.<br /><br />The only good thing of this movie was the beautiful outback scenery, the wonder and the danger, and two cultures learning each others differences - other than that it was overrated melodramatic, pathetic hype. Actually, I spent more quality time updating my webpage whilst watching this over-rated boof-brained, sad attempt of what could have been a wonderful story.<br /><br />Want to see a brilliant Aussie movie with non stop action, feeling, and a sense of awe and wonder - watch "Gabriel" Made only four years later with much less money and a lot more soul - literally. I found "Gabriel's Story" much more convincing, heartwarming and awakening.
