Having read all the comments before I would just like to reinforce that the film is about innocence and idealism. I don't think the director really is doing "propaganda" for leftist ideas or revolutions. The "leftie" characters were aptly shown as naive and even outright dumb. The capitalist wasn't a monster or inhuman either.<br /><br />I don't think the "alternative" end explanation for Hardenberg being an accomplice makes any sense. He obviously remains "establishment". The message on the wall is clearly for him. In the end I was saddened that Hardenberg didn't have some empathy or learn a bit himself. I think he really was once a SDS member and a revolutionary himself, though naturally he played it up a bit to save his skin.<br /><br />It also shows that life and the system eventually get us all. We end up boring and all about conformity. Our youthful rebellion becoming a comfortable obedience. We just want our paychecks and suburban homes.<br /><br />Its also sad to read so many commentaries about "lefty" film... the film is so much more than just the politics in it.
