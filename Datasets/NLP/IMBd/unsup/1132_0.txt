Arguably a tad better than the similar PURE LUCK, THE MAN features Sam Jackson as an federal agent who somehow ends up playing nursemaid to salesman Eugene Levy, as they pursue the bad guys who have killed Jackson's partner. This one is a real groaner, with Levy playing the bespectacled fish out of water to Jackson's perpetually scowling lawman. A lot of time is spent in Jackson's car. A lot of time. I have to admit I could not sit through this one to the end, but then who could? Levy is mildly funny, but a little of him goes a long way, as he has proved in everyone of his movies. Jackson is picking up a paycheck, pure and simple. Skip THE MAN.
