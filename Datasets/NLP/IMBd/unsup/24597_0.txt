Such a witty movie, lot's of 'moments'. Clive Owen, a ronin sort of being, has a baby - actually the delivery scene is a hoot - and he sets out to feed it and protect it. This is much better humor, drama and better visuals than 800 and yet in the same comic book-style genre. But live.<br /><br />It's exciting and very fast-paced. But mainly tongue in cheek. Great editing and direction.The editing and film effects can throw you off at the start but hang in there - it's worth it. Once you get into the idiom you're hooked.<br /><br />If you don't laugh you're dead.<br /><br />See it.
