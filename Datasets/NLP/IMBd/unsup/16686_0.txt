This isn't a terrible episode, but I thought it was a particularly generic and boring entry in the series. Dean and Sam come across a strange death in Oklahoma, concerning a construction worker who was found - minus a brain... Doctors shrug it off as Mad Cow Disease, though the brother's decide to do a little more thorough investigation around a new housing development where it seems insects are acting slightly odd. Another resident of the community is found mysteriously dead among a cluster of spiders and with the help of a 16 year-old kid, they realize the area holds an ancient, native American curse. Aside from some significant progression in the two main characters, where Sam expresses some past conflict with their father, "Bugs" is a rather weak episode with not nearly enough focus on the revealed swarm seen at the end. It is resolved quite ineffectively and the vague emphasis on the source of the plague seemed forced and dull... Pretty mediocre installment in the show.
