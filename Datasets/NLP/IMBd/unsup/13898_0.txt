But still a disappointment. Let's look back to the original film for a moment. Overall, not much dialogue. The humor was scarce but touching, the fawns a picture of innocence. Now take a look at Bambi 2. A lot of unnecessary yapping in between cheesy pop songs. Some of cute moments, some jokes reused from the original, and the movie even has its fair share of toilet humor. The fawns are now rambunctious and argumentative, at points even fighting with each other.<br /><br />Now I'm not saying that Bambi 2 has to be a carbon copy of the original, but shouldn't it at least possess a similar tone? There were many things I did like about this movie- the animation was spectacular, and the movie was, overall, pretty sweet. The original movie had a style that's hard to emulate, I'll admit. And hey, toddlers will probably pay attention to this one much longer than the first.<br /><br />However, in history, there are some films that just shouldn't be touched. Cinderella? Aladdin? Okay. But Bambi 2, as entertaining as it was, left me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. However, for what it's worth (a cheap, straight to DVD release), I guess I can't complain.
