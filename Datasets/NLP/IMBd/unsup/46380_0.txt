This truly obscure neo-noir from 1988 is memorable as Uma Thurman's first starring role and also has a bit part from Steve Buscemi. Quentin Tarantino must have seen it since he cast both of them in "Pulp Fiction." The DVD retails at WalMart for $1.00, which is about what it's worth. "Kiss Daddy Goodbye" has an intriguing storyline but is so low-budget as to be literally unwatchable: the lighting is poor, the photography amateurish, and night scenes are literally invisible. On the plus side the eighteen-year old Uma oozes sex appeal and a sleazy sort of glamour which must have attracted Tarantino to her, and there are some gritty, realistic performances, particularly from Buscemi. The movie was produced with grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the West German Kunstministerium, another example of taxpayers' money going to waste.
