The orphanage is a chilling tale that i watched with friends and family. I found that it was captivating to say the least, i immensely struggled to take my eyes of the screen at any moment at fear of missing a vital addition to the plot. The reason for this fear was due to the simple fact that there are lots of tiny clues which eventually all come together to conclude the film. There were so many twists and turns that at times the film is hard to follow and events seem randomly placed, however as the film progresses all secrets are slowly revealed. overall unfortunately there are some facts that remain to be a mystery but i will allow you to watch it and decide for yourself. overall a very gripping film that has been very cleverly made.
