Folks, this is the epic to look out for at international movie festivals! I have had the opportunity to see this on big screen, in full sound- and was blown away! Though I couldn't understand everything, the action within the film was clear enough to make the general plot understood. Though it is not an American film- it has authentic period costume, fantastic cinematography, and in my opinion has met or surpassed special effects of such films as the Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, and the Matrix. Of course, it probably won't get the recognition it deserves in North America, as it isn't a home-grown... but it is well worth the trip to the theatre to see it if is ever in town... I'm going to see it for at least another 2 times if possible! The only disappointment was the pop-type music for the closing credits... everything else: SUPERB!
