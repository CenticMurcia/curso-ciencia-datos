OK, this is notable for one thing: the dog is well trained. Oh, and it's got Lily Munster in it (Yvonne De Carlo). This is a low budget film made in Texas and by something called "The Construction Company"? Well, that would be appropriate, I guess, since this possesses all the thrills and chills of framing a house. Seems like this dog, Greta, is a rather sweet and lovable Rottweiler. It also seems like Hester, the character played by De Carlo, is into dabbling with Satanism and black magic and uses to dog to kill off her relatives. I guess I'm a tad on the puzzled side WHY, because SHE'S the one that seems to have all the money, the big house, etc., so I'm not sure what the motive is. I'm even less sure what the motive was for making this movie, really. Anyway, the dog does all kinds of deadly tricks, like a curling iron in the bath tub, jumping out of the seat of a car to scare the owner backward into oncoming traffic, and even strangulation of her owner's boyfriend with the dog leash while he's dozing up against a tree.....and the guy is dead and the dog is lying by his side as though nothing had happened, and the cops are looking for someone that strangled him while a 100-lb. plus Rottweiler calmly lay there? Yeah right. Anyway, this movie doesn't get many points for coherence, but it does make a rather good point at the end: do NOT upset Rottweilers. 4 out of 10.
