Film is vintage Heston, in the same vein as Planet of the Apes, and Soylent Green. Heston is bad ass (as usual). Still, if you're just the type to like movies such as "How to Make an American Quilt," or, "The Princess Diaries," you probably won't like, or "get" this film. Film is only for macho studs who are ready to take on the "family." Heston, to paraphrase Rowdy Roddy Piper (of "They Live" fame), came to chew bubble gum and kick ass. Damn...he's all out of gum.<br /><br />The film is crafted well, with a great score for a B film. I'd get it on CD if I could. Too bad IMDb doesn't list the soundtrack. HINT HINT, IMDb...get the soundtrack listings!!!<br /><br />There are two types of people in this world: those who like Heston/Omega Man, and those that don't. The former group consists of men and heroes - the latter, mere Ethan Hawke apologists and Spice Girl fans. Don't be that guy. Be a real man, enjoy vintage Heston
