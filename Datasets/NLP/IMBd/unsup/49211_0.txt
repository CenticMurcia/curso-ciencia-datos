All the while I was watching this movie I kept asking myself, Do the authors of this mediocrity understand what being catholic is all about? There's, of course, the modern "socially-concerned-Hollywood", which depicts the Catholic Church as a decadent, senile and misoginous group of eunuchs and frigids, emotionally frail and codependant, obsessed with sex and rites, completely ignorant of the true meaning of human dignity and who do not understand that this church has to accomodate its ideas into the most common idiosincresies in order to take its place where it belongs: equal to and along all other churches, because they're all alike and none holds the absolute truth. So they make films like "Catholics", "Priest" and "Stigmata" to denounce how truly hipocryt this church really is, and how courageous are the ones who defy it.<br /><br />The point is that such perception has nothing to do with what being Catholic really means and what the Catholic Church is in fact. Their conrnerstones are Faith, Hope and Charity, and it's precisely because all faithful are united through Christ where its meaning relies on. A film that argues that the Church might enforce the abolishness of Mass based on obedience is absurd precisely because such obedience is based in the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, such argument is exactly the one some protestant churches and sects sustain: that you alone can be the judge of your relation with God regardless of the means He established to grant His grace.<br /><br />Any writing on the future of the church should recall perhaps how early christianity was like: people who gathered and grew in their faith regardless of its mainstream social acceptance, and who knew that they should not trade its teachings for social popularity.
