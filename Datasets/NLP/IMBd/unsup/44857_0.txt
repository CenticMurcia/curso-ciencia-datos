STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Hercules (Arnie), son of Zeus, becomes bored with life on Mount Olympus and decides he wants to explore the world. Zeus is none too pleased with this and hurls a thunderbolt at him which crashlands him on a frieghter bound for New York. There's something of a 'culture clash' as his ways on Olympus don't quite gel with the ways of those in the Big Apple. But with the help of a nerdy, wimpish man (Arnold Stang) who befriends him, he tries to fit in better.<br /><br />I hate it when these no name, small time DVD companies take these long forgotten 'before they were famous' films made God knows how long ago and give them snazzy, glossy new covers to make them look like they're new and trendy films, as was the case here. I knew what I was letting myself in for(some other poor sod might not!) but my sketchy plot summary alone should be some indication of how long I was able to stick this execrably dire 'comedy.' <br /><br />The film fails to generate anything even remotely resembling a laugh within the first half an hour, leaving little hope for the rest of this sorry debacle. And it doesn't help that Ah-nuld is at his wooden acting worst, struggling to deliver his lines with any sense of charisma or style at all.<br /><br />This is a film that makes Arnie's performances in films such as Commando or Eraser seem Oscar worthy, it's not funny in any way at all and I'm glad it's at a very proper place in the bottom 100 list. Utterly awful. *
