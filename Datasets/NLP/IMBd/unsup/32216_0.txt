Four episodes out of the seven in this collections of skits stand out for me: Lynn Redgrave as a horny Queen with a chastity belt, and Woody Allen as the Fool trying to remove it; Gene Wilder and his affair with a sheep; the 'What's My Perversion?' TV programme; and, best of all, the final sketch where Woody is a sperm about to be fired into a woman on a first date. Space age copulation with a control room and everything.<br /><br />Overall it is a funny film, but lots of it misses the mark and hasn't held up well over the years. It is less cerebral and more starry than many of Allen's later movies (for a start it has Burt Reynolds who was hotter than hot in 1972). It tries too hard to be clever but does manage to cover most of the fascinating spectrum of human sexuality, and to make it fun.
