If you like to laugh out loud watch this movie! If you watch this movie and don't laugh seek out a doctor your funny done is broken. Don Juan and Miguel surrounded by some of my very favorite performers make this one a must see for everyone. If you have never seen them at a Ren Faire this movie will make you want to see them live. They alone are worth the price of admission to any renaissance faire. As far as I'm concerned you haven't lived until Miguel has flashed you a nipple or watched what that man can do with a pickle.LOL Always funny and fresh you can truly tell these men love what they do. So go, go now and watch this movie you won't be sorry you did. Can't wait to see the next one that they filmed this summer.
