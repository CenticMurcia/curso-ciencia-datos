One night, when I had nothing better to do, I decided to watch "Damnation Alley". Let's just say that I should have found something else to do. Anything would have been better than sitting through this horrible film. The acting is bad - Jan-Michael Vincent and George Peppard simply cannot act. The storyline is decent, but the movie makes it extremely boring. I wasn't impressed by the hour-long ride in the land-rover/tank, regardless of its all-terrain capabilities. As for special effects, the sky images were interesting but didn't really do too much for the movie. If you ever have a chance to see "Damnation Alley" -- don't.
