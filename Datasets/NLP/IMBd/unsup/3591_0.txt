I didn't think much of this when I first saw it and don't think much of it now. It's terrible really because the girls are great and it looks good most of the time with plenty of sexy kills. The title, salacious though it is, is pretty accurate, but the predictable tale plods along and in the end produces a killer we have not only not seen but did not know existed! Distortion on the soundtrack doesn't help this one. PS: Third time lucky! Watching this once more without distorted soundtrack, in fact watching in Italian, it is a sumptuous visual and aural feast. The sexy killings come at frequent intervals and the film is super sexy all the way through. I notice this time that of course we have seen and do know the character revealed as the killer at the end, even if she has not been prominent. Guess that should have given her away, that and the regular POV shots of the original death and continual references to running water.
