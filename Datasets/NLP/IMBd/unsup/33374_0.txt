An indie film about two couple gay men's lives, how they deal with relationships and responsibilities. Every man has his own problem, dashing outside, but desperate inside.<br /><br />How to pursue the lifestyle you are seeking for? How to find another perfect half of your life? Films can offer different options, but reality itself deters you, not everyone is lucky enough to get what he wants. The world looks more colorful and uncertain when you are aware of its capacity and emptiness, rather depressing.<br /><br />Actors are all unknown, and the acting is just so-so, not so convincing but for a small romantic film, I should not ask too much.<br /><br />Still not get the title, why "200 American"? Maybe I missed something and I admit I had been fallen asleep during the film playing. Shameful for me! I always think I can survive from any films no matter how boring or awful they are.
