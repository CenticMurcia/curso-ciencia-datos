In Holland the second season is now on TV. I couldn't wait and i watched in on DVD already. <br /><br />I also liked season 1 but it wasn't as good as sex and the city. But the second season is so good!!!! Much more humor which i really liked! The best part of season two for me is the episode where they go to the spa (without alcohol en cellphones....) when they go back as fast as they can... hahaha....and then they get car trouble. They open the hood en they are staring at the engine. It was hilarious! <br /><br />In short. From season two i love this show!!!!! Really funny, but also real problems en great lovestories....just GREAT! I hope there will be much more seasons to come, i can't wait!
