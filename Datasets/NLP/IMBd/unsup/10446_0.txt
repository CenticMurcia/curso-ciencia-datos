i started watching this show when bbc America started airing it here in the states i watched the pilot because i thought it looked a lot similar to buffy the vampire slayer(my favorite show... rest in peace). the first episode was OK but as the series progresses it seems to get better and better. ill make it plain that hex is by no means my favorite show ever but it serves a good purpose of being a good summer show. up to episode seven it has been good and interesting with many plot twists and cool character. i ask that you try out this show and give it a chance because it really is worth it. it might also be a good show to pick up the season for because that way you can watch it at your leisure
