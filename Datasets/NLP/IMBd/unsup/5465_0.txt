To tell the truth, I nearly did not bother with this one; to tell the truth it's all the same anyway; I gave up on Perdita Durango, haven´t bothered much with other titles by this very singular Basque director, but have at last sat through an entire film.<br /><br />Using satire to the nth degree, even going to the extremes of including a take-off of `the Exorcist', `El Día de La Bestía' is a mixture of horror, comedy and spoof, and most definitely a cock in the snout at anyone remotely religious. Rolling along at an intrepid pace, the film is an insight into what a feverish mind and overheated imagination can cook up. I mean, the story is impossible, but that is the magic of cinema...........isn't it?<br /><br />Anyway, everyone is rather round the bend, off his rocker or stark, staring bonkers as we British youngsters used to say near half a century ago. Whilst unravelling Amharic scrawls the Right Reverend Father Ángel Beriartúa discovers that the antichrist will be born on Christmas Day in Madrid. From there to a blood-letting search of the most bizarre in which all kinds of weird goings-on are coming off, normally at hell-bent speed, which is probably where everyone should end up anyway, the film is a debauch into trivial skylarks, heavily dosed up with all the gruesome products of horror and perversity liberally mixed into a comical cocktail of doubtful parentage.<br /><br />What I cannot fathom is how they managed to get Maria Grazia Cucinotta to fall down those stairs so spectacularly, without any parts of her anatomy plopping out of that dress...............<br /><br />If you like this kind of nonsensical black humour, I suggest you give `Airbag' (1997) (qv) by the also Basque director Juanma Bajo Ulloa a try.
