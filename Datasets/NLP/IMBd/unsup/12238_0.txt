After watching this film, I must say that I was less than impressed. The tone of the film is misleading. While watching the Pla interview segments it was obvious that she was becoming increasingly annoyed with the film maker. By his own omission, he paid bar for this girl and did not pay her for her time. This tends to anger the bar girls because if they aren't in the bar they can't find another customer. It was also clear that he was making a habit of showing up at her work and interrogating her with questions she did not want to answer. In addition, most Thai bar girls do not wish to appear on camera especially in connection with any kind of prostitution. Thai people are very modest people and would not easily have their faces filmed in this kind of film in order to protect their future. They believe this would be ruined if people saw a film where they were connected with prostitution.<br /><br />I question the authenticity of the film's ending, where the film maker presents that 1 week after filming Pla was dead. Personally, I don't believe it. I suspect that after annoying the poor girl, she most likely was avoiding him and was thus unavailable for more footage. I suspect that in needing an ending, describing a questionable and potentially fraudulent death of Pla without filmed proof accomplishes nothing more than giving the movie an ending and inciting emotion in the audience.<br /><br />I would not recommend this film to anyone. You would be better served to visit Bangkok and see it for yourself. Make your own judgement.
