One disturbing trend in SciFi Channel original movies of late is that they're starting to feel like they have to weave more plot into the monster movie. Please. We don't care. This starts out interesting enough. Some family is sailing at sea, the mother tucks the kid into bed then hears a disturbance from above, when she resurfaces and father is clinging to one of the sails by his fingers, in the clutches of a giant squid's tentacles. She is, of course, woefully unprepared for a giant squid confrontation and has to fumble around for their flare gun. By the time she finds it, it's too late -- the squid has his next meal. Sweet. But this is followed by 90 minutes of boring treasure hunts, a couple of attractive female divers shooting the breeze with that dude from the 2005 edition of "The Bachelor" about lost treasure and precious little killer squid footage. What footage they do have features pretty bad special effects. Thus, "Kraken" Tentacles of the Deep" is an incredibly boring movie and does not hold your interest. Watch it while doing household chores so you can get stuff done.
