In 1994 Kevin Smith had his debut film as a director in Clerks. The story focuses on the two workers Dante Hicks (O'Halloran) who works at the convienate store next to the movie rental store with Randal Graves (Anderson). Randal is a smart ass who says what's on his mind and then you've got small minded Dante who is mostly quiet and angry inside but to scared to let out his anger. While on the job they meet w shoppers and the birth of the best duos Jay (Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith). Jay is a pot head looking for two things in life, drugs and the ladies Silent Bob hardly talks at all but when he does it's normally heart warming and inspirational. Too bad the movie isn't. Wait screw that who needs heart warming when you got Randal, snowballing, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob, and of course Randal. Clerks is filled with unique dialog and tons of originality from an excellent director. Smith can only do better. My final rating 8/10.
