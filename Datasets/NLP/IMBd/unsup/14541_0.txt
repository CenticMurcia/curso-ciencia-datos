I recently saw this movie for the first time. I was 16 when it was released. I was expecting it to be alot like "A Boy Named Charlie Brown" (1969) the first Peanuts feature.<br /><br />This film is good on its own. The songs and tunes on the soundtrack are upbeat and pretty. The animation is first-rate high quality from Mr. Melendez. The introduction of Woodstock is cute. I especially liked the scenes where he and Snoopy are on their way to visit Lila in the hospital. There is a complicated scene where Woodstock has to walk on each of the sidewalk grate pipes to cross them while Snoopy just keeps walking. Their "buddy" scenes are great.<br /><br />There is not much use of the Peanuts gang in this film Charlie Brown has a new and different voice for this film. But, he does sing a sad little tune near the end of the film that will tug at your heartstrings.<br /><br />If you have never seen this film, please do.<br /><br />I watched this film on 2/13/00, the night that Mr. Schulz died. I hope that the Charlie Brown and friends legacy continues with these films and the TV shows.
