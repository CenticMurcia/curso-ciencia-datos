I have tried so much to try and actually enjoy this show(who does), but everything I've seen from this show is nothing but dark humor, which isn't at all funny in any way. This show is about this evil(in my own opinion) girl named Mandy, this dumb as a doorknob boy named Billy, and their forced-to-be-friend-forever servant known as the Grim Reaper. When the first started out, it was OK. Not that entertaining but not that dark either. But as more episodes came out, the more darker it became. Mandy became more evil, Billy became even more of an idiot, and the Grim Reaper went out of character a lot more often. He sometimes even enjoy Billy and Mandy as friends. I do not know how children actually think this is entertaining. And how parents haven't tried to ban this show yet. They have made fun of many popular shows/movies including Harry Potter, Star Wars, Pokeman/Digimon, X-Men. And even shows that are on Cartoon Network as well like Fosters Home For Imaginary Friends, Codename Kids Next Door,etc. I really wish I could give this show -10 stars because this show will crush childhood dreams.
