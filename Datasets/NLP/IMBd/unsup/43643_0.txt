some nice bodies, cars as well as females. writing is horrible. the acting is even worse. if you want a soft core porn, then this movie might work for you. tried to copy the "Fast And The Furious" car racing style, but writing doesn't pull it off. the characters don't make you believe them. without the sex, this movie would have been a one. horrible, utterly horrible. whoever put up the cash to make this movie is definitely visiting a shrink daily! The writing is horrific, thank god they had a few pretty females that get naked often! the ins and outs of the racer and the team owners conflict opponent show that when bad writing hits, not even a tried and true money maker can make money. A total waste of time. The director needs to go back to film school and learn more techniques.
