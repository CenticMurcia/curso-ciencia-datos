Music superstar is threatened by a twisted fan and so hires a stolid bodyguard to protect her--and quickly falls in love with him. Nonsensical rubbish served as the debut acting vehicle for real-life music diva Whitney Houston, who does passable work off the stage. Kevin Costner, on the other hand, is enervated beyond belief; his brand of low-keyed machismo isn't in tune with the general air of camp inherent in this tacky scenario--he doesn't seem to be in on the joke and comes off seeming tired and indifferent. This got by with audiences via Houston's musical numbers; otherwise it is second-string stuff, with a script that makes very little sense, tossing ideas at the screen with no point or purpose. Disappointing throughout. ** from ****
