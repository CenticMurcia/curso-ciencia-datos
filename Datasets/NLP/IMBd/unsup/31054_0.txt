I'm 23 minutes in, and have stopped this movie.<br /><br />Normally if I'm going to rate a film, I will watch the whole thing. However, there are not many movies which force me to turn them off in the first quarter. I will generally give it a chance even if it's terrible.<br /><br />This movie, however, breaks the mold. I generally love Matthew Mcconaughey. His early work was brilliant. Movies like this one show him to be a shallow actor. He is officially typecast into the romantic comedy genre. Usually his films are cute. This movie is crap.<br /><br />The acting so far is shallow at best. I am extremely disappointed in both leading "actors". Jennifer Garner has done some incredible roles, and the fact that both of them would even consider putting their names on this show that they probably aren't getting any other offers.<br /><br />And Micheal Douglas: What are you doing? You have a great resume. So you are getting older and don't have so much coming your way. Would you rather go out with class, or go out with really low quality volume? Bad move dude.<br /><br />I am very glad that I pirated this movie. Seeing it in the theatre or renting it would have been the same as ripping up my money.
