If you have absolutely nothing to do, or you need to critique a film as an academic exercise, try this one. I saw the USA version, with English dubbed in, out of sync with the lip-movements.<br /><br />One can't help but notice the style of cinematography, music, editing and direction so much like the Clint Eastwood "spaghetti-westerns", or Hercules movies of the 1950's.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie about the Battle of Britain, there are others that are better (e.g. "The Battle of Britain").
