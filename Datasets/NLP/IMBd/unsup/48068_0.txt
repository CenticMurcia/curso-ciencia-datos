I wanted to learn about the credit industry - a very important industry that gives us the ability to buy homes and education among many other things. Our access to capital is what differentiates us from third world countries that are not as well developed. Muhammed Yunus has recognized this and won a Nobel Peace Price for his micro-finance programs.<br /><br />There are negatives to the industry as well but the movie doesn't intelligently lay out any case - it just tries to get you to engage emotionally instead of engage in any type of critical thinking. What caused these people to get into debt? A message of personal responsibility was merely skated over.<br /><br />There were a few facts that are good to know, but many others were horribly inaccurate or half-truths. I will not cite any for fear of being a spoiler but am chomping at the bit to do so.<br /><br />Many people need education in credit/finance and it would be fabulous to have classes in high school to show how to use credit wisely (along with personal finance). Hopefully a naive well-meaning teacher doesn't use this movie to do the job.
