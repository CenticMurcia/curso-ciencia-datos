This movie was absolutely false advertisement. they advertised it as a family movie..well they sure put it that way at the begging of the movie. Till they eat after midnight! Holy crap when i was a kid and saw this movie...well the first time i saw it i was 5. didn't think it was scary at all and loved it, until that night when i went to bed..i had nightmares for the rest of elementary school. and i hated the movie from then on out...but as i hit middle school i basically mentally prepared myself over middle school about it and finally 8th grade year i watched gremlins: the movie that scared the sh** out of me when i was little.... And boy i don't know what i was missing. but this movie is one of the best i have seen. Just the cast was great the animatronics on the gremlins was flawless, and i love this movie now as a 16 year old. i watch it all the time and every time i watch it, its pure genius. I highly recommend this movie.
