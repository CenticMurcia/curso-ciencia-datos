Gun Shy is the story of a drug bust gone bad and the agent who has been caught in the middle of a world gone crazy. He falls in love when he least expects it, finds friends in a very unlikely group, and manages to keep going despite the circumstances.<br /><br />This is a wonderful farce that happens to contain some really talented actors. Most notably Liam Neeson, who has been seen most recently as Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I (1999). He plays Charlie, an undercover DEA agent who is going through a nervous breakdown. Oliver Platt who most recently caught my attention as Hector Cyr, an eccentric expert on crocodiles in Lake Placid (1999). Oliver plays Fulvio, the son-in-law of Italian Mobster Don Carmine Minetti. Sandra Bullock plays Judy Tipp, a nurse who takes ailing Charlie under her wing. Honorable mention in the movie goes to Mitch Pileggi, who does an excellent job portraying the somewhat shallow character of Dexter Helvenshaw, one of Charlie's superiors.<br /><br />I must say I had never heard of director/writer Eric Blakeney. He has a great wit, lets hope he produces more. I found many scenes in this movie very compelling. One in the middle of the movie stands out.<br /><br />Fulvio (Oliver Platt) comes home after a particularly stressful confrontation and enters the dingy, cluttered kitchen of the home he shares with his wife, Gloria. They are not having a good time of it and she angrily tells him he better shape up. She storms off and you expect him to blow up. He has that mad gleam in his eyes. He seizes a knife... ...and then throws it in the sink and starts cleaning the kitchen frantically, not stopping until it is spotless. Priceless.
