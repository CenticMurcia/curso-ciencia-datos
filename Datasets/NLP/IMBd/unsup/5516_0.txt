I am an avid Allen Payne fan, and I do not see enough of his work. Thank you so much for casting him. The character he played was quite well suited to his debonair persona. I also enjoyed the other actors as well. They all portrayed serious life and death issues with sincerity. This cast really fit together perfectly. I must say that none of the actors were difficult to watch, and the director made me see his whole intention. I will probably rent it again to show some folks whom I believe could appreciate the quality that has been displayed in Blue Hill Avenue. The actors who played Tristan's friends were excellent and of course Allen Payne was OUTSTANDING as always. More Allen Payne please.
