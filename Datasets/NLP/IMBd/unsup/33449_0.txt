WOAH what a stinker. It's embarrassing to see Jet Li and Jackie Chan in so many pandering scenes with a dumb worthless white kid in order to try and get suburban drones to watch their movie. This is really pathetic usage of the stupid kid as comic relief for a really lame story about returning a magical staff to save the world and all that good stuff. <br /><br />There's the hot Asian girl that has absolutely no chemistry with our male lead- and his martial arts ability is a big fat zero and any fight scenes with him in it are just miserable to watch.<br /><br />It would have been a good movie if they could have just edited out the stupid worthless white kid and made an interesting story instead of this trash. The kung fu is wire fu for the most part, with not a lot of realism, just a lot of crap. Jackie and Jet should be ashamed of themselves for starring in this disgusting dog. PLOT: 95 pound weakling gets a hold of a magic staff and needs to return it to it's rightful owner - a martial arts master, along the way he befriends people that magically speak English even though they are Chinese that have never seen a white guy.. and that's just one of a long list of groaners that will make you go.. please kill me I can't stand this anymore.<br /><br />Better title- Crouching White Kid Hidden Pandering.<br /><br />If you must watch this- just fast forward through any scene with the kid in it or risk throwing up- some of the fight scenes are OK, but there's so many more movies out there that are better- like Iron Monkey, the Fong Sai Yuk series, House of Flying Daggers, Prodgial Son, Kiss of The Dragon, Ong Bak, etc...
