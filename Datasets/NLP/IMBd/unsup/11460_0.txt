I wish they would have included the original longer version of the "Bad Girl" video that was run on MTV. The longer original version had a much better story line to it, like a mini movie with more Christopher Walken scenes. But at least I have this one to watch, Madonna is at her very best in her career and her videos were visual magic! "Justify My Love" would have been another EXCELLENT video to have been included here but too much questionable content I guess. The black and white filming of "Justify" is pure genius! It really is too bad it's not included here. "Rain" is another visual masterpiece and "Bedtime Story" was one of the first truly "Over the Top Expensive" videos of the day and one of the first to use massive amounts of computer altered graphics, A real masterpiece! Don't pass up the chance to own this wonderful collection
