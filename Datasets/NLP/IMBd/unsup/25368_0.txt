Film opens witrh some pompous, overblown English "professor" (Frank Baxter) overacting and yapping about what could possibly be in the middle of the Earth. Then we get a story of John Agar and three other idiots discovering (in the middle of the Earth), a civilization of albino Sumarians (no, I'm not kidding) who use the title creatures as their slaves (again, not kidding). I'm giving this crap a 3 because some of the sets are impressive, but everything else rots. The story is, to say the least, ridiculous; the dialogue weak and the mole people look laughable (and nothing like moles). As for the acting: Hugh Beaumont (why Hugh?) is pretty good as is Cynthia Patrick as the obligatory love interest (for an albino, she looks like she's getting some sun). Agar is just horrible (but who could blame him?). He can be good, but not here. This is a truly stupid, dull movie--one of the worst sci-fi movies of the 50s. However, if you have insomnia, this'll cure it!
