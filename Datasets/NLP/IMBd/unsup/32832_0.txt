Man ! I give 1/10 for this movie. And I would prefer give 0. Can't believe kind of so bad "movie" exist. It's not "B series" but "Z series".<br /><br />Produce in 1992 ! Have no sense. Even the music of Ennio Morricone(Once Upon a Time in the West)is ridiculous for this "movie".<br /><br />It's evident after to watch this movie, that we can conclude actor/actress don't make movie just for fun but to win money to pay their "Kingdom", their Mercedes, their swimming pool, etc.<br /><br />Personally to be a good actor and make this kind of movie I would feel a lot depress. Oh my God !<br /><br />Even in my better bad nightmare I can't imagine a so bad movie. It's Fantastic that they are guys to find money to create this kind of "thing".<br /><br />Not only the movie is "null" but actor/actress are bad too. But can we be good in this kind of "movie".<br /><br />God give pardon to the producer of this "thing" cause he/they really don't know what they do !<br /><br />I must admit this "movie" is a very good soporific and if you have some trouble to sleep well I suggest you buy it. Be sure at 100% you will sleep before the end.
