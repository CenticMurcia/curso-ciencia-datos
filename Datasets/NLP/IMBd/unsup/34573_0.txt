Factoids: 1.'Short cut' road used is a clearly maintained county road.Never any maintenance, police or local use? Unbelievable.2. Sound of wind didn't match very light snowfall;hardly any snow falling which undermined the isolation one is supposed to feel.3.Very cold outside but no steam when they spoke?4.What did they not turn on the car heater?5.How could the battery last so long with the lights on?6.The guy early on mentions somethings spooky; i.e. supernatural: no tire tracks from car that runs them off the road. But showing his insight, no footprints are ever mentioned when the 'ghosts' appear repeatedly.7.Though in real life not too far removed from a college-aged kid, E. Blunt appears a decade older than the character she's playing.8.Overuse, with little payoff, of spectral figures fleeting by.9.Why not start walking back on road they just drove on? Irritating and periodic time reminders showed they weren't that far from the garage.10.The garage:Her being locked mysteriously into restroom with no one hearing her yelling?Does this mean that this is a warning from the evil vibes hovering many miles down the road?Why should this "warning" just be directed at her?11.Those periodic visits from spooks ultimately go from being mildly frightening to being irritating.AND SO ON AND SO ON. Main overall complaint? Too many story devices pulled in leading to confusion and its ultimate fate, irritable I-don't-care-what-happens-to-them syndrome.
