Sequels, by their nature, are supposed to be inferior to the original because they no longer have originality at their side. My my, does MIMIC 3 prove this notion. The film tries to be a thoughtful approach to the series, but it only ends up being tedious, dull, and wholly lacking in entertainment value. Too bad, because the actors do some good work, but the movie, sporting a thankfully short running time, does itself no favors. Dull characters mixed in with a dull story equals a dull movie. Even THE SIMPSONS gave us a better REAR WINDOW retread. And is it me, or did our voyeur photographer always seem to run out of film or forgot to click on his camera whenever the mimics were in view? Well, I guess if he actually took a picture of them the whole movie would be over, and the dumb cop couldn't keep thinking that our hero was nuts. How contrived.<br /><br />3 out of 10
