The relationship between Angel and Nene is one of the most passionate, destructive, uncompromising depictions of love in all its blood-soaked sordidness that I've seen in a long time. These are not nice guys. They are wounded and fierce and protective of each other. So complex a relationship needs time to develop on film and director ,Marcelo Pi√±eyro, isn't afraid to give it to them. We share the sweltering boredom of their exile, the desperation of Nene's love for Angel and Angel's wordless, psychotic attempts to save Nene. These great actors can say it all in a single look. It is one of the most intensely erotic and romantic film I've seen in a very long time.This is a movie that will stay with me.
