I fully agree with 'Cabbleaddict' all right... Maybe not QUITE as bad as all that, but definitely NOT a keeper by any means. And YES, I also agree that likely the main culprit here was the director (thus like CA said, not surprisingly the guy did only 2 other films) First thing on looking this up here on IMDb was 'Who the hell is that...???' upon seeing who the director was.<br /><br />Basically, pretty much the word 'amateurish' sums up my overall impression. Nice outdoor shots though; after viewing the film and before looking it up I would have sworn due to it's sort of dated execution (even for the time) that it had been made several years before this (even with the exception somewhat of the hair 'styles' and such which slightly may have indicated a tad more toward 1985) ALL of these people have done MUCH better!<br /><br />As to the one comment in the discussion section, yes, Mariel does indeed look a tad 'Manish' (except for the lovely set displayed in the shower of course : ) but ever since seeing 'PERSONAL BEST' (cough...) I'm afraid that I've been quite taken with her (and THAT was PRE-implants!!!)<br /><br />Okay, okay... I think I'd better stop on THAT note... Basically there are MANY films starring these same people, not necessarily together of course, where they are LIGHT YEARS better. You wanna see a good solid Kurt Russell film, see either 'SOLDIER' (for Sci Fi fans) or 'DARK BLUE' a bloody excellent Police Drama / Thriller! Another excellent film directed like 1 MILLION times better (Sidney Lumet) starring Andy Garcia and a lovely cast is 'NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN', another excellent Police Thriller!<br /><br />So... a '6'...??? NO... But, maybe a '4', yeah...
