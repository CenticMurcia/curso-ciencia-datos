This movie is one of the best renditions of "a Christmas carol" that i have ever seen, and yet most people have never heard of it! it doesn't get to all aspects of Dickens' original work, but it hits all the major points, and is coupled with great creative and original songs that get stuck in your head for days. The third person narration by B.A.H. Humbug it a very cute extra touch. In my opinion, the movie is neck-in-neck with Mickey Mouse for the best take on "Carol." It doesn't always get a yearly playing, but it is definitely worth keeping your eye out when scanning your TV guide around Christmas. It is really a fantastic retelling of a classic!!
