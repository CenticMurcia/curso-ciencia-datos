This movie is the worst movie ever to play on my television set. Its copies should be burned. Tim Curry's mustache was falling off. Daryl Hannah's rendition of Morticia was definitely NOT to die for. The actors had no idea how to play the parts they were given. They were either overly dramatic or had no emotion whatsoever. Even the scenery was awful! And the script was absolutely repulsive. The plot simply wasn't there. Overall, bad script, bad lighting, bad portrayals, bad props, even. Don't see it, no matter the circumstances--it disgraces the Addams Family name. Try "The Addams Family" or "Addams Family Values" instead.
