I was in college when JANE visited Vietnam; I thought her actions were disloyal to the United States, and to the men & women fighting in SE Asia against communism. In all the years since then there has been nothing that Jane Fonda Turner has done other than marry a rich man. Any of her supported charities or so called good works could not measure up to other people who volunteer or give money for causes. Nor could she ever make up for the harm she did to individuals or the military fighting in Vietnam. She is a traitor and should have been charged as one, and should have been deported and denied citizenship back in the '70s. Her family name has given her privilege, but should not give her honor. She is infamous, not famous. ABC & Barbara Walters should never have considered her a great woman. She was even mediocre as an actress/entertainer.
