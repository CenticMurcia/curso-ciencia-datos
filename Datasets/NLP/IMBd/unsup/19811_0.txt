I've recommended this film to countless friends, and the reviews are always mixed. I lived in Battle Creek for 3 years so perhaps it just means more to me. <br /><br />This film was in fact shot in NY and NC, not Battle Creek, but they still did a great job portraying the romance of the early 1900's.<br /><br />The performances are top notch and the actors in this film are give their best. It's a great film, but not a critically acclaimed movie.<br /><br />Dana Carey could've had more lines, but what I want to know is what happened to the character actor who played him as a child, this kid was really great and could've been huge. <br /><br />The one liners in this movie are classic. It's one of those films that you think is funny, but when you recall it at a later date, its even funnier. <br /><br />So get a big, buttered bowl of popcorn and enjoy it for what it is! A hilarious tale of the wacky health craze of the early 1900's.
