Summary: Four strangers with dreams of success meet in a train to Mumbai from Allahabad. Bobby (Dino Morea), Omi (Rohit Roy), Jai (Bikram Saluja) and Lucky (Sanjay Suri) land in Mumbai and don't know what to do. One day, they decide to make big money and circumstances lead them to kidnapping Musa (Sanjay Dutt) who actually turns out to be a Don. The rest of the movie is a story of wasted talent, mindless bullets and wild dances.<br /><br />Comments: The story is absolutely weak with no substance. All we can see is that the boys understand the value of being at home and not exposing themselves to the dangers of their wild dreams. Dutt surely has performed well, but his Armani suits do not match with his profile of being a tough don. The four actors have done a fairly average job. The ladies in the movies didn't have much of role worth making a mention. The movie on the whole makes an average viewing.
