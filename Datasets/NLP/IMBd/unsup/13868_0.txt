This short t.v. show was funny, excitement, and plain old great, it's not bad for a long time ago show that has been in the air for 27 years. That is a long time and you know why that long, because it was a great show. Yogi is a bear that wants a lot of food for hibernation, he and his partner in time Boo-Boo will not stop going past the ranger and get the picnic basket. But they always fail in one after another way in a funny way but different ways. And he has a girl name Cindy who loves him but Yogi doesn't love her back, thats so funny.I wished they never stopped making "The Yogi Bear Show", the people back then and right now will miss the show.
