This would seem to be a twisted social statement disguised as a holiday movie. That statement being that women who commit serious crimes, especially if those women are pretty, are somehow not responsible for those crimes. There is always an "evil man" who is the "true criminal" behind it. I have seen this same set up in countless movies.<br /><br />We really need to rid ourselves of this notion. Women are capable and guilty of every single crime that a man could commit and some they couldn't.<br /><br />In the first fifteen minutes, our main character is guilty of theft, lying to the police, reckless endangerment of a child, using a child to perform a crime and the biggest one, assault. She should receive at least ten years in prison for those crimes.<br /><br />I won't go into the rest of the story of the film, because it only seeks to disarm you into thinking she is a good person who had good reason for what she did. She isn't and she didn't.<br /><br />The ending though is something pretty incredible. She is given a massive second chance which she doesn't deserve, but she says the "real bad guy" (who is arrested thanks to a planted wallet) doesn't deserve one and actually has the the gall have him charged for burglarising her house! Let's put things into context here. She is guilty of hundreds, probably thousands of thefts. Everything she bought in that house, was bought with money stolen off innocent, hard working people. She is in turn robbed, and thinks she is entitled to justice for that robbery? That is insane.<br /><br />This movie may preach forgiveness, but only if you're female and blonde. The rest of us have to live by the normal rules and laws of society.<br /><br />2/10
