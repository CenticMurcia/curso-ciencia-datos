Although Fear of Flying introduces a better plot than the first, the acting is very bad and some parts are outrageously unrealistic. Who would fire a gun in a plane? One amusing part was when the terrorist threatens to blow up the anthrax bomb in the plane. This would not only destroy the plane and the humans, but the anthrax will disperse. Two passengers acquire the detonator,push the bomb out the door of the plane, and it detonate it so the terrorist does not attempt to dispose of the passengers. In other words, what appeared to be a good deed, subsequently enabled the anthrax to disperse. Another amusing part was when a passenger attempts to talk to a Czechoslovakian terrorist. She says she only knows a little of the language, but then suddenly starts speaking as if she speaks it fluently! The main terrorist had these cool claws which he used to dispose of his victims. Fear of Flying was somewhat more entertaining than the first Turbulence, in good and bad ways.
