Gregory is your average Scottish teenager, interested in football (soccer for us in America)and girls, not necessarily in that order. He falls in love with the new striker on the team, a girl who took his place. When he finally gets up the nerve to ask her out, things don't turn out exactly as he plans.<br /><br />I first saw Gregory's Girl shortly after it was released, when I was an awkward and shy teenager myself. John Gordon Sinclair does a realistic and believable portrayal of Gregory, and the fickle love of an adolescent. I also find the scenes between Gregory and his sister Madeline very touching and heartwarming.<br /><br />This is a feel good movie dealing with adolescent crushes, and is well worth seeing. I wish that it had gone on longer and shown us more of the characters' lives--it just finished too soon.
