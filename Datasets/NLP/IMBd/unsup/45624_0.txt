The action in this film is extremely implausible and unexciting, the film is formulaic, and the plot is thin as a thrice brewed tea bag. While the acting is fine, the plot is ludicrous. <br /><br />A man walking down the middle of a busy street in Italy with a gun in his hand, and no one says/does anything.<br /><br />Full automatic fire in the Guggenheim Museum with no security or cops appearing until conveniently after the "action" -- and 10 minutes after the 1st bullets flew.... <br /><br />The idea that law enforcement would be unable or unwilling to follow this neon-sign lit-up obvious yet laughable string of events.... Well, I'm just going to log my rating as very poor and suggest people do not pay to watch this film.
