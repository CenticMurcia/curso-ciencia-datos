I bought a copy under the illusion that Connery right in the middle of his Bond days combined with the name Sidney Lumet would make a nice little film. Didn't expect it to be watchable but it was a heist film and they are always a laugh.<br /><br />Instead I got the chance to see the most dated nugget of junk I have ever seen. Trust me considering my collection of tapes that's a feat.<br /><br />Now I shouldn't really be giving this film a review as I couldn't manage the whole thing. I just could not endure the sight of Mr Connery getting back into bed yet again with Ms Cannon, the half-hearted fawning of a supposedly gay Mr Balsam [didn't know it was possible to underact a gay stereotype] and as for the direction and focus of the film I an only guess that Mr Lumet had other things on his mind.<br /><br />Beyond all these the sound effects and music destroyed the film most concisely. The 'hidden camera' effects stood out so badly that I just had to keep pressing the mute button to avoid them.<br /><br />Another film which badly utilises 'modern' technology but not quite as badly as this is 'The Osterman Weekend' but I managed to get through that and it didn't obscure the film as intently as this. So if you want to watch a dated techno-thriller watch that instead.
