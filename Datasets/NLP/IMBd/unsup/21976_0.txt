I thought this movie would be awful but I was wrong.Aly & AJ's acting was fine & the rest of the cast's too.This movie is about the spoiled Callum sisters who are forced to work at their father's dairy.Their father is gone on vacation & it's up to Taylor & Courtney to save the day by trying to find their father's missing money.<br /><br />After seeing this movie I bought Aly & AJ's CD Into the Rush because I liked the song On the Ride so much!<br /><br />I am glad this movie is coming out on DVD June 27.The only thing that I didn't like movie was(for some reason)the name.<br /><br />I actually didn't get to see the ending but the rest of the movie was fine.<br /><br />I give this movie 9/10.
