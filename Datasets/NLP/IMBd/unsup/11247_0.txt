This is a great action comedy with that wonderful rare combination of film categories Hong Kong films were so famous for during the early 1990s. Spectacular action combines with outrageous comedy and romance in this spoof of almost everything. This makes similar US romantic situation comedy films look very slow and boring by comparison. Maggie Cheung, Chingmy Yau, and Brigitte Lin are all fabulous, as is Ekin Cheng, Tony Leung Kar Fai and Jackie Cheung. Three sisters decide to get some temporary boyfriends when they think they have discovered their widower dad has terminal cancer with only a month to live. Brigitte Lin is a masculine, abusive, violent cop, who picks a high paid gigolo because she can control, beat, and threaten him to behave. Maggie Cheung is a naive, sweet optimist who accidentally picks a real lowlife very crude low-level sociopath gangster. She thinks he is great, and overlooks all his defects. Chingmy is the younger sexy sister who thinks she is picking a virgin. All three situations are insanely funny and combine for even more insanity when they all get together in the house to meet their dad. The Triad Olympics scene is especially funny- possibly a spoof of special Olympics. Throw your taste out the window, and prepare to witness things you have never seen before when watching this truly outrageous action-comedy directed by Wong Jing. Look for the uncut version on laserdisc if you can- for even more outrageousness.
