Well, it doesn´t make much sense and Anthony Perkins in his post-"Psycho"-mood is as one-note as a standard-villain can get. But Roger Moore - then still the reigning James Bond - as a women bashing, cold-blooded and bearded anti-terrorist expert does not just save the day but runs away with every scene he is in and eventually with the movie itself. Nothing to spoil a great evening with your closest friends for, but a pleasant joyride in case you´ve nothing better to do.
