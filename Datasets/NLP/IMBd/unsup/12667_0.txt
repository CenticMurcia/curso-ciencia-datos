Call it the Arctic Documentary, meets Alive!, meets Jurassic 'Horror' Park.<br /><br />I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival and enjoyed from beginning to end, rather unexpectedly with really good results.<br /><br />This movie is about an oil research team in the remote reaches of the Alaskan Arctic, trying to see just how feasible oil drilling is, weighing the environmental unknowns against the corporate needs to secure 'energy independence'. Then as this clash intensifies, the human stakes start to rise out against the bleakness of the landscape.<br /><br />Real, dramatic, yet occasionally intense, against a bleak landscape, the realness of this story shone through. This was my kind of movie.
