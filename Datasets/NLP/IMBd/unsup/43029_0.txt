I usually enjoy Asian films, but this was just a 2 hour drag... I felt deprived of a good old-fashioned revenge-film. When you read the back of the cover and look at the pictures it's obvious that the film is marketed as an action/revenge-film, yet there's only a few exciting moments in the entire (and BTW extremely long) 2 hours. Imagine going to grab a burger, you see the sign, the menu says "hamburger", and yet what you get is a salad. This film was to me like a salad in a burger-wrapping (I know,terrible analogy, but you get the point?).<br /><br />If you're expecting action, you'll be very disappointed. If drama is your cup of tea, then you might enjoy this. I didn't...
