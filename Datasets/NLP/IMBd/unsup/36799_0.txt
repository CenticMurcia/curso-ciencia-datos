I had really high hopes for this movie. what the Hughe's brothers have done is turn one of the most fascinating murder/mysteries of the 20th Century into an music video with no narrative structure or form and absolutely no redeeming features.<br /><br />The love story between Mary Kelly and Abberline is ridiculous. it's only saving grace are the few quips from Robbie Coltrane and some nice character moments by Jason Flemyng. The gore is pointless. there is no tension , there is no mystery. the scenes are arranged one after the other, but there is absolutely nothing linking them. give me the Michael Caine adaptation of the ripper story any day. far more entertaining.<br /><br />
