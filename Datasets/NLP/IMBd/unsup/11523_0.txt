BUCK PRIVATES is the first film in which famous comedy team Abbott and Costello played the main characters. The story follows two salesmen who escape from the police and end up in the US Army, where they have many hilarious adventures. Probably the funniest army movie ever, it includes some of their funny gags, involving Costello who keeps turning on the radio and angering their boss, and the "right, left, right, left" scene. The film that boosted these brand new stars to success, BUCK PRIVATES is a fun adventure with a heart, for the whole family.<br /><br />Grade: 7/10<br /><br />MPAA Rating: not rated<br /><br />My Rating: Ages 5 and up (some mild violence)
