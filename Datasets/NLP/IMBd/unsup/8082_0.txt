This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of Nicholle Tom's movies. Nicholle was the perfect choice to play Amy Dustin and her acting is superior! I think Nicholle should have won an Academy Award for her performance in this movie. When Amy is forced to by Pete have sex with him you can clearly see the fear in her eyes. I have seen this movie several time and I am still impressed and deeply touched by the way the movie tells the story of Amy Dustin. It is a tragic tale of how a young girl can be abused by a older man. I think everyone (and not just Nicholle fans) should see this movie.<br /><br />
