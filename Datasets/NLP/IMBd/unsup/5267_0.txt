Wing Commander is not the best game-made-movie to be produced, nor is it even meant to be. It has some noticeable performances by some otherwise unknown actors, it has top-of-the-line special effects, and you don't need to be a genius to figure out the plot. So why is almost everyone dumping on it so much?<br /><br />When you look at it, WC is a pretty good film, especially considering the budget it was made on. Sure, the Kilrathi looked pretty dumb at times, but it was better than not seeing them at all, which was what they had originally planned, and yes, bullets in space does sound a little strange at first, but for me, it's a welcome change from the old Star Wars/Star Trek clich√©s out there; laser blasters, photon torpedos, all that bull. And WC does perfectly fine without any of it. The acting is not top-notch, but it's still pretty damn good, especially Tcheky Karyo's performance as Paladin. Now THAT's good acting for you!<br /><br />The overall plot is the low point of the film, that I will admit. It basically consists of the team stopping the Kilrathi from snatching a "Nav-Com" unit that will enable them to target destinations when jumping through wormholes, and thus enable them to hitch a ride to Earth. The idea of naming those gravity wells after the two monsters from the Odyssey is definitely a nice touch. The idea of the discrimination against the Pilgrims, and thus the hostility Chris Blair faces, adds an emotional side of film, along with the idea of not acknowledging one's existence after they've died. It adds where the story lacks.<br /><br />Yes, there is some cheesiness factor, and yes, it could have been better. Besides, it isn't meant to please everyone. No movie is, for that matter. I suppose this is just one of those films where hard-core sci-fi fans are looking for true refinement. You won't find it in WC. For those of you with simple tastes, like me, for instance, will find yourselves a completely enjoyable movie for all intents and purposes.<br /><br />If you're a sci-fi fan who isn't looking for perfection in anything he sees, try Wing Commander. You may just like it.<br /><br />My only question is, why did almost everyone in the film speak with some kind of foreign accent?
