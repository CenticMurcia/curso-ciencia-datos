I would rank this movie as one of the top 10 worst movie I have seen this year.<br /><br />I thought it was a crime type movie according to its name. It turned out to be a horror movie, with ghosts throughout the movie to scare people.<br /><br />It was not a brilliant crime story as well; the ending was quite silly with no logic. It seemed like the ghosts brought the female police to the solution. And the ending is "The Alphabet Killer" had not been caught, how positive was that? At the end, every one of us looks like idiot, and waste our 1.5 hours.<br /><br />Did the female police had serious mental illness? She was over-reacting, the character could be more normal than what she did. For the last, half an hour, I really grind my teeth to finish this movie. If I have a brick on my hand, I would throw it to the screen.<br /><br />Definitely one of the Hollywood junks, don't waste you time and money, and fooled by the beautiful and exciting movie name!!
