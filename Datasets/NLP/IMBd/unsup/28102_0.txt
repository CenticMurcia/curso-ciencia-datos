At times like an Afterschool Special (Nami inherited a mansion, she and her boyfriend check it out while the two computer nerds offer advice via computer download), at times purposely made to resemble a video game (Nami and her boyfriend enter each room of the mansion, get a key or other object, exit room via secret door, etc.), at times like a predictable, over the top horror movie (Nami, I'm your crazy sister!), St. John's Wort would be a total turkey if it were not for a few arty special effects that quickly grow annoying and a gloss of Generation Y computerese. Skip this one and you won't be sorry -- try "Dark Water" or "The Two Sisters" (Korean) if you are looking for quality Asian horror.
