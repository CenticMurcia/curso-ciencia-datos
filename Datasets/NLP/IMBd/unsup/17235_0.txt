The Corner is an EXCELLENT drama series directed by Charles(Roc) Dutton on HBO. If you don't know what its like in the hood...please check this mutha out!!! The series takes place in Baltimore(based on a true story), and it is about the everyday happenings in a particular neighborhood and its down and out residents. The Corner takes you into the hellish lives of dope fiends and what they must do to stay high. Of course, this story has been shown before but, the talent of the actors make you feel as though you are watching a true life documentary such as, Investigative Reports(Bill Kurtis). A+ acting from the entire cast makes this show a must see! 10/10 stars!!!!
