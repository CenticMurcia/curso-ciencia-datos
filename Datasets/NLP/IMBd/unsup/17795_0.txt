<br /><br />So simple, so good. This film is a milestone in Turkish cinema. You will not see the so-called "art film" syndromes or "avant-garde absurdities" in this film. But this doesnt mean that it lacks of depth. No way buddies, this is a pretty good film: entertaining, giving cinema pleasure, and having depth in plot. Cem Yilmaz acts wonderful. Mazhar Alanson of famous band MFO which I am a fan of, is quite good together with Selim Nasit who died shortly after this film. Good plot, good acting, good songs. You'll certainly enjoy it! I give 8 out of 10.
