Hey, I laughed my butt off watching this film! It was a laugh a minute thrill for me. Once in a great while, Hollywood will actually make a movie for the sole purpose of entertainment, and this film is one of them.<br /><br />I don't see this as a cruel movie in regards to animals, but it's more like a live action cartoon. We saw this type of thing in the old Tom and Jerry cartoons, and the writers gave the same formula a James Bond/Mission Impossible theme and gave us this great comedy. It's not anti-cat, as someone wrote in these pages, and I say that because the cats are decidedly the funniest characters in the movie. Hey, I own two cats and two dogs, I love them all, and a true animal lover will love this film.<br /><br />A hilarious triumph! However, I will suggest that if you only love cats, stay away, or you might be offended. Other than that, great film for seeing over and over.
