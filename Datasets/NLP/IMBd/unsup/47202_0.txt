I read James Dixon's great novelization of this sequel first, so my expectations were high. Too high. It plays like a retread of the first film with three killer tots instead of one.<br /><br />John Ryan is back trying to warn other parents of the infant scourge, but nobody listens until it's too late or they're dead.<br /><br />Once again, Cohen gives us a dialog-heavy, vapid time-waster with little action until the last ten minutes and badly directed action at that.<br /><br />Bernard Herrmann's score is culled from unused cues from the first film and is the film's only saving grace.<br /><br />If you can still find it, read the novelization and consider what this film could have been.
