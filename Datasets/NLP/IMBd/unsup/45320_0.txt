A boring wreck of a film, and a terrible waste of the talents of some usually excellent actors. Where can I start? Poorly shot on digital video, with a nearly nonexistent plot, lousy script, poor directorial choices that include jumpy editing and an annoying, extremely repetitious performance by Norman Reedus, who seems to be more interested in chewing his nails or smoking a cigarette than croaking another line of bad dialogue. More embarrassing is a very strange and unnecessary cameo by Sean Young, who really is going to the bottom of the barrel for a paycheck. I really felt sorry for Kathleen Robertson and Michael T. Weiss, good actors in a terrible movie, they deserve better, I just hope they were paid well at least! I saw this film at a special screening in Hollywood, and most of the cast and crew were in the audience and it received quite a tepid response, I guess they suffered a great deal watching it and didn't have enough energy to fake enthusiasm. I would advise you to avoid this movie, but it's so bad, I don't think anyone will put it out.
