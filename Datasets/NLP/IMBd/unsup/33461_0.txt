I could only rate this a 3/10 for Reese Witherspoon and Candace Bergen. The story of sweet home Alabama girl Reese and her desire to divorce her first husband in order to marry JFK, Jr. lookalike Patrick Dempsey is flawed from the first frame. However, Ms. Witherspoon is able to transcend the material and make the movie somewhat inviting. Candace Bergen as the Mayor of New York is totally unbelievable. Patrick Dempsey is given virtually nothing to do - and he has talent, but wasted in this picture. Josh Lucas - husband number one - lives in the requisite trailer and chugs beer at the local tavern. But, he is also a pilot and established wood designer. So, the premise that Reese is from the wicked south, uneducated and teen bride is baseless. The picture is totally predictable and a waste of time, except to watch Reese and Candace go at it during the wedding.
