Was still coming down off the high of the series finale of TNG as it was extraordinary. This show was a brand new concept. I was a little unnerved by it's premise, 'To Boldly Stay Where No One Has Stayed Before'. O boy was I wrong! Commander Ben Sisko was played with depth, emotion and so much integrity by Avery Brooks from minute one. The opener of this series was superb. Revisiting the battle of Wolf 359 was genius. The tension between Sisko and Picard was so well done. Patrick Stewart there to show all how to do it I'm sure! The Station is in the Bajoran System. The episode rolled on and the Wormhole is discovered. It is stable, a first for the Federation The Cardassians and Bajor were both relatively young races for Star Trek, but both were interesting and had so much room for development. The crew, Dax, a Trill with lots of oomph and wonderful character. Doctor Julian Bashir, an annoying at first character but who blossomed into one of the show's best. Major Kira Nerys, the Bajoran Liason and First Officer of the Station. Odo, Chief of Security and affectionately named 'Constable', a Shape shifter with an unexplored background. Miles Edward O'Brien, Chief Of Operations who has transferred over from the USS Enterprise and finally Jake Sisko, the latter Sisko's son. Ben having lost his wife, Jennifer at the battle of Wolf 359, explaining Sisko's earlier angst with Picard. This was one of Trek's better pilots and set it up for a very very interesting seven year run
