I only recently came across this phenomenon called the "Indigo child" when a former school principal, upon listening to some of the tales of my firstborn, suggested that she was most likely an "Indigo child." Knowing little of this so-called Indigo phenomenon, I searched on lineand came upon this movie, which I decided to finally watch for the sake of continuing my inquiry.<br /><br />All I can truly say from a purely intuitive viewpoint (and the nausea I felt when watching the movie) is that this is the most exploitive film I have ever seen produced, written and directed  worse yet than Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will" (perhaps as insidious). Its content was as exploitive as the New Age "colonialism," which has exploited ancient belief systems from indigenous peoples around the world and Eastern philosophies to create multi-billion dollar industries  from yoga to Taoism. <br /><br />The film itself is probably the worst produced, written, directed and actedcomparable to Kevin Costner's Waterworld and The Postman (two truly awful movies)<br /><br />More to the pointas a parent of a "gifted" child (now a young adult)all I can truly attest to is that too many parents and adults seeking "spiritual" rest (freedom from the contradictions and paradoxes of life)are exploiting their Judeo-Christian background (whether they are religious or otherwise)as a means to explain, control, find cause to and otherwise "deal" with existence. Using their children as foils to their own self-aggrandizement is ludicrous!<br /><br />In all honesty, spiritual cinema is a farce. If you look carefully at the history of cinema, its history shows the art of cinema (as are all artistic works) as an ongoing form of inquiry into the nature of human beings. Cinema, from one end of the spectrum to the other, is an outward manifestation of the anthropomorphic view of our existence. All cinema forms, have sought to understand the human condition through the lens of the camera (the third eye? the 6th Chakra...also known as the Indigo aura? nudge, nudge, wink, wink)  even the worst of films have glimpsed into our complex natures and relationship with metaphysical awareness.<br /><br />It is as arrogant to suggest that spiritual cinema is finally showing "us" as we truly are, as it is to suggest that Indigo children are rising up in numbers as "warriors" to save humanity from its downfall. Or that the arrogance of children feeling "entitled" in a generation of exhaustive individualism, capitalism and technological innovations is a "sign" of Indigo forthrightness. Let's face it...this generation is "smarter" because technological tools have changed the way they (we) think..(including cinema)... In short, this movie is propaganda for the spiritually and cognitively inept<br /><br />Finally, bravo to commentator and boom operator kstrain1, with whom I agree wholeheartedly in saying, "And Hollywood HAS made interesting spiritual films, like "Contact", "I Heart Huckabees", "Donnie Darko", "The Sixth Sense", "Phenomenon", "Waking Life", and "Powder'. Even the lousy "Revenge of the Sith" has more spiritual common sense than this film."
