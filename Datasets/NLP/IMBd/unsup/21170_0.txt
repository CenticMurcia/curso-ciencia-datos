Cary Grant & Irene Dunne were a great screen team --all 3 of their films were winners--but this one was the very best. Gail Patrick usually played a glamor puss &, as in this film, she was,as usual, very haughty. However, a very interesting sidebar to this film is watching Grant & Randolph Scott together. They made their 1st movie together back in 1932--a film called Hot Saturday. In My Favorite Wife,a stand out scene was when Grant 1st sees Scott on the diving board. His eyes light up and even later, in his office, he cannot get the image of Scott out of his mind. Of course, anyone might react that way if their wife had been alone with him for 7 years--but--these guys certainly looked ( and apparently did) like 2 guys who really appreciated each other--in more ways than one.
