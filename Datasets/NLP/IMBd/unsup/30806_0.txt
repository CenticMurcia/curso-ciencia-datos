From the creator of "Dexter's Laboratory" (once my favorite kids' show) comes an unjustly praised exercise in beating up "Star Wars" for more lunch money. Genndy Tartakovsky's brilliantly surreal animation is here, but this is supposed to be (at least remotely) dramatic, so the style doesn't fit. In fact, the characters look like goofy sub-par video game renderings that make this feel like a clunky, fan-fodder horror from beyond.<br /><br />The truth is, this is not just a miserable story, it's a miserable way to tell a miserable story, destroying all hope for half-decency. In context, nothing in this drivel can feel quite real. If you really want to see "Star Wars," you'd find more in the dreadfully stupid "Attack of the Clones" than this, which was little more than a piece of meat thrown to the ravening masses.<br /><br />If you have millennia of patience and don't experience headaches induced by severe stupidity and banality, enjoy.
