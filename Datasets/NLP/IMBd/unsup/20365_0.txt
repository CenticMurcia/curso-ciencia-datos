...because I wanted to watch this movie when it came out in theaters. Then I didn't rent it at Blockbuster for reasons I can't remember.<br /><br />I watched it when it aired on HBO. And man, what a letdown.<br /><br />The gorgeous Anne Hathaway was the main reason for me to watch this pile of crap. She doesn't save the day. Kate Hudson does her job but it isn't enough.<br /><br />There isn't a single funny moment. This shouldn't be considered as a comedy or drama, or anything.<br /><br />It's a dull, silly, pointless movie that doesn't delivers a single positive message for it's audience.<br /><br />The sexy Anne Hathaway at least shows some skin during her dancing sequences and I thank her for that. <br /><br />The humor is bland and you won't even smile. What was the intention of this movie? <br /><br />The ending that deals with the pregnancy was an insult for cinema.
