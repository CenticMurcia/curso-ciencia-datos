The Raffle is one god-awful film. It's fascinating to watch, though. Simply because you can't believe anyone would make a movie like this.<br /><br />It's about two dishwater-dull guys who want to make some money putting on a contest to find the most beautiful woman in the world. The plot has potential for comedy laced with some smut - it fails miserably on both counts.<br /><br />One thing that is highly irritating throughout the film is that the actors are always laughing or have big smiles on their faces when there is nothing funny going on. I'm not sure if that's because they realize how stupid the film is or because the director is trying to use them as a moving laugh track. If a laugh track is the case, then it doesn't work.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for viewing some T & A, steer clear of this gem. There is precious little of it. Considering the quality of the picture, you'd think they'd pepper it with female flesh.<br /><br />The screenplay seems like it was dubbed to fit the mouth movements of the actors instead of suiting the film.<br /><br />The cheese in this film is constant. There is scarcely a moment that I wasn't close to yakking.<br /><br />Mark Hammill has a small part in this debacle. Fortunately, I heard he cashed in on the recent Star Wars films, so he probably won't have to be part of a project like this again.<br /><br />If you are feeling masochistic or want to show film students how not to make a movie, check this one out.<br /><br />
