This film seems to be an inept attempt to recapture the magic of Casablanca (it even features the ending scene of the plane taking off) and fails despite having Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. The story deals with a Nazi plot to stir up trouble in neutral Turkey and it doesn't work. George Raft is miscast and just doesn't pull it off. It is ironic that he turned down the lead role in Casablanca and movie fans should be grateful.Recommended only for movie buffs and Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet fans.
