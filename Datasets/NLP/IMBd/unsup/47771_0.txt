Regarding the story and the message, it was nice to see Mark Harmon's character change into a good guy at the end but for most the movie he, and all the other characters simply typify Hollywood and the low moral standards it holds. I hope the rest of the U.S.A. doesn't think or act the way the people here do, but who knows?<br /><br />The movie is slick-looking but oozes the sleaze we saw in the 1970s. Madeline Stowe, more of a '90s actress, would have been more 'appropriate' in those grimy '70s films apparently with a lot of the roles she seemed to play in the '90s, like this one in which her character has zero morals. She's a pretty woman but that horrible, throaty voice of hers is brutal and loses whatever sex appeal she is supposed to have. And who's the woman Harmon is going after? Her, of course. <br /><br />A bad choice by him, and a bad one by me to waste time watching this fluff.
