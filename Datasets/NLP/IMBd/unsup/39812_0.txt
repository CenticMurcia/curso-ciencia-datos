Bollywood movies have grown up a lot and are becoming more mainstream. The problem is the standard Bollywood movie has to follow a strict formula, with very little room for experimentation. This movie appeared to try to push some of those boundaries, but with little result. The plot line starts off normal, the FOB character is far from believable. His character would be a FOB in India, the way he's portrayed. The characters are very plastic and predictable.<br /><br />The music and dance scenes were nice, modern and fun. The supporting characters were the best part of the movie. This "party" takes up almost 1/3 of the movie and nothing goes on really, leaving you waiting for the traditional ending "big speech". When it arrives, it makes no sense, and if ANYONE can understand the main character's point from his dialog at the "big speech" then send it to the production company for inclusion on the video jacket. It might raise the rating a notch or two. Fans of Bollywood will find this average, fans of comedy will forget it within hours and fans of movies will find it below average.
