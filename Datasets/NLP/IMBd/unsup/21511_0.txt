When I saw this movie for the first time I wasn't Meg Ryan's fan yet. I think I watched it in one of this saturday morning tv session, I really liked, specially the cast. This wonderful girl, who I became fan later is really funny and totally different of the kind of characters she would became specialist later. Dennis Quaid is great, he is a very talented actor, but working with the woman he was going to marry is incomparable, there is a great chemistry between them. But the star of the movie is Martin Short, who is hilarious as the schizophrenic Jack. It's certainly the funniest science fiction movie ever made.
