Different, fun and like life itself doesn't have an exact Hollywood outcome. <br /><br />The main characters learns and teaches others. One of my favorite scenes is about the reason for taking off shoes before going into the house - it's basically so you leave the world and it's chaos outside your sanctuary and not to avoid getting dirt that can be vacuumed up later.<br /><br />Also, when you put two different cultures together you learn a lot about each. The good and the bad. There is some basic dishonesty in our own culture and also many humorous sayings that arn't to be taking literally.<br /><br />I also recommend renting Shall We Dance.
