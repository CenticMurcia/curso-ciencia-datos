"Immagini di un convento" is a nunsploitation film that really delivers - I would rather call it "Sexual Revolution in a Convent". There's something weird and fascinating in the notion of women being locked or locking themselves behind convent walls, where they have to lead a life that denies their identity of women, all of it to serve an abstraction called God. But our lives are ruled by abstractions. Are they really necessary? But that's beside the point. Let's go to the film.<br /><br />Joe D'Amato, in an interview featured in my DVD (Exploitation Digital), confesses that he always felt a kind of attraction for nuns. They lived in his fantasies (maybe something to do with the forbidden fruit).<br /><br />The film credits say that the film is loosely based on Jacques Diderot's "La Religieuse". Very, very loosely, I should say (I've read the book). But that doesn't matter either. Anyway the film is really very interesting (in all senses). Our senses be praised!<br /><br />"Immagini di un convento" pulls no punches. The film begins with the arrival of a noble woman, Isabella (Paola Senatore), who was confined against her will in the convent. The first thing she does when introduced to the Mother Superior is to uncover her breasts as a protest. The Mother Superior is aghast with shock (or maybe secretly excited) and orders Isabella with a trembling voice to leave her and go to her cell. This is just the beginning! We are then introduced to the nuns (all of them very beautiful). Suddenly a thunderous noise outside is heard. All the nuns go running to see what it is. They find a man lying on the ground bleeding, maybe he was another victim of the robbers that abound in the surrounding forest. They lodge him in a hut near the convent. He is an artist and also a veritable Don Juan with a magnetic charm. In the park that circles the convent there's a statue of Pan, the satyr with horns (or maybe the Devil). It's a laughing ironic statue with strange eyes. Strange things begin to happen in the convent. Lesbian affairs, whips, dildos, masturbation, and even rape (and what a rape!). <br /><br />An exorcist is called, but the nuns are already wild and hot. While he tries to purify the convent, nuns are masturbating in their cells, one nun using a dildo on another, some are licking and kissing in a state of frenzy, while the Mother Superior is wildly throwing herself around the bed pressing her legs together, nearly out of her mind. And the serene exorcist proceeds along the corridor saying prayers in Latin and sprinkling holy water around. The nuns, naked or semi-naked, emerge from their cell doors and begin to follow the priest and... Well, I think it's not necessary to tell more. I think that by now you know what you're in for. <br /><br />"Immagini di un convento" is very interesting, it is the strongest nunsploitation film that I've seen so far. Good cinematography. Highly recommended!
