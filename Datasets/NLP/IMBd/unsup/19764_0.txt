Firstly, this is a very unlucky movie. Don't misunderstand me! Actually it's a great movie, however it's very very underestimated also. There are two reason for that: 1- It took pressure from government in turkey before it began to play. 2- It isn't understood. For example, even most of people who have watched the movie and loved it don't understand who is the killer. It has a very heavy plot. First reason of the underestimation of the movie lead us to state fascism theme of the movie. Second reason lead us not only everyday fascism but also (and because of first one) state fascism. I'd like to say one more thing: We can read the theories of Foucault from the line spaces of the scenario. Power relations (goverment, pressure, Turkish word of "iktidar" contain the meaning of all of these) are in everywhere. In the state, in the school, sexual relations, in the family, in the neighborhood and (surely) in the examination room of a police station. **************************************Spoiler: I must turn the real question of the movie because you can't understand things I wrote if I don't answer that question. Answer: The killer of Spiky girl(Kirpi)is the police! For this reason censure committee tried to obstruct the broadcasting of the movie.Okay, how can we find the killer from the movie? Name of the movie is 9. There are 8 people (except the police) in the examination room. Mom 1, Stationer 2, American man 3, Greengrocer 4, Ex-fiancée 5, Photo Firuz 6, Tunç 7, Kaya 8, ? 9. Who is the 9th person? Where did the necklace (of Yiddish symbol)come from? Why did they (the police) stop recording before they beat and torture Kaya and made him confess the crime and sign ? If we don't answer these, we can't find the killer. Remember the words of Firuz: " If you want, all things could have lived in a different manner." Tunç prefer to confess (or do) the crime because he didn't want his nationalist (and praised) dad (the butcher) have known he had f*Cked Firuz. Firuz (who possibly knew the real killer) prefer to agree the accusation of murder because he want that nobody have known his homosexuality (and his love to Kaya)so he made up a different story about the murder with the police along the movie (and the reason of the pain he felt while he was sitting on his ass is not his regret!) and he tried to save Kaya from accusations while he was doing that. Salim the stationer (who possibly knew the real killer) panicked and told a lot of things because he tried to save Kaya (because he is his real father). American is an "other" and all neighborhood could accuse him for this crime. American and Salim are afraid of the reactions of the neighborhood (because one of them is an ex-communist and a cheater while other one is a foreigner) and they are easily persuaded to hide somethings for the possibility to continue their lives in the neighborhood. And Spiky is an "other" too and all neighborhood (Mom, grocer etc.)hate her and would like to kill her. But there is a video tape Firuz had recorded so suspects are Kaya, Firuz and Tunç. At the end of the examinations of the neighborhood, the police succeeded to make people accuse each other, make up false stories and agree the accusation. Finally, the police tortured Kaya (who don't want to agree the "confession"), made up the "necklace story" so he signed. 9th is Spiky (Kirpi) who had been killed by the police (or us!) in the examination room of the police office. And the last question: Why we (or the police) killed Spiky? Katil polis! **********************************Spolier
