First to say: This was one good movie, entertaining and interesting and somehow even exciting. Cast and the core of the story were really not bad....not bad..actually that's, what this movie was. But it could have been really great. It was not because the actors sometimes could not be convincing enough. Actually it was not an actor-problem, but more a screenplay- or director-problem. The adjustment of the original story with a standard hollywood-template simply was too obvious. The atmosphere was not bad, but it was not really continuous. The cuban flair and atmosphere of the setting also could have been brought to the screen in a more intense way. So it lacked the great excitement. But you always can do it better. In fact it was a really romantic, erotic, entertaining and thrilling lovestory (sorry...a story about love ;-)). Compared to the horrible standard crap-romances you could see at the cinemas the last years it was very refreshing. Watch it without great expectations and you will be surprised. 7 Stars!!
