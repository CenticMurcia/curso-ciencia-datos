I just watched "Someone She Knows" although it was a very good movie I I wished it would have had the conclusion of the trial. Usually at the end of the movie there is the outcome of the jail sentence. It is so many people that could be and are in the same danger as this little girl was. This movie will help people think about others. This happened back in 1986, this is now 2007, I hate to imagine how many more children this has happened too. A sad thing too because children are innocent and so trusting to people they know ( think they know ).<br /><br />I have tried to find out the outcome on the trial. When it took place and what his sentence was. I have not had any luck. What about the parents Belinda and Kim Sorrell ? Are they still in Kansas ? Did they ever have any more children ? If anyone has any information on this would you please post it ?
