This was a HUGE waste of time and $$$$$. What a discrace to the original. This is now my all time worst movie !! I don't think that this will be topped for some time. I should have known better, this movie didn't even make it to the theatres. It is no wonder Paul Newman doesn't appear in it, he probably could sense that it was pure GARBAGE !!
