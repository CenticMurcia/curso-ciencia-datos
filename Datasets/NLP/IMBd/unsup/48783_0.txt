Shelley Long... ugh!!! The female Steve Guttenberg of the 1980's. Hello Again is merely playing on the ideas that were already washed up in the 1930's screwball comedies, but had least had clever writers and fresh ideas. This is like watching the rejected pages for "Blithe Spirit" or "Move Over, Darling". Corbin Bernsen is just a smarmier Guttenberg.
