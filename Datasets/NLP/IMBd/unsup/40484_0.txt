Seen this clichéd piece of film-making tonight; now I want my money back; extremely disappointing film on all levels.<br /><br />After enjoying the freshness of the original Pusher, then Bleeder was alright film overall; although it was hailed as a big advertising flop here in Denmark.<br /><br />Anyway, this Pusher 2, of which I hear the only reason they made this, is that they thought they could big money on a sequel and they needed it because their production company's Fear X was a big flop in America. Personally I think this is always a bad idea to make a movie from this viewpoint.<br /><br />The "story" follows Tonny (not a bad performance by Mads Mikkelsen but nothing at all special either) as he comes out of prison and finds out about his family and stuff and oh yeah steals a Ferrari; which turns out to be the biggest laugh of the film; somebody leaves a Ferrari in the middle of the road with the keys in it, hops out to say hi to his girlfriend and Tonny steals it...ha ha..yeah lucky guy!!! I love dark and gritty films but please don't give me this clichéd nonsense...and by the way; if all these guys and girls have no money, how is it that every scene you see them, they are snorted coke? It just made it all seem less real and the filmmaker was trying too hard to be "ghetto"...it just doesn't work.<br /><br />I heard there is another Pusher 3 in on the way, lets hope they bring back Kim Bodnia !!YEAH!! and all will be forgiven for this mess!
