Sweet Helen Hunt is better for bland Andrew McCarthy than sexy-but-bitchy and thoughtless Kelly Preston, but it takes him the entire movie to figure that out. This painfully predictable comedy tries to delay the inevitable by coming up with a series of forced scenes and situations, and it's also visually dreary, despite the potentially majestic locations. I think Hunt is the best thing in the picture. (*1/2)
