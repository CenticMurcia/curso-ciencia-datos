"House of Luk" had a wonderful response at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January 2001. It was perhaps the lowest budget film screened at the festival but many attendees said they thought it had better entertainment value than many of the blockbuster movies which were also featured. You will remember the characters in this movie many months after you see and hear their story. Their predicaments and the resolution of their fortunes will encourage you to believe anyone's luck can change. "House of Luk" does not rely on blowing things up, computer generated effects or violence. It is 100% story driven.<br /><br />
