This wasn't what I expected out of a WWII film. The whole film seemed like a total insult to what people had to go through during WW2 and the only thing that this film shows is how a stupid love triangle got broken up. At the beginning when the 80 yr old man dropped dead after hearing "the famous song" and people saying that it's cursed, I already had impatience for it. I don't like superstitious themes in any kind of film genre except horror; any other kind of genre seems totally out of place. Pet peeve. The worse part of the film were the characters who I couldn't identify with or hold sympathy for any of them. They were at best self-indulgent, debauched, selfish, had lack of humanity and uncaring for the world around them. I thought the most despicable character was Ilona who expects the world to revolve around her fingers, self-absorbed, manipulative, depraved, and unadaptable. At least Andre had some sort of conscience and killed himself knowing that his music caused suffering instead of getting rich off dead people unlike Laslo. It was war, people (Jews, Poles, Gypsies, etc.) where being hauled off in cattle trains by the minute, Nazis shoot people as sport and seize control of government, homes, businesses and yet a menage a trois was living a happy dissolute life because they have each other... that's suppose to be touching?! Give me a freakin' break!!!
