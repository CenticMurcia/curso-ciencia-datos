This beautiful film is another action western about Union and Confederate soldiers at a western outpost whose task is to hold the territory for the Union, prevent rebel defections, and fight Indians. A pretty rebel sympathizer uses her charms to effect an escape of Confederate officers and the hunt is on. William Holden and Eleanor Parker play off one another well in this tug of war and wills with John Forsythe hovering as an interested party. The film has exciting cavalry-Indian battle scenes, and the second clash is particularly novel in its execution because it is done by Indians. A craven rebel soldier proves to be the unlikely hero at the wind up. The picture was filmed largely in Death Valley and is striking in its great visual beauty.
