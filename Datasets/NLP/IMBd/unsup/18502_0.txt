i just saw this as part of a slamdance overview (it played at slamdance last year) and i was delighted. this is a clever, well made film. the picture follows johnny twennies, a young man with all the style and character of newspaper reporters from early movies, only he's living in the present day. his "old fashioned" manners and morals confuse his modern counterparts and occasionally creep in and take control of the film. i highly recommend this show for all.<br /><br />there is a little swearing in the film, which somehow warranted an 'r' rating even though there is much less swearing and less objectionable material than most 'pg-13' flicks (if you let your kids watch pg-13, let 'em watch this.)
