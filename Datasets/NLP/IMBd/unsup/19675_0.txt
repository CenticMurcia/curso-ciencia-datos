Grandiose soap opera drama (isn't life a big soap opera?), beautifully acted, photographed, scored, written, directed. It features incest, pre-marital lust, a teen with a domineering mother, suicide, illegitimate children, murder, more. Lana Turner gives her best performance ever, minimizing any annoying postures, heading a mostly noble ensemble cast, with the possible exception of Lee Phillips, handsome as the small town's new principal, but somewhat grating in character. Diane Varsi, as Turner's daughter is also the narrator, occasionally brilliant, but somewhat monotone in voice. Hope Lange is superb, along with Arthur Kennedy, Betty Field, Mildred Dunnock, Leon Ames, Russ Tamblyn. The New England locations are stunning in Deluxe color Cinemascope, set to a stirring, symphonic soundtrack. The setting is 1940s before and after World War II, but it's most definitely 1957, via the costumes and hairstyles. Based on a bestselling book, and supposedly toned down a bit, the picture was a huge hit for Fox, spawning a mediocre 1961 movie sequel and a highly watched 1960s television series. But don't miss the original classic!
