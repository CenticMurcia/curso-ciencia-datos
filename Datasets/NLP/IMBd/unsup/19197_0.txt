Quinton Tarantino included this flick in his 2007 LA Grindhouse Film Festival, and the print was not only from his personal collection, but he introduced the movie himself at it's first screening. His praise followed the lines of the review appearing at the head of this IMDb comments section: this was innovative in 1978 (I saw it first in its test market run, before it got national distribution). Tarantino asserted the belief that it was the first of the "kids-go-to-the-lake" scare flicks; that it was innovative in its "stories-within-the-story" for the genre; and, that for the dollars, the acting, directing, camera work and special effects are pretty damn good. And they're both right. It cost less to make and test market than the production of the average regional TV spot today. More trivia: note the name of the sound mixer: Ron Judkins. Two-time Oscar winner. William Ragsdale: "Fright Night", etc. And look up Gil Glascow in IMDb; he's worked steadily all these years.
