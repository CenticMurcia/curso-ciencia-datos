Captain Hickock (David Beecroft) is sent to investigate a strange death resulting from experiments conducted in seclusion in the desert. The scientists in charge, Van Fleet (ever wonderful character veteran James Hong) and Erhardt (Louise Fletcher) are experimenting with advanced stages of sleep and this has caused an opening in an alternate dimension through which a violent, shape-shifting creature emerges and starts decimating the hapless crew.<br /><br />"Shadowzone" is noticeably better than other movies of its ilk. It's actually fairly well done; writer / director J.S. Cardone establishes a dead serious tone, begins his movie on an ominous note, and creates some reasonable suspense throughout. Never does this intriguing tale get too cheesy or laughable at any point; it's easy to get caught up in the story and be immersed in the dingy and claustrophobic atmosphere. Calling to mind past sci-fi / horror favorites like "Alien" and "The Thing", it has great sets, superb music by Richard Band, and decent splatter by Mark Shostrom.<br /><br />The cast is also better than usual for this sort of thing, with Fletcher given the best part as the too-dedicated scientist. Miguel Nunez, whom genre fans will recognize from "Friday the 13th: A New Beginning" and "The Return of the Living Dead", is good as computer technician Wiley, with the late character actress Lu Leonard stealing her scenes as the crusty cook.<br /><br />Those interested can also take note that there's a dose of both female and male nudity on display here.<br /><br />"Shadowzone" is an entertaining little movie worth checking out. In fact, I think it deserves to be better known.<br /><br />8/10
