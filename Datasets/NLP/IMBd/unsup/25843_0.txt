I heard this film had got Oscar for something. Haven't you ever thought why films of such different levels get Oscars? Nobody is surprised that "Coocoo's nest" did but this one! Extremely unimpressive McQuinn's play and Hoffmann who tries to save the situation and fails. And who could wait that the director of Planet of the apes may product such an unfortunate picture?!
