This may not be the greatest film ever made but it is certainly entertaining. Every once and a while this little gem shows up on late night TV and it's still fun to watch. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise were by far the best comic duo in their day and the supporting cast is equally enjoyable. Roger Moore spoofs his own 007 image to outrageous levels; Jamie Farr is downright hilarious as The Sheik; Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. play the perfect pair of disguised, perverted priests; and of course, this was back in the day when Farrah Fawcett was substantial eye candy.<br /><br />If anything, women should find this film delightfully amusing, considering that it repeatedly mocks the whole "male machismo" angle: men obsessed with beer, women and speed that spend all of ninety minutes trying to see who is faster, who gets the girl and who has the bigger (put your own thoughts here) when all is said and done.<br /><br />It's more or less an extended version of "Smokey and the Bandit:" hot shot speed demons trying to stay one step ahead of the law and dish out one-liners while shamelessly advertising Budweiser along the way.<br /><br />If anything, the outtakes at the end are worth sitting through the movie to see. Clearly the cast had a lot of fun making this film and it shows on screen. So just sit back with the popcorn and shut off your brain for a while...it's a therapeutic necessity.
