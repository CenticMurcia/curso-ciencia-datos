Whew! I've heard some rather positive reviews of this movie but it is not a good movie.<br /><br />The plot concerns a hypnotist (or psychical researcher according to the movie) who hypnotizes a woman into reliving a past life which involves knights, imps, and witches. That screws up stuff in the past for some reason so somehow he follows her back in time to fix things. How exactly this happens is beyond my knowledge.<br /><br />This movie has mistakes, incredibly stupid dialog, and one of the most illogical plots of all time. Worst of all...no zombies or undead creatures of any kind!<br /><br />Still, it's a campy, goofy movie good for a laugh or two. Look for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version.
