The movie Contagion was a very low budget and horribly made movie. If they where not so cheap and chose to actually spend some money on some decent actors the film would not have been so bad. During the whole movie it reminded me of the movie outbreak which was actually OK and I think this movie tried to be like that. The only good actor in the whole movie was the sketchy little kid that crawled through the air vent to get every where, why couldn't he just walk? I would never recommend this movie to anyone unless you have to watch and even then I am still sorry for you. The up side to the movie Contagion is that it was actually kind of amusing at some points in the movie, and I believe that it wasn't suppose to be funny. I loved how when one of the doctors was studying the virus she started to rub her eyes and mouth with the same gloves that she was studying the virus with. This movie is not even good enough to have a chance to be played on the sci fi channel, which is bad because they play some really bad movies on there.
