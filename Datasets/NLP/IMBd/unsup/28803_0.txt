It's a good screwball comedy, but the subject is too sensitive a theme in this age. A movie which has a man dating, albeit reluctantly, a teenager just wouldn't go in today's world.<br /><br />I was a teenager when this came out and that's not really the way we were either. However, we were used to Hollywood's portrayal of us and just shrugged our shoulders.<br /><br />Be that as it may, this is a good comedy, somewhat routine but well done and especially well written. Somehow Myrna Loy didn't seem quite right with Cary Grant as she did with William Powell, but that's okay.<br /><br />The comedy was somewhat sporadic, but the picnic scene is especially hilarious. All in all, a worthwhile movie for those who enjoy screwball comedy.
