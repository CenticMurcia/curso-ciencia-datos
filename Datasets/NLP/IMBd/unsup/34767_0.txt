Chuck Norris goes the Charles Bronson route and makes a cookie cutter action flick despite his geriatric state. Chuck Norris at 65(!) is still kicking away and if this is any indication of what we should expect from Chuck Norris for the next couple of years, perhaps it's not such a bad idea that he peddles total gym commercials. The boring plot involves Nazis out to steal priceless jewels for some unfathomable reason and so they kidnap an old man and so his daughter (Joanna Pacula) hires out the help of Norris who is less Invasion USA and more Missing In Action. Seriously The Cutter has to be one of the least action packed films of Norris' career, Norris doesn't do many roundhouses and relies heavily on gunplay to get him by. In fact Norris seems to be in his old 80's mode where he was ruthless in his stoic presence however there just isn't enough action. In fact the bus sequence which is meant to be a homage to Code Of Silence, just reminds us how much the mighty have fallen.<br /><br />A Chuck Norris fact is that the chief export of Chuck Norris is Pain and with this movie, he has exported a good amount on his target audience.<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)
