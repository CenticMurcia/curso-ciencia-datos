I can never be sure what movie I am going to see when the names are the same. I tried to watch the original Wicker Man the other day, but whoever wrote the description got it wrong and it was the Nick cage version.<br /><br />I tuned into the followup to The Hills Have Eyes last night and was fooled again. I didn't even know there was a Wes Craven version as I saw the 2006 movie. The description on Showtime was for the 2007 movie, but they showed the Wes Craven version of Hills Have Eyes II. I god cheated as this version was not worth losing 90 minutes of my precious sleep.<br /><br />Maybe it would be scary for some tweens, who would not get to see it for its "R" rating, but it was cheesy horror with only one slightly gory sequence. Disappointing, to say the least.
