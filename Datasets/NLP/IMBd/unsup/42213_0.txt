Now whats that distinctive noise you hear?Yes your right.It's the bottom of the barrel being scraped relentlessly one more time.Only this time we have reached the end of the line.NO MORE PLEASE! This years winners were Calum Best and Bianca Gascoigne.A man famous for being the son of a famous footballer and a young woman famous for being the daughter of a woman married to a famous footballer.Speakes volumes dosen't it?Really accentuates the celebrity bit in the title dosen't it? ITV are genuinely insulting the viewers intelligence by actually allowing this piece of meaningless drivel to be broadcast.What person decided this waste of time to be deemed fit for public consumption?Surely after the rock bottom ratings for the first series it would have acted as a dose of cold,hard reality to ITV and make them execute this monstrosity but alas it was unleashed on the poor public again. Please ITV do everyone a massive favour and end this once and for all
