Never before have I seen such an annoying bunch of clods in a TV show before as are on this show Punched Up but I guess I should not be surprised considering the other TV shows that have been produced by this 'how-can-they-still-be-this-incompetent?' network, like Popcultured and Girls Will Be Girls.<br /><br />Basically the cast of over-acting 'look how funny and loud I am' unknown Toronto comedians scream and yell over each other for half an hour while they pretend to help improve someone's life with their fantastic advice and most of all their so-unfunny-it-hurts comedy.<br /><br />The stories and 'real live guests' are all so scripted and fake that it is hard to believe all of it is so completely unfunny, when you are making it all up and control everything how can none of it be funny? The only good thing on this show is the animation which is average but at least not terrible like the rest of the show.
