Never going to be nominated or presumably anything else. But it deserves recognition for the maturity of the fantasy.<br /><br />The main reason is that as long as a movie delivers something that I really enjoy, then I don't rank after critical review, but through share enjoyment.<br /><br />The main character at first, posing with a futuristic plastic-like toy in a ridicules way made me snicker, but only shortly as the whole took me comfortably through the most. Now others may associate and whine, simply reflecting their own general attitude, that there are similarities to other movies, as if the writer had himself intently watched some crappy movies and diddled down some elements to bring into play. Now now. Lets looked at it , for what it is:<br /><br />An all to serious portrayal of a man that had lost everything and led, graciously, to vengefully seeking for what could be more of necessity and redemption than the eager willingness to shed blood over lost loved ones, is cast into a intelligently woven landscape of fiction, that offers more than childish play between good and evil.<br /><br />One can see the maturity of those involved to endow us a jewel, because when you think of how the dilemmas and dramas intermix in rivalry from different clans, the characters are all blessed with the intelligent mindset of the makers of this movie. Complexes that make big men being slightly retarded is nonexistent, which is a relief. I enjoyed the alliance in dire circumstances that led them without words to know they were on the same boat. And as the future king looks bluntly down on the corpses of what had healed ill feelings towards, now giving the sense that he morned that he had to bury his ill feelings towards the deceased with a feeling of loss of an comrade.<br /><br />I was content to see that every character that led me to be intressted in everyone, and the outcome in its ending, being dangerously clische, still led a humble road to something which balanced on the edge of not knowing how it would actually end. The so called hero melded into the likes of peasants and kings alike, as to become insignificantly overvalued as not to definitely imply the obvious that he would decide the outcome, which he also didn't. There was other heroes, and no one was made insignificant.<br /><br />Next highlight. In one scene, in midst of darkness something is slipped to the hands of a strong woman, who plays her role as the equal of men. That must have been the must stunning capture of what most movies fail in doing, when portraying a woman. Simply because it probably didn't overdo it, like a uncertain pleader who would try to hard to convince it with fancy words and show, rather then solid statements. Thank god for that! ( The atheist said )<br /><br />There are more highlighting that could be made, to just overstate the simplicity of a fast paced thrill, but the share enjoyment this one offers, I believe it simply has to be judged by yourself.<br /><br />It was far greater than expected in entertainment. Im in the same mood as i reviewed a drama a couple of hours ago, so don't think I'm being generous, because i shat on that so called 10 star flick. Im simply saying. It made me say "Coool!" in one or two scenes. That doesn't happen to me often nowadays.
