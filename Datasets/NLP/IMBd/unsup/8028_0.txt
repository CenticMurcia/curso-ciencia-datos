"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes" is a very good film. Released by the Disney company in 1970 or so, it's a movie about a student who has all the knowledge, all the power, all the info - that made him as smart as one of those huuuuuge computers of the time!!!!! Hence, the name of the film is called "The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes!"<br /><br />I've seen this original version not on the Old Disney Channel, but on a local station late one Saturday night in '97. It was good; I also remember the 1995 TV remake that I watched on ABC as were we moving here to Texas!<br /><br />Man, I wish I had all the knowledge like that boy did!!!!! Oops, this reminds me - I gotta quit writing reviews at the moment and finish writing my midterm paper - now!!!!!<br /><br />Before I go, let me say, enjoy this film!!!!!<br /><br />10/10
