A boxer finds himself magically winning a fight he actually lost. It is due to the wishes of small boy who admires him. This allows him to move on to a more important fight. This is about the idea of faith and hope. As the episode goes along that faith and hope disintegrates. The boy becomes a victim. The issue that is more important is the color blindness of Rod Serling. I would imagine a cast featuring two African Americans would have been extremely bold at this time. I wonder how Joe Six Pack would have received this, even if he were a fan of the Twilight Zone. The acting is good and it was good to see the late Ivan Dixon (Hogan's Heroes) doing quite an outstanding acting job. It makes you wonder how many wonderful actors were locked out of the industry. Serling was a visionary.
