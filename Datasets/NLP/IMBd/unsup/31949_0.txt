I love Arthuiran Ledgends, and this movie does a great job of translating the best of the Arthurian ledgends. I'm pround to call this one of my favorite movies. Now, if you consider yourself a buff on legend then see this movie, and never see 'First Knight' which was just terrible. I enjoy mostly p***ing on people who claim 'First Knight' is remotely a good movie. Make yourself happy and watch Excalibur, have some dignity.
