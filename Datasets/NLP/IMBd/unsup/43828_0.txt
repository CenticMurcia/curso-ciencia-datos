I'm a big Michael Jordan fan. That's a fan of Michael Jordan, the basketball player, not the actor. He's good in one-minute commercials, but he's bad, very bad in this movie. This movie was nothing more than a large advertisement for Michael Jordan and the product he endorses.<br /><br />I love sports, and have a few favorite sports movies. But most sports-related movies are terrible and this one falls is one of the worst of the worse.
