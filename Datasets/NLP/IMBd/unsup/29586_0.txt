The film has nothing special to offer, except for very very melodious songs by Anu Malik, two beautiful girls (Preity Zinta and Rani Mukerji), who, at that point of time, were reasonably newcomers, and today, both are the top actresses in India. It was nice to watch the film, as an entertainer, and there are some funny scenes. But the film does not have some novel script which can capture you.<br /><br />Salman makes his part very well. As an actor whose mission in this film is to make people laugh, he knows how to combine this aspect with some emotional expressions, such as that when Preity informs him about the new car the family gifted him, and he feels offended about that.<br /><br />Preity is very beautiful and there is something irresistible about her on-screen. The role may not have required histrionics from her, but she does her job effectively.<br /><br />Mukerji gets very little scope and doesn't make any impact. The first three quarters feature her lying on bed, and the remaining one introduces her as a good human being and caring sister, too typical and boring.<br /><br />Watch it if you are a fan of Salman, Preity and to some extent Rani, and want to have some good two-three hours, but don't watch it if you expect to see a good, or even an average film. 4/10.
