I've already watched this episode twice, and love it. It's great to see the creators still know how to have some fun with these characters...especially the interplay between Brass and Doc Robbins. My favorite, by far, has to be casting James Whitmore (see also The Shawshank Redemption, Them!, several episodes of The Twilight Zone, and the narration of Ken Burns' Lewis & Clark documentary, among many other credits) as the old man no-one takes seriously. I know it's not the exact line, but when, after completing the "I Shot an Arrow Into the Air" poem, Sara tells him to "Keep the Faith," I was almost hoping for her to call him Brooks - again see Shawshank.
