This feature film was originally released as the final episode of a 16-part radio serial, which may explain its weaknesses. Firstly, the fact that every character speaks in some distinctive, but unrealistic, fashion. Secondly, the incomprehensibly convoluted plot and unlikely coincidences that abound. A scene in which a jilted lover hurls himself off a cliff is unintentionally hilarious. After repeated viewings, I still can't remember whodunit, not because it is so cleverly hidden from the viewer, but because the solution makes no sense at all.
