Cinderella III is the story of our beloved Disney Princess celebrating her one year anniversary married to the prince. The Fairy Godmother is there as well, and carelessly flings her wand in the bushes while singing. The wand lands in the hands of Anastasia, one of Cinderella's stepsisters. And soon, the wicked stepmother takes matters into her own hands by reversing time to when the duke arrived to try the slipper on the feet of the stepsisters. BUT, this time- the wand is used to make it fit Anastaia's foot. From there, a suspenseful series of events follow Cinderella as she tries to set things right.<br /><br />This film is amazing. It is the best Disney sequel I've seen to date. The animation isn't the quality of a theatrical release, but it much better than most direct-to-video films are.<br /><br />The story is very suspenseful and creative. It is slightly predictable, but aside from that, it keeps your attention and not once will you be bored.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful. The voices are obviously not that of the original film, but the actors do their best to bring feeling to the characters, and that is what matters. (In my opinion, the actress who voices Anastasia did a wonderful job.) The film contains some new songs. No song is as great as anything you'd find in a golden Disney film, but again- these songs are ones you want to listen to again. Along with the songs, the score to the film is wonderful especially in climactic scenes. And yes- there are "action" scenes in this film, and they are wonderful.<br /><br />This film wasn't made for money. It was made to please all the fans who were disappointed in "Cinderella 2." And let me tell you, Disney did something right with a sequel for once.
