This show was the best show on tv. Too bad NBC didn't have the guts to keep it on tv. The show was great. The actors did an excellent job. The writers for the show came up with someone to keep you wanting to watch tv. This show is better than Sopranos. Yes it is a little edgy for network tv, but with the time slot that it was on made it ok. For the network tv they cut a lot out of the show that is shown on the DVD set. The DVD set shows how the producers wanted the show to be. Hopefully HBO will pick this show up and air it. Then it will have a network that won't be afraid to show it. For anyone that likes the Sopranos or Godfather will love this show and I highly recommend it. Miguel is cool and smart while Chato takes care of the dirty work.
