I am a movie lover. So, it was with great anticipation that I went to see Body/Antibody at the Fort Lauderdale Film Festival. Boy, am I glad I did! My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. From the opening shot to the closing credits. The whiteness and starkness of Kip's environment and how it becomes "invaded", enabled us to feel his emotions. The leads did an excellent job in their roles. Robert Gomes as Kip, reminded me of George Clooney and Leslie Kendall as Celine reminded me of the "old time" Hollywood glamor girls. All the details in this film were defined by the writing and direction. I don't know what it takes to make a movie. I can only imagine the hard work, time, money and emotion spent on making all the pieces come together, in the hopes of the audience enjoying the outcome. Let me say, it was obvious by their reaction, the audience enjoyed the outcome a great deal. I would recommend this film to people who appreciate character development and a good mystery with just the right amount of dark humor thrown in.
