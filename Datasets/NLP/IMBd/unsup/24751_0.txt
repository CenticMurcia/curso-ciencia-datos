Individual stories of inmates in the huge, overcrowded and infamous Carandiru penitentiary in Sao Paulo, Brazil; the fil rouge being a doctor (a narrow character who ain't but a narrative excuse) who decides to take care of the prisoners during the outbreak of AIDS epidemic. At the end, a futile fight starts a riot which will eventually end with the death of 111 inmates.<br /><br />Carandiru is'nt a masterpiece. But it's a good, solid, non moralistic or stereotyped and yet entertaining prison movie which manage to transport the non-Brazilian viewer to feel the noises, the colors, even the scents of a lively, desperate and merciless world in which good and evil, guilt and innocence are inextricable.<br /><br />Way better than Ciudad de Deus ("City of God") by Meirelles, which was a lot more successful abroad; IMHO, it was just a stylish gangster-movie with a Brazilian location.
