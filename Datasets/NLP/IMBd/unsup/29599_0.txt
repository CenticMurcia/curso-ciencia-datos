This series was the kind of thing that made TV worth it a quarter century ago. Written by the English novelist Frederick Raphael from his book, it was more than a little autobiographic, and carried the flavour of the 50s and 60s, while avoiding many of the clich√©s this period evokes.<br /><br />The TV series was Intelligent, wry, literate, subtle, with brilliant acting.<br /><br />In post-war England, it followed a group of students at Cambridge, with their hopes, affairs, confrontations with life, and, later, disillusionments and achievements. It's impossible to explain how truly intelligent the writing is; this has to be experienced. <br /><br />We NEED it on DVD!
