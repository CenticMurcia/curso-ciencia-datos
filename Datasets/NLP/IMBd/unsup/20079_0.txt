This movie makes me pee with laughter! I am not even kidding. If you are totally into really bad funny horror movies, this one takes the cake. There are a lot of bad ones out there that are not funny, but this one (along with troll 2) is amazing. The acting, the screams, the ice queens moves are hysterical. The acting - they are just all play there part so bad. I think tori is the worst Ice queen gyrates and jerks around so much she looks like she's having seizures I watch about once a year and it gets me every time. I am telling you as soon as i turned on the DVD and valley by gregory douglas came on, I knew it was going to be a really bad movie.
