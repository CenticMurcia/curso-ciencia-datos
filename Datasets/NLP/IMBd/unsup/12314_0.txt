Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge is the sequel to the horror classic Nightmare on Elm Street. This movie shows Freddy's plan to get back to the real world: to possess a teenager that has a girlfriend who looks just like Meryl Streep. I got to watch this yesterday (well, today) at 4:00 A.M. Even at that time, I wasn't scared. This movie does not scare you- it only has an awful amount of gory/disgusting images. Anyways, it is somehow a good movie. Robert Englund is menacing as Freddy Krueger, which makes it up for the weak performance of the leading actor (which I forgot the name). The scene in the party is really good, with Freddy producing a bloodbath with all the scared "little kids". Another great example of non-scary horror movie that kinda works. My next target is the first movie, which I still haven't seen. Well, off to the video store! FINAL GRADE: 7.3/10
