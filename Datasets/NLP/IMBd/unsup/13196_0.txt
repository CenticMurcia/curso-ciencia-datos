Dreamer was a heart warming and wonderful movie.... My Daughter and left the theater with a "Great" Feeling. During the movie you find yourself cheering for the good guys to prevail. The whole cast did a wonderful job.....my daughter was so inspired by the moral of the story. You have to believe in yourself and others. The Characters in the movie were so believable and it looked like they truly enjoyed making this movie. <br /><br />It's about time we start seeing more inspiring movies..... I really hope this movie does well at the box office and DVD. We will buy the DVD when it comes out.<br /><br />I hope Hollywood will take heed and start making more movies that will inspire us to believe and be better people.
