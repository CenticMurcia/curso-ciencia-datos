The opening credits state: 'special songs by Don Sullivan', the main star of this Texas-produced B-flick.<br /><br />We have a Gila Monster walking between some dinky toys, which is not scary, not funny, just plain silly and boring. The whole film apparently was made for the benefit of Don Sullivan who belts out a couple of songs on the strangest moments and shamelessly plugs his records for the drive in audiences. What am I talking about here? There is some kind of a story, but the execution is so terrible and without any imagination whatsoever, it doesn't matter really. After an hour, when the film is almost over, the Sheriff is asked: 'Have you heard the stories about a giant lizard?' 'No, I can't say that I have.' <br /><br />Neither did I.<br /><br />Some amusing songs save this from being a total bore. I must say, the score is quite effective, but otherwise a perfect mess. Just awful.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 3/10
