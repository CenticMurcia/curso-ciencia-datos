WTF? This is one messed up movie. I guess I should have expected that with anything remotely related to Robert Crumb, but this movie redefines the boundaries of tastelessness for me. I was sometimes incredulous, often distgusted, and never amused. The only value to this movie is as a historical record (made in 1974) of a sick and twisted mind. I like subversive material as much as the next guy, but come on!
