I've seen a lot of horrible movies in my time but this one takes the cake. Usually when you watch an atrocious film, comedy is there because the film is so bad. As far as Snowboard Academy goes, I was unable to find anything funny. It is like a Scooby Doo episode gone horribly wrong. The jokes are flat, the acting is poor, and there seems to be little to no direction at all. The snowboarding and skiing footage is low quality, it looks like a bunch of bums were taught to snowboard and given a job in the film. If I wanted to see better tricks I could head off to the beginners slope at the local ski hill. The film goes on the same level as the talented Varney's not-so-classics, alongside Ernest Goes to Africa. All and all the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen.
