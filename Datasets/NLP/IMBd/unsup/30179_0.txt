This movie is a genuine piece of eroticism. Some comments pointed out that the acting was awful. Well in a way one could say that the actors are not acting, they are living the situation ! (I wouldn't be surprise to learn that they had a lot a sex together when the cameras where not shooting...). What I try to say is that this movie is not "manufactured" according to the canonical rules, it is "genuine". This is why it conveys a unique impression of freedom - seldom found elsewhere - that I would call A LIBERTARIAN EXPERIENCE OF SEX. And therefore it gives to the receptive spectator a mostly exhilarating experience.<br /><br />It is the combination of the world of Henry Miller and the sexual liberation of the 70's (more advanced in the Scandinavian countries - this is a Danish film) that made it possible.<br /><br />If I where to keep just one erotic movie, it may well be this one. Of course if you watched too many lousy porn, your look may be too much formatted to appreciate this movie...
