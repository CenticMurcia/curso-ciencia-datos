This is my second favorite Godzilla film.<br /><br />It has a good enough story, a great enemy, and good enough special effects. If you own this on DVD and you live in the USA, then please watch it on the "Audio Commentary". It will change your view of the movie. Plus it's a great come back against "Godzilla (1998)" which disgraced Godzilla. If you are a big Godzilla Fan, I fully recommend this film to you. It's a great start to begin the Millennium series which also has some really good films, among my favorite.<br /><br />Anyway, I give this film an A-. If you watch it with the "Audio Commentary", you will too.
