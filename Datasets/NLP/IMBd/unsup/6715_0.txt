If only our poor politicians could muster the money to create the incredible advertising monster that was Bee Movie. If you have kids it is pretty much a guarantee that you'll be asked to go see this movie or buy it when the DVD is released. Do not fear, this film actually lives up to the hype. For the infants, bright shiny colors and movement, for the kids, good animation, a fun story and some fun set pieces. For the adults pretty much all of the above and a plot that will keep you entertained if not enthralled and some laughs. The storyline goes through responsibility, duty, family, consequences for actions and Ray Liotta. The cast is a great ensemble, including, the aforementioned Liotta who parodies both himself and his career, Rene Zegweller, Matthew Broderick and of course Jerry Seinfeld who also co-wrote this. It also has Rip Torn who I cannot watch now without hearing "if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball." Forget logic, this is a kids movie and it's not about you, just be thankful Jerry Seinfeld put some stuff in this to keep you happy too, not all kids movies are so considerate. <br /><br />If only all kids movies were this good.
