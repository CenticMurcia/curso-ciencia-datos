I didn't notice the use of footage from Renny Harlin's movie, but I did notice the use of footage from "Narrow Margin", specifically the shootout at the cabin in the woods. The guy in the helicopter is wearing a beige suit and cowboy boots. I could swear that I have also seen another movie that used this footage as well. The movie is extremely low budget and shows it. The acting and directing are all fairly unremarkable which is strange considering the talented cast. Perhaps this just points up the importance of a good script. No matter how talented the actor or the director is the story and dialog are uninteresting, so is the movie.
