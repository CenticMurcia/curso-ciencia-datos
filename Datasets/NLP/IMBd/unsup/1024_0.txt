Mèxico, being an almost 100% Catholic country produced several nunsploitation flicks in the 70's. Before censorship took a big role in Mexican movies, there were many, many exploitation flicks for different tastes. I must admit that this isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it is a movie that deserves a chance and will please fans of gore and sleaze. <br /><br />Many Mexicans tend to easily "scare" with plots like the one in "Satànico Pandemonium" because it deals with two restricted topics in Mexican society : sex and religion nastiness. <br /><br />"Satànico Pandemonium" does not rank high on the exploitation Heaven but it manages to deliver quality intense violence and disturbing images for those who enjoy this kind of cinema. The language used in this movie is macabre and it's very relevant for the plot. If you speak Spanish you might enjoy it more than if you watch it with sub-titles because most of the words have no exact literal translation.<br /><br />The raw acting is a key factor in the movie. For example, the afro American nun that cries all over the convent because of her depression for being black is something that may seem random; you just watch her cry and suffer. The scene takes relevance as the plot develops (she's "aided" by Sister Maria who convinces her to commit suicide).<br /><br />Many situations like that one make you think "where's the coherence with these Mexican film makers?" but that's just to add tension. Also, the convent is very creepy mainly because of a great art direction. The atmosphere in the convent is sinister and the fact that the Devil is prowling outside, makes it even more a scary place. I praise the cinematography because the movie is visually stunning. The events take place at noon at night and the movie still looks sinister.<br /><br />The music is also convincing and very disturbing. The director knows how to create a disturbing, scary setting with the correct use of light, sounds, and suspense. The acting is not that good because most of the main actresses were amateur, except for Pezet who delivers a brave, solid performance. She's a beautiful woman with nerves. She was perfect for the role because she's extremely pretty, has an angel face; the perfect prey for Satan. She deserved more leading roles in her career. Too bad that this was her last movie. She was just too beautiful to be involved in Nunsploitation flicks! Veteran t.v. and movie actor Enrique Rocha gives a strong performance as the Devil and his voice is scary alone. He was great. The rest of the cast is just plain and dull. <br /><br />The movie goes directly to the point immediately after it starts. After the opening credits, Satan seduces Sister Mary and then the Horror starts immediately. She is tempted in several scenes, and finally, when she falls into Satan's tramp, she starts a rampage of sex and murder. Thank you! <br /><br />Maybe Europeans aren't easily scared with topics like The Devil seducing or torturing nuns,but here in Mèxico it's a different deal. The Devil is by far the scariest character in Mèxican culture. Now, if you mix him with religion (which is something very delicate here) you have a terrifying experience. In the first minutes there is auto flagellation (good gore) , lesbian nun sex, and Satan. Mèxico created this interesting premise which sadly, in the 80's and 90's was heavily banned because of a censorship campaign against violence in cinema. I'm glad that these movies get DVD releases for Europe so they can recognize the country's talent in Horror. <br /><br />The main problem with this movie is the lack of continuity and coherence in the plot. First, we only know that the movie takes place in the inquisition times because of the tombs of the nuns. So, the movie is set in the mid 1600's. Then, what should we realize about the ending? It's too easy to blame the Devil! but it does no makes sense. <br /><br />Anyways, "Satanico Pandemonium" has become somewhat a cult nunsploitation movie; it was even referenced in "From Dusk Till Dawn". The weak point of the movie is that it hasn't aged very well. The veteran director is heavily influenced by classic theater techniques and acting and does not gives a dynamic mood to the movie. The camera angles are boring at some points, and some events truly last longer than they should. For example, when Sister Maria takes care of the sick cow, or when she realizes she's been tempted by the Devil.<br /><br />At some point it looks like a very old Horror movie but with lots of gore. Talking about gore, the movie has two highlight gory scenes in my opinion. First, when Sister Maria seduces and later stabs Marcelo to death. The scene is weird because it makes you wonder how would it be if a nun "like that" would seduce you, and later, it grosses you out. I felt sorry for Marcelo's tender grandmother. The other scene, is when Sister Maria is stabbed to death by the other nuns. The gore is great in this movie. Expect stabs, self punishment, and a glorious flashback sequence involving the inquisition (excellent for those who like gore). <br /><br />Mèxico is not all about raw, cheesy, gory flicks involving wrestlers, with no plot. Mèxico had a HUGE potential in the genre but as many people know, politicians and Constitutional Presidents banned the rise of Mexican exploitation. Sure, it came back in the 80's but not as a Horror sub-genre; it came among low budget Action movies and the typical Valentìn Trujillo flicks.<br /><br />Give a try to "Satànico Pandemonium" because it offers blood, gore, a scary plot (for us who respect the religious factor), and a dark atmosphere. Buy it for all of it's goodies. I believe there's an unrated version.
