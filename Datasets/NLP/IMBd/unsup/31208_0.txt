I thought it was a brilliant film, it was well shot, and very suspenseful. Although the actual aliens themselves were very crappy, they compensated for this by only shooting them with he camera out of focus, or in darkness. A minor triumph in independant cinema, for a tv film, I was thoroughly entertained, and even scared on occasion, which I don't think I actually have been before when watching a movie. (and i've seen ALOT of movies)<br /><br />Late night gold :)<br /><br />Watch it if you catch it, but i wouldn't buy it personally. Not to knock it ro anything, just not the kind of thing i like to watch over and over. Mistakes are numerous, but quite frankly I don't give a damn, this is a cracking film.
