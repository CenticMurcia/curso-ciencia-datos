this is very good movie about the wreck of titanic it is unscripted and the don't now Wat they are doing they test new robots name bot1 and bot2 later the changed their name into Jake and Elwood just like Blusebrothers and then they explore the ship in places that had never seen since 1912 i will give this movie 8 because i liked it wen the were telling the story about the ship and they show the rooms digital-ed in computer it is very cool. and on the end wen bot brakes down and the other bot have to rescue it so i just think this is very good historic movie<br /><br />james
