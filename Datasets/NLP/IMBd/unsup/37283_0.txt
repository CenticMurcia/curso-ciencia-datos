I begun reading the Georgia Nicholson series when I was around 15. When I heard there was a movie out I decided to check it out online since Singapore doesn't show it. As the movie wore on I began to accept the idea that the story was rather different from the original. It doesn't capture the sense of early teen immaturity that made the book so hilarious and lighthearted. It portrayed Georgia as a normal girl in terms on personality. Jas was NOTHING like I imagined to be; a rather blank girl with an obsession with her fringe and the environment. The characters disappointed me greatly. From the main characters all the way to Dave the laugh. The result of the show was mortifying. Georgia's parents would have never thrown such a big party plus she would have died in their presence. Wet Lindsay was suppose to be an anorexia twit with a large forehead. Immense disappointment for me. I'd rather read the book.
