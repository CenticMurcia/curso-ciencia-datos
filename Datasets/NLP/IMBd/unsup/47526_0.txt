I had watched this once before and knew it had something to do with a house, but I had forgotten much else. Now watching it the second time I hope I can forget it just as easily as I had the first time.<br /><br />It's about a couple who lose their son and buy a house out in the country to try and cope with their loss. The man is a writer and the woman is just a mourning mother trying to move on. They don't know the story of the house and how it has destroyed many other families that lived there before.<br /><br />The woman quickly starts to see things, including messages telling her shes going to die soon. The husband seems to think shes just having a hard time dealing with the stress, but he doesn't realize he is changing too, for the worse. As time goes on the truth unravels and we watch as the madness and the fear strike.<br /><br />At first the movie is promising, the big house has potential to make a good haunted house movie, the hallucinations telling you you only have a few days to die would be very scary and here it gives hope for a creepy movie, but as it goes on you realize its going nowhere.<br /><br />This movie is a supernatural thriller not to be confused with a horror film. It is not scary and quite frankly its down right stupid.<br /><br />The actors are all bad, there is no cool production values and it has worthless CGI at times. I would not recommend it to anyone. It reminded me in a very small way of The Shining, but just because you liked that one doesn't mean you will this garbage.<br /><br />Save your time and stay away from this boring movie, its not entertaining in any way, you could do worse, but you could surely find something way better to kill 90 minutes.
