From the beginning, you think that maybe this movie will develop into something really scary and frightening, hopefully breaking free of the rash of boring horror movies released over the last few months. Nope. It's got alot of goth-horror goriness for shock value, but it pretty much falls flat on its face two thirds of the way through.<br /><br />The plot isn't too bad to begin with, but then it is neither explained nor developed... In general, the movie was lame, stupid, dumb, idiotic, ridiculous, pointless... what else can I say? I don't even want to type anymore because it isn't worth my time. I want a refund.
