Santa Clause 3 is basically a sad, unpleasant story of a dysfunctional family--Santa Clause/Tim Allen's. It is seldom funny. Why in the world would anyone want to drop this franchise in the dumpster? Why would any parent want to take little children to see this painful reminder of their own family--or their friends'? Another killer is the flashback to the time Tim Allen's character first meets Santa Clause on his roof. We see Allen then and Allen now. Then was younger by years and makeup was not used to make the older Allen look, well, well, let's just leave it at older. In scene after scene one of the main characters, Sandy, falls asleep in the middle of meetings. Sandy, as in the Sand Man. Finally we get it. At first I just thought the script had put the actor to sleep. Better the audience had stayed home and slept through this one.
