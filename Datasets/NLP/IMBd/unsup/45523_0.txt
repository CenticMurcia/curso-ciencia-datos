This movie's poster shows a great white shark with its mouth wide open. Thus when I entered the theater, I expected something spine-tingling. On this point the movie did not deliver. <br /><br />It was, in fact, a story about a scientific team searching for a great white to study. Most of the movie is spent searching rather than studying. To my way of thinking the movie was not a total waste of my time. There is footage of sharks (none of them great whites) feeding on a whale carcass. In addition some of the researchers leave the safety of the shark cages and swim among these unjustly maligned fish.<br /><br />Eventually they find a great white which they study from the ship and in shark cages. Huge and formidable these sharks certainly are, but anyone expecting "Jaws" type of excitement will be be disappointed. Ditto to those who would have preferred more information about great whites than was offered. Such is my reason to call "Blue Water, White Death" 'interesting but unsatisfying'.
