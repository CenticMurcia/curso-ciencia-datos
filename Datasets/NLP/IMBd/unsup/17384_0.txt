I first saw this film at a theater in New York's East Village and found myself hooked within the first 5 minutes! I just saw it again on DVD and it was even better. Great commentary by the Director and a solid visual transfer - looks awesome! But more importantly, the script is "dead-on!" Solid writing truly brings this gritty, character drama to life. All in all, the film depicts realistic scenarios laced with many humorous parts - all the while featuring "Hell's Kitchen" as the backdrop. A must see for anyone who wants to understand what a strong, entertaining, independent film is supposed to look like. Also... The DVD extras (Commentary & Interview) provide insight as to how painstakingly difficult it was to bring this awesome film to life.
