I saw this movie with my mom and brother the other day, and its charming-yet-not-sickeningly-sweet story, along with its acting quality and special effects, were all pleasantly surprising.<br /><br />Alex Etel ("Millions") is well-cast as the main character, Angus, who lives in denial of his father's death. The prolonged absence of his beloved dad leaves Angus vulnerable and timid. He spends a lot of time indoors, deluding himself into thinking his father will eventually come home from the war. One day, Angus finds a bizarre egg at the beach. It eventually hatches into a newborn Loch Ness Monster named Crusoe, giving Angus a friend whom he can love as his father loved him.<br /><br />Oscar-nominee Emily Watson gives a nervous, wonderfully subtle performance of Angus's overprotective mother, and Ben Chaplin ("The Thin Red Line") is likable and natural as the handyman who befriends Angus.<br /><br />As others have noted, the CGI is used as an effective supplement to the story, and never becomes the focal point. Angus's exhilarating ride atop Crusoe through the Loch (which, in front of a stunning Scottish landscape, is gorgeous on the big screen) quells the boy's fears, which range from water to the dangers and sadness of the adult world. "The Water Horse" a fantasy that is light and family-friendly, but also carries an important life lesson.<br /><br />By adventure's end, Angus learns to let go--of both Crusoe and his father. Kids will like Crusoe's cuteness and occasional comic relief, but parents will also be fulfilled, as the film is not obnoxiously zany or as drenched with annoying pop culture references as many "family movies" tend to be. Understated and genuine, "The Water Horse" is sure to warm the cockles of any movie-goer's heart.
