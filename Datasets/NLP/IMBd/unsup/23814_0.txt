This movie was suggested to me by a librarian co-worker of mine during college. She said she wasn't going to tell me what it was about and even blackened out the back cover of the VHS. She smiled as though plotting and walked away. I dashed home and haven't stopped watching it since. The language used blends poetry with oratory simplicity. The family is faulted in a righteous and enduring way that you want to be part of the farm too. Our heroin rushes in to a strange place with unknown relatives. She is a city girl, thrust upon Cold Comfort Farm. Are the Starkadders aware that their guest is set on tidying and making lovely their dear farm? Setting things as they should be, promoting and planting seeds of change. There are mysteries mentioned and owes due. Every little corner of this movie will enchant you; the writing is superb and greatly verbose. But truly the actors each take on and portray not a role, but the person. Supporting cast brings sparkles and bubbles to the movie. I find myself quoting from it often in life. Still laughing and remembering, "there will always be Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm."
