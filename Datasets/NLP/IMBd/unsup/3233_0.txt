This ripoff of "King Kong" has got to be one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen, just because of how it never takes itself seriously. When a Hong Kong magnate sets out on an expedition to find a prehistoric ape in India, he and the others find not only the ape but also a scantily clad woman (Evelyne Kraft) who's known the big guy ever since her plane crashed in the jungle many years earlier. This of course means that "Xing xing wang" - called "The Mighty Peking Man" in English - is really an excuse to show off the woman's body. And what a body! I bet that many a teenage boy went to see this movie just to ogle the hot babe and get as horny as possible.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a total exploitation flick, so it makes sense that Quentin Tarantino brought it to DVD. Any image that you have of corny '70s cinema can be found here. A real treat in every way. You're sure to like it. Especially the blonde gal in the skimpy bikini, natch.
