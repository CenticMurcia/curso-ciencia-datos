If, for even a brief moment, you are considering seeing this movie, STOP. I have already made that mistake for you, let my pain be your gain. I hate this movie with a passion as it goes no where, says nothing and is purely a waste of life to watch. I am amazed that there were actors which actually signed on to do this. I can sit through some pretty bad horror movies and laugh at the cheap production value or even the bad writing, but this movie can't even be held in the same category as cheesy horror flicks. It is simply that bad. I thought my wife was going to leave me just because I rented this movie, yes it is that bad. This is not a misunderstood film, it is not some sort of noir that no one gets, it is just the worst film ever. I can't stop saying it, sorry, it really is that bad.
