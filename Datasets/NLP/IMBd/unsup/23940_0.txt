This movie shouts one word: WARMTH. The colors, the plot, the characters, they are all wonderfully warm.<br /><br />I've watched this movie with senior citizens who were around in the forties. I once watched it with a Jewish guy who grew up on Long Island (albeit in the early 30's, not the 40's). All comments were the same: THIS was life in New York during wartime.<br /><br />Vietnam was my war, so this era was a mystery to me. However, any time a genius like Woody Allen can create a film that not only makes me and my rowdy friends laugh, but gets guffaws from my dear old Mom as well, it deserves a little fanfare.<br /><br />I didn't even mention the solid gold music.<br /><br />See this film at once!
