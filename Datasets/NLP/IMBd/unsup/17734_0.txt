This is a pale comparison to the 1985 Mini-Series based on Jackie Collins's novel "Hollywood Wives". Not having read the "New Generation" book, I can't say how literary it is. But as a made for television movie it is poor. Farrah Fawcett's character Lissa seems tired. And the vacuous young characters are atrocious. Every one talking on cell phones in every other scene is a bit much. Yes, most people have cell phones, but it vitiates the action for the characters to always be on cell phones. Doesn't anyone in movies walk down streets, or go over to someone's house without calling first. <br /><br />I thought all three female leads were empty, shallow characters with nothing interesting to say or do. I'll have to read the book this trash was based on, and imagine how it could have been conceived as a TV movie.
