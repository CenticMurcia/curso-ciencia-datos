After viewing this film 5 or so hours ago, I left the cinema thinking this was an OK movie. As far as a "leave your brain at the door" kind of movie goes, it was actually pretty good. But after a few hours of letting the experience stew over in my mind, I find myself utterly unfulfilled. I say this, because the only moments in the film that I can recall are the entirely negative aspects. Awkwerdness is the word that springs to mind. The jokes seem laboured, for example, the drawn out fart joke. Even with the cameo of Seth Rogen lifting this moment up abit, its the kind of humour a 5 year old Nickelodeon viewer would enjoy. Fart jokes haven't worked since Blazing Saddles, and even there it was just a device used by Mel Brooks to see how much the censors would let him get away with. I think maybe its time to stop.<br /><br />Now to bring up what has to be the worst point in the film, and that has to be the relationship between Dale (John C. Reilly) and Alice (Kathryn Hahn). Everything about them felt so wrong. Just throwing out a "vagina" or a "ball sack" doesn't merit a laugh from me, and oh boy were the scenes awkward. I would liken them to watching the crassest of the crass Bill Hicks act with your Grandparents. Yep, really, and I was just in the cinema with a friend of mine.<br /><br />So all in all, I'd recommend for people to avoid this film. Unless you want to sit through a butt-load of average. Hey, but what do you expect from a Judd Apatow production.<br /><br />Oh, and also, Will Ferrell has a terrible voice!
