Gore, gore, gore. While there are some nice creepy atmospheric moments in this tale of a young, somewhat psychic girl trying to figure out the mysterious goings-on at her boarding school, that soon goes out the window in favor of gruesome beheadings, straight-razors to the face, and giant vats of human viscera. I kept looking at the clock praying that time would somehow move faster. By the 45 minute mark, I just couldn't care less how the movie ended and contemplated putting the truck in gear and leaving the drive-in me and my wife were watching this at. I hate to say it, but this ranks right up there with some of the worst movies I've ever seen. Do yourself a favor and skip this one, especially at the theater. Crap. Pure crap. The only redeeming aspects of this film are bad anime scenarios and death by evil curse. For all those espousing low-budget, his-own-art anime felating drivel - sack up, pull your heads out and watch real movies. Morons.
