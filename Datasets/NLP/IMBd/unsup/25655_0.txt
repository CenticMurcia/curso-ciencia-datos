Satire that is funny without being vicious, "Coneheads" has a smart observation about everything American from golf to immigration policy. But it's probably unsatisfying for the typical audience of the typical alien-invasion movie, and better suited to the home video than the big screen. A disappointing conclusion, but still all-round good entertainment
