A story of messed up real life people trying to find a happy hollywood ending, almost real life for a change.<br /><br />Nicholson is fantastic getting all the quick witted replies and comments that he deserves, and Hunt provides a fantastic lead opposite him and the pair blend beautifully together in their scenes.<br /><br />Gooding and Kinnear provide strong support, but it's Kinnear who outshines Gooding, why haven't we seen him in more prominent roles before?<br /><br />The film can get a bit sappy in places, but it always brings it back to reality with a bang.<br /><br />Definately a go see, for all those Victor Meldrew types.
