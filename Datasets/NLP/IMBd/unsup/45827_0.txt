"Bound By Lies" wants to be an erotic thriller and a murder mystery. It fails because it is not very erotic, not very thrilling and not very mysterious. The two stars are rather over-the-hill for the genre. Kristy Swanson is still pretty, but by no means as irresistible as she's supposed to be here. She looked really great in the mid-90's - I wish she had done this kind of role then. I wish Natassia Malthe (who plays Kristy's assistant in this film) had the leading role instead. And Stephen Baldwin is no Alec, hell he's no William either. Stephen and Kristy "do it" only once, and in that scene he shows more than her! There is an irrelevant car chase in the beginning (which was mostly lifted from another film, according to IMDb trivia), and one good scene involving a handcuffed and tied Baldwin in a bathtub, but other than that you won't find many thrills here. As for the "mystery" plot, making the most obvious suspect the actual killer can only be called "unpredictably predictable". However, I still found the film watchable enough to give it *1/2 out of 4 stars.
