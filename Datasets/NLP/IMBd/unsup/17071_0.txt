This version, a remake of the original by Pat O'Brien and Adolphe Menjou, is the best of the three versions of this play adapted to the screen. (The third starred Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and is nearly as good.)<br /><br />It's an absolute hoot. And I've seen it probably two dozen times. It's better than potato chips. I can't just watch one scene. Whenever it's on I'm hooked for the duration.<br /><br />The snappy patter, split-second timing and overlapping dialogue is enough to make you want the script for re-reading after the credits have run.<br /><br />They don't make 'em like this any more.
