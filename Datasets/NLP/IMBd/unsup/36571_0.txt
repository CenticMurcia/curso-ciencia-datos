This movie is witty and funny for the first half an hour, but afterward it is completely boring, it's the same action repeated over and over until the movie ends, only the prostitute in the scene is different. It presents the drama of a guy who didn't have the guts to do the things his heart told him at some particular times in life, and how could he do it? He is a sex addict, he sees all relations through the prism of sex which for an adult is both immature and disgustful. The end of the movie is blank, it has no taste, no smell; it's there because the movie just had to end. Suddenly all his sex addiction problem ends when he finds the girl of his dreams (that's like for the fourth or fifth time). Unfortunately i have watched it, it ruined one of my evenings and the only thing that this movie showed me, once again in my life, is that when you don't know what you want you ruin your life and the life of others around you :)
