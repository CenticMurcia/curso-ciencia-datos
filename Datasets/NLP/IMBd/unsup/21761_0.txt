I read a short commentary about the Darjeeling Limited before it was finished. It seemed interesting, and with the cast assembled I felt it would probably be a good movie. Of course, when I did finally see it, I was excited to see it was another Wes Anderson creation. Following three brothers on a spiritual journey to find their way back to each other, couldn't be more realistic. Siblings often know each other so well, and yet they never really know each other well enough, as is the truth with these three brothers. Still grieving over the death of their father, they argue and come together over and over again. They confront their mother along the way and each other about the events that followed the death of their father. When it is all said and done, no three brothers can come together and find such a spiritual bond as these three. I cried, I laughed, and I fell in love with the music. I can't see any other actors playing in the roles of these three quirky brothers and I can't believe how amazing I felt when the movie was over. I got the message and I hope you do too. I enjoyed this movie so much, I added it to my collection.
