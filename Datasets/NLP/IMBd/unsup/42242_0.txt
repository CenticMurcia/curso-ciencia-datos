(my comments are based on the unrated director's cut which runs 12 minutes longer than the R-rated theatrical cut)<br /><br />call it Basic Instinct part 2, since it's by the same writer and basically the exact same movie for the most part just with different actors.<br /><br />the numerous explicit sex scenes are about as unerotic as you can get, and the movies centerpiece, the car chase, seems to go on forever. i honestly feel that this movie could of had something going for it with a little restraint in the sex department and better writing.<br /><br />a barely competent erotic/thriller.<br /><br />rating:4
