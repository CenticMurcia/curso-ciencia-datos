Oh, how can I star? This movie was so awful. I love the first two Candyman movies, they were creepy, scary and they had a plot. In this third installment there is no good acting. Donna D'Enrico should leave her career. I was very sick of hearing her stupid screaming. The only one right in this movie was Tony Todd. Oh, and Tony Todd said in some interview that Candyman 3 was a load of crap. Leaving the awful acting, the stupid ending and almost everything about this movie behind, it was OK. Imean, I liked the gore and the performance by Tony Todd. God, they even missed the excellent soundtrack by Phillip Glass. Bad, bah, bad sequel. I know it was inevitable, but now they should make a Candyman 4 to end the story, cause it's a shame that THIS CRAP was the end of the series. But, what can I say? What's the end of the series in Halloween, Hellraiser and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre? They have been remade cause those series had no salvation. Look at Halloween: Resuurrection, Hellraiser: Hellworl and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation. If you want a creepy, scary well-done movie, just watch the original Candyamn, and then if you liked it, go watch Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh, but stop right there. Candyman 3 is a big mess: 3/10
