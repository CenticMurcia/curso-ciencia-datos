This was 20th Century Fox's first attempt to make a movie targeting the Latino community. From this regard it is an important first step by Hollywood in acknowledging a growing trend in America. To be sure, the strength of the Latin community will dictate that studios figure out the right formula versus Latinos succumbing to what studios think they should watch. So in this regard, I give it 10 stars.<br /><br />Some other impressive elements come from the casting. Jaci Velasquez is a Christian artist and notice that her theatrical debut is a PG movie and how she wore the one-piece bathing suit and otherwise maintained a modest demeanor alongside her co-stars. Another reason to consider Ms. Velasquez a role model for teens and to applaud Fox for not offering up an over-sexed first attempt to draw in Latino crowds.<br /><br />Unfortunately the plot is somewhat vapid which is why I don't necessarily recommend the movie other than for its pivotal place in a movement that is gaining momentum.
