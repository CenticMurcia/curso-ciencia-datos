Like a children's history lesson. Nothing worse than redundant dialogue that has to set the scene to save time. Two Yogi-isms in the first scene and then we don't hear from him again. Sort of like name dropping. Never been a Yankee fan and the depiction of the boorish Yankee fans and team have sealed their fate.
