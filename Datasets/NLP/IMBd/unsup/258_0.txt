I was taken back the first moments of the movie. I do not agree with this type of family arrangement. However, Robin Williams and Nathan Lane are such fantastic actors and comedians, I couldn't help but "get into" this movie. The movie has no boring moments. It is all about the antics of the gay couple "trying" to come up with a plan to appear "straight" to a family with a totally different agenda.<br /><br />I have watched this movie numerous times. I have the video tape and the DVD. Every time it appears on television, I have to watch. Just when I think my family gets a little too crazy, I always have "The Birdcage" to assure me all is well.<br /><br />I am a registered nurse and currently completing my Bachelor's Degree in Nursing. I have chosen this movie to write a research paper about families. After I complete the paper, I will post another comment.
