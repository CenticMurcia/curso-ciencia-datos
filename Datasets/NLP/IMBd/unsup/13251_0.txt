This movie rules. Satanic rituals, midgets, Tim THomerson, That hot chick, monsters that look really stupid and some AMAZING acting-what else do you need? Not much more that I can think of! Also a sequel to 3 other equally great movies by CHarles Band. GO get them.they are bad channels, dollman, and demonic toys. I can't say enough good things about this film. You really have to see for yourself this spectacle. I just hope that Charles Band never retires and I can look forward to more of this stuff for years. I know you all will post about how horrible this film is but I can't see what your talking about. I know it isn't a "great quaility horror film" but who cares? I have found that these films are for cheap thrills only so why bother to make it something more?
