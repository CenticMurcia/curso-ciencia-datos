An amusingly bad mix of post-Freudian psychology, sleep science, bedeviled women, and naked co-eds. This is a classic adult thriller, meaning that it is not thrilling and is really meant for frustrated teenagers. The acting is periodically horrible, but usually rises to the level of being just awful. The plot (about four students and a professor who conquer their sexual fears while lucid dreaming but--surprise!--meet a mysterious devil-woman in their dreams and must team up to defeat her) is intriguing in the let's-slow-down-and-look-at-the-overturned-tractor-trailer sort of way. Standard pay-TV after-dark fare.
