What other movie has a bootlegger as a likable hero. Where the phrase "my boys just took him for a ride" can give you a happy feeling. What movie but "Night Nurse" - an addictively weird movie. Barbara Stanwyck gives a typical top rate performance. Clark Gable plays a psychotic chauffeur. The studio may have been testing him in different roles because the same year he was in "The Easiest Way" playing the decent, hard- working and quite moralistic husband of Anita Page - an even more "blink and you will miss him" role. Joan Blondell is always great - this time as Stanwyck's pal. Ralf Harolde as the oddball doctor with some strange tics and even stranger habits - the film seemed to leave it up to you to figure him out and it was not hard. Marcia Mae Jones who was so powerful in "These Three" plays Nannie, one of the little children in the midst of the intrigue. You will go back for a second and third look at "Night Nurse". "sez who" "sez me in a big way sister".
