John Ford directed a very interesting film with all kinds of suspense along with the story written by the famous Eugene O'Neill. This story takes place on a freighter, "Glencairn", along with a great cast of veteran actors who are all individuals with many years of sailing experiences and some are just plain rough and tough and others keep to themselves. John Wayne, (Ole Olsen) plays the role of a Swedish seaman who wants to make this voyage on the Glencairn his last, because he wants to go home to his mother's farm near Stockholm, Sweden. Wayne does not play a very big role in this film in spite of the fact he has star billing. Thomas Mitchell, (Aloysuis Driscoll) plays the role as the senior man and gives a great supporting role. Even Ward Bond appears and has a relatively short role in this picture. This picture takes place during WW II and the Glencairn has hidden on board lots of ammunition to support the war effort in England and could be destroyed by German planes or submarines. Nice film, but not what I expected to see.
