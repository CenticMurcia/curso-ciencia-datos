What I really like about this storyline is it gives the viewer ideas of what to do if you happen to find yourself in this problem! I can't wait until this film is finally sold! I SEE MR. OSCAR IN YOUR FUTURE! This movie will make you cry and feel things that you have not felt in a long time. I sure wish I could have been a part of the crew, but I tell all my friends about this film! You just have to see it when it comes out! The behind the story is just as good as the film. You have to ask me about this. I had a chance to interview Corinna Harney and this is a story that you will never forget.
