This film is brilliantly made, and should be seen by more people.<br /><br />It is very powerful in the way it shows one brave man's lone attempt to stop the Nazis in their tracks and Brandauer perfectly conveys the sense of silent outrage against the atrocities he sees rising around him.<br /><br />It is heartbreaking to discover that he was executed weeks before the liberation by the Allies, and that no memorial exists to commemorates him to this day.<br /><br />Everyone should see this film.<br /><br />Also, the fact it is filmed on location in Germany makes it very atmospheric and you can feel the climate of fear and suppression very plausibly more so than in many other films set in this era.<br /><br />Dennehy and LeVaillant are convincing as the Nazis.
