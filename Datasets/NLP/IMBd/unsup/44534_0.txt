Having watched this film at the Genesis Mile End cinema, I can honestly say that this is the worst film I have ever had to pay money to see. An atrocious mess of a production, with even worse direction, it's a real pity because its story could have been something quite interesting, but this is a clear example of some idiotic filmmakers trying to maximise sales by casting B list American actors. Jeff Fahey, plays Richard Murray a pathologist who really just does paperwork rather than examine bodies, and is haunted by the death of his wife, begins to receive messages from the dead of murder victims of a serial killer. With an added excuse to bring in another American name, Marty Kove of Karate Kid fame, a wannabe tough talking American cop to investigate these murders because obviously the English don't have the correct qualifications for investigating murders, the film becomes a comical example of a bunch of filmmakers who don't know how to tell a story. Over the top lighting, ridiculous characters, laughable special effects, and preposterous twist can't aid or at least make this film entertaining even for the avid B movie fan. This film made for £2 million it doesn't look it £500,000 would be my guess. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
