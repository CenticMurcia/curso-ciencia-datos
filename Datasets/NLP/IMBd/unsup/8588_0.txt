You know the background by now so i won't bother going into the plot. Before i went to see this i pretty much expected the movie to be kind of funny, but not as funny as it could be. I was pretty much right. I liked the movie, there are some really great jokes and 8 mile references but i think that it could have really been even better. All the actors did a pretty good job in their parts. Overall, i would recommend the movie for any comedy lovers to see.
