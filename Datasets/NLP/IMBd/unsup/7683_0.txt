The final horror film from the celebrated British studio was the second adaptation of a Dennis Wheatley novel to reach the screen, after "The Devil Rides Out" in the late 60's. Here, "Devil Rides Out" hero Christopher Lee is now the villain, Father Michael. He's a heretic priest with fiendish plans for ravishing young "nun" Katherine (Nastassja Kinski, in her first big role). Katherine is being protected by American occult novelist John Verney (Hollywood legend Richard Widmark of "Kiss of Death" fame, making for a most unlikely but very welcome hero for a Hammer film).<br /><br />I will grant that the conclusion does feel a little rushed, and the special effect of a demonic puppet is below par for a film that does succeed in creating an ominous mood. It's a good plot with some effectively shocking moments, not the least of which is young Kinski's full frontal nudity late in the film. It's graphic, creepy, and allows its veteran cast a chance to really shine. Lee is superb in one of his best villainous parts, and Widmark is a likable and rock-solid presence as his adversary. Honor "Pussy Galore" Blackman offers a bright performance as Widmark's agent and Denholm Elliott of the first and third "Indiana Jones" films is perfectly jittery as Kinski's guilt-plagued father. Kinski is quite stunning, mixing a sense of untapped sexuality and demure innocence very well.<br /><br />For a film with its share of detractors, I thought it was reasonably well executed and polished horror fare. It's well acted, grim, and has a bit of kick to it. The script and the characters are intelligent and overall it rates as a respectable swan song for the legendary studio that produced it.<br /><br />8/10
