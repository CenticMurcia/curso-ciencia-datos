Another lame attempt at a "politically correct" Cinderella story, but with Elmo in place of Brandy. It dosen't get much worst than this. If your looking for a GOOD fairy tale story, watch the "Happily Ever After" series, politically correct it may be but atleast their able to pull it off, and on a regular basis.
