The film was VERY clever. I can definitely see this happening! My friends and I have different views on what to trust in a guy and when we think it is time to run. Being an (untrusting) New Yorker, I would find the whole thing creepy. But plenty of my girlfriends would find it romantic. That's why it works. It was also very funny. The acting was great. I also enjoyed how the director set us all up and how he cut the scenes together. Even the song played on the guitar was cute (and so was the guy). This film was the right length with the right "wow" you're supposed to experience from a short film. I highly recommend this short!
