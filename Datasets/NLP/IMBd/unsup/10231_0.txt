Some movies suffer from titles that overstate what the movie can deliver. _Attack the Gas Station!_ is certainly not one of them. Yessir, you'll see a gas station be attacked. By my count, the gas station is attacked four times in the film's first five minutes. The last gas station attack becomes much more involved and lasts an entire evening, during which the gas station attackers and their hostages all learn valuable life lessons from each other and grow as people. Also, they are able to unite against a common enemy: some guy who drives loudly. Completely morally bankrupt, but likable. A hell of a movie. See it if you have the opportunity.
