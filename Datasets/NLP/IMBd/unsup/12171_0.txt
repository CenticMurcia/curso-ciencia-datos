My class and i studied this film as our A-level focus film for our exam and we all loved it. all the girls thought the guys were really hot and the story line was amazing. we decided to read some reviews before posting our own and by the looks of things most people feel the same way as we do!<br /><br />this has been a very interesting film to study, however the ending shouldn't of been changed for us English viewers. we have come away form the Edukators with completely different morals then the rest of the world. <br /><br />can't wait to see what the exam question will ask about this film but believe me i won't be able to stop writing!
