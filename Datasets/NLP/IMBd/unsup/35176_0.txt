Nothing fresh about this movie: conservatives are bad. Christians are bad, republicans are all fascists, blah blah blah.<br /><br />If I wanted to get beat over the head with fanatic left-wing views I can just watch the Daily Show for free which like this movie says the same thing ad nauseum. <br /><br />For all the rah rah talk about revolution against the state (with huge allusions, blatant actually, to the democratically elected Bush Administration) it really boils down to a message tailor-made for people who will just revel in the idea of seeing Bush compared to Hitler, Fox News compared to(ironically) state propaganda, Christians portrayed as oppressive bigots. <br /><br />So if you hate republicans and enjoy liberal clich√©, this movie is for you. For those who can see through the bullshat on both sides, avoid this steaming pile.
