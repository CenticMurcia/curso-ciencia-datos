I'm always looking for good quality entertainment, whether it be books, movies, or TV series, for the young or the not-so-young, and "The Wayne Manifesto" is a rare gem that doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Based on the books by David McRobbie, it follows the life of 12 year old Wayne Wilson, who moves to a new neighbourhood with his family, and is therefore the 'new kid', in almost every aspect of his life.<br /><br />Chronologically, I'm definitely not a 'kid' any more, and wasn't when I first watched this excellent series either, but I still couldn't resist its charms, and thankfully, had the foresight to record most of the episodes.<br /><br />Apart from hoping that more great Aussie shows like this could be made, my only other wish would be that it be released on DVD in the not-too-distant future.
