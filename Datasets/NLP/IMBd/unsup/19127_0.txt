Enjoyed this Edward G. Robinson, where he plays the role of Joe Keller, a self made man who was poor and built up a very profitable business. Joe has a nice family he is very proud of and works hard to give them all the comforts he never had when he was a child growing up. During World War II Joe started bidding for government contracts and he was making good money until American pilots started having problems with their aircraft and many pilots were killed because of faulty parts. There is a big scandal and Joe Keller faces some very serious problems. Burt Lancaster, (Chris Keller) plays the role of one of Joe Keller's son's and he gives an outstanding supporting role in this film. After this airplane scandal, many people started saying, "Ask Joe Keller" what really happened. Edward G. put his heart and soul in his role and clearly showed his great professional acting abilities. This is a rather sad story, but true to life.
