A timeless classic. Full marks to the director and the cast.<br /><br />Hrithik is perfection personified as usual. This would be Ash's best performance till date as she does not giggle needlessly or overact at any point.<br /><br />The supporting cast has done a great job too - especially Punam Sinha and Nikitin. A slight regret is that Sonu Sood should have had a stronger personality for his background, but it is does not impact the movie in any way. <br /><br />The music is endearing. It will catch up on you as you listen to it a couple of times.<br /><br />Avoid watching pirated online versions and go watch it in a theater. A pirated version simply cannot capture the grandeur of this movie.
