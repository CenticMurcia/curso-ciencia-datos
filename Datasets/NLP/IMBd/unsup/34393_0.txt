This show is troublesome to say the least. Dwarfism is not a normal human condition, it's in fact a serious genetic ailment with tremendous health consequences, and depending on form can often lead to an early death.<br /><br />I am not against people having this condition, they can't help being the way they were born. I am completely against, however, two "little people" getting together and having dwarf children out of ignorance of their own conditions. Yes, they had one child which fortunately did not receive the trait, but their other child was not as fortunate.<br /><br />It is not cute to see a dwarf child! He will face horrific health problems in his future. Dwarfism is not a race, species, or ethnicity of people, it is a terrible genetic disorder which is not to be taken lightly, and should never be purposefully or willfully given to a child!
