Man, how can anyone not love James Cagney? He had more screen presence than just about anyone who has ever appeared in any film in movie history.<br /><br />This is James Cagney's fifth film, The Public Enemy, as it still shocks today with its incredible violence and story of two best buddies who get into crime together. They mix in with some of the shadiest characters ever seen on screen, like Putty Nose and Paddy, both of who keep coming out with great line after great line, total 1930's style.<br /><br />Of course this has the grapefruit scene, but there are many great scenes, like when Cagney tells a bartender "eh, you're yella" and gives him a slap. If one hasn't seen The Public Enemy, one really must!
