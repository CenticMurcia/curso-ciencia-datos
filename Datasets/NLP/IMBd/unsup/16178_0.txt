Good actors. GREAT story (Ian McEwan is a legend!) Definitely read the novel of the same title before seeing the film! This film was fantastic. I finished reading the novel two days before seeing the movie, and although it had it's differences to the novel, I was gripped. The screenplay made necessary changes to the story's plot. For example Joe Rose is a scientist-turned-journalist in the book, this would not have been very effective on screen, and so they made him a lecturer. *SPOILER below* The end scene was absolutely fantastic, I was expecting the novel's ending with the gun to be used, but the knifing was extremely shocking and poignant. Similarly, the small clip as the credits run, of Jed in an institution matches well with the 2nd Appendix of the novel... eerily emotive!! :: The film makers did a great job of turning the book into a film, and I recommend this movie!
