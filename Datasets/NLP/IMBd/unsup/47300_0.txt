1st watched 8/16/2009 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Jean Yarbrough): Lame and boring zombie movie where every scene appears manufactured and contrived. The story involves a couple pilots and a servant who crash on an island and encounter a strange doctor and his weird counterparts. He, of course, welcomes them to his mansion quite graciously but the servant realizes early on that things aren't right with him. Of course, he sees the zombies on the Island and no-one believes him initially because he's just a servant. The plot becomes a lot more complicated when we realize there is also a lost admiral whom the mad doctor is trying to get information out of by hypnotizing him. The complications in the plot really don't help the movie because it moves at such a slow pace and even the zombies are pretty ho-hum. There is also a very lame comedy attempt thrown in with using a racist portrayal of a black man with big eyes providing the hucks, although they are obviously borrowed from other movies. And then of course, the mean count has the Lugosi-like foreign accent and the local folk get involved with the voodie attempts on the admiral. I really can't believe how many of these type of movies were made in this timeframe. Hopefully they weren't all this bad.
