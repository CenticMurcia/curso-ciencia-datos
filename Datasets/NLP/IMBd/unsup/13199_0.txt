In Lexington, Kentucky, the horse barn of the family Crane has been empty for years, without any horses, due to the financial difficulties of the family. When the female horse Sonya, a.k.a. Sonador (Dreamer, in Spanish) breaks one foreleg in a race, the owner Palmer (David Morse) decides to sacrifice the animal, but the trainer Ben Crane (Kurt Russell) accepts the injured horse as part of three months salaries owed by Palmer. His daughter Cale (Dakota Fanning) becomes very connected with Sonya, and while the horse is rehabilitated, the wounds in the ties of the Crane family are also healed.<br /><br />"Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story" is one of those beautiful, positive, optimistic movies, with a magnificent message for families. First, you must never give up your dream; following your dream, no matter how impossible it seems to be, magic may happen. The other one is that families shall always stay united, no matter how difficult the situation seems to be: the union makes the strength. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Sonhadora" ("Dreamer")
