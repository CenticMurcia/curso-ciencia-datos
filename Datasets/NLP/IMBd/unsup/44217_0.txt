I wonder: What the Sci-Fi channel was thinking when they put on this muck?<br /><br />Was it a parody? Satire? No it was just bad. What was with the barber/mobsters? Absolutely idiotic. Then ninjas?<br /><br />Unfunny, silly (but not in a funny way), stupid characters and costumes, the worst production values and a dumber plot.<br /><br />Using IMDB I checked up on the mind-numbing cast, just to make sure I didn't accidently see them in any other films.<br /><br />PLEASE DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.
