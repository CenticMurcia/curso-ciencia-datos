From the weird characters to their estranged roles, this movie gives a new meaning to "Real Weird" I was expecting the movie to be somewhat of a scary thriller but my toughts afterwards are contrary. MTV made such a big deal about the lost season through commercials, I'm disappointed that the commercial's intensions wasn't even relevant to the story line. I mean, the reason why this movie is such an upset to some viewers is probably because MTV wasted all there money on it's crummy commercials. Yes, it all starts out as a usual MTV Real World episode, where everyone is arriving and introducing themselves then they are invited to a real world challenge, get kidnapped by some lunatic and get "real" tortured in somekind of a jailhouse. By the way, if you were paying attention, the people that arrived together in groups of two like Cash and Melinda, Liz and Keith, Omara and Adam all had somekind of love connection... and then you have your categorized, spiritual, on-the-side person- Boomer. The only thing good about this movie is the suspenseful plot, storyline and the acting. Now they were going to far when they totally copied the Blair Witch Project with the Running through the woods scene with the creepy old house, and not to forget the cheesy disclaimers that it was deemed "lost footage" and such nonsense. If you possibly have nothing else better to do,it's late at night and there is nothing to watch then by all means watch this. I recommend it only if you have the time.
