This is one of the most transparent and heavy handed pieces of propaganda ever disguised as a horror movie.<br /><br />Earth spirits defending themselves by literally reaching out and attacking humans has been a left wing wet dream for a long time and it was only a matter of time before it hit the movie screen.<br /><br />I could overlook the politics if it wasn't so monumentally boring, silly, and full of stereotypes. Once again, Ron Perlman is cast as a loud ignorant right winger, his vaguely simian cranial features a big asset to the role I'm sure, while "Good guy", James Legros is as bland as usual, with a nastier than usual beard.<br /><br />Can you imagine being the love interest and getting into a love triangle with these two puke faces?<br /><br />Larry (what's his face) the director and star of Habit, the most boring vampire movie ever, should take a lesson from those commie spaghetti westerns and at least let us have some fun.
