Like all American soaps, 'Dynasty' is nothing but a mish-mash of ropey acting, inane plots and one-dimensional characters. Many loved it, though. If this heap of misery entitled 'Dynasty' has made so many people happy then that is fine by me. What I objected to was the fact that most days in the mid to late '90's, 'Dynasty' somehow managed to bribe U.K-Gold into giving it constant re-runs (what did we do to deserve this?), as was the case with 'Knots Landing' and 'Dallas'.<br /><br />The best known cast member from this show, as most will know, is Joan Collins, who many men used to fancy. I, myself, could never understand why. I wonder what men would think if they actually saw her face without the 10,000 layers of make-up.<br /><br />Some people reckon that hanging is suitable punishment for murderers. No, that's just a smack on the wrist. Make them suffer. Make them beg for forgiveness. Make them watch endless repeats of 'Dynasty'.
