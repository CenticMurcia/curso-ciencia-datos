Despite it's bad reputation, this comedy about fancy-pants Army officer Matthew Perry and rowdy mountain man Chris Farley's attempt to upstage Lewis and Clark by beating them to the Pacific Ocean is amiable and a whole lot of fun for fans of Farley and Perry's well worn comedic alter-egos.<br /><br />Not all of the jokes hit their mark but enough of them do and the story is a fairly interesting one.<br /><br />It's sad to say that Farley's hard-living ways really shows through in his performance, especially during his blustery outbursts.<br /><br />Certainly this is the strangest film ever to come out of executive producer Ted Turner's fascination with American history, unless you count the Turner Home Video distributed Civil War horror tale, Ghost Brigade.
