I don't know why Wes Craven, didn't Direct this, but without Freddy's creator, it simply insults the original with its attempts to break the boundary's set out by Wes Craven in the first movie. Freddy now seems to be able to interfere with others through the power of dreams, not the just the person that has the dreams, and it comes across as contrived and tacky.<br /><br />Freddy is still a good character, although more laughable than Scary in this outing, he was humorous in the first movie, but not at the expense of the Horror.<br /><br />Don't let this movie be your guide, The original Nightmare wipes the floor with this second rate follow up.<br /><br />4/10
