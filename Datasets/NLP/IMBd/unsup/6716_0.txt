It's been a while since I acquired a headache from a movie. For that, I thank "Bee Movie," a dreadfully mindless excursion into the worlds of both copycat kiddie fantasy and shameless commercial promotion (for a show that's been off the air for years).<br /><br />This was a movie I never even wanted to watch. So the disc was inserted without my blessing into a DVD player that should be praised for its patience at showing such garbage, and I was subjected to all 90 or whatever minutes of this trash festival. I was told I wouldn't even notice the nasal, whiny, someone-please-strike-him-mute voice of hack comedian Jerry Seinfeld (that's right, I said it, Seinfeld *and* his show are two of the most cruel things that can be unleashed upon mankind). Naturally, that was wrong.<br /><br />Basically, that meant that the movie was basically a rehash of movies like "A Bug's Life" and "Antz," both of which were very good movies in which insects dreamed of a better life and had the fortitude to make it happen. That sentence should be its own genre by now! Even the actors I had genuine respect for (Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, and Larry Miller, the hilarious voice of the pointy-haired boss in "Dilbert") were unimaginably uninspiring. They had absolutely no shame, wasting what seemed like hours on jokes about rock star Sting. They even sank so low as to feature a character called "Bee Larry King." Next time, can we please get Dugong Dr. Phil a role in a "Madagascar" sequel?<br /><br />When a bee stings, it dies. It's a fact of biology. And this putrid bug corpse starts stinging the moment the disc drawer is closed.
