"Operation-Annihilate" is the final episode of the first season. It is an interesting episode for a variety of reasons. I liked how the show takes time to explore Kirk's personal life outside the Federation. More important, the program explores how personal feelings affect commanding choices. Kirk goes bunkers when he finds out his brother was killed by some strange looking creatures. I wished the story would have spent more time on Kirk and his family (his nephew comes aboard the Enterprise) but the original TV series never showed much enthusiasm for that kind of thing. But there are enough glimpses of Kirk's life outside the Enterprise to make the program interesting. A big part of the episode was filmed outside soundstages and the open spaces are a nice touch.
