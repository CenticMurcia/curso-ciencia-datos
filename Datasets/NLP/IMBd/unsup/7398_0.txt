This is the supposed story of one of the most famous characters in auto-racing from his childhood in the early part of the last century to the his death in 1988. The film seems to have been shot in English with Italian and American actors.<br /><br />Having seen a number of films starring Sergio Castellitto, I was expecting this to be an in-depth study of an interesting and conflicted person. Instead I was treated to embarrassingly bad dialog and clich√©d situations.<br /><br />This must be the worst film Castellitto has ever done and certainly the worst film I have seen in many years.
