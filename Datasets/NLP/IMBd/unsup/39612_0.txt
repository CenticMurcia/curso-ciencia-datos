Early in the film, when Arthur and Curt are out in the snow surveying the dead cattle, snow is falling when the camera is on Arthur, snow is not falling when the camera is on Curt - over and over and over again. This hard to miss goof is only the beginning of a downward spiral for this film. Choppy editing, bad acting and a horrible script await the poor viewer who chooses to sit through this clunker.<br /><br />And should I mention how when the panther/"painter" attacks and kills Arthur, no blood or wound is ever seen?... Even when Curt takes Arthur's coat off... Even when Arthur's body is draped over the horse. This and the fact that we never see the cat, plus the jarring transition between the outdoor footage and the cheesy studio look of the homestead exterior made the whole film look really low budget.
