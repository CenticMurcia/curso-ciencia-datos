You'd have to be pretty stoned to enjoy the Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat. Besides the dreadful animation, the non-stories and the incredibly dated dialogue, the (arguably?) racist depictions of African Americans are incredibly offensive. The only bright spot is the psychedelic trip sequence which may have inspired the similar segment in Beavis and Butthead Do America. Watch it at your own risk---you'll feel dirty afterwards.
