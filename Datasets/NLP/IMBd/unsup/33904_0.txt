The Snow Queen is one of Hans Christian Andersen's best fairy tales. However, there has only been a few adaptations of it, and most are mediocre and childish. This is no exception.<br /><br />The best thing about this TV special is the musical score; which is so beautiful and mystical it could have come from a classical music piece. I can't say the same for the rest.<br /><br />This made-for-TV special looks like it was made by a group of college film students. I'm not too sure how much of this is 'real', because it looks like every shot has been superimposed over an Adobe photo edit. Even worse, the motion capture has a weird, jerky style of action that really detracts from any 'magic'. This is proof that CGI can give authentic looking dinosaurs, and encourage some of the shoddiest special effects ever shot.<br /><br />The character development is so weak that neither sympathy, nor an understanding of personalities is felt. The story mainly skims and summarizes the plot of Andersen's fairy tale, giving the feel of headline news when compared to the original book.<br /><br />I would normally give an adaptation like this a three, but considering that this is a one hour TV special, a 'major motion picture' style cannot be expected. This gets a four.
