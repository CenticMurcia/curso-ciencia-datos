Although surprised that Jolie received a razzberrie nomination for this, she -- as the the other characters -- is not the protagonist. The significant characters are the locations: Especially Ethiopia and those victimized. Each landscape, in each conflict captured in images, portrays the inescapable fact that the human species, unlike all others on our planet, is capable of going "beyond" the need to kill for food or for survival or even to become "leader of the pack" in a "fair" competition. An aspect in homo sapiens somehow "needs" to "plan" not only the submission, but -- when necessary -- "beyond" the complete elimination of the others around. Despite its flaws, a powerful commentary about our human condition that should not be missed!
