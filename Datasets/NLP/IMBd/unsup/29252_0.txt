I have no idea why so many want to bash this film.....because it's Wesley Snipes? Because it's straight-to-DVD? This movie "7 Seconds" isn't that bad.....it's got some decent one-liner dialog, and some good thrills and some rad car chases.<br /><br />Since his trademark series "Blade" came to a close in 2004, Wesley has been really almost hitting rock bottom since then. He's been getting the same fate as Seagal and Van Damme only because no on likes martial arts anymore.....so sad. Its actually even more enjoyable to watch than seeing Rambo pick up a rocket launcher or firing those bomb arrows. And even more than Arnie getting his hands on a freaking machine gun and saying "I'll be Back" in a dramatic fashion. Martial arts is more worth watching because it's something that can be done and its a practice.<br /><br />So Snipes, Seagal and Van Damme seem like they would rather allow their careers to tank than give up their martial arts skills, and i praise all of them for that.<br /><br />Even though the starting scene might be a rip-off from the one in "Heat" (and yeah, they even take the hockey masks, lol), and the flashbacks are shown a little bit too much, but i guess its for a reason, to show who the characters are talking about, i guess.<br /><br />And also, Alexsie, that Russian gangster guy with Cerebral Palsy, is also a pretty interesting character, cause the actor does a good job of getting into him, and boy, was he INSANE.<br /><br />So come on, people....just give it a chance and give Wesley some of that recognition he deserves back. 'cause he doesn't deserve to be in this position.....
