I just bought this on dvd the other day allthough i must admit i wasn't looking for it as i wanted to buy ghost world but the shop didn't have it(DAMM YOU WOOLWORTHS IT'S A GREAT MOVIE NOW I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO VIRGIN IN CARDIFF)anyway i went across to w.h smith and even though they didn't have it, they did have this gem on the shelf, so i bought this instead. I remember seeing this when i was a young kid and even though i didn't totaly understand it at the time, i thought it was so cool. It also could have been the first gangster film i ever saw. brian de palma is a master at suspense and say what you want about him for riping off other film makers,the pram down the stairs at the train station is a nailbiter. the performances are also impecable too with sean conerey's secne taking,giving him a much deserved oscar. A mention should also go to ennio moricone's wonderful score and stephen h burum's elegent cinematography making you believe you are in the 1930s. couple that with excelent pacing and you a well crafted piece of entertainment. It may not have the same kind of depth that the godfather has,but to be fair it dosen't try to and everything it try's to do it succeds at<br /><br />a faultles 10/10
