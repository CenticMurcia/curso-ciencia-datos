Hasnain Hyderabadwala & Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER(2006) remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which wasn't that great in the first place<br /><br />The film looks similar to Emraan's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER<br /><br />The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however isn't as engrossing<br /><br />The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain's characterization isn't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too<br /><br />Direction is okay Music is a winner, especially ZINDAGI NE, MAUSAM, WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good<br /><br />Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual, Rajat Bedi fills the bill
