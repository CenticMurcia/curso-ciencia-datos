Please Sajid Khan, stick to what you do better (which is a tough question to answer). This movie started out with vulgar humor and continued throughout. Vulgarity that Sajid Khan is always full of. He tried to follow the typical 'masala film' guidelines. Thus, squeezing in an 'all-star cast' song and guest-appearances by the other left over actors in the film industry. But, this movie needed a lot more than just this masala and a xerox copy of a well known Hollywood movie. <br /><br />Akshay Kumar was natural as usual and he brought some humor to the movie but that was forced as well. Maybe the next time around Sajid, you should put some real efforts into making a movie and stop PLAGIARIZING!!
