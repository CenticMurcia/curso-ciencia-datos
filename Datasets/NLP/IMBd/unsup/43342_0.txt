Firoz Nadiadwala made his career with HERA PHERI, APD and the recent PHIR HERA PHERI <br /><br />So now he is stuck with the same idea of film-making<br /><br />So what this film has?<br /><br />It has a big star cast as usual in such comedy films where they have so many characters and sub plots that you get more confused<br /><br />So here we have The once funny now boring Johny Lever and Paresh Rawal(who is loosing his touch now) Shahid Kapur just after VIVAAH perhaps he thought of getting a hit as a comedy as those days before VIVAAH he was going bad in his career Ayesha Takia need i say anything ? Vivek Oberoi- again nothing needs to be said about this crazy people Sunny Deol- phew! Arbaaz, Chunky, Jackie- you find this people in so many such films <br /><br />To sum up this is some stupid comedy based in Dubai(mostly such films r set there) and the most ridiculous situations, boring comedy and stunts and dances<br /><br />Direction by Ahmed Khan is bad Music is okay<br /><br />Amongst actors Paresh is funny in places but nothing great Johny is monotonous Shahid is okay but he tends to overdo it Ayesha has nothing to do like mostly in her films Sameera too is just added Sunny Deol does his repetitive acting Vivek has a short nonsense role Om Puri and Sharmila are wasted Jackie, Arbaaz, Chunky are crazy as usual Zakir is as usual Suresh Menon is a gap filler
