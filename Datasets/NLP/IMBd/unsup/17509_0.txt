I always say that I can tell whether a movie is going to be great or bad just by watching the first 5 mins. <br /><br />Well, this one seriously failed that test. Most of the five mins was spent on a map of Cuba set to some god awful music with just place names indicated that we are gonna forget immediately.<br /><br />As the movie progressed, even though I longed to find out something about this guy, I wasn't getting much at all. <br /><br />So much time wasted on pointless shots and dialog of people saying "hi" to each other in Spanish and getting sick.<br /><br />As I'm getting old and didn't care about a single one of the boring characters I had to turn it off. I made it about 50 mins I think. Nothing happened, nothing even looked like it was gonna happen. I'm too old to waste X hours on this drivel, so as usual I head to IMDb to check out the ratings. <br /><br />Much to my surprise its a high rating, and there are pages of good reviews. Only when I got to the last few pages did I find people who agree with me that this film is drivel.<br /><br />So, come on, all you others you think it sucks, please speak up now :-)<br /><br />Guess I'll have to check out Wikipedia to find out what this guy really did. It'll be much quicker.
