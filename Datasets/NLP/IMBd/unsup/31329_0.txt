Being a fan of "JAG" and its topical stories, I knew that this show couldn't be that bad, but due to my work schedule wasn't able to watch it when the first season debuted. I finally got around to catching this show in early 04 and have been watching it ever since. I thought that "CSI" and its many versions was great--but "NCIS" is The Best! The chemistry between all characters is sooo real. "CSI" doesn't have that feel to me. Wonder what the next season will hold now that Kate is gone. Are we to see a more obsessed Gibbs, like he was before they found out who Ari was?! I hope so! And I hope they finally track down and kill that bastard Ari
