Another great performance by Paulette Goddard. Along with Veronica Lake, and Claudette Colbert as the lead.<br /><br />All were very good, however, it was Paulette that got the Academy Award nomination as "Best Supporting Actress" for this film. And she deserved it. Yet in all the TV hype and movie club ads, it's always Colbert and Lake that get billed. Paulette went on to make another film with Sonny Tufts, "I Love A Soldier", because of their charisma in this film together.
