After sitting through this pathetic excuse for a film , when the plane actually landed , I was fully expecting to hear the sound of clicking , as the passengers push a large safety bar up in front of them , as some young , teenage boy shouts "please dad , can I go on it again?"<br /><br />Now , I realise that it was based on an actual incident , which i'm sure was terrifying for the real people involved , but almost everything about this film was pure shambles. The only saving grace was the fly by shots of the plane with it's roof ripped off.<br /><br />I'm sorry , but I actually found it more of a comedy than whatever it was supposed to be. The young boy passenger eating cookies gets a gold star (and another cookie) for being the only one to spot that enormous rip in the ceiling. The fearless stewardess who's been pinned to the floor for ages , takes time out to show everyone her tropical talent for windsurfing , as she stands upright in the middle of the isle whilst clinging to the chairs , at several hundred miles an hour. Then she suddenly remembers what she's there for , and continues to overact by throwing herself about like a mad woman. The overall acting is about as wooden as a lump of driftwood. Most of the passengers look catatonic , like they've been hit in the back with a dumb-dumb bullet.<br /><br />The whole set looks like it was borrowed from the Wallyworld amusement park. The make-up is terrible. Just about everyone looks like they've either been barbecued or on the sunbed for too long. The budget must have been about $10 for this appalling flick , and about $9.50 of that was probably spent on hotdogs.<br /><br />Even the famous cheesy 'Airplane' flashbacks are included , right down to the fighter plane scene with the instructor's words ringing in the pilot's ears. Almost at the end of the ride , two of the passengers decide to offer their piloting and medical services. Why didn't they offer them before? Maybe they fell asleep after watching a certain in-flight movie. At least the medic attempts to help , but why does the pilot then retract his offer of assistance? The unknown government official jumping on the plane at the last moment after it lands , and ordering everyone to leave was pure class. He then decides it was all a mistake and disappears into oblivion. Who was he , where did he go , does anyone care?<br /><br />This film is about as enjoyable as the last in-flight meal I had.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour. Upgrade to first class and watch a better film.
