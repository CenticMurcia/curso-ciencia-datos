I can sum up the movie in a couple words. Terrible acting, sub-par fight scenes, and ridiculous clich√© plot. Is this suppose to be a cross between a kung fu film and a zombie one? That is the worst idea ever.<br /><br />Insulting to real martial arts films. Not even deserving of a title as a parody... it wasn't funny at all. I consider it to be more of an abomination of poop and urine. It seemed like I was watching an amateur audition tape for a low-quality zombie movie whose plot was written by a very imaginative 8 year old. It is deemed more worthy of being on YouTube than on DVD.<br /><br />You're better off downloading it, or better yet, don't watch it at all. I find staring at a brick wall more exciting than this 'movie'.<br /><br />D+ for effort though.
