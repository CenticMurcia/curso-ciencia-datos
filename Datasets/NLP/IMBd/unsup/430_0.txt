The original "Xtro" (1983) still remains a cult favorite these days, because of the gory effects and weird nightmare sequences. Certainly, it was influenced by Ridley Scott's "Alien" (1979) but it was no cheap rip-off. Unfortunateley, that was the case with "Xtro 2: The Second Encouter" (1990). It had nothing in common with the original one and was nothing more than a mix between "Alien" and "Aliens". To a certain level, it was enjoyable, but not very good. It had it's moments.<br /><br />No memorable moments for the awful "Xtro 3: Watch The Skies". What the hell ? Again, totally unrelated to the previous films, so why the title ? Just another way to cash in on the cult success of the first one. But this time, it really is bad.. No idea what Andrew Divoff (Wishmaster) is doing here, the rest of the unknown cast if unconvincing. That can also be said about the creature, you can hardly see it and that may be for the best because it is bad and awful. The awful story is boring and uninspired. I use the word awful a lot but that perfectly describes this cheap mess.. avoid it at all cost....
