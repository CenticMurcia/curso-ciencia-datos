This is one of the most amazing series ever put to film. Specifically.....Krista Allen. She is unbelievably beautiful, and seeing her in all her glory is truly a treat! She's a pretty good actress, too, especially considering that this is one of her first roles. The episodes that feature other actresses in action, rather than Krista, of course, aren't as interesting. But those with Krista are awesome! Again, she is too beautiful for words....you have to see her for yourself. The plot, as if that matters, is kinda cool, with Krista's character, teaching aliens the ways of earthly love. See it if you can.
