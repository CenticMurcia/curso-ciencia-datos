*A Spoiler or two*<br /><br />'There's Nothing Out There' starts off ok aswell as Mike who seems to know all about horror movies which makes it slightly amusing but that was done better by Jamie Kennedy in Scream. It is all let down by the actual monster who is really the sorriest monster you will ever see in a horror movie. It looks like somebody with a very bad cold has sneezed on the floor and hasn't bothered to wipe it up. A small green fat blob which is a cross between Slimer from Ghostbusters, a critter from Critters and a piece of clay. It actually does rip a bit of the story from critters. I think the guys behind this should have stuck a maniac with an axe in this instead of a bad looking midget monster. It is occasionally funny and does poke fun at the horror genre but it is pretty bad. Worth watching for the cliches alone, not much else though. 4/10.
