This is what grind house movies are all about. They lack most of the things that one would think, make up a good movie (i.e.- no budget, no name actors, poor art direction, rough cinematography, etc.). But this is exactly the type of movie that you expect nothing from, and it gives you an unbelievable amount of entertainment.<br /><br />If there is any way you can get a hold of a print of this film, or have a chance to see it at a revival house, I suggest you do. It is much better to watch on film than it is on DVD. <br /><br />I believe this film is a sequel (one of many) to the film "Zombie A.K.A: Dawn of the Dead" originally directed by George A Romero. The Second Zombie film was done by Italian director Lucio Fulci and was entitled simply, "Zombie" here in the U.S.<br /><br />Truth be told, I expected little from this Italian import campy horror flick. But as the film progressed, I realized that it is just the kind of nostalgic grind house film that select demographics will enjoy for years to come.
