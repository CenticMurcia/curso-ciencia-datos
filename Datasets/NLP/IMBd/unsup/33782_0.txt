...not that someone else is trying to cash in on the 9/11 conspiracism that runs rampant among people too lazy to research the matters for themselves, but it's mind boggling at how many people will just accept whatever internet video is hot at the moment at face value, no questions asked.<br /><br />The film starts off by letting us know that the narrator/producer was a conservative Republican (why is this important?) and a demolition hobbyist (yep, thats what he calls himself). Because of the above qualifications, he knows the towers would not have been able to collapse unless someone planted explosives in them. Yep, the sound reasoning only gets more impressive from there as he explains his exhaustive research methods that consisted of surfing the internet and watching some movies. For a week. This certainly puts the hundreds of people with actual experience in these matters and the educational background necessary to understand the events to shame. This man managed to completely dismiss the hundreds of thousands of collective man hours of the industries leading experts in one week, by surfing the internet.<br /><br />There is little "new" info or takes on already debunked nonsense in this home made vid, just regurgitated bumper sticker talking points. ("never before has a steel building collapsed due to fire", not only intentionally misleading but factually wrong).<br /><br />What surprises me is in the wake of people being forced to face the reality of how factually inaccurate and intentionally misleading Loose Change and it's editions really were, these same people are now championing this similar video without skipping a beat. It's as if they learned nothing about thinking for themselves, and most likely never will.<br /><br />Still, like loose change, this video has it's merits, especially as a study in mass paranoia and rumor regurgitation. I recommend watching it, as I did with loose change, and then seeing screw911mysteries as a companion piece. or don't, if you aren't really concerned with truth. But please, don't turn off your brains and just accept what someone says on an internet video as fact, look into it for yourself.
