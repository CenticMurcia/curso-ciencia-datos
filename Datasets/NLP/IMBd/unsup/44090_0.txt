Did anyone notice the ending included "The Smoking Man" from the original X Files? Once again, he is hooked up with all of the world powers and has access to Andromeda. The series was over-rated, the Ford commercial was stupid. The lab falling apart in second chapter was indeed an old thriller type of stunt. Not at all fresh. I agree that the sub-plots of the President and his wife, staff, drug addictions and family members did not add to the presentation of this predictable storyline. The original was exciting and entertaining. We too are upset that we anticipated so much more from the cast and were ripped off. We are older and have a lot of experience with sci-fi but this did not even make it into that category. Did anyone pay attention to the footage of all the dead birds...a bit of overkill. Sort of like re-watching The Birds by Hitchkock, NOT.
