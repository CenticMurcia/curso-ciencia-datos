The Coen Brothers never cease to amaze me. I must admit, you have to be a Coen Brothers fan to get a Coen Brothers movie, but once you get their style/message, it's PURE BRILLIANCE. Modern day Voltaire's <br /><br />"Burn After Reading", gives us a Dim Whit Personal Trainer played by BradPitt (note: If you're a fan of Brad Pitt because of his Character in Fight club--you're in for a rude awakening in this one!). STUD he is NOT! <br /><br />A Lady who only cares about fixing her physical appearance.<br /><br />Clooney, who plays the goof-ball, will sleep with anyone he has a chance to sleep with---(f.y.i. the "back pillow" scene is CLASSIC).<br /><br />Essentially, this is a movie where the audience gets to drop in on the (unlikely) interconnected/intersected lives of nothing BUT Self Serving Idiots, all of whom meet their "demise" because of their own self serving interests.<br /><br />GREAT SHOW! Worthy of Voltaire--"The aptitude for quick, perceptive, cutting, witty and often scathingly critical repartee" (WikiPedia)---describes "Burn After Reading" exactly.<br /><br />P.S. When watching, take special note of each Characters Hair. Nice Plot Device! :=)
