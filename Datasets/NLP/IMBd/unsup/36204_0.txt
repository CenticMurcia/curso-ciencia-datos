"American Psycho 2" is a bland dark comedy about a female college Freshman majoring in sociopathology (eg: serial killers) who is determined to get a position as a teaching assistant with her professor as a stepping stone to a career with the FBI and will kill anyone who gets in her way. In spite of the film's somewhat sardonic tenor and dark subject, there's little violence, gore, sex or nudity, and over all the film is lacking in verve, style, and creative edge of the original American Psycho. Save this one for cable. C-
