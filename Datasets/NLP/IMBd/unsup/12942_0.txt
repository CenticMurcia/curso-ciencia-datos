On paper, this movie had all the makings of a classic...a hugely talented superstar cast, a unique and creative storyline and an artistic assortment of cinematic spices like emotion, tender romance, jealousy, greed, mystery and a lip smacking element of surprise in the end. Yet sadly on screen, the director fails to synchronize all these tools into a well oiled machine; in short, the movie fails to grip the audience.<br /><br />going by its length, under two hours which is remarkably short for a Hindi movie, one would have expected the movie to unfold at breakneck pace...the kind of tempo that keeps your hips gyrating on the edge of the seat; however, the pace is sluggish for most parts.<br /><br />set in a captivating palace of Rajasthan, it traces the emotional roller coaster ride of the royal palace guard Eklavya ( amitabh bachchan in a memorable performance ) who is put to the cruelest of altars in the end when he is faced with a choice between his loyalty and his son...<br /><br />Saif ali khan as the son, Vidya balan and Sanjay Dutt all give beautiful performances, although the focus never really manages to shift out of the magnetic persona of Amitabh, who plays the role with such rigorous conviction that every crease in his face or every hint of a tear in his eyes more than makes up for the lack of dialogs in the movie..Eklavya is a movie of personal choices and the overly challenging task of choosing the lesser of the two wrongs, or for that matter, the better of the two rights...<br /><br />barring the tortoise pace, which is not quite so bothersome as the screens blank under a couple of hours, the movie is quite worth watching for the sheer gravity of performances.
