i first saw 'master of disguise' when it came out on DVD in early 2003. i remember it being funny, but now i see it as being kind of silly. well, there were some really funny deleted scenes included on the DVD, which (in my opinion) shouldn't have been cut out at all! but really, this movie was pretty unusual for a kid's movie. i mean, a comedian most kids didn't know of at the time, dressing up as some iconic people kids don't know exist, (Quint, Tony Montana)and a scene in which a bumbling idiot and his grandfather disguss the size of a woman's ass? i mean, seriously! is this movie for kids for for sexually frustrated teens? 3/10
