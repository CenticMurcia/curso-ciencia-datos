Karam is a very, very interesting story told in a stylish format. It was so emotionally & psychologically thrilling, the whole movie is charged with pulse pounding suspense and made so dark & sinister that gives you the tensive mood for the film. Inspired from Collateral & Kill Bill. The best Bollywood movie in 2005. Sanjay F. Gupta made a terrific film for his first attempt he only made one film so far but still he is one of my favourite directors. He was a cinematographer of Qayamat, Mujhse Shaadi Karogi and Zinda. The story is mentioned in the plot summery and also by other comment users.<br /><br />Karam has probably the best cinematography in any Bollywood movie, which suits the mood e.g. the flashback scene of John's first kill, was in animation, black and white for John's dream and sepia for the song Tera Hi Karam when he was in huge depression. The animated scene was in black and white the only colour was blood. The main menu of the DVD is wavy, green. <br /><br />The best scenes in the film has to be the: <br /><br />1. Animated scene.<br /><br />2. When John was trying to save his wife he was wearing dark sunglasses and black gloves.<br /><br />3. Where he was in the club during the song Ishq Nachaya Kare dressed like Eric Draven in The Crow and he killed the first man in his hit list.<br /><br />Songs are excellent without a doubt every song is good the best ones probably are Tinka Tinka and Ishq Nachaya Kare.<br /><br />I also noticed a goof when John received his wife's finger it was a full finger but when he was talking to her on the phone after the song Ishq Nachaya Kare her finger was half cut.
