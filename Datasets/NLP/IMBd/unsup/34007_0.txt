Good grief! Why was this one made? The first Exorcist movie was sheer cinema magic. The second was a waste of money and talent. This movie is what gives sequels a bad name. It was not so much the acting that was below standard - I don't think anyone could have made such a muddled script look good. This looked like it was written by a committee of accountants. (Nothing personal against accountants, I am one. I also know I have no business writing a script.) Richard Burton was one of the best actors of his generation. If you based his career on this movie, you would have thought him a hack. He might have needed the cash and therefore just slept his way through this. I recommend avoiding this unless you have a thing for pain. Linda Blair went on to a career that seemingly matched the quality of this movie. Yes, this movie is scary, but not in a good way. It is scary they actually released this.
