There is a decent idea buried at the core of "The Whispering", but the script's logic is messy (why can some people see the demon-woman and others can't? What does the hypnosis scene have to do with anything else? And - SPOILER - as someone else already mentioned, how can you defeat a demon simply by breaking a mirror???). Leif Garrett gives a narcoleptic performance that matches the director's funereal pace perfectly. In short, this is yet another horror film that you'll have completely forgotten two hours after seeing it. (*1/2)
