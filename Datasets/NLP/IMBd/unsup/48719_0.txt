I did not like this film at all. Very romantic Cuban style movie, without any edge at all. The fact that the maker of this film was allowed to make it and leave Cuba with the tapes, tells it all. This movie smells Cuban propaganda.<br /><br />All the people have their problems, but all in all its really not much to talk about. You see a quite well functioning Havanna, where people actually work and looks forward. Do they? i cannot remember seeing that many people work at the same time, when i visitede the country in 98..<br /><br />I don't say that all films like this have to be critical to the system, but when you make a film about this many Cubans i find it very strange not to include at least one person who dreams about: another government,democracy, freedom of speech, to be able to travel, to read what he/she wants...the list goes on...a person with dreams like these is not hard to find in Havanna. OK there was this guy who went to Miami, but i bet even Fidel was not insulted after seeing that scene.<br /><br />I gave it 2 points because of the great photo shots.<br /><br />Its a sin to use porn like music in a film about a country with a music tradition as strong as the Cuban.
