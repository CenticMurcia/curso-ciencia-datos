It was torture watching the movie. This was not in Vietnam, it was in Thailand. The "Vietnamese" actors were Thai. When the "Vietnamese" police told Beckett to put down the gun, they were speaking Thai, not Vietnamese. If you want to make a movie, make it genuine. I'm white myself but it's giving off the exact stereotype white people have on Asian people.<br /><br />This is what Cynthia Alvarenga from Burbank, California wrote:<br /><br />"I liked the casting choices. Of course Tom Berenger is the perfect actor but John Doman, Denis Arndt, William Duffy and especially Byron Mann were convincing in their characters. The Vietnamese cast and crew were phenomenal. I liked the very well-written story, no loose ends. All the information that was told in the story was used with it's conclusions. I like the location choices in Vietnam. I loved the music (WOW). There was a Southeast Asian theme but not over the top stereotypical. The music was hip and matched the screens of the movie. I like the cinematography. The lighting at the dock with Quan and the informant, spooky. Great job, really !!"<br /><br />Listen, Cynthia: take off your blind fold. This just shows how uneducated you are and your stereotype doesn't contribute anything to this world. You need to get a sense of what's a good movie and what's a bad movie because you are completely lost. I feel sorry for people like this lady.
