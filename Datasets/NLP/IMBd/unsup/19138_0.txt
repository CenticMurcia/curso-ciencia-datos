OK,this is a resume of the entire movie,because this movie is probable one of the worst movies ever seen,not for his special effects it for his awful script.. i resume:this movie is about the NATO mission in kosovo,its about a soldiers of Spanish engineers corp., the film start whit him trying to rescue a Serb hostage,but wen he arrives,he don't shot he see how the hostage is executed with a plastic bag but he don't do anything,he is hitting by a weaponless mens and have more brainless scenes, 1ºIn the mission and stupid french commander decided to shot some kosovars refugees,(but kosovars militants of elk were the NATO allies). 2ºbefore lost 4 strikers and all the convoy,the rest of the Spanish platoon decided to continue the mission(wow,they are lost,are 10 soldiers,within trucks,radios,food and radio and the mission is in a village taken by serbs militians,) 3ºin the road to the village they see a car with more kosovar allies,but they decided to left the road and run across a mined field,genius,then they lost a soldier... 4ºwhen they arrive to village they are easily captured by militiants,(the reason they never use his machine guns) 5ºFinally the kosovars retakes the village using the Spaniards stykers,and some of the Spaniard soldiers escapes to the outskirts and kill a pacific famer,and eating the food like animals... awful movie,its more like "what don't do in a battlefield
