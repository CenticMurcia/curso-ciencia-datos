I found this movie very entertaining. Although it was an action film I found the humor hilarious. <br /><br />It's no Tarantino, but I loved the dark humor in the movie and the fact that nothing went right for our hero throughout. <br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this movie for a rental. Just bare in mind that it's not a comedy, but it's also not a total shoot em up. Like I said, this is no Tarantino, but if you like Quentin's movies I think you'll like this one. This movie started strong for me, maybe compared to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (minus the drugs) meets the second half of True Romance (they even throw in a hot blonde to sauce up the mix). This movie has a good mix of characters. From the rugged hero, to the righteous hit-man, and a slew of other crazy individuals met by Boomer along the way.
