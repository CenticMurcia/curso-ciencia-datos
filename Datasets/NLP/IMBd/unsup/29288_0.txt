Pretty Cool Movie Well after hearing Trina's albums and being a big fan of course I went out to rent her 1st movie, and hearing her talk about how its important to practice abstenance was the only way to stop the men from violence blew my mind. This movie was mad cute, it is based an a story of Greek mythology and takes place in the hood of Miami. Trina place Alicia a girl who wants to end the street violence and make their home safe. This is actually quite a positive movie and Trina shows great skills in acting. The only thing keeping this movie from more stars is a couple minor actors really are bad at acting...but Trina and the rest of the majors are really good. These movie is very sexual and funny, A must have for any Trina fan.
