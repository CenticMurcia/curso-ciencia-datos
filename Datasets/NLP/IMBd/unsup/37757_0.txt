If you happen to be inebriated or just love B-Rated movies in general though there are fares that are far more worthy in this genre and you don't have to be drunk to enjoy them i.e. Phoenix the Warrior or anything with Loren Avedon, Cynthia Rothrock etc, etc.<br /><br />Still, despite the horrendous acting, the butchering of the story and characters, and D-grade special effects, they did get some of the set pieces right so I guess we know where the budget went.<br /><br />In the end however, for any fan of the original anime/manga series it is a must see if for no other reason than to contribute to the ongoing littering of the internet with inane conversation threads ...<br /><br />BTW, for an equally 'entertaining' fare, check out the "ThunderCats" trailer made by some fan-people (I think) that's floating around the internet. So bad, it's a blast!
