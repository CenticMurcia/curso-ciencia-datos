I really liked "Lola rennt", but I loved "23". The plot is fascinating, the music is great, the cast is gorgeous. While telling the story, the movie takes you back into the 80s. August Diehl as Karl Koch does an outstanding performance. After watching "23", you'll ask yourself if there is really an international conspiracy going on. Nearly every time you hear or see this number, you'll think "What if it was true?". A must see. 10 points.
