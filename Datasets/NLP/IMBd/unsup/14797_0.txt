This is by far one of the best Hindi movies ever made, in my opinion. The acting is superb, and this is probably one of Preity's better movies. All the actors give a very moving performance. This movie can make you laugh and cry all at the same time, and the storyline isn't the same old things you see in Bollywood films. The main reason I like this film is because it contains modern elements in it. Its set in NY, and its has Western culture blended into it also. Being a teenager living in the US, I personally enjoy being able to relate to the movies I watch and I don't really like movies that are too traditional. I think if you like modernized Hindi movies you'll love this movie. Even if you don't, its most definitely worth watching.
