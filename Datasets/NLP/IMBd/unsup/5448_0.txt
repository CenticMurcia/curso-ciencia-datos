This is a good low budget straight-forward exorcism movie. Low budget movies have improved considerably recently and this movie shows it. It looks good, has some good special effects and a decent story. The acting is excellent all around with fresh and realistic dialogue. The lovely Erica Roby is a revelation in the role of the possessed Gail. She is such a natural beauty. The movie hinges on her performance and she does a fine job in representing the various stages of a tormented teen girl. The various priests as well as the psychiatrist also do a good acting job. This movie is surprisingly entertaining considering the limitations in filming almost the entire movie in a house. Definitely worth a look.
