I would imagine that most people will go and see this film because Matrix was sold out (do studios deliberately do this ie. release dreadful films at the same time as guaranteed big sellers of a similar genre?). Anyway, I think this is the worst film I have ever seen. It is full of unexplained elements: where did the virus come from? Why was the tug boat out in the middle of a typhoon? etc The "plot" was paper thin, extremely poorly acted, the scriptwriter should be shot, the only shocks came from loud noises, there was no dramatic tension built up - the end of the film was always going to be simply when they got off the ship: there was nothing to "figure out" (like in Alien): no moral ambiguities were presented (like in The Fly): and there was no deadline to beat (a crude, but at times successful plot device). The film could and should have ended much earlier. Donald Sutherland (especially) and Jamie Lee Curtis (to some extent) - hang your heads. This is the turkey of your careers.
