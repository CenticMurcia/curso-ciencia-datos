I'm not sure why people were so venomous about the acting and the storyline of this movie. I thought, given the situation of "Blake and Francis," that if this were a real set of Siamese twins, there would not be a lot to feel giddy about. I liked it. I thought it was original and really makes one stop and evaluate his/her own life. We are darn lucky to be whole and healthy. We'd have no idea what it'd be like to be joined together having to try and live a normal life. My congratulations to the Polish brothers. Outstanding work, boys. If either actor had shown a variety of emotions, it would have been totally unrealistic. I know I'd not be happy if I had to drag someone around knowing she'd die before I. The critics of this film need to stop and think before they make cruel comments. I lost my sister, and she was not a my Siamese twin, but she was my best friend, and since her death, I've been gloomy. But like Francis said, "Every story has a happy ending...it's just been untold." That's my life right now. Good movie, Michael and Mark.
