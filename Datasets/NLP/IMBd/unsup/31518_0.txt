This was my favourite film I saw at the Calgary International Film Festival this year. It was amazing.<br /><br />"Gloomy Sunday" delivers in all aspects of world cinema. The plot is intriguing and keeps your attention. It is an interesting story.<br /><br />That along with great performances from Joachim Król and Erika Marozsán make this film even more worth seeing. The location of Budapest is beautiful, the camera work is great; the film had comedy, action, suspense and thrills all wrapped up into one. Something for everyone. I am definitely looking foreword to Rolf Schübel upcoming film "Blueprint". I'm sure we'll see more of what we got in "Gloomy Sunday", which is exactly what cinema needs.<br /><br />Rolf Schübel's "Gloomy Sunday" 9/10
