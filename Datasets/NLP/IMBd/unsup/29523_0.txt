This was a great movie. I love movies of the week and watch them all of the time. I liked the idea of the family needing to feel safe so they move to the gated community. We all wonder what it would be like to live in that type of neighborhood. And, don't we all dread that one neighbor who just HAS to be everyone's friend?! LOL. I really enjoyed Alexandra Paul too. She always delivers a good performance. She had great chemistry with the leading man as well. I thought the female villain was SO well done. She was creepy and hilarious all at once. The actress was perfectly cast! If you are a big movie watcher like I am, you have got to see this one. It seemed to have it all. It was suspenseful, fun and the acting was also good. I wish we could see more movies like this one!
