Colombian dream is probably the best Colombian movie ever done, especially Felipe Aljure's wonderful direction and very original screenplay makes this movie a must if you want to know about new styles and concepts about Colombian movie. Since Maria Full of Grace which was released in 2003 but being half Colombian half American I haven't seen a so well done Colombian story. This movie is far apart of the way other directors tell a story about drugs and social problems that are part of the costumbrism and black movie style made in Colombia's cinematography but which is also part of Colombia's reality. Even though the young leading actors still have a lot to learn the movie has extraordinary supporting actors and also very good film editing and sound editing.
