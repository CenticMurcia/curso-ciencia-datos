What a disappointment! This film really doesn't honour its title or the original movie where it's based. The main topic of the plot is similar to the original, but all the rest is terribly different, on a bad way! The first 45 minutes are not so bad, but after the point where LUTHER (one of the robbers) becomes a vampire it really goes down! The plot ends right there, because it turns just into a "killing vampire festival" with awful special effects and no great interest, at least for me! But worse than the low quality special effects was that cheap imitation of PSYCHO's bathtub killing scene! Yes, the famous scene of PSYCHO is imitated but this time the killer is a bat! Ridiculous! <br /><br />The links to the original film are very small and insignificant. The major one is when LUTHER goes to the "Titty Twister" Bar and becomes a vampire, but even that one was terribly short and spoiled.<br /><br />Besides, there're some humoured wannabe lines that just end being very stupid, like that one near the end: "  Tell me something Buck. What the hell were vampires doing robbing a bank?  You got me! I supposed vampires need money, just like anybody else!". Of course I was wondering myself why they still want robbing the bank after they become vampires (LUTHER and Jesus). I found it a bit absurd, they still want the money; but that "explanation", even trying to be humorous, is really ridiculous and unnecessary! <br /><br />Overall, I was expecting something much better! I have to say it has a nice soundtrack though, especially in the first 45 minutes.
