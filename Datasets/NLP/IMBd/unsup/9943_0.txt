Every new years day 14:10pm it's tradition that our whole family sits down in front of the TV and watch Ivanhoe. I just love this classic film of knights and virgins. The story is beautiful and the fights is great. it's a real treat if you are like me a fan of medieval story's. A fun scene i never will forget is when Robin Hoods priest Tuck punch king Richard the Lionheart right in the mouth, not knowing who he is. A great moment for me was when i in a Dungeuns and dragon game meeting stole Sam Neils Line after i was challenged by another knight. "Prepare your self then. Look the last upon the sun!" If you like Anthony Andrews as Wilfred of Ivanhoe i recommend his Other TV movie The Scarlet Pimpanel.
