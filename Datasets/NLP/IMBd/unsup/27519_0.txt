Danger Island is TERRIBLE. In EVERY way. BUT! It is without a doubt the most entertaining film I've ever seen. The dialogue, the plot, the acting, the effects - GENIUS!!!! There are several suggestions ( plot points that are never explained, the montage of images during the end credits ) that this was a failed pilot to a TV series - if anyone's listening, MAKE IT HAPPEN!!! Danger Island every week? HEAVEN!!!!!!<br /><br />Altogether now: Alone on a dangerous island, Frank's become a fishmonster! Alone on a dangerous island, Frank's become a fishmonster! FRANK! HE'S A FISHMONSTER!! ( etc. )
