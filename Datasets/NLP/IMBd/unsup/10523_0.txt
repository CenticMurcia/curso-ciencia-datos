Once in a while one is just moved. Moved into the picture, as though right alongside the characters, the action, the sound and the fury (of the war in Bosnia.) The dark odyssey of the soldier (Dennis Quaid) begins in tragedy--the death of his wife and son, whom he has been neglecting because of his military duties) in an alleged Muslim extremist cafe bombing--and leads him on a rocky, suspenseful chase to redemption. On the way he works as an assassin/sniper for the Foreign Legion, and as a mercenary-sniper for the Serbs. He commits cold blooded murder regularly, hard-heartedly, until he shoots a peasant teenage boy. This is his turning point. His conscience seems to reinvent itself. He intervenes in the savage beating of a pregnant woman, delivers her child, and thus begins the redelivery of himself into renewed morality and humanity. An important part of the journey of the baby girl, the mother, and the wounded "savior" is the effective and affecting portrayals of these characters by Quaid and the (I think Serbian actress) young woman. She has been cast out by her family and is very reluctant to accept the child or Quaid. The story moves along a perilous road with many painfully tense--and unpredictable event (not a cliche in the picture, unless one thinks beautiful babies and weeping rescuers is maudlin--moments and tragic scenes. I don't think this film is well know in the states; what a pity. I don't think Quaid (and many fine European actors) garned awards and recognition for this film, I do think Mr. Quaid created one of the finest characters/performances I have seen in the movies. Of course it also turns out that this picture has revived (and unfortunate) significance today--since 9/11. Recommended at an 8 level from. . . jaime
