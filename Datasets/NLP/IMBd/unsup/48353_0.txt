Production house Amicus had a rich tradition in serving the so-called horror omnibuses. Long feature films telling three separate tales that mix humor and horror. The Monster Club was the last one and I can't really say I'm sorry for that. I didn't enjoy this film at all since it only has a few good moments and even those aren't highly memorable. Two absolute legends in the field provide the Monster Club with a silly wraparound story. John Carradine is a horror-author who donated a little bit of blood to vampire Vincent Price.this latter is so grateful for this that he takes Carradine to the 'Club' where the writer could find inspiration for upcoming horror stories. Let's start with the worst news first: the second story is really stupid and a complete waste of Donald Pleasance's horror talent. It's a very boring vampire-tale that's neither scary.nor funny. The first and last stories are watchable, yet the quality level never surpasses your average 'Tales from the Crypt' episode or something. The reasons why these fables are more or less interesting are because they introduce interesting variants on the common monsters. The protagonists are for example a Shadmock and a Humghoul! This last one is a result of sex between a ghoul and a human being! The gruesome make-up effects are limited and the direction is really crappy. Which is really surprising since Roy Ward Baker did a few outstanding directing jobs in the past. For instance, Dr. Jeckyll and Sister Hyde and Quartermass and the Pit for the Hammer Studio's. Vincent Price looks so tired and fed up that he almost becomes pitiful.yet he still manages to ramble a funny monologue near the end. The whole thing is completely ruined by bad (and too much) pop/rock music that form yet another connection between the stories. The only sequence that is really worth mentioning is a female stripper that goes all the way.and I do mean ALL the way.
