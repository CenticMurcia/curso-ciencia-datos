This film is apparently about the Jersey Devil, I say "apparently" because there is NO Jersey Devil in this film. In fact, I'm pretty sure that the Writers had no idea of what it was, they probably just liked the hockey team. Now I'm sure that some of you out there find this to be funny...it'll stop being funny after you sit through this turd. Nothing will be funny for at least two days after the viewing of this movie, you'll be that mad at yourself for watching the whole thing. What's it about? It's a "Blair Witch" type film, with worse acting, no real plot and not much in the money department. The film asks the question..."What happens when a group of indi film makers go into the woods to find a fictional beast?" Well I'll tell you exactly what happens...NOTHING. And not just nothing, 2 plus hours of nothing. Here's the spoiler, at the end of this very long and very boring documentary the film breaks the atmosphere of documentary by having the individual responsible for the deaths of the townsfolk kill the person who's making the documentary. Then it shows him stuffing the body in the trunk of the car and he drives away. They spend all but the last 3 minutes of the film trying so desperately to make you believe that this is a documentary and not just awful camera work and bad acting and then they throw that out the window with the "big twist". If there is a God, and after seeing this movie you'll really question that, he will "strike down with great vengeance and furious anger" those responsible for this turd that is so in need of flushing. Please, please, stay FAR FAR away.
