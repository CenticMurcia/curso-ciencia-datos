Oil industrialist Leonard Dawson had a 60th birthday on a cruise ship and his son Robert was making his day happy until a single bullet kills his boy. The man who killed him is Golgo 13 who is a mysterious hit-man who loves the ladies as he scores with them and goes out for some killing as being his choice of sport. Dawson vows revenge as he hires assassins and the FBI to go after Golgo 13 but can the unstoppable assassin live through all this ordeal? <br /><br />Very underrated cult Japanese animated action thriller based on the popular Japanese comics is a sensational one. This one isn't for the kids due to graphic bloody violence, scenes of sex with nudity and language but the film is very well animated and stylish. Sure the CGI in the climax is kind of laughable by today even though back then it was a little cheap and the storyline is very compelling as well as the old school type of animation here. The score is very good here that ranges from jazzy to more heartfelt even during the dramatic powerful climax.<br /><br />If your looking for an underrated Japanese animated diamond in the rough, check this one out.
