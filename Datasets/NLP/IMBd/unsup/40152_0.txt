Yeah, I know it was made for TV and it sure looks it. From the moment I saw the opening titles and heard the theme music, I knew I was in for a baaad movie. I'm talking real bad. Once again, I bought a used DVD movie based on the cover art and fake reviews. I didn't see the made for TV 3 point type or else I would've stayed away. (Silly me.) The special effects budget must've been extremely low 'cause the CGI was cartoonish and unconvincing. The acting was poor and the entire movie should be honored with a Golden Turkey award. A movie strictly for making fun of. This movie would even have offended Ed Wood's ethics of film making. Kraken, should be sunk in the cold deep waters of anonymity.
