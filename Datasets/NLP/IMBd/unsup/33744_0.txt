Spoiled pooch finds love and life with a kid who's dad is a fireman.<br /><br />How many times have we been there and done that? Low level family film is good for undemanding three or four year olds since odds are they're the only ones who won't have seen it all before. Not bad but why would anyone rationally (me included) subject themselves to the film? Okay the trailer looked okay, but as they say anyone can take 90 minutes of a movie and make it look good. As I said the problem is that unless you've been hiding under a rock you've seen this type of thing before. Add an unimaginative director and a cast that isn't spectacular and you have a movie that really isn't worth bothering with.
