Wally has a girlfriend, not a wife. This was a fantastic movie - not for the film budget or special effects or anything - but for the verbal content. Andre's stories make you think about how mundane life really can be. Though his cures for the mundane are quite exotic and unrealistic, they make you wonder what you can do different each day to appreciate the world around you. They make you think about ways to look at things differently. If you're an artist of any kind, some of these thoughts are priceless. I would recommend this movie to those who are interested in performance art, unconventional and experimental theatre, philosophers, intellects, etc.
