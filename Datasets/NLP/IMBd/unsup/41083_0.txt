This movie is a collectible for fans of classic films ,epecially German classic cinema. Since Kino on Video hasn't decide to release it in this country yet or time warner, they own the distribution rights of most of the classics of the U.F.A. library, you got to have a multi zone player and a converter that will detect all regions on your ntsc TV . This can be costly but its well worth it to play th euro version. If the American distribution is ever releases with subtitles, English, i'll be obligated to replace the German version as an American citizen. The story is changed form the original opera. Many of the songs were eliminated.It was turned into a light Viennese comedy with some music. In Germany ,in the 30's and 40', light Viennese comedies were popular on the cinema,like"The porch conscert",,1935,directed by Douglass Sirk.Well, Hitler was failing when this movie was being produce. So the expenses of the production probably and the lack of singing talent for many of the actors ,except Johanne Heesters, might of compelled the filmmakers to cut back. Now its a light Vienese comedy with some music. Whats really doesn't make any sense is that ,Marte Harrel, dyes her hair red to disguise herself to her husband , played by Heesters,. In reality your still going to recognize the same person. Why are the director of the ball living in the same place as Heesters and Harrell? Was it a duplex? Well its good any way.
