I still don't now if these twins are conjoined or not. Most say they are not. There performances were superb. No matter what, they are not freaks.<br /><br />They are two sensitive people trapped in the same body. I only wanted the very best for them. An empathy developed. <br /><br />It is sad that nature plays such downright dirty tricks. They were the nicest people around. It makes you want to help the less fortunate.<br /><br />I give this film 10 stars. I will see it again.
