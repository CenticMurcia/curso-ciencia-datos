This movie has definitely changed the map of the Egyptian movie making industry.Meaning, future makings should at least level up to half of what Marwan Hamed the promising director has produced. I will not repeat words like "Masterpiece" or " an Oscar winning Movie", but I fear that Marwan has produced a piece of work that should make him produce more of the same level. And that is the real challenge.<br /><br />I also feel that this daring story has opened the way or paved it for more creativity without the need to worry about censorship or limiting expressions. I am so happy to have seen so many taboos on the screen in order for the people to discuss and find solutions. Therefore, to share the problems of the Egyptians with the public through movies is also another challenge that the movie industry has to work on. <br /><br />I hope we see other competing directors who will force the audience to be totally engrossed in whatever they are watching.<br /><br />Eman Al Masri
