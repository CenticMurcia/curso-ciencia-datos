Well, if somebody asked me how did i like the movie I'd tell them I got disappointed because none of the "revelations" proved to be really moving (neither the history of Marcus, nor new facts on Skynet's creation) but on the other hand it's a nice contribution to the Terminator realm. Still, in its exquisiteness its closer to part 3 than 2 or 1. The main value that this movie presents lays mainly in the presentation of the postnuclear world. Obviously, Skynet's new gadgets have been introduced and they're rather interesting, though gaudy in some respects. The moment we learn Marcus is one of them our appetite increases immensely. Unfortunately, it only starts good to become really cheesy later on.
