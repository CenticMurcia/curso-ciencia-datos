How does this have a 5.5? This should at least have a 6.5. Its a hilarious movie. It's just like the comedy classic It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. The two movies are very similar. It's about racing, and it has an all-star cast. Some of the most talented people are in it, like Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, Mel Tillis, and more. It's like a big budget Love Boat. We are lucky to have movies like that. Not enough movies like this are made today. Everybody puts on a terrific show. Also, if you loved this movie and it's stellar array of stars, then you'll love the sequel. It has twice as many great stars, and it's just as good. See this movie.
