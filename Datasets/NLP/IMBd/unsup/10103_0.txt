I was really disappointed in this movie. Most thrillers will spend the first hour developing the characters, involving you in their story so when they are in danger you are frightened for them. You truly care for them and feel for what they go through. But not in this movie. Before the first hour is over, our heroine is already fighting for her life, and it would appear the story is about to come to an end. There was no real developing of a plot, and it made me think the writers were in the hall closet writing it as we watched. It feels rushed, and when we do meet the killer, we feel short changed.<br /><br />Candice Bergen should stick to comedy. She is not interesting in the role of victim, but comes across as bland, boring. I was actually rooting for the killer at times. There is way too much dialog at times and no one seems to know how to dial 911. It is not a movie I would recommend if you are looking for an on-the-edge-of-your-seat type thriller.
