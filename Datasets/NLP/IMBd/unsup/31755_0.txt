This movie shows that my strategy of knowing only stars and genre about a movie before seeing it, actually pays off. I just read somewhere that it got a prize for being the worst movie of 2007. I knew that it was just because LL got a bad press in middle America (which seems to be all America these days) so i decided to give it a go. I was a bit afraid to see a grown up LL, however. This is a good thriller. The story-line is a bit surprising at times, when you don't overthink it. Sure, if you really try and think about all the possibilities you will have figured it out before you've seen half the movie, but be honest: which movie has surprises for the seasoned movie goer?<br /><br />And while LL might have lost her Parent Trap appeal (the freckles, although this film shows that she still has some on her back) she can actually act. Most negatives here are cheap shots at LL's behaviour outside the film, or stock replies like bad-bad-bad or morons who went to see this expecting the gore from Saw and Hostel, I mean, how stupid can you get?<br /><br />I kinda hated Ormond though, I don't see why she had to speak in that awful accent.<br /><br />The only thing what was a bit disappointing was the actual identity of the killer. But hey, you can't have it all. And Lindsay shouldn't do stripper like roles with the reputation she's got. Now, if Alexis Bledel did it ...<br /><br />All in all good film in it's genre, and it's not afraid to break some genres along the way.
