For the viewer who was wondering where this movie was filmed: it was filmed on the campus of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. I can't say this film did much for me. As others had said it seemed to be padded out just to make it into a feature length movie. The long takes of following the stage tech wondering around backstage reminded me of the recent film "Elephant"(but to it's credit it did come 7 years before that film). The stuff with the sniper on the roof was interesting but even that could have been fleshed out more.The budget obviously showed but where it let the viewer down was long bits of nothing happening. A decent student film with some nice Steadicam work at the end but nothing more than that.
