Not really awful but one will always wonder what possessed the immensely talented Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy to make this film together. Maybe it was some sort of a deal or perhaps even a dare.<br /><br />It is immensely familiar to see the opposites in buddy comedy territory but usually there is some kind of twist (think: Lethal Weapon or the original Odd Couple). The difference is in this case is that none of the characters are suicidal.<br /><br />This is not to say that I didn't enjoy some of the moments in here. Levy is incredibly good at playing the nebbish and of course Jackson could do his part in his sleep. There is even a little scene that references some of Jackson's previous work with regards to him using the F-word like he had some kind of reverse V-chip installed within him.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a failed attempt. Even the villain is not all that evil. He seems rather pleasant, except for the fact that he is involved in criminal activity.<br /><br />So, if you absolutely don't have anything else to do, watch this. You will not die laughing but you will be mildly entertained.
