If you think of the main villain as Elmer Fudd, this movie becomes much more funny.<br /><br />So essentially, you have this small New Mexico town, where the local police department takes no notice of the fact that dozens of strippers from the local strip clubs vanish without a trace. In fact, the part of the movie that is about the one rogue cop who tries to catch the real killer is so irrelevant to the plot that I'm not even sure why they included it.<br /><br />THe main part is about the hunter dude who decides that he would rather hunt strippers than deer. That is of course, after he rapes them. (Tastefully shown with a cut-away.) <br /><br />The heroine of the movie is show as a innocent girl who is tricked into stripping and prostitution. Of course. We wouldn't feel any sympathy for her if she CHOSE to be a prostitute. She is stripped naked and forced to run from the crazy hunter who goes after her with a crossbow until she actually proves too resilient, and he switches to a long range hunting rifle. After running past enough strategically placed branches and cropped camera shots, she finds some clothes to finish the movie in.<br /><br />Of course, the strip club in the movie is laughable. If the writer had spent any time in a real strip club, it might have increased the cost of this movie to a whole $61.00.<br /><br />Not to say it wasn't totally without merit. There was some snappy dialog and some interesting scenes. But most of it was repetitive.
