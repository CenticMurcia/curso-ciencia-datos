If you don't have anything to do and you really love to see bad movies without a red line. Well I still wouldn't recommend this. Some movies are so bad that you can laugh at them. But this is so bad you'd probably be more likely to become a serial killer before likening this movie. this is a movie that has OK effects which is sad on such a bad movie. I think it's a waste of space in the video-stores..<br /><br />Sh*t-planet is a more soothing name for this so called movie.. I would probably recommend it to my wurst enemy...<br /><br />What ever you do don't watch this movie.. it's not only the wurst Science fiction ever seen it's also the wurst movie ever...
