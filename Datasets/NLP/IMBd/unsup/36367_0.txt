Why would anyone take the story of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and then slap on the title of Friday the 13th???? I've seen the original Friday the 13th movie and all of its sequels of the 1980's, and even the worst sequel of this bunch is far superior than this 2009 remake. They should have called this movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.<br /><br />Why is this movie so horrible? First and foremost, they tried to show a "different" side of Jason. That was my biggest turn-off in this remake. The Jason in this movie is something of a calculated hunter who keeps people chained up in his basement. The original Jason would've never been like that. Period. The original Jason was a cold and inhuman killer - you simply could not understand his motives because he was so evil and inhuman. He was a killing machine that never stopped and never toyed with his victims. He was a brutal monster. The new remade Jason is more "human" and less threatening, less scary. He essentially becomes a backwoodsman who doesn't like people on his turf.<br /><br />Secondly, the cast is too Dawson-Creekish for me. I like stupid teenagers getting sliced and diced in slasher movies, but these young actors and actresses really pile on the unnecessary drama amongst themselves and have too much of a social and political conscience. As if we care who they are. It's like the cast of a Scream movie decided to camp out and end up bumping into a territorial hunter in a hockey mask.<br /><br />Third, where did all that sex come from??? Since when did Friday the 13th turn into porn? I like nudity sprinkled into my slashers, but the amount of nudity and sex in this movie really makes you wonder just why in hell so much energy was put into the movie in the first place. I still haven't figured out if they really intended on making a slasher or a porn - the sex and nudity far outweigh the gore.<br /><br />If you're going to do a remake, do a freaking remake. Don't continue the story with a whole set of new characters and an entirely different plot. I was hoping to see a remake and instead I get a sequel 2009 style. Only this sequel is by far the worst made and should not at all bear the title of Friday the 13th.<br /><br />My recommendation - rent this remake if you want to see a movie that resembles nothing like the original. You're actually better off just watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
