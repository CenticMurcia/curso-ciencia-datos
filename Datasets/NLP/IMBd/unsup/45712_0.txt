I am more than disappointed with this movie to say the least. I remember being first in line at my local movie theater at the opening day for this one. After months of previews the day had finally arrived. My anticipation level was even higher than for The Crying Game 2 (which still has yet to be produced). So I get my box of raisinettes (which are wonderful mixed with popcorn I must say. I know its a strange combination, but it really works. Whats strange is that I have tried this at home and its never as good. I think it must be the "butter flavored topping" that only a movie theater can provide. Im sorry Orville, but you have a ways to go. I was thinking of possibly purchasing my own popcorn popping machine, just as they have at my local movie theater, but I cannot afford that at this time. I was saving up money to spend on this online auction of Pauly Shore memorabilia. The flip-flops he wore in Encino Man are up to $476! wow! Maybe next year.) and I sit down in the theater. 2 hours later I walk out very disappointed. There were no love scenes what so ever! The trailers were totally alluding to 9 1/2 Weeks type sex scenes with the two stars. Instead it turned out to be this hokey comedy. To be honest, I was expecting full frontal nudity and everything. If I wanted to see a comedy, I would have gone to see Too Wong Fu or something.<br /><br />So yeah. Don't watch this pile of dung!
