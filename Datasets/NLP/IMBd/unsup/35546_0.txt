This movie is wrong. The reason that the crew members' names are incorrect is because a Hollywood lawyer advised that they not use their real names in order to avoid being sued. That was a good idea. Take the co-pilot for example: if the real co-pilot, Jim Verinis, had really acted the way he did in the movie, he would most certainly have been charged with insubordination. As for the lax security, which allowed people to have sex in the airplane... I do not comprehend the previous reviews which included comments about "stunning acting", "brilliant", and "the best war movie". Did they happen to see the film? As for the quote "This movie will move even the most stoic of viewers", all I can say is, move the most stoic of viewers to what? Sarcastic laughter?
