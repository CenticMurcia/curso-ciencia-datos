I guess when this was made the director, Antonio Bido, was making a rather valiant attempt to follow in Dario Argento's footsteps. He does manage to succeed on some levels but fails at others. The music in this (by Trans Europa Express) is very much like that of Goblin from Argento's films, and it sounds hauntingly familiar, as in it was lifted almost entirely from "Deep Red" if it's not the same exact music. There's even an attempt to capture Argento's stylishness, but that fails because the film is rather murky and almost grainy at times, unlike the crystal clear work of Argento. Still though, this isn't a bad film, although it's rather typical Italian stuff where you have to pay attention because otherwise you can't keep track of the players without a score card. It begins with a man killed in a pharmacy and a woman who accidentally witnesses the murder and then of course, she's a target. But there are other targets too, and they're all linked to something that happened many years ago, and it's seemingly a series of revenge killings. Overall it's not bad, it's just not top notch stuff. 7 out of 10, recommended for those who like Argento and don't mind "wanna-be's".
