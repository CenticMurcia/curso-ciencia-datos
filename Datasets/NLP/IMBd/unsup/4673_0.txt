-Great story and amazing voice work <br /><br />-Mr. Frieze lives peacefully in Antarctica with a small Inuit boy. He stays there because it's the only place his body can survive without his clunky suit. He spends his time fishing then looks for a way to cure his wife who lives in a frozen state. One day a group of scientist accidentally destroys his home and his wife's protective chamber, they figured no one would be crazy enough to live in such cold condition. However, they figure wrong and trigger Mr. Frieze to go back to his old menacing ways by dawning on his suit and going to Gotham to find an old friend to help bring his wife back to good health. Meanwhile back in Gotham Batman and Robin are busy protecting the city whiles their alter egos maintain a normal life of parties and work. Frieze eventually finds his friend and he tells him that his wife needs a transplant, they find an unwilling donor and she happens to be batgirl's alter ego. Batman and robin find out and soon have to go and rescue her from Mr. Frieze.<br /><br />-Unlike its live action movie counter part, this is a well made movie with intelligent characters. Mr. Frieze isn't a clich√© bad guy that wants to take over the world or destroy Gotham for that matter. He just wants to find a cure for his wife and is willing to do whatever it takes to cure her. Batman is a smart detective that uses fear to get what he wants and Robin is techno savvy sidekick that does more than deliver lame punch lines. The only thing this movie shares with the live action version might be that they both have excellent scores. Shirley Walker used Elfman's theme in this one and used it well, she also created her own themes and did a great job of not letting the music get too loud but rather score the emotions that the characters are feeling.<br /><br />-This is a great movie and what Warner brothers should have made instead of that dog crap called "Batman and Robin". If you can forgive its short length then you'll really enjoy this movie <br /><br />Kevin Conroy has the coolest voice ever
