Jason Priestley as box office draw? Get real! If his "career" hadn't already been dead, this "effort" definitely would have killed it.<br /><br />The story here is that of three childhood buddies and their infatuation with Marilyn Monroe, told in flash backs. Nice 1950s & 60s "Americana", complete with golden oldie tunes, fashions, movie clips, cars and other period gimmicks. Other than the "time travel" perks, there's not much to see.<br /><br />A perpetually cigarette-smoking, baby-faced Priestly becomes annoying. The "tough guy" image of his character reminds us of the equally unbelievable Prince in "Purple Rain". This is no "Stand By Me", so be prepared for a disappointment.
