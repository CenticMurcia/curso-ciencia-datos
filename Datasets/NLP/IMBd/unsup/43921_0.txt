I had a chance to see this picture way before it's release date many times. Each time I felt as if it was never ending. Slow without pace or substance. I felt no chemistry between any of the actors and wonder if Jamie Fox or Colin Farrell would ever do another picture together it was as if they had a lack of chemistry between them. Although the academy award winning cinematographer is well known. The look of the picture was very flat with no depth or color. Shot digital only no film was used. I had the feeling I was watching a video game. Overall Li Gong tried hard with her acting part in the movie. But I could not feel the energy coming from her or Colin Farrell even when it came from the love scenes. sorry but I give this one 1 out of 10.
