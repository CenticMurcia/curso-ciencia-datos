I expected this movie to show the American (Todd) as a jerk. Well, he certainly had his jerkish moments, but he was portrayed as a decent guy underneath. I expected this movie to show an American stereotype of India, and the American has to ride in and save the day. But instead of this movie's "India" being full of American clich√©s, the screenplay was filled with all sorts of little things that only a native or a long-time visitor would know about. I know nothing about India, and so I can't judge the screenplay's accuracy, but I spotted no bias or hidden agenda.<br /><br />When I was a teenager, my family was stationed in Japan, and this movie brought back memories. When I was a teen, there was a moment when I "got it" that the Japanese people and their culture were worthy of respect, even though the Japanese "think weird." I'm glad that they showed a similar moment for Todd (the hamburger-brander scene).<br /><br />And the movie was hilarious, on many different levels. The Holi scenes were _inspired_.
