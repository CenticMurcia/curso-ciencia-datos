This is, by far, the best Farrelly Brothers comedy to date. Few comedies can maintain the kind of comedic stamina and brilliance that Dumb & Dumber does from its title to the credits. It has just the right combination of innocence and absurdity to make it funny. What is most enjoyable about this film are the numerous and precious one-liners--from John Deere letters to generalizations about senior citizens--it provides so many opportunities to laugh.
