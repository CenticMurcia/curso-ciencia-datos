If it hadn't got caught up in the political rhetoric of the time. The propaganda of Russia - bad - and "freedom" - good - is so caricaturized, it is reminiscent of the awfully silly musical movie the main characters are producing in the film. Sometimes the music and dancing can save such a movie, but this one contains mostly snoozers and losers. The cast does a good deal for the picture, but they can't save it.
