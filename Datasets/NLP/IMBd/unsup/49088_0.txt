Has a number of scenes that easily meet requirements to be spoofed by MST3K. Best example: Landau throws a child-like temper-tantrum in the control center, threatening not to come back until he has full control of the goings-on. Plus, a lot of the dialog is simplistic, cartoon-like, i.e. not very realistic at all. There are a number of fallacies and absurd situations: 1) Connery says the 5-mile meteor will have the power of 250,000,000 tons of TNT (or 250,000?); either way that would be an understatement. But okay; I'm nit-picking, 2) Less nit-pickingish is calling the potential impact (only!) ten times stronger than the strongest earthquake; it's more like a million times stronger, 3) It's impossible to redirect a meteor when it's only days away from impact (again, nit-picking, or maybe they didn't know that then - though I doubt that), 4) it isn't possible to destroy a meteor that big (and that fast) with a series of nuclear hits, 5) One of the space centers only discover a big one going towards NY when it's just minutes away from impact! What were they doing, sleeping? 6) And does it have to hit NY of all places? Why do these meteors and asteroids always aim for the well-known cities? 7) It should have been more devastating; they showed it's impact to be more like that of a huge earthquake than a meteor, 8) the absurdity that governments would actually think about politics when the future of the entire planet is at stake - and that they actually need convincing that warheads need to be used?! The film is also quite slow.
