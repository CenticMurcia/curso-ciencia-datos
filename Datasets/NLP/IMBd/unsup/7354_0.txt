This games cover made it look like an extremely well done game. Add to that a nice opening sequence as invaders have come to destroy earth and some of earth's mightiest heroes have already fallen. In the end it disappoints with to much focus on the Imperfects and not enough on the marvel characters especially in the end. I like to be able to play a game without inviting the gang over to play and as a single player game this one will keep you entertained for a bit, but not over the long haul. The fighting is easy to pick up and I love the fact that the characters are not the same strength, but why such a limited number of characters? Sure we get Spider-man, Wolverine, Venom, Daredevil and more to choose from, however the marvel universe is so expansive you could have had twice the number of marvel characters and still had the three they choose to knock out of action early. This game could have won me over also with multiple endings, but it doesn't go the only route that could have saved it. Instead the ending rushes at you with one lame character you have to win with...why not have it so you decide who win's the game and save the day? That would have given this game so much more reply value. In the end an okay fighter with some of your favorite marvel characters and some new characters who often mirror one of the marvel ones.
