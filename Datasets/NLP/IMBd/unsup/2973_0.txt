I DO enjoy this show-it's low key and many of the recipes sound great. The only problem: unless you have a ton of time, you can't put these together in a pinch, not to mention the money most of these will cost. But, if you do, you're sure to enjoy it. One example of a minor "flaw": some of her bake sale items are way too complicated or upscale for us lesser folks. More highbrow than some of the other Foodnetwork fare, it is nonetheless a good fit and well worth a look, even if it's in a longing, "I wish I could do /afford that" mode. In summary, it's probably in league with Emeril as it would appear to be a program for the more sophisticated cook with the before mentioned time and cash at one's discretion.
