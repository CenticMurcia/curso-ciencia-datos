I can only regret that I invested some money in this film! I've seen many bad ones, but this one is one of the worst films ever it is just so meaningless, brain dead and badly done! First of all the acting is embarrassing, especially the arty couple is horrendously bad, even worse than average actors in a student film  especially the woman! The main character comes across as a rather big and stupid bloke, but not someone you bother engaging with. His girlfriend is probably the one that gives the best performance (if you can talk about that) but you hardly notice her About the technical side of the film there is nothing special to remark, except the direction of the camera is very student film look a like and simple, but what frustrates me most as the viewer is the story. Because the story is absolutely meaningless, which becomes more and more obvious as it develops also the "real life" killing footage is absolutely tasteless, especially because it is advertised so strongly on the front of the DVD cover No wonder the critics walked out during the screening in Cannes  (I don't think it was because of this films "controversial" qualities)  rather the embarrassment that a film like this could reach Cannes!!! A last remark I would like to make with regards to Cold Fish is the question of who would make a film like this and do it so badly? And why, since the film is originally from 2001, would he or she want to send it out on DVD again in 2005! Are these people completely without any sense of direction and just wanting to make as much money as possibly  if so please change profession because it doesn't look like you have anything to give with regards to films
