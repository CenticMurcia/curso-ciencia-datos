I am a Chinese but I don't understand this movie at all. This is such a typical point of view about Chinese living in America. I don't know, but is it possible that some director can make a movie about those Chinese who are better educated. Because from what I know, also lots of Chinese who graduated from Chinese college also live a descent life in US, I am not sure if you guys have seen the movie "Push Hand" by directed by An Lee, that's something for real.<br /><br />The people this story described, is someone who also live a poor life even in China, they struggled here in China and then with nothing to give up, they went to USA for a so called American Dream. that's something I really read from this movie.<br /><br />this movie is just too negative to watch.
