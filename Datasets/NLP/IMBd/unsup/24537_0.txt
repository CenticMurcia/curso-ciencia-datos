Based on the comics, the movie X-Men, while there are many important characters, follows Marie a.k.a. Rogue and Logan a.k.a Wolverine, who discover Professor Xavier and his "X-Men" as Logan labels them (Scott a.k.a. Cyclops, Jean Grey, Ororo a.k.a Storm), who help them after an accident. However, they soon discover that the Brotherhood, led by Magneto (or Erik), plans on using them for a scheme, which he tested on a Senator first. I think everyone's good, but it's always hard when there's at least two Oscar winners, two Shakespearian actors and some other awards winners.<br /><br />If you like action films (which I do), this is a definite must-see.
