only good thing about this movie was Bradley because i connected with him and i feel like him most of the time, though maybe not quite as nice lol. Morgan freeman was good as always but the movie itself didn't really have any kind of message. i gave it 2 stars for those 2 actors. everyone else was lame. it wasn't like Rocky or something where it had a inspirational message of if you try hard enough you can beat the odds, go the distance etc. this like the OP, this seemed to be like don't get married which is stupid, Hollywood likes to make it seem like EVERYONE is cheating on everyone else. thats not true, most normal ppl do stay together for quite a while. and not everyone who is married is cheating on there spouse. i hated that radha Michelle, she frig-gin played him so bad and then left him for that other cheating mofo, it was like wtf that guy slapped her and was also a cheater. so what was the point of that, a cheater can trust another cheater? stupid. but when Bradley met that doctor i was no way, most doctors are NOT nice and pretty like that, that was so Hollywood "chance" meeting right there. i was expecting a different kind of movie, like more romantic not this super depressing nihilistic crap. and whats with movies these days showcasing "city hall" weddings and not getting married in the holy church? stuff like that bugs me to no end. even Indiana Jones got married in a church, but not other "real life" type movies? another thing i didn't like was how loose everyone was, i mean seriously you meet someone for 2 seconds and boom, your in bed with cm on? MAKING A SEX TAPE WITH THEM??? OK, i think they doomed each other with taking advice from a slutty goth chick. ugh, this movie was so stupid, my brain hurts from the lameness.
