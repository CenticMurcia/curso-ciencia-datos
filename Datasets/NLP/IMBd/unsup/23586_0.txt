This 1990 classic puts us in the middle of the Irish mafia in New York's Hells Kitchen. This masterpiece tells the story of old friendships, different perspectives on life, betrayal, loyalty, and the destruction of the self. Sean Penn delivers a strong performance here, as does Ed Harris and Gary Oldman. This is overall a truly emotional and violent roller-coaster of what happens when friends grow and and the repercussions of what that means, be it good or bad. A must see for Penn/Oldman fans, and any drama film fanatic.
