This movie was pretty darn awful. Brooke Shields' acting was, while commendable for your average twelve-year-old, uneven, to be kind. I expect better than animated whining from Susan Sarandon - really, one of her less well-thought-out roles. The only person who managed to convey the nature of his character was Keith Carradine. The acting was painfully wooden on the part of the supporting characters, especially the Madam, Frances Faye (oy geveult!). I don't understand how Louis Malle, writer and director of _Au_Revoir_Les_Enfants_ could produce a film with such lackluster portrayals of potentially engrossing characters.<br /><br />So, for all of that, only the painterly direction of Mr. Malle and his willingness to look unflinchingly at something that turns most people's stomachs saves the film. Yes, it is disturbing to see Ms. Shields naked in sexual contexts, and performing and intimating acts that we try to keep the pubescent from even learning about in this country (USA). This is the beauty of the film, and its entire aesthetic reason to be.<br /><br />If you're offended by naked baby buttocks, sexually aware pre-teens, or horrific acting, don't see this movie. If you want a challenge to your moral standards, it's the perfect show for you. If you're neither of the above, wait until somebody else rents it, because it's not worth paying for.
