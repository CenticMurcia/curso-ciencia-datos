I was not expecting much of this movie. Unfortunately, I was not disappointed. This movie started out with a bad script. And the direction was very poor. I have read the English adaptation of the original play by Giradoux and I have seen the musical "Dear World" based on the stage play. Too many characters were added to the screenplay, and too much dialog was removed. The director wasn't sure whether it was a drama or a comedy or a tragedy or a farce. Or maybe he thought it was all of the above. I watched it with someone who did not know the story and she was totally lost. Hopefully this will not make it onto DVD. I can't imagine any company wasting the money on such a project.
