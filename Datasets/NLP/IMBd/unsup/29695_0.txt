Those who have not seen Fred Durst in action need to see this excellent movie under his direction. The movie is so moving and Fred has perfected every scene. The actors and crew acquired a great respect for Fred's hard work on this film.<br /><br />The talent performed by the wonderful actors in this movie will make each a household name. I was blown away at their ability to captivate the audience and hold everyone's attention to the end of the movie.<br /><br />People laughed, cried, and gasped during the premier and I didn't see anyone go for refreshments during the film. That should tell everyone how exciting it was! Thank you for allowing me to express my views on this premier. If you haven't seen it, write into your movie theaters and demand it be shown. It is worth it!
