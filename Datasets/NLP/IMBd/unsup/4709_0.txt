It's amazing to me what some people will say about movies and most of it doesn't make sense. I bought this movie because it had a very beautiful woman who 4 years later land a usage role in a classic TV show. Robert Stack plays the role of Captain Larkin, Hugh O'Brien plays the role of Detective Daniel Myerson, and the beautiful young women was Farrah Fawcett majors who played the role of Karen White. This was your typical airplane movie where it took about 15 minutes or more to set up everybody roles that would occur on the flight 502. After the jumbo jet takes off Captain Larkin gets a radio call from security in New York City. First, a box was found in the first class section that security thought it was a bomb that turned out to be a smoking jack in the box. Next security finds a note in the lounge with an ominous message left by a passenger threatening to kill some of the passengers. At first, it is thought to be a sick joke, but soon a man posing as a priest and a flight attendant are killed. It is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases. All and all the weasel gives this movie 8 star. As far as Farrah Fawcett Majors goes, she did a great job at being the flight attendant in charge.
