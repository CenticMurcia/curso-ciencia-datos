I've always loved everything that Cary Grant has done, and this is no exception. A fast-paced, well-written and witty script does more than just show off the three main actors, Grant, Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple, it gives some of the funniest lines to the supporting cast. <br /><br />Despite it's highly predictable plot, it isn't the outcome that kept me watching, but the wonderful witty script and comic timing. I understand that the behind the scenes tension, secondary to Ms. Loy being accused of a communist by McCarthy, was thick. But you would never guess it. The actors appear to be thoroughly, and genuinely enjoying themselves. <br /><br />And it's that obvious pleasure that oozes out of the screen and into the audience. More than once, I caught myself laughing out loud. Definitely one to take time out and enjoy!
