I don't get where all these jealous people come from who are writing those bad comments... First of all, this is not a comedy, it's a drama about the modern television, how it manipulates us and our lives.<br /><br />The actors, as in DIE FETTEN JAHRE SIND VORBEI are very well casted and do a pretty good job here, especially Bleibtreu. The photography is manily realistic and in a documentary style and so is the acting. Some might think that its a bit overdosed showing the TV-producers doing nothing else than sniffing coke and being assholes but those who work in the business will recognize most of it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching the movie, even if it could have been a bit shorter and to the point. There are not many directors in Germany which are brave enough to write such explosive stuff!
