I just saw this movie over the weekend with my girlfriend. We watched with subtitles as neither of us speak French. And aside for a few moments of being at a loss (more because we're American and its a French film), it was a great film. It's a story of a relatively successful young man in the real estate business. His father had to beat up clients to make them pay the bills. His deceased mother was a pianist. Happening to come across his mother's manager, he is provoked to regain his early talent at the piano. The movie documents his travels in learning to play the piano all over again and his life along this path. With his father and colleagues pushing him away from the piano, he gathers more steam. But his day job keeps him away from his "hobby" as everyone puts it. He gets increasingly frustrated with dealing with everyone else's problems and not being able to pursue his own challenges.<br /><br />This is the type of film that ends and you are not sure if he reaches his goal. But you know that he is happy at the conclusion of the film. My only qualm? I don't think a single scene goes by without a cigarette being smoked. But then again, I think most of France has a cigarette lit.
