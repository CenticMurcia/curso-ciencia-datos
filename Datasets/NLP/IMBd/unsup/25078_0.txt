This film should not be seen, due to it featuring an underage performer, and if you watch it you are a horrible, horrible person.<br /><br />But if you were to watch it anyway, I would expect it to have a very nice scene involving a maid, which would be made better by the fact that unlike most newer films, the actress seems to be having a good time. I would thoroughly enjoy this. And since thats really the only memorable part, I'll just give a brief overview of what I would expect to find.<br /><br />Scene 1 = 9/10 (Worth watching just for this)<br /><br />Scene 2 = 7.5/10 (Not bad, +1 for the end)<br /><br />Scene 2.5 = 10/10 just for horrible humor, epic.<br /><br />Scene 3 = 7/10 (Feels like it was thrown in at the end, but its interesting enough)<br /><br />Scene 4 = 7/10 (Good, end was kind of a let down)<br /><br />Scene 5 = 7/10 (Would have been 8.5 if a certain substance ended up on her face instead, such a waste...)<br /><br />Scene 6 = 8/10 (Kind of a combination of 2 scenes. The outdoors one has a few really nice parts. The indoors one isn't anything special.)<br /><br />Scene 7 = 8.5/10 (Nice surprise, good way to end the movie)<br /><br />Overall I would give it an 8. And if you don't have enough time for the whole thing, just watch the first 20 min or so, you'll thank me.
