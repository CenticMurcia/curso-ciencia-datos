I received a free preview ticket for this and should have stayed home. This was just an awful waste of time and money. I have to think that there is someone out there who could have used the studio's money for something better. There were actually people laughing uncontrollably at a guy getting hit in the groin with a paint ball! It was painfully obvious that this was getting ready to happen. It was like a bad sitcom pilot that went on for way too long. The only good thing here is that there are some fairly attractive females. Oh well, I guess this just wasn't for me. I really shouldn't be complaining though, it was free after all...
