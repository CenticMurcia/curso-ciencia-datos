This film has some outstanding performances and is also realistic, amusing without being comical, and hard-edged without being hard-boiled. Add Gena Rowlands' performance, and it is certainly worth a view.<br /><br />Anyone who has experienced dating outside of a large metro area will be familiar with the scene- the nights Beth and Debbie (Juliette Lewis and Uma Thurman) go out to Ollie's; hoping to meet someone new. As it is set in the 80's there are some great soundtracks, and there is also a parallel story with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara (as Nick) who develop a relationship in the unlikely environment of Bayonne, New Jersey.<br /><br />The visuals in this film are quite effective. The stark reality of Thurman's loneliness; her loss of her father; her mother trying to make ends meet as a waitress. Sounds bleak, but it isn't. This is due to Laura Cahill's sensitive telling of this story; and Thurman's and Lewis' chemistry on screen. Both are trying to meet someone, to change the life they are living.<br /><br />Another aspect of this film that I enjoyed was that, while there are humorous (and absurd) things that happen when we are single, this DOES show that, but not as so much ridiculous fluff. More as how real people are affected. For example Debbie dislikes her Mom's new boyfriend (Gazzara). But when she meets him one day at Ollie's she starts to discuss her problems. He smiles and says it's not the end of the world; she suddenly realizes he is right; she has wasted time on another guy who isn't worth it.<br /><br />Juliette Lewis is also believable as Beth, a high-school dropout who has a young daughter, and no husband. She tries to be protective of Debbie (Thurman) when she sees her being hurt by yet another bad relationship. All in all , the performances were very good in this film. It is sad at times, but not depressing. And Rowlands is excellent. 9/10
