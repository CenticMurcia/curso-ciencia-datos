I know Subiha way back since Eighties. At that time she was a young lady and just came back form Oxford to Karachi. She was engage in a War Against Rape to save innocent women and also joins an Urdu newspaper AMN with us. She was although too young but a brilliant and socio conscious girl. With reference to her film Khamosh Pani I would like to say Weldon SubihaÂ…. But my dear you may don't know, today situation in Pakistan is more dangerous than Zia period. Nowadays we are sitting on a volcano that erupts every day some where in Pakistan and take lot of innocent peoples life. Karachi was a modern city by every means in recent past but today go anywhere in this city, it may be a posh area, middle class locality or a slums you will find bearded men and burqa clad women in such a huge numbers that no one could even imagine some years earlier. This huge number of black bearded mullah and black burqa clad women on streets looks to me a black storm which is coming to destroy every thing. Time has come to make a film on this situation, I would like to suggest name of this film '' LAWA''. I think no one but Subiha can produce that kind of a film. I wish you best of luck Subiha.
