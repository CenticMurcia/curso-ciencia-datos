This cartoon short SHOULD have won the Oscar instead of Lend A Paw! An absolutely perfect blending of music and action throughout, well-executed at every turn. Incredibly funny with no dialogue-sight gags only and the running gags are great! Wonderful marriage of beautiful music and antic lunacy with a drop dead ending! Fanatically, totally recommended! I love this cartoon!!!
