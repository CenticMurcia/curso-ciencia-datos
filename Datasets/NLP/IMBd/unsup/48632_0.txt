First off, I have no idea where to begin. There were just so many things wrong with this movie. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br /><br />1. This movie was a very cheap rip-off of the old GODZILLA movies. Only the FX in this movie were far worse.<br /><br />2.The graphics on the monster were horrible. A second grader could probably come up with something better.<br /><br />3. You could never hear what the alien dudes were saying to each other because they were always mumbling. <br /><br />4. The plot was really dumb and a lot of the dialog was stupid. EX. Guy talking to monster while holding really big gun says: "Hey, Mr. Monster, I want you to meet my friend Tommy".<br /><br />5. What did the second monster have to do with anything? If the aliens were so powerful, why couldn't they just take control of the monster's mind again?<br /><br />I could go on forever, but since this has to be under 1000 words, I'm not going to. So, again, I cannot stress how bad this movie was. Stay away! This movie is a deathtrap......... -5 stars out of 5.
