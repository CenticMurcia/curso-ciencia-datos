Ray Manzarek is a legend of the keyboards and has a Masters degree in film from UCLA but its interesting to note that he is still more famous for Light My Fire than Love Her Madly..... Truly the worst movie I have sat and watched in 45 years of watching film..... it makes Plan 9 from Outer space seem like an interesting movie....... a waste of 90 minutes of the life of anyone watching..... so utterly abysmal that it has to be seen to be believed that a group of people would spend 17 days of their lives and turn out such utter dross.... the acting is dismal, script total drivel with the end bit nicked from Sidney Lumets DeathTrap and worst of all.....it was actually shown in a cinema.... ....and I am believe it or not a huge Doors fan!<br /><br />One of the worst aspects of this garbage is the way Manzarek shamelessly promotes the story as coming from the mind of rock legend Jim Morrison. Thus ensuring that a few Doors fans like myself would give it a try even though we were well aware after his awful LA Woman interpretation that Ray Manzarek had the directing talent of a half drunk chimp on crack. Manzarek needs Jim Morrison to remain in the limelight as his talent dwindles year in year out whilst Morrison needs Manzarek like a hole in the head. Wonder what happened to Rays film 'Riders On The Storm' a tale of a bunch of college friends who go into the desert and get stoned.....another idea from Jim Morrison apparently......or just one nicked from Oliver Stone in an act of total hypocrisy by Manzarek. It seems as 2009 comes to an end Manzarek the writer and Manzarek the film maker have taken a back seat to Manzarek the full time Jim Morrison groupie!
