This movie bears only a vague resemblence to the novel, which is a classic, but this movie was a travesty. I was spluttering and ranting throughout the vast majority of it, as they added a 'love interest' and took other liberties with the story to make it more fitting for a Hollywood formula.<br /><br />My condolences to the cast and crew.
