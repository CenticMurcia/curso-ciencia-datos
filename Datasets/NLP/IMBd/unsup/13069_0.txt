These four actors have brilliant talent, so I asked myself, what are they doing in a movie like this? I mainly saw this to watch Toni Collette and I can honestly say I was rather dissappointed with this movie as a whole. I didn't get enough background on this relationship between the couples, and although they talk quite a bit about all their "vacations and years together" we only witness one occasion in a 1988 flashback. One minute I was sympathizing with one character, the next minute disliking them. I hate that type of back-and-forth thing because it's tiring to keep up with who you're supposed to like and hate. The ending is kind of...this is the end. Finis. So what is that? Did the writers just forget to finish the script? If more effort had been put in this movie (not by the actors, they were finaminal in their roles) then perhaps this movie would've been more than just an HBO run-by. Not even a huge fan of any of these four can honestly love it...Sorry Toni.
