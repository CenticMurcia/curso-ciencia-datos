How the tables turn in this movie. Hitch said this was his second mistake of his career when he falsely led the audience into thinking the flashback scene was real. But beware. It is hitch and he always has something in store for his audience. I thought that was the brilliance of the film but that can be argued.<br /><br />Marlene Dietrich is so unbelievably sexy and the way she presents herself is very nostalgic of her Von Sternberg days with "Blue Angel" and "The Scarlet Empress". Was 15 years that long to lose her sexuality? I don't think she ever lost it. Richard Todd's character (Johnny) is the quintessential pre-Norman Bates. He has urges to kill which is his fault. Every character has some sort of fault which becomes very evident throughout the film and which Hitch is known for. Jane Wyman's character has a thirst for wanting to know the truth, but she doesn't when she finds it. I like how the romance changes which was something new at the time. Hitch always created something new which audiences viewed as typical Hollywood entertainment which is a shame since his movies are art in itself.<br /><br />The opening seen says it all where London is the stage in the fictional story. Any Hitch fan should view this and go along with the ride and not question everything since it would ruin the experience.
