I like to think of myself as a man of letters, a verbose and eloquent commentator on cultural affairs and the like, but no words can prepare you for this indescribable movie. Let me say from the start that it is FANTASTIC... a tragic love story of Romeo and Juliet proportions, and yet utterly hilarious; a western, and yet set in fifties' Thailand; technically superb and yet filled with pastiches of movie cliches; tongue in cheek and yet very moving. It is the sound of one hand clapping louder than a football crowd. Beyond this, words fail... 10/10
