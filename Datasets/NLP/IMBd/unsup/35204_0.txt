Although this was an early film, it is completely boring because of the proselytizing done by the supposed "communist state", which was in reality only an elitist central committee protected by the elements of the army and a secret police, much like America today. The premise is that the people who don't co-operate with the communal needs of the state, are "scum of the earth" or "crop fertilizer" and they are portrayed as being selfish and undesirable murderers in the film and thus have to be 'weeded out'. Its obvious that this is nothing but a ultra-realist piece of propaganda from Stalinist Russia, there's nothing to get excited over considering a small peasant village is getting a new tractor. Some interesting shots but over all, very boring and empty of any substance which keeps the viewer interested......For the agricultural student, its dated because the machinery used is now obsolete, some nice seeds/crops in the film though and shots of animal husbandry are included, especially a titillating scene where a peasant babushka milks a cow. Extras on the DVD's include 1930's constructivist milk ads from Russia and how to brush your teeth with toothpaste made from manure.
