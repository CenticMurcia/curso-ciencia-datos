I saw Carandiru after seeing Takeshi Kitanos "Zatoichi" at the Toronto Film<br /><br />Festival. Let me tell you, my day was full of carnage but it's OK because both movies were very good. The director was there as well as an actor or two if I remember correctly, they spoke about the film with true passion which added to the essence of the final product. It opend my eyes to an event that I never knew of. Highness was a great charater, Graca was my favorite, he should learn<br /><br />english and get into the indie scene in North America. Good film 7\10.
