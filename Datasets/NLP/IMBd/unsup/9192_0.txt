I disagree with the previous writer that the LP "Let It Be" contained the Beatles "weakest efforts" - not sure how you can call "The Long & Winding Road", "Get Back", and "Let It Be" weak efforts. However I do agree that the movie leaves a lot to be desired. This is not a great piece of work - but in a strange way - it is appropriately fragmented. This was a complex band, filmed no doubt at a cross-road. The absence of their (recently deceased) manager, the presence of strangers in the studio, the prospect of ever present angst, and combative postures.<br /><br />While not an easy film to watch, in my opinion a true Beatles fan will take from it the best sense of why this marriage had to end.
