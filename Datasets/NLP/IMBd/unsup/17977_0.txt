you know how switchblade sam rolls into town? on steel rails, leapin' off the locomotive at full speed and dustin' himself off. then he scopes out the town and says, "i bet they don't even lock their doors." this is the happiest man in the world. he walks into people's houses, eats their food, jacks all their cash and jewelry... shoot, he even steals candy from a baby. cops try to give him guff, but he don't sweat it. he'll cook up a whole pot of beans, even when he isn't hungry. he eats his apples off of his switchblade. he got some tight threads. he probably gets laid all the time too, but they ain't showin' that in this movie. he drinks his whiskey straight out the flask. he kidnaps kids and holds them for ransom. <br /><br />mr. Wilson is kinda cool too.
