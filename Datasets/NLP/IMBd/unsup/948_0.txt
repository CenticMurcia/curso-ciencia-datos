I have seen this movie three times since its release, but if I'm to be honest the last two times were mostly because of miss Beckinsale. To quote Dylan in the movie: "I can see it now, she is a stunningly attractive woman."<br /><br />The other actors make a good appearence as well, both Futterman as Dylan and Townsend as Jez are well casted, and they make well balanced duo. The movie is funny, though maybe not as laugh-out-loud-hillarious as a pure comedy would be, and allthough the plot is pretty crap (with some really far fetched sollutions), all in all it's a movie well worth seeing (unless you have a thing against pretty female faces...).
