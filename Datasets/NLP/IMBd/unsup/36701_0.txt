I wanted this movie to end very soon. Hugh Grant is the same person in every movie he's in. I was tired of him in the first 15 minutes and i was tired of this unoriginal plot. All through this film there was this illogical maze od complications that made me want to say, "Enough already!" There were a few funny moments but it did not make up for the tedious pot that was a retread of so many other films.
