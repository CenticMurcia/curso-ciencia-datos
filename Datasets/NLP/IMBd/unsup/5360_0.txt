Hallmark entertainment should leave these Jules Vern films alone. They did a bad job on filming,20,000 leagues under the sea,which was around a 3 hour bore,now,their version of Mysterious Island,again another bore which lasts about 3 hours. The special effects were bad,a bunch of relatively unknown actors,do not waste your time with this one. If possible,go to your video store or purchase a copy of the 1961 version which is far superior than this one. The 1961 version has well known British and American actors,good special effects that were outstanding for that year,even today they stand out,this film also has a Bernard Herrmann music score.
