The Erlenmeyer Flask the Limerick:<br /><br />A doctor with alien DNA<br /><br />From the syndicate runs away<br /><br />A flask labeled "Purity"<br /><br />Turns out not to be<br /><br />The monkey pee, Scully will say<br /><br />Great episode. The mythology officially kicks off into full gear with this wonderful season 1 finale. On rewatching this episode I was surprised to find out how many mythology references originated from this episode. Such as the cloning experiment, Zeus genetics, purity control, the phrase: "trust no one", etc. It is too bad that Deep Throat dies so early in the series but luckily we are given a very worthy successor soon enough. I also thought this was quite early for Scully to get her evidence from the monkey pee about finding alien DNA. It seemed that it took longer for her to find evidence like that in the series. The conspiracy still seemed so new and mysterious with so much to look forward to. I give the episode a perfect 10.
