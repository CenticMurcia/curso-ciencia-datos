The above question wan posed by an irate woman called "Nell?" Now, that's an odd insult that she used: a sun-baked ham? Well, in an old film, particularly a Three Stooges short that is 68 years old, you're going to get a lot of strange name-calling. I suppose in real life, the boys would be called a lot worse.....a lot worse.<br /><br />Daisy, Tessie, Flossie and Nell (the old coot who has no patience with the bumbling boys) actually hire the Stooges to take them West so they can perform their singing and dancing act. Of course, five months into the trip they've only made it about 100 miles to Kansas and Nell has lost her patience. Can't blame the poor woman.<br /><br />The bulk of the story contains classic Three Stooges gags, some of which are good no matter how many times, or in how many films, you seem them: like the grizzly bear wandering into the shed and Curly, at first, thinking it's a warm blanket.<br /><br />Then, PC-aside, we get the normal adventures with Indians which are usually pretty funny. The highlight, however, of this "western adventure," is the ice-fishing scene..Without giving too much away, suffice to say all three Stooges wind up taking humorous plunges into the icy waters. You can't help but laugh out loud at some of them.
