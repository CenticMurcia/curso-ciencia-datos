In response to planktonrules, your comment that this was one of Hitchcock's failures is wide of the mark. It was a wonderful black comedy, nearly an old fashioned French farce. To say it was a failure in the USA is one thing (it was) but internationally it didn't do too badly. As was mentioned earlier in the site, this film went fairly well in the UK, Italy and France. This could be seen that subtle humour is more appreciated outside of the USA than inside. Hitch's problem was that the humour in the film was not the "in your face" type that was typical of comedy films of this era whereas overseas movies like "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (the original) had that subtle, understated humour similar to TTWH.
