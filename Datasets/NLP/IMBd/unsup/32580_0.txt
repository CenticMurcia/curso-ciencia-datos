"Poe's Law" is usually used to describe the confusion that results from a politician or religious leader being so "out there" that it is almost impossible to distinguish him from a parody version of the same type of person. I think we can apply Poe's Law to almost every bad action movie ever made (i.e. Steven Seagal, J.C. Van Damme, Lorenzo Lamas...Don't get me wrong, I love these films and sometimes the worse they are, the more I can enjoy them). This film is no exception with it's trite dialog and flimsy plot. Some highlights include the music score, which is slightly more creative than most films from this genre, but I laughed out loud when Lamas confronts an art museum tour group by pointing at a photo of a homeless guy and angrily yelling, "Do any of you see that the man in this photograph spends the night freezing, out in the cold?" They all shake their heads like imbeciles, "No, we can't see it". Lorenzo's character is soooo deep (uh, not)! I gave this film a 4 out of 10 within the bounds of the action movie genre.
