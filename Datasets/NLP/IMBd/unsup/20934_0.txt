Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is my all-time favorite Jim Carrey movie. It has to be one of his funniest films ever! The story centers around the Miami Dolphins and that their prize mascot, Snowflake, has been stolen! Ace Ventura: Pet Detective must search through all of Miami looking for clues and motives on the kidnapping and makes a complete fool of himself at the same time! He's the best man for the job, actually he's the only man for the job! If you wanted to see Jim Carrey before he was the Grinch then this is the movie to see! Courtney Cox is also in the movie, playing an executive of the Dolphins named Melissa Robinson, Ace's love interest in the movie. Emilio (Tone Loc) is Carrey's police friend and Dan Marino (my favorite quarterback) has a role too! Lois Einhorn (Sean Young) is the bad cop in the movie, always belittling Ace for everything with the big fat cop guy, Aguado (John Capodice).<br /><br />It's also funny because nobody takes Ace Ventura seriously because he is a pet detective. However, he is extremely intelligent and makes fools out of the Florida police on several occasions.<br /><br />The cast of the film is great and it includes a cameo of former Miami coach, Don Shula. It has a much better cast than the second (and last) Ace Ventura film.<br /><br />Some might say Ace Ventura: Pet Detective is a horrible movie. The plot may be a bit unusual, but I assure you this is a hilarious movie with an interesting (albeit bizzare) twist. You will actually enjoy yourself watching a movie which is quite hard to do with most of the crap that has come out this year!<br /><br />I recommend this on VHS or DVD, both are readily available. For the true hardcore fans of the film, you will be slightly disappointed like me. The NBC TV version of this film contains additional scenes that weren't on the DVD or VHS :(. The DVD is one of the older ones with no special features. Unless you consider the trailer and director comments to be special. I don't. However, if you're a Carrey fan then get it!<br /><br />P.S. Some of the scenes removed include a scene with Ace singing on stage, Ace going into a bar looking for Ray Finkle, talking to Melissa Robinson in a car, and other little extensions on scenes. Let's just hope one day there will be a director's cut!!
