Despite having Charlie Lau helping Mathew Broderick's character in his hitting, the high school baseball scenes were completely unrealistic and look like a bad Pony League game. I cannot see a high school coach treat a varsity level game in this manner. Make the umpires look like real umpires, too.<br /><br />Another thing, high school baseball is only seven innings and they are playing in the ninth inning. Come on, a little research here. A simple detail like this really ruins movies with sporting scenes that are filled with these kinds of errors.<br /><br />Being involved with sports, some mistakes like this type of thing can lose any credibility. Movies need to make sporting events to look realistic, especially down to the officials. I see too often referees and umpires in out-of-date uniforms (I mean vintage 1940s) and doing things most trained officials would never do.
