I know, you want to see it because the cover shows a hot female body holding a machine gun, and because it's been out of print on DVD for years and now there's a certain level of mystique about it... but I'm telling you, there is absolutely NOTHING here that's worth looking at! I was shocked by how boring the whole thing was. Nothing transpires that is even remotely cool. I went into it knowing that it was a B movie, most likely made for video (perhaps with an ultra-brief theatrical release) and that the title was a play on DIE HARD. Still, with my expectations at their lowest setting, I was disappointed beyond belief.<br /><br />The acting - or lack thereof - is the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of trash. There's really no action in it, either. The girls weren't even hot enough to grab my attention. That's right... Ugly girls, no action and a hokey horror sub-plot that will have you shaking your head violently.<br /><br />I have seen this DVD sell for more than $100 on Ebay, simply because it's not being made anymore. People love to track down video rarities. I know, because I'm one of those people. However, HARD TO DIE is not only unworthy of paying to see, it doesn't deserve the 90 minutes of your life required to view it. Utterly worthless.
