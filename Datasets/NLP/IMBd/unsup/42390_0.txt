I was looking forward to take a break from my boring exam in Design History,to watch this movie a late Friday night. Well, The movie began 20 minutes ago, and now I'm here, just relieved to be back at my computer. I'm just gonna write this review and then go on reading about fabric-hall design in the early 20th century. You can just guess what my opinion of the movie is. The images were sharp, the colors were descent for DV-format, even the editing was satisfying.There were some people in the movie too... I might go back again and watch another minute of the movie later, while I'm having a cigarette....or maybe it's time to stop smoking...
