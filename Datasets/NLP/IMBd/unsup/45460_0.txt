1st watched 3/28/2004 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Keith Snyder): Unique but slow moving drama about a detective who is only given one week to live and hires someone to kill him so that he won't go out slowly. Another story within this central theme, is the serial killer that he's tracking down but we really don't get shown much of this side of the story. Scott Wolf does a good job in his role as the detective but when a twist in the story occurs and he decides he doesn't want to be killed, the movie just doesn't go anywhere. A very flat performance by Tim Roth in the role of the assassin doesn't help the story much, and Gabriel Byrne really doesn't do much with his role as the person Wolf works thru to get the killing done. All in all this was a good try at a different kind of thriller but there's not enough heart going into the making of this. There were some obvious small things like editing mistakes that made it clear that not a lot work was put into finishing this but instead it was just put on the movie shelves as soon as it could.
