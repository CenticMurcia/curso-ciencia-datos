This movie was so awful that it inspired me to sign into IMDb after not doing so for a couple of years.<br /><br />For the life of me, I can't understand why HBO would buy the rights to show this "film". ... (think Walker Texas Ranger type storyline, script, and dialog) <br /><br />The director assembled an encore cast headlined by Terrance Howard, Donnie Wahlberg, and beautiful Nia Long. However, as another poster mentioned, even the all star cast of actors couldn't save the lame script and the predictable "plot twists".<br /><br />This was an awful movie. I'm glad that I watched it on HBO so I only wasted my time and not my money.
