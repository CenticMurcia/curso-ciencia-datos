This was one of the best movies I've ever seen: It's horror, a bit of gruesome scenes mixed with the magic of the reality only Clive Barker can describe in his works.<br /><br />While watching this movie, pay attention to all the scenes that relate to things previously said, watch the circle close itself.<br /><br />And enjoy Clive Barker telling you that there is more in the world - more to see, more to feel and more than simply to "be".
