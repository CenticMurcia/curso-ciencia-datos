There is not much to say about this film other than that it is the worst film Scott has ever made. The tag line 'Somebody told them to get a life...so they did' is somewhat misleading unless the definition of life is murder and eventual suicide. What is this film trying to prove? That women can also capable leading violent lives? If this is liberation then women should be weary. Had the Geena Davis character left her abusive husband, forged out a new independent life for herself and found happiness, now that would have been inspirational. But alas, all we get is another road movie glamorizing violence. Yawn.
