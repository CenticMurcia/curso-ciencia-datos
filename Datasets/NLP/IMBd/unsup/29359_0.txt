I've just seen Tower of Evil for the first time and found it rather scary in parts. I enjoyed watching this, despite reading bad reviews about it.<br /><br />A group of young Americans drop off at a deserted lighthouse to spend the night there but all but one of them are bumped off, the survivor being a girl who kills a sailor, thinking he was the murderer. After she is rescued, another group go to stay there to see what really happened and is isn't long before killings start. We discover the killer to be a man who didn't get over the death of his wife and became a recluse on the island and as a result, he has mutated. He is killed at the end but his even more mutated son then appears, kills a man and the whole place then burns down.<br /><br />Tower of Evil is British made and is rather scary once on the island, where most of the scenes are shot in the dark.<br /><br />Quite a few familiar stars are in the cast: Bryant Haliday (The Projected Man, Devil Doll), Robin Askworth (Horror Hospital, Confessions of a Window Cleaner), Dennis Price (Twins of Evil, The Earth Dies Screaming), Derek Fowlds (Oscar Blaketon in Heartbeat), Anthony Valentine (To the Devil a Daughter), George Coulouris (Citizen Kane) and Jill Haworth.<br /><br />If you are a fan of 1970's horror, this is for you. Quite creepy.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
