So far this is one of seven in the director series compilations (the others being Chris Cunningham, Anton Corbijn, Jonathan Glazer, Mark Romanek, Stephane Sednaoui, and Spike Jonez). These would definitely be considered the new wave, MTV generation type directors. These directors are fully integrated into a visual medium. I would love to see who the series go to next.<br /><br />You might remember Michel Gondry from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Chappelle's Bloc Party. Prior to these movies he became famous for doing stunning music videos for artists like the White Stripes and Bjork.<br /><br />This is mostly a collection of the various music videos that he has done from about 1986 to 2003. Out of the all the music video's I have to pick 5 as my favorite.<br /><br />1) Daft Punk - around the world. Trippy and surreal dance number consisting of aliens, skeletons, mummies, and a few women.<br /><br />2) Kylie Minogue - come into my world. Kylie's Mobius trip from her dry cleaner + 1.<br /><br />3) White Stripes - fell in love with a girl. Lego land video is simply amazing.<br /><br />4) White Stripes - the hardest button to button. Recurring Michel theme of duplication.<br /><br />5) Cibo Matto - sugar water. Split screen asynchronous story that has a focal point in the middle.<br /><br />This is basically a compilation of the work of the director. It includes his music videos, commercials, and other projects. This is their portfolio. The Director's Series is the great thing as you see the influences and evolution of the director. I also enjoyed the Levi's commercial, with the truck driver. I highly recommend this and the other DVDs in this series.
