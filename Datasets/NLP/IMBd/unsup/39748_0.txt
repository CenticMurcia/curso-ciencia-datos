Chevy Chase moves to the country to become a farmer.<br /><br />Chase plays 'Andy Farmer', a newspaper columnist who starts a new life in the sticks with his wife (Madolyn Smith). He meets with all kinds of zany experiences.... too bad none of them are remotely funny. Chevy is great at dry humor and modestly scores with a one-liner now and then, but the film just doesn't make it as one of those good comedies that you'd like to watch every so often with a big bowl of popcorn.<br /><br />OK scenes include Madolyn's visit to an antique shop and Chevy tossing his hot coffee on a bird outside his window.... *snicker*.... that was funny!
