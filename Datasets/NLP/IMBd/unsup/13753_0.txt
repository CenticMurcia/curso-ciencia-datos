Edward Furlong reaches critical mass in this roll, which is buttered with gargantuan heaviness. Though the story is famished for what anyone might term logical structure, Mr. Furlong seems hungry to chew his way through every scene. Some might think he's becoming too big for such movies, squeezing into them like 5-pounds of marbled pork in a two-pound sausage casing. But I think he's a dollop of awesome; a soup√ßon of superb; and the thick, calorie-laden icing on what might otherwise be a rather slender cinematic cake. It doesn't matter that the director seems to have "written" this while shooting it, nor that the film runs out without any explicable ending. It has the enormous talent of Edward Furlong, who feasts on the meager dramatic opportunities as if they were a banquet.
