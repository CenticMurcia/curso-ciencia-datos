This short, which I must confess has two characters I find very unappealing, starts out marvelously for about the first 90 seconds, but the action quickly turns almost entirely to a series of setups for a running gag which is repeated (to varying degrees of effectiveness) so often that it starts to get tedious. The fact that the dog is a one-dimensional character of limited personality and that Claude Cat is limited here by the running gag only makes things more problematic. To a degree, the cameo by another Warner Brothers character and the ending of the short, along with a wonderful beginning, salvages this short and raises its overall score. This is on Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 3 and is worth watching, though the Collection as a whole is most highly recommended without reservation. Not the best short I've seen, but far from the worst I've watched. Recommended
