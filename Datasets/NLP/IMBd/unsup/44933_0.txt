In the sparkling tradition of 'Very Bad Things,' 'A Simple Plan' and 'Open Water 2: Adrift,' comes a 'Donkey Punch' that's a dozen of hits inferior to the films it's mirroring. Sure it's more serious than 'Things' and 'Plan' but what made those fun to watch was that they didn't take themselves so seriously. This 'Donkey' movie was made by people that have never seen those three, or any other young adult 'Oh, I've never met you, so I guess it's safe to go with you to ___" (fill in destination) film. There's got to be countless ones out there. The twist, I suppose they were shooting for was the said title. What takes seconds to explain what it is doesn't make this much more original than 'Things' or 'Plan.' Three girl friends meet four guy friends while on holiday in Spain and opt for a sunset cruise on a yacht. After one dies by a (insert title here), the action, suspense and paranoia ensures. When the movie turns cat & mouse, everyone out for themselves, hurting each other, plotting, etc, it's not terrible, but horribly unoriginal, predictable and gives us zero characters/heroes in which to root for. Granted most of us haven't been involved in such circumstances, we can't honestly say what we would do. However, having seen at least 48 movies like this one, I think I'll have a pretty good idea of what NOT to do. I think if it really did happen to me, and they made it into a movie, chances are it would just a 5-minute You-tube clip. One other problem I had, and I'm probably in the minority, but though I speak English, I find myself using the English subtitles more with such thick English accents. Unfortunately, this DVD only had Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />'Very Bad Things' and 'A Simple Plan' are highly recommended over this. Even the low-rated (but I actually enjoyed) 'Open Water 2: Adrift' is a better rental.
