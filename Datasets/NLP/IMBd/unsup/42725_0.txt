Holy Christ. sorry, but i have to get it off my chest. i just finished watching this movie, and felt i needed to REGISTER on this site just to write a review just to express my hatred for this movie. there are countless errors in this movie, and the production values......ugh all i am saying is i could fund a better quality movie with whats in my wallet right now. harsh? no, not at all. it looks like they filmed this thing on a video phone. and the plot..... first off we find our so called 'heroes' in a dojo with their trainer 'white Dragon' but they don't know he is white dragon, they are being informed of white dragon foiling robbers and such. this sparked my attention because later in the movie they saw white dragon on a Japanese comic, they were wondering who he was, even though they were informed of him in the first FIVE MINUTES of the movie. another thing that annoyed me is their costumes. their ninjas right? wrong. they wear black suits, colored maskes, CLOWN WIGS and roller blades. yeah, VERY stealthy. now we come to THE worst scene in the entire movie, if not in film history. we find white dragon fighting Cobra Khan in a balloon factory. and by balloon factory i mean a bunch of clowns in a room blowing up balloons. well here we are, the fight between cobra khan and white dragon, well they do anything but fight. the mighty white dragon is just bouncing on balloons and telling each other that 'nah nah cant get meh' and the ever dreadful 'neener neener!' I could swear at one point i heard my television crying in sorrow. the long and short of it is i wanted to stab my eyes out with a rusty knife. Yeah, not a very good movie.
