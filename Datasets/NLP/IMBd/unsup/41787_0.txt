After his seventeenth murder in moving lift, a psychiatric patient named Devlon was killed by the police. Nevertheless Dr.Cardan, who has been the psychiatrist in charge of the patient for years, insists his body must be burnt. But three male medical students and their female friends steals the body for their party in an empty house nearby the cemetery. Soon Dr.Cardan and Cap.Ancira begin to find the body, but this night is the Halloween so that five local kids go to the problematic cemetery for tests of their courage... This Mexican zombie film, which consists of chaotic elements of Halloween, the Evil Dead and Death Screams, is so multifariously bad that I can write about only three major points. First, the lightning is technically problematic. This film, of which total running time is 91 minutes, has only 8 minutes day-time scenes, and 90 per cent of the whole is night-time scenes with amateurishly poor lightning so that at least half of the film seems to be almost black-and-white. Second, the dialogue is much more problematic. For instance, the psychiatrist, Dr.Cardan explains two contradictory facts to the policeman, Cap.Ancira, namely, 1)the patient's body must be cremated, and 2)the patient's body can be destroyed only with an old document named Black Book. Just what kind of foolishness is this? Maybe Dr.Cardan,M.D. is the same kind of more famous Dr.Butcher,Medical Deviate. Indeed the entire dialogue is so childish that words of the psychiatrist and of the five elementary-school kids are almost exchangeable. And third, the ending scene is terribly bad. I can tell what exactly it is, but I can tell its unbelievable irrationality turns the whole film to be some kind of four-sided triangle.
