So i am not a big fan of Lindsey Lohan but the trailer looked really good so I was excited to see this movie. I finally got to rent it. I found it to be slow at various points especially when she finally discovers about the stigmata thing and then tries to solve the case. The trailer was misleading in the fact that most of the scenes shown were from the last twenty minutes of the film. The confrontation between the killer and Dakota should have been more suspenseful/longer. Then when Dakota and Aubrey meet there was no response from Aubrey. I could have done without the drawn out scenes of Dakota stripping. Overall the concept was good, i just think the script should've been edited a little.
