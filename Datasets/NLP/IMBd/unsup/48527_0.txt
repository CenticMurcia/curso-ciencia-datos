I just got back from a free tester screening of this movie and even participated in the focus group of about 30 people afterward. To sum it up, nobody said they would have paid to see this movie and nobody agreed that they would recommend this to a friend. Though it is overwhelmingly bad, it was just a tester screening and they may yet make changes to this piece. <br /><br />Spoiler? ****The Upcoming portions has some stuff about the story, but there is nothing really to spoil other than if you thought this was going to be a good movie.<br /><br />There were a few bright spots, AKA Danny Masterson, Adam Brody, and John Cho. Danny Masterson played the supposedly geeky roommate who Anna Faris is creeped out by due to his love of Sci-Fi. He is portrayed as being, literally, a spooky Skull-F***er, ya kind of weird but funny none the less. Adam Brody plays the intelligent and economical pot dealer and in his limited role is absolutely hilarious. Anna ends up owing him money and must travel to Venice in order to pay him off, or else. This is the basic premise of the movie, it seems. John Cho is a sausage delivery man who has no connection to Anna other than she was so high she stowed away on his delivery truck in an effort to get to Venice. The only problem with all this is that each of these characters were in the movie for no longer than 5 or 6 minutes, they had no interaction with each other, and they were the funniest characters in the flick (this is bad if they all have limited roles).<br /><br />Now onto Anna, poor poor Anna. She accidentally eats a whole batch of pot cupcakes (the weird part about this is that you don't actually know that these cupcakes are pot filled) and goes on a 'fun' filled expedition to repay her debts. Sounds funny right? Not really, she acted like she more strung out on speed or trippin on some bad shrooms or LSD...Has she ever even smoked before? It was just completely unbelievable and she was basically the entire movie, considering there were no other main characters in any sense of the word. She would just go around and talk to one person, then a random event will happen leading to another person and another event. <br /><br />As far as the story goes, I don't think there was one. It just seemed like a series of random events that had a beginning, a meaningless ending, and nothing in between. There were many dull moments throughout the movie that made an hour and a half seem a lot longer than that.<br /><br />With that said, there were still moments of stoner brilliance and with some quality editing and an extensive overhaul this movie may still have a chance. Remember that this movie is still in the works and they have a chance to kick it up a notch, but I think it is unrealistic. Other than that, I'm sad to say that Smiley Face is Dead on Arrival.
