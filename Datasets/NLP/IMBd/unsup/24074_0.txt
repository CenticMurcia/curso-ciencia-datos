Early Hitchcock, in which he is exploring all fields of technique. Spectacular special effects, overwhelming use of lighting and memorable action scenes. Novello's acting may be slightly overdone, but it only makes him seem more mysterious. Still modern, still Hitchcock and certainly very interesting!
