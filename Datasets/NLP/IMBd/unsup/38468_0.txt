Marius ET Jeannette is a nostalgic film created to highlight class struggle and things long gone. The latter is evident by the close nit community given by the living arrangements and how the people interact. The class struggle, given by the poor precarious employment and by the simplicity of life, where sex seems to be the only interest they can afford, highlights a longing for the France that once was the biggest power in the European union ( notice how in the beginning of the movie, a world balloon floats in the once great harbour - a symbol of globalisation and capitalism that has left France behind). Overall the movie is the same as many other french romantic movies .. a very slow start to a seemingly pointless love story , where all you can think is "get over it you two and get together!" and where the ending is rather disappointing. I wouldn't recommend it unless you had to study the french bitterness of the 90s.
