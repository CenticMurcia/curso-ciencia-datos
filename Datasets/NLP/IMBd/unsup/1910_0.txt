This film is fantastically understated and has within it the foundations of excellence.<br /><br />O.C and Stiggs is what great film making is all about - bringing to life an environment that is high fiction but could truly exist somewhere.<br /><br />Made in 1987, it has all the hall marks of a film made in the late sixties to early seventies. Good films of that time felt free and progressive.<br /><br />Real classics kind of exist in a little world of their own, and this is just that sort.
