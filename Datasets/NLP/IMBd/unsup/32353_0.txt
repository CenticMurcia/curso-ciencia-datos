Come on Vince. You're a Billionaire. Hire someone who can write and someone who can direct (not a guy who has never directed anything other than porn like you did with See No Evil) and a lead who can act. This was a piece of crap that never should have seen the light of day. Even as a popcorn flick this thing failed in everyway. Repetitive explosions (cena got flash burned to death every time there was an explosion in this movie). Lame as fights (cena takes out those two drug dealers his own size but is getting his a** handed to him by narrow assed Robert Patrick). Poor direction. The list just goes on and on. Of course with how little he spends making these films he's probably making money on them (or at least a hell of a tax write off/business loss), but eventually even his hardest core fans are going to get sick of bad films trying to sell themselves based only on wwe stars in the roles. well given the fact that any time you turn on the wwe it's the same guys in the same matches (can't even pretend to be interested in that anymore) maybe they won't?
