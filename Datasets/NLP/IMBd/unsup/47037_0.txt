David Jason is brilliant. Sadly a good actor cannot salvage an obvious story line (which owes a lot other work, such as the similarly named Ghostship) which meant it all became a little predictable, and towards the end just plain silly.<br /><br />Characters behave inconsistently and illogically as the story lurches towards the less than surprising end.<br /><br />The special effects themselves were also erratic - obviously a lot of money was spent on the set of the sub, but the cgi shots ranged from the okay to dreadful.<br /><br />Okay if you are bored, but not the great work I was expecting.
