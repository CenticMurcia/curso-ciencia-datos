Hello fellow Harsh Realm fans. Have you heard the good news ? The short lived T.V. series from the creative mind of Chris Carter ( X-Files fame ) is finally out officially on DVD ! For those those of you out there reading this not familiar with the short lived Fox network television program let me fill you in. The government is running a covert computer program known as "Harsh Realm" People's minds are "transported" into this computer program without there knowledge. Here everything seems real but in this reality America is a post nuclear wasteland. Here it is survival is a daily struggle. It is in this computer program where a former highly decorated soldier known as "Santiago" rules with an iron fist. A soldier is sent in to "win" the game by killing Santiago. The soldier is not told by the government that in the computer program if you die there, you die in the real world. The Fox network recently released this short lived but innovative T.V. show on DVD. Only nine episodes are on it but it is well worth it. You can find used sets of this TV show for sale on E-bay for a reasonable price. You can also purchase it new from National store chain Best Buy for about $30.00 I hope my description helped you in deciding if you wanted to purchase or view this show. I gave it 8 out of a possible 10 stars only because they show did not have enough time to develop the characters and plot of the show. The show is well worth the money.
