Like all Thundercats fans I really loved this cartoon!! So much so, that 20 yrs since watching an episode when I saw the whole series on DVD for sale online I decided to order it. I was so excited when I received my package that I thought I'd have a Thundercats marathon with my older sister (who also loved it) about halfway through the first disc (there's about 14 discs all up) I couldn't remember why I loved this cartoon so much? Don't get me wrong, it was exactly how I remembered it but something was missing? Probably the fact that there was absolutely no opportunity of me ever becoming a Thundercat or cruising around 3rd Earth in the Thundertank, I guess it lost all of it's appeal. Oh and Liono, Lord of the Thundercats really annoyed me, he was more like Liono, Lord of stating the obvious! I guess when you're older you pick up their silly mistakes, such as when they introduced new characters (such as bengaly and pumara) the old characters (such as cheetara & tigra) disappeared off the face of 3rd earth. It wasn't a total waste of money though, I have a younger brother and sister who were born after the Thundercat era and have grown up on the "new" 3d cartoons (that have absolutely no morals or lesson to be learned) so seeing them watch the series was OK I guess!
