hell tanner was a great anti-hero the last of the hells angels, greatest mailman of all time a sociopath who saved the east coast for the hell of it.<br /><br />the characters, plot, and style of the book were completely ignored for a much lamer movie plot and massively more boringly paced. instead of attempting to escape from the pigs on his bike, the scene with the guv, his brother and the other drivers would be a great opening instead we get a boring ass bit that introduces hell as a soldier instead of an outlaw so now he's just a slacker jarhead an insult to the book i hope someday someone makes a new version that's actually true to the story cuz that would be a great movie
