The best part about his movie for me is the story. I love how these characters are so real, how they change, it's really touching. I love the photography, the soundtrack and the simple true story that was told. Negative commentary about it for me is hard to do, because the choices the characters made in this film aren't always good ones, but it's what the character would do in real life. There's subtle moments and connections in this film that you might miss if you're mind drifts, but it all ties up so lovely and it gives us hope for our own lives. Many of the comments that I got from others was, they lived that, they can relate. I can say no more except that I was deeply touched by the sincerity of this film. Drew Johnson's heart is up on the screen and it's something we need right now in American Cinema.
