OK. I've seen this film about 20 times, and I think I may watch it at least 20 more. Why? You may ask. Well, how about the best movie ever?. Yes, it is a comedy, and yes it is very innocent, but if you have ever been in love or at least you think you have, I'm sure you will enjoy it.<br /><br />I saw this movie on one of those late night showings and having nothing better to do I kept watching. From the beginning I was hooked, I just couldn't stop watching. Somehow It reminded me of my teenage years and how deeply you could fall in love.<br /><br />This film show us that, for a movie to be really good, a large budget is not necessary, not even a bunch of stars (at the time they were pretty unknown, I think), just a great filmmaker and something important to tell, 'That's that. No eggs, no strudel. Nothing'.
