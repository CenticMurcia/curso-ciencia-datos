This is definitely one of the worst movies I've seen so far this year.<br /><br />Lori Petty = bad movie. I think Lori ruined the movie for me most of all with her whiny voice and annoying mannerisms. Every scene with her made me want to turn the movie off. I think what annoys me most is that she acts the same way in every movie she's in. <br /><br />As a female musician myself, I was disappointed with the music. I didn't feel that it "rocked" at all. So the bad music + Lori Petty = super bad movie.<br /><br />Gina's great, but not even she could save this one.
