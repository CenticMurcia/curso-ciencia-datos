Overdressed Los Angeles locations come between harmless Dennis Hopper (as Frankie), porn star Darryl Hannah (as Margaret), her director Kiefer Sutherland (as Joey), and everybody's mob boss Michael Madsen (as Sal). Uncharacteristically, Mr. Hopper is called "Fly" because he wouldn't hurt one. He plays re-recordings on his jukebox, is called an ugly waitress, and falls in love with Ms. Hannah. She alternately appears blonde and brunette for adult audiences (note, no nudity), and tries not to shoot up. Flailing and jumping around on the set, Mr. Sutherland is mercifully gagged and tied up during the second half.<br /><br />** The Last Days of Frankie the Fly (10/24/96) Peter Markle ~ Dennis Hopper, Darryl Hannah, Kiefer Sutherland, Michael Madsen
