A more intelligent and poignant critique of our Western 'capitalist dictatorship' (the words of our three anti-heroes!), you would not find, not even on the pages of my Brighton anarchist friends' 'The Schnews' (ah, ah!). And this is also a very intelligent, humane and absorbing thriller (for want of a better word, we all express ourselves by clich√©s, like Peter or Jan would say!) because Hans Weingartner is a consummate and devilishly clever storyteller and after the first few sequences you will forget where you are, and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen! A must see for old radical firebrands like myself and 'capitalist slaves' (only kidding!) alike!
