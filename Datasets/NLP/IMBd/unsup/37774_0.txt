I watched this movie just because of Robert Englund (best known as Freddy Kruger from "Nightmare on ElmStreet"), but I was disappointed! This movie looks just like cheap 80's slasher movie (exaple: "Nightmare on ElmStreet" latest 4 sequels). This movie became a disaster at the end, when Chambers has been taken by tornado.<br /><br />Young actors acted nice. Meredith Henderson and Nathan Stephenson had show, that they can act very good, so some producers had to take them to better movies. Other actors acted fair. Robert Englund is still a good actor, but this movie has not been watching, if you're the fan of Roberts character Freddy Kruger. Plot of this movie was average (except ending).<br /><br />So, I give a 4 to this movie, but I was thought about 2 or 3.
