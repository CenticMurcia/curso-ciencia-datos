Ew. This movie is horrible. It's either a bad homage or straight out rip-off of the film "Heathers", which is worlds better than this, plus it features Rose McGowen reprising that same role she does in just about every film she's in: heartless bitch that never shows any emotions (the only other character she ever portrays is ditzy girl that never shows any emotions. She has range...). Plus, as if the lame script, thin satire and horrible acting wasn't enough - you get to see Rose and her real life boyfriend, Marilyn Manson, have sex. It's charming.<br /><br />Yes, High School sucks, but so does this movie. Two wrongs don't make a right.
