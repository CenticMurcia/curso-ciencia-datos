I discovered this film in the dark, back corner of the video store, covered in dust. The dust was so thick, I could barely read the title. But something about it caught my eye. Was it the deep black of the video cover? Nietzche once said that if you stare long enough into an abyss, the abyss stares back at you... I felt as though this cover was staring at me, within me, beckoning me to pervade its depths and discover the secret it held within...I knew that whatever this movie was, I had to rent it. I dusted off the cover and for the first time in my life gazed upon those words: 'The Incorporated.' I watched it, and although the film by itself was only mediocre, there was one aspect, one historic performance that made the movie worth watching, my life worth living. That magical performance is, of course, the work of David L. Scott. His performance in this was, quite frankly, the greatest performance as a 911 operator in the history of film. But what has happened to this great man? It's a terrible shame that this extraordinary actor has disappeared from the film scene. He will be profoundly missed...
