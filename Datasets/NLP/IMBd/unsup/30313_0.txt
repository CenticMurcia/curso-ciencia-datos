People who love:<br /><br />- depictions of New York City's Times Square (and New York City, for that matter) as gritty-as-you please and before it was remade as a family theme park<br /><br />- Tim Curry (see him here as a late-night radio DJ speaking to nocturnal urban denizens in verse from the center of Times Square)<br /><br />- movies about youthful rebellion that are half tongue-in-cheek<br /><br />will get a kick out of this movie. I recommend it, especially if you don't require that you grow spiritually or expand your vocabulary every time you invest 90 minutes in a movie.
