Contemporary Turkish cinema produces 20-30 movies every year (not counting straight-to-video or TV stuff) and about half of them are good, decent movies worth watching. Mehmet Ali Erbil generally is the lead in the other half.<br /><br />As a golden rule, never watch a movie with Mehmet Ali Erbil. He is not a good actor, has no comedic talent beyond fart jokes, and no sense of appropriateness or decency. He apparently has a following who enjoys to see his torturous TV shows, and ready to pay for more of that crap in movie theaters.<br /><br />Also, never watch a Turkish comedy that tries to emulate the American ZAZ movies of the 80s. They invariably suck because of poor writing coupled with bad casting.<br /><br />Finally, to be specific for the ones who are late to take the hint, never see this movie. Actually, forget that this movie existed...
