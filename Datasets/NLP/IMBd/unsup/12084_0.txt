I finally got to see this film last night - the previews looked great and overall I wasn't disappointed. The film - though a bit slow at times - was a unique blend of a Western and a 1001 Arabian Nights.<br /><br />(possible spoilers) This was the first time that the events at Wounded Knee were depicted on film (at least, as far as I know). Other films have mentioned the events, but nothing more. Custer made his last stand at Little Bighorn in 1876 ... the Indians made their last stand at Wounded Knee in 1890. If DANCES WITH WOLVES would ever have a sequel, I would imagine it would pick up where the first film left off and end at Wounded Knee.<br /><br />For the film HIDALGO, the old West was only looked upon briefly. Most of the film was spent in Arabia. It is very interesting how the film's release is timed - while the US is still in Iraq. The film shows that the Middle East had feelings of ill-will toward America in the 1890's as much as they did in the 1990's.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen made for a very convincing cowboy. It is good to see that he is finally receiving top billings in movies, something that is perhaps overdue. We saw him briefly in WITNESS, but I do not remember seeing him again until CRIMSON TIDE which was 10 years later. His performance in that film made me believe he was finally receiving recognition.<br /><br />The film has powerful overtones along with a basic plot. Overall, it made for a great adventure film that I plan to watch again. Its ending was certainly bittersweet - if you love something, set it free...
