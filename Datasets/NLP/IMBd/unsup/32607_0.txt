Imagine my surprise when the movie ended that it had only been two hours since it began. It felt more like 10. Were it not for Meryl Streep playing the quintessential Jewish Mother (reminded me of my Grandmother) I probably would have turned it off after the first 3 hours.<br /><br />Director Younger used tons of flashbacks in an attempt to keep the story going, but all it did was make the movie longer. Further, the flashback scenes were so out of place the viewer can't help but lose track of what is happening and when it is happening. You might want to rethink that technique for the next one, Ben.<br /><br />Bottom line--Bryan Greenberg is a cutie. Uma Thurman...well, I've never quite gotten that one. Meryl is great. After that, the plot goes absolutely nowhere (does anybody know what happened at the end? If so, please explain it to me.)
