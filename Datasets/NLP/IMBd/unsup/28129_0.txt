One of the best dramas I ever watched, very chocking and strong. It made me feel bad, as a really good drama is supposed to.<br /><br />I put myself in the place of the main character, who is just a child watching terrible things he can't believe are possible or acceptable. He wants to help the girl that is being tortured, but feels helpless facing an adult. The lack of credibility a child has before the police, when an adult woman contradicts the information given by a child, and the oppression that the same woman uses over the child are some examples of why the main character feels like he can't do anything. His agony rises even more with the feeling of guilt, because in his childish understanding he sees himself as responsible for the start of the worst tortures. The best he can think of doing is pretending to be in her game, while trying to find a way to help the tortured girls.<br /><br />The movie has a great environment and a great story, that it is very well told. It unrolls naturally. The acting is very good overall, making the story very believable. The only actor that (seldom) didn't seem completely natural is the main actor (the boy), but it's perfectly understandable, as it is a very demanding role and he is a young actor. When I read the other reviews, the only negative/low grade ones I could find are either of those people comparing the movie to the book (which I didn't read - and anyway, a movie is always a different work, so it should be assessed independently) or from the people who consider this movie too disturbing and didn't like it, failing to understand the fact that a DRAMA is supposed to be that way.<br /><br />Oh, I saw someone saying it was child pornography... whoever can get near to excited with this movie must be really really really sick.
