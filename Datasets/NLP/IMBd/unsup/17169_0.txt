This movie was incredibly terrible, it was like they were trying to make the worst movie possible....And they succeeded with flying colors. The acting was pure trash and the killing in the movie was so unnecessary and ridiculous. No one kills that many people for absolutely no reason! Every time I get bored I just put Killa season and skip to the part where he's crying about his niece getting shot and I just laugh for a good 5 minutes, the fake tears and the way his expressions are exaggerated are just too hilarious. In conclusion, you should buy this movie if you want to be a witness to the worst movie on the entire planet, or if you want to laugh at serious scenes that aren't meant to be funny. Other than that the only place this movie belongs is in the garbage, or better yet, in a furnace........lol
