I watched l'Iceberg last night, and I have to say, right from the beginning, a smile never left my face. It may not be the style of humor that everyone likes nowadays. <br /><br />The film has a very light atmosphere, but it is not necessary to look to deeply. Very inspired by Tati, the film requires only simple observation without trying to look very deep.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to be in the presence of the two lead actors at the theater here in Strasbourg. Afterwards, Fiona Gordon made it perfectly clear that this film is meant to be simple and pleasant, yet the laughs continued non-stop. Do not expect a typical American-styled humor in this film.<br /><br />For any fans of a lighter style of humor, this movie should do wonders. I can't praise this movie enough :)
