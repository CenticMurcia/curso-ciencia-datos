This movie was actually shown on PBS when it first came out, and many schools also utilize it in English class.<br /><br />It is an interesting drama revolving around Connie (Laura Dern), her friends, and adolescent life in rural Northern California, or any other average American small-town.<br /><br />Basically, Connie is attempting to escape her stifling everyday life; she and her mother are constantly at odds (well played by Mary Kay Place); and she spends most of her time at the mall; just like many kids, she has no direction, but enjoys meeting other kids at the local hamburger stand; eventually, after several encounters, she meets Treat Williams, who is a little different than most boys.....<br /><br />The short story by Oates was actually based on the true story of a serial killer in Tucson AZ, who was nicknamed the "Pied Piper of Tucson". The story takes off into more tension from there; you should read the short story, as you will get the meaning of Arnold Friend/Treat Williams a lot better; the character is well portrayed by Treat Williams; suave, smooth and dangerous.....just what most young girls are attracted to.<br /><br />All in all, a very good movie; and Laura Dern was good in the role, very vulnerable and impressionable; the novel projected the impression of a more standard beauty for the times....perhaps an actress like Jenny Garth or Mira Sorvino.
