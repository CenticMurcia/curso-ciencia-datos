Awkward nut case goes around raping and killing women, now he turns his sights on a suburban housewife and soon invades her home.<br /><br />From the premise of this movie one would like to think that it would be, at the very least, an interesting thriller. Well, you would be wrong unfortunately. Forced Entry, unsurprisingly a poor remake of an infamous sexploitation flick from 1973, is a completely tedious movie. Not only is the movie badly paced but the acting is utterly terrible, the cinematography dull, and there is a miserable lack of suspense and tension. On top of this it's tasteless and told entirely from the monotone point of view of its unconvincing villain. The only highlights are early appearances from later stars Tanya Roberts and Nancy Allen (who plays an ill-fated hitchhiker) however they can't save a movie that's not only garbage but boring garbage! <br /><br />Not on video, for good reason.<br /><br />BOMB out of ****
