There exists the phrase, "It's so bad it's good". Well, this film could well have been created from start to finish under that principle.<br /><br />I've voted just a single point in its favour (only because zero is not an allowed option). By any sane analysis "The Day it Came to Earth" is dire: the plot is contrived; the acting is wooden; the camera-work is suspect; the sound is indistinct; the scary bits just aren't; and best of all, it came in the night, not in the day.<br /><br />And yet, a one dimensional voting system like this does not do justice to the complete ensemble of the TDICTE experience. Why have I watched it six times? What makes it so compulsive? How can something so poor, something so wrong in every respect, be this good? Honestly, I can't say. Find out for yourself. Watch it, live it, but don't say I didn't warn you.
