This is a movie about 3 persons. One is a woman who behaves as if she was neurotic and had some kind of bipolar mental disease. The very sad truth is that she is just childish and extremely boring. There is a man who basically has nothing to say, at all; and another one who has quite an irritating smile and a magical knee.<br /><br />They tend to get mad at each other, but it s OK, they are reconciled each 5 minutes. <br /><br />They dance too. We have to take into account that it is the way dancers express their very inner feelings and frustrations. So, they do everything by dancing, and everything is very deep.<br /><br />The dog what quite a good actor.
