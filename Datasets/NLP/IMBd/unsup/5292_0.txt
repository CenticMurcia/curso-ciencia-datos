Thought it was beautiful and absolutely amazing from beginning to end. With rare dialog (but what's there is hilarious), the main focus is the beautiful cinematography, the sparse and understated performances of everyone, and the NOISE!!! Yes, the noise aspect of the film is what really got me interested in it, but the film as a whole is definitely some kind of minor masterpiece apart from that.<br /><br />All the beach shots... the shots of the characters walking around making noises.... shots of people sitting, wordless.... shots of people watching the rain. A very slow, VERY minimal art film. I was just in love.<br /><br />An extremely interesting, unique, moving film... but only about 1 out of every billion people will enjoy it.
