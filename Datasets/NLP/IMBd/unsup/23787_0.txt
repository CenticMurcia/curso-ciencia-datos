I'll make this as concise as possible: Terrible Script, Poor continuity, God-awful acting, Plot holes a plenty, Direction with no style, Horror movie that isn't frightening.<br /><br />For anyone interested in the film industry, I strongly recommend attending genre specific film festivals in the future. You get to experience the work of truly talented people at the beginning of their careers...the price (outside of admission) is enduring the work of delusional people like those attached to this movie. However, it's the bad which allows us to appreciate the good.<br /><br />If the director of this movie gets the opportunity to direct again, than everyone should be allowed to direct films. You, me, our grandmothers. Now, I'm not saying he won't work in the industry...he will. Possibly as a P.A. or a gaffer or even a best boy. He just doesn't have what it takes to direct. And, these actors should find another career or go back and take some classes.
