This "film" has a pretty ridiculous plot, some of the wost acting I've ever seen and some fairly laughable effects, but it wasn't without a certain b-movie charm.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS ***<br /><br />Angela Featherstone is some kind of demon who works in hell punishing the sinners there, but gets bored and comes to Earth to punish them here instead. The premise seems to suggest God and Satan work together or something, and that heaven and hell are more or less the same place, and that demons are really good guys that simply punish the wicked. Interesting take, but all things considered rather stupid.<br /><br />*** END SPOILERS ***<br /><br />I haven't seen Featherstone perform in anything else besides the small part she had in Con Air, but her acting in this film probably comes close to being the worst I've ever seen. She is so wooden and unconvincing that I can only imagine she was merely hired for her striking blue eyes and red hair. Or perhaps they thought that was the exact deadpan humourless mode of speech this "fish out of water" should have. Either way, she's lucky to have worked in Hollywood again after her abysmal performance this film.<br /><br />The "special effects" more or less consist of superimposing some flames on the screen and a hilarious animated red eye twinkle, there are some truly hilarious bad acting moments from other cast members, and most of the plot elements are stupendously dumb, but nevertheless I stuck it out to the end and didn't come away too disappointed. I have very low expectations when it comes to low budget crap like this.<br /><br />4/10
