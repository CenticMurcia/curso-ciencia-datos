That's all I really can say about this show, "Pathetic". The performers are all so bad it's annoying, I actually even have a physical reaction watching this show like I'm about to be sick and I'm not just saying that to make a point it is really so bad that I feel a little sick to my stomach, not sure how that reaction works but I swear it's true. Who ever writes this televised garbage should never be allowed to write anything ever again. This show is easily one of the very worst shows I have ever seen in my entire life and as much as I want to say it is the #1 worst show ever made I'm not sure that's true because there have been some other awful shows but right now I can't think of anything I'm sure is worse than Comedy Inc. It is shameful that this show was ever put on TV and I mean it who ever spent good money to make this show and wasted all that air time airing it should be ashamed of themselves. This show's Pathetic.
