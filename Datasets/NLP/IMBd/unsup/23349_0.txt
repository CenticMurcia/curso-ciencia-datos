I decided to watch this movie on a whim with absolutely no expectations and I was completely charmed by it. Sure, the plot is your usual 30's rom com hogwash where a bad girl meets a good boy, but the script is unusually well-written for a B-picture and provides many laughs and cute romantic moments you'll sigh over. The 2 leads, Dixie Lee and Joe Morrison look unbelievably cute together, though Joe is a bit of a wooden actor. His main purpose in this movie is just to stand around looking cute and sing love songs, which he does remarkably well, so we can forgive him that. Dixie Lee, Bing Crosby's unfortunate first wife, does very well here as she cracks wise and sings. What makes this B movie extra-special are Burns and Allen as supporting characters, and all their gags are not to be missed. Another thing that makes this movie oh so lovable are the marvelous 30's tunes. My favorites were Dixie Lee's solo "You Got Me Doin' Things" and Joe's midnight lullaby to Dixie, "Let Me Sing You to Sleep". Joe also gives a very lovely rendition of the Tchaikovsky's "Nur Wer Die Sehnsucht Kennt".<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie suffers when it takes a melodramatic turn in the last 10 minutes but the ending is happy (it's a comedy after all!) and Burns and Allen save the ending somewhat with their antics. Despite all the film's small faults, it's terribly charming, and if you like 30's comedies or musicals I highly recommend it. It'll leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.
