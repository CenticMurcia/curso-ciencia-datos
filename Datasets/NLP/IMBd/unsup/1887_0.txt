This movie is not bad it is MORE than bad. It is really terrible and is one of the worst films I have ever seen. When I saw this movie for 11 months ago it was the first real time I wanted to kill the director MORE than once. The movie shouldn't been titled: Hellgate. It's real name should have been: Welcome viewers, welcome to Hell.
