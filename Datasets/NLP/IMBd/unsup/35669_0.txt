This is quite possibly the worst show I have ever seen in a long time. Don't get me wrong, I don't watch TV to be properly informed about what is going on in the world or to try and figure out the inner secrets of the existentialism. I watch TV for what it is, pure entertainment. You should know that by now, and before I digress... I had to force myself to sit there and watch all six episodes. The script is absolutely horrible and only an idiot wouldn't see that it's chock full of painfully obvious plot holes which they try and cover up with lots of quotes from the bible. I have to admit when I first saw Fred Durst, I wasn't really sure if that was really him, I think I spent more time trying to figure out if it that was really him or not than I did trying to figure out how this show would end. The two main characters remind me of a show I once saw a while back, oh yeah, it was called X-Files. The always doubtful scientist paired with the always believing believer. I mean they should have just called this X-Files 2 or something, it's that painfully obvious they are ripping it off, and I'm not even an X-Files fan. The worst part of this whole show is that they waste 200 hours of your life just to lead into episode six which is supposed to tie in all the clues from 1-5 together and while they do, its very clumsily done. If you hadn't figured out by the end of episode one what's going to happen 2-5 and after watching those episodes what would happen in episode six, you probably enjoyed this show. You may as well watch the Stand. Though that had a much better story line to it as it was based off an actual book and it had something called a "plot".
