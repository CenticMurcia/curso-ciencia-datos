What a load of toilet this film was. I've seen it twice now and I really cant say anything nice about it other than the sex scenes were okay - but more on that in a moment.<br /><br />Based on Bram Stoker's novel The Jewel of the Seven Stars (itself not a very interesting book) this tells the story of blah blah blah. Quite frankly, after ten minutes I couldn't care less. The acting is total nosh and you never really understand anything that goes on.<br /><br />*** Now for Spoilers *** Now the sex scenes: how can that fat bloke pull so many babes? Come on, they're only fillers to keep you from turning off.<br /><br />And what's with that humping in the bath got to do with anything? Why is that maid spying? Who is getting rogered in the tub? And why does the door handle bleed? If you're thinking about this film, just don't. Get the slightly better (but not by much) Hammer Horror Blood From the Mummy's Tomb.
