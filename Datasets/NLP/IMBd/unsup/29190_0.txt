An awesome play on social queues and common expectations in the public place. What is right and what is wrong? This film takes everything we learn that is "correct" and turns it upside down. Showing situations that would normally shock anyone, though the characters glide through these incredibly awkward scenarios with ease. When I saw it, I wasn't sure what to feel. This was almost an Alice In Wonderland-like place where all your ideals went out the window. There is praise for murder, drunken monks, and tourist attractions taken as pornographic. Almost no logic was involved in the creation of this film, but respectively I adore the dream-like universe Bunuel has created.
