I watched the series when it first appeared on TV back in 1976. A VCR and a DVD-player were unknown back then, and I always hoped that one day I could have the movie in my possession. When it was finally possible to tape and save movies, I often wondered whether 'I, Claudius' would be for sale on the market. Recently, I found out that you could buy the DVD, I mean really, it was already for sale back in 2001 and I DIDN'T KNOW !!! (geezes). I searched the internet and bought the DVD, watched it together with my 13 year old son, and he loved it as much as I did back then and now. He will use it for his Latin project. One word only : Magnificent !!!
