Watching the beautifully restored print on TCM, I had to remind myself that this was the early 1930's; it has a certain contemporary feel, which belies the fact the film was made 70 years ago. What seems "blatantly racist" in 2004 was really quite realistic in 1934, not to mention that the novel was written some years before that. An audience needs to accept the storyline as is, and marvel in the excellent production of the picture and the marvelous performances. I found it to be historical rather than dated...although that last line is, inarguably, ridiculous.<br /><br />Watch it, enjoy it...that sure don't make 'em like THAT any more!
