I just hate this movie. I'm a teenager myself and this movie disgusted me. For one, the main character in the film ,Georgia, was hideous looking. Oh my God i wanted to leave as soon as her face appeared. Now, now, before you go and reply back or whatever, hear me out, good god. Anyway, back to the movie itself. Her as a character is a completely different story. The way the characters put emphasis on their way of speaking made me just cringe, like i had to cover my ears it was so loud. The parenting was just disgusting. Like, in the end "I'm going to take you to your first night club!" as her mother said. WHAT THE HELL?! She's fourteen and SHES GOING TO A NIGHT CLUB?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That's just. OH my god. <br /><br />The story line is over used. Honestly, i think I'm actually going to read the books so i could get the REAL story and not some Hollywood trash they brought out. This movie was rated PG when i went to see it, it should be PG 13. Let me give you some examples<br /><br />"LETS GO BOY STALKING!" "Yeah, my mom could put a whole pencil case in her boobs." "Well YOU DID ask what it was like being felt up!" "OH my God, you're like, going 7 on the scale already?!"(which basically means sex in what i heard from the movie. I don't know)<br /><br />They put so much slang into their way of speaking, i should have brought a translator. Good Lord. <br /><br />I have so much more to say, but this movie's so bad, i don't think it's even worth it. <br /><br />I'd give it a ZERO, even a negative one if i could.<br /><br />This movie is worse than EPIC movie. Id rather see THAT than this pile of trash. Just don't see it. Just don't i beg you. I wasted my money. <br /><br />Also this is my first review ever. How lucky! Expect plenty more from me in the near future.
