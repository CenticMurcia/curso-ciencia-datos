Guy likes girl, guy is terminally ill, guy wants to save girl from getting hurt so guy makes girl hate him so she can forget him and he can die in peace.<br /><br />Sound familiar???? No s#$%. This line can be used to describe a large number of movie in the past the most recent being Bluffmaster. Only in this case we know from the beginning that he is not actually dying.<br /><br />Well with reference to the above its safe to say that one cannot have any expectations from this movie. All one can expect it a run of the mill slapstick comedy with over the top humour and funny one liners and hugely over-exaggerated characters.<br /><br />Not that thats bad we Indian feast on such comedies. We love to leave all our sensibilities at home and forget all the plot inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies of the film and just have laugh.<br /><br />But this movie is just to bad. Bad enough that they have to rely on jokes we cracked as kids and received as sms's on the phone. PATHETIC!! The acting is not really bad its of the same quality you would expect in any such slapstick comedy only problem is that the jokes are really so pathetic and the timing so bad that its difficult to laugh. Special mention for Rajpal Yadav who gets credit for being as if not more annoying then Johny Lever in less that 10 films hot on his trail is Boman Irani who of he continues these roles will no doubt catch up with him.Anupam Kher must have been really broke to have accepted the role in this film.<br /><br />They only saving grace of this film is Mallika Sherawat who plays the sexy sultry seductress to the hilt and carry the entire film on her shoulders with some help from Akshaye Khanna who deserved much better than this. The only few genuinely funny scenes in this movie all involve Mallika or akshaye with one particular scene being the one at the funeral.<br /><br />Also i don't know Ayesha takia was hardly given any comic sequences when will Indian filmmakers realise that women (besides the seductress) can be funny tooo.<br /><br />The songs save for one are all forgettable and i doubt the one that is OK will leave its mark too.<br /><br />All in all a totally avoidable movie the only funny scenes are almost all in the teasers. Definitely not worth watching but if it coming on TV and you nothing better to do don't change the channel you may end up seeing a few funny scenes.
