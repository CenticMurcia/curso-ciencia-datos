Wow this was a great movie! The acting and comedy was incredible, along with cutting edge (for its time) special effects. Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are a hilarious duo, backed up by Bruce Willis's fantastic performance. I've seen this movie countless times, and it just gets better and better. The best of all time! They need to re-release it into theaters!
