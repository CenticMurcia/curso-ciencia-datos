My then 19 year old Son and I watched this movie on television about a year or so ago. I told him that he had to watch it because it was the funniest movie that I ever saw. He laughed so hard during the entire movie that I am and must find the DVD. This movie is a classic. It is a great movie to watch with one's family during the Holidays. A classic indeed. Another reason for me looking for this movie is that I have a girlfriend who at one point in her life was suing everyone that came across her path. That is what really got me on the search. Both Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis were a crack up. I loved her patience, while he was off on a rampage.
