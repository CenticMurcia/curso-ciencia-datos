big budget(ish) and minor stars. felt sorry for bob newheart acting in this drivel must need the money to retire to Florida!. the funny bit's wern't funny. the plot couldn't have been believed even if it were written by god himself on stone tablet. the acting was diabolical especially from kyle mcclachlan, who can actually act he must need the money for his own production or something. noah wyle stank. the hot eye candy was a dog and pathetic at acting. the script and dialogue was awful as were the set pieces.. a total waste of 1 hour 45 minutes.. want the same experience but feel less cheated i suggest you put your head in a gas oven for that length of time but make sure the gas is off first.
