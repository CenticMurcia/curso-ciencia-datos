I saw this film for the first time at the tender age of four...and absolutely loved it. For years afterward I collected Godzilla films, and for me, Destroy All Monsters (or Kill all Monsters as I misremembered it) was my holy grail. Well, I finally got ahold of it (of course, by then it had been 14 years, and I was 18). I was *hugely* disappointed. There isn't anywhere near enough footage of the monsters, what footage there is often substandard or stock footage. The more obscure (read less popular) monsters have about 30 seconds of screen time, and lame retreads like the T-rex from King Kong Escapes get more screen time than Manda or Varan. Who gets all the screen time? A plucky band of humans in a rocketship. Very lame. The final "climatic" battle is just every monster Toho ever made vs. Ghidra...hmm...I wonder who'll win? Well since Rodan, Godzilla and Rodan did it by themselves in Ghidra's first appearance, what's the likelyhood that he can beat all of them? Its a very short sequence, and, somewhat predictably, all of the minor monsters don't even really participate. If you want to see good multiple monster Toho action, I recommend Ghidra, Monster Zero or perhaps Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla or Terror of Mechagodzilla. Believe me, I'm a big G-fan, but this movie is one of the worst.
