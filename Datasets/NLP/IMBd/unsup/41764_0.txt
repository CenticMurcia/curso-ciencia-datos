Usually, I'm not a friend of really harsh critics, but to my regret, I can't find a single good thing about that movie. There is no tension, no action, no humor, no erotic...nothing, but boredom. Not even for friends of Mia Farrow like me it's interesting. Most of the plot seems to consist of questions, which are not very interesting and the answers neither. Sorry, but this movie is just a waste of time and money. And it's such a pity, because I anticipates so much. I thought, it would be an eerie and exciting haunted house movie- and than that!!! So, let me give You the advice: Don't watch it! I really wonder, how it could be realized. Which producer is interested in such a lame script? Maybe they hoped to make money with the mere name of Mia Farrow.
