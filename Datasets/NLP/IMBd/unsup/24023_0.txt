From Stephen T. Kay (of "The Shield" fame) comes a Get Carter 're-make', but viewers shouldn't treat this as a re-make of the film - rather a modern re-interpretation of the book "Jack's Return Home" (1970). The basic premise is the same, an injustice followed by revenge - but this film is an excellent work in it's own separate right. The limited connections between the films are the book, the film title and a few references to the 1971 film (and Caine's presence in both). There is a lot of "film snobbery" out there about Stallone and it's true that he's had his fair share of c*** films, but this isn't one of them. His acting would put a lot of people to shame, in fact it's a superb performance (also see "Copland"). His presence dominates his scenes, only Caine and Mickey Rourke's presence competes. The supporting actors are very good too and the storyline is such that if you blink you'll miss the thread. People who say "I didn't get it", frankly just need to see the film again. It definitely deserves multiple viewings. Also, look how many comments the film has - always a good guide as to whether a film has made an impact or not - twice as many as the original and 2/3 as many as Taxi Driver.....<br /><br />Not to mention the film is beautifully shot, brilliantly edited and has a Greeaaat soundtrack!
