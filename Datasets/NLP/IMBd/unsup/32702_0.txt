Did any of the actors put any thought while reading the script. Or they just had nothing better to do with there time. I thought How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days sure had its perks. This movie started out good, a good Hollywood setting, about the adventures and misadventures of romance in L.A. But as the film went on it just really got bad, and annoying to sit through. My thoughts on this is, who wrote this stupidity anyone dares to call it self a movie script. The characters seriously become very unsympathetic. Poppy Montgomery and Tori Spellings characters make this film very unwatchable. Not that they are bad actress's, they just deserve better then this.
