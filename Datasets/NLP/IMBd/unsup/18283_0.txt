This used to love this show! I used to watch it with my twin sister on VHS from the video shop when we were about 6 or 7. It ruled and the plots were happily remembered (the good old days they were). About four months ago, I was surfing about on YouTube when I type "The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" up. I first watch the intro (which was cool) then I watch an episode or two. I love them! I mad for that show again. Old memories are rediscovered and I kept on watching more and more episodes off the Internet! Life is good again. But there is only one problem: it's not on normal television! I think the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 or Five should consider bringing back this show. Kids of today will love it and the morals are beyond the best. Yes, the morals, AOSTH had meaningful morals like: "Go to the library" or "Don't go off with strangers" or "Tell a teacher if you are being bullied". I'm afraid the other Sonic cartoons don't have that kind of thought into their cartoons. Sonic Underground sucked and there wasn't meaning to it but to make money! Sonic's so called cousins from that series were stupid and unappealing. Sonic X is alright, a bit violence but just alright but it can't beat the 1993 DiC AOSTH series. I have never the other Sonic the Hedgehog Series by DiC and hopefully I never will! The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog really needs to be brought back to British Terrestrial Television...and Fast! P.S I also loved Stracth the Robo Chicken and Grounder the Drill Arm Robot from this series. Life was never the same without them! Stuff Coconuts the Robo Monkey, he was a nobody and he stank! 9/10
