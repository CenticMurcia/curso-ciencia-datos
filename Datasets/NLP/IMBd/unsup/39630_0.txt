This is actually one of those productions (I wouldn't be willing to call this a movie) I regret I can't vote a '0' for... The plot (story? What story???) is pathetic nonsense throughout, a script obviously non-existent, acting is ridiculous, f/x are more than poor (even for low-budget standards) - all in all this is a complete waste of time (not a waste of talent though, as there simply is none at all...), nothing more or less than disgusting dreck! Better avoid it if you can. 1/10
