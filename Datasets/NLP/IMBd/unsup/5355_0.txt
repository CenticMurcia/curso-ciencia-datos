A very mediocre adaption of Jules Verne indeed, even if it appears to include bits from every story Verne ever wrote. Although obviously enjoying the Thai sunshine, the cast do little to help the inane script along. Patrick Stewart valiantly tries, but sadly looking an Arabian Dress Up Party as the sinister Captain Nemo, Kyle MacLachlan does his usual Twin Peaks wooden routine, while the Pirate Captain gives a terrible impersonation of Robert Newton's Long John Silver. Add to this some dismal animation of huge bugs, spiders, snakes and birds that look like they are made of plastic and escaped from an Insect Spray Commercial. The scale was awkward to say the best of it, the original King Kong had smoother animation than this lot. We deserve much better after 70 years and digital technology. Verne seems to adapt best to the screen with some Spielberg like tongue in cheek attitude, which is sadly lacking in this film. The whole thing plods along to its obvious conclusion, without any credit to anyone involved. Main mystery is why they made it, but possibly inspired by the success of the TV series LOST.
