Starts out sorta creepy. Kids dying. Don't really want to see that anywhere, even in a movie. Yet as a parent, it really hits home. My wife who normally falls asleep even in the best of action movies stayed awake thru the entire flick. Mostly because we were both hoping for justice. We got WAY less than that. Not only was the ending a "What the hell?", but we COULD NOT understand or comprehend was the last printed lines in the movie: <br /><br />"A fireman was exhumed in 2006 and cleared of the murders. Nobody has been convicted of the crimes to date."<br /><br />What? There were no firemen in the movie! What happened to the psychiatrist gone bad? You can't expect people to pay money to rent your videos to give them cr@p like this. Never mind paying box office prices. And you wonder why bitemetorrent is as popular as it is.<br /><br />You'll wind up getting a rep for pushing the "artistic license" window, and people will stay away. Far away. Especially producers.
