I am not really sure why I am still giving it 3 stars. I spent my valuable $s to watch this movie in theater and believe me I was really upset (IMDB would not let me write prohibited words...WTF) to watch it. Just figured out that the story wasn't even original and is mostly based on B&C. And, still, the guy claims that the story was his concept? Are Bollywood directors so impudent? Or just admit that we lack originality and creativity in our film industry.<br /><br />A couple of other movies that come to mind that have been copied include Aamir (copy of some Columbian movie), Life in Metro (certain segment taken scene-to-scene from The Apartment) and Ek Chhoti Si Love Story (A Short Story About Love). All the non-Desi counterparts of these movies are excellent.
