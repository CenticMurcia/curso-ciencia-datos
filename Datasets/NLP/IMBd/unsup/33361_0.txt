I went out of my way to see this film, dragging my naieve roommate with me. I saw it at our local second run theatre for a more expensive price than usual as it was not a main film there. <br /><br />I love Amy Sedaris. She is probably the funniest comedian I have ever come across. Strangers with Candy however felt like an comedy skit that was stretched from the humorous 5 minute length to 90 minutes. Granted, there were a lot of people in the theatre laughing out loud, but I found these were people already familiar with the director, other actors and the type of off-beat comedy it was going to be. Being a big fan of Sedaris is not enough to carry you through this movie. It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was getting close. I agree with another post on here that says that if your humour is middle of the road, you may not like or get the comedy in this film. I like dry humour, British humour, but am a fan of all of it overall. I didn't get this comedy though, I just didn't find it funny. You can only laugh so hard at slapstick, weird teeth and deranged teachers for so long, in my case about 5 minutes. I was very disappointed and do not recommend this movie for anyone outside that small clique whose personality type can only be described as "sideshow."
