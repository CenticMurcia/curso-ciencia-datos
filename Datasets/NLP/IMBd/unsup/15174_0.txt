Finally, the question that has been nagging cinephiles for two years has been answered -- will there ever be a film that's worse than Eating Out? The answer is an unqualified "Yes, Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds." <br /><br />The script is completely predictable at every turn -- the opening even has two guys ripping at each other's clothing that dissolves into a fantasy sequence featuring one guy and his annoying girlfriend -- I didn't see that one coming. The direction by Philip J. Bartel is, well, sloppy and the actors appear to recite their lines of dialogue rather than deliver them in a believable manner that suits the characters. The sets look like they were put up an hour before filming and could collapse at any moment. Production values are nonexistent. The awful, awful director of the first film, Q Allan Brocka, even appears as an extra in this one in the scene with the nude male model. Brocka is seated right in front of him to get a good look at his genitals. Perv.<br /><br />How do films like this get financed when there are so many good screenplays languishing on shelves? Avoid this at all costs.It's not even bad-movie good.
