Ricky Mabe is Benjamin Stiles, a teenage prankster sent to live with his estranged Grandfather at a large, spacious mansion in Maine. The film follows young Stiles as he confronts a perplexing supernatural mystery that engulfs his grandfather's sprawling estate. The film has a very crisp, polished look to it, thanks to an excellent to-video transfer. The acting is for the most part excellent, particularly in the case of Jan Rubes, who plays Benjamin's grandfather. The story is constructed and executed effectively, right up until the end, where the film's greatest weakness lies. The manner and speed with which the mystery is solved will undoubtedly leave many viewers disappointed. It left this reviewer thinking the writer, having developed a truly interesting web of mystery, was at a loss in finding an effective way to have it solved, and finally settled on a climax which reeks of rushed carelessness. Too bad, as the rest of this film is a lot of fun, and is suitable for family viewing. Also, young viewers are less likely to feel cheated by the ending. There are no scenes of shocking violence (or foul language), in this picture. In all, an above average and at times truly spooky film, suitable for the entire family. Just how many films can any reviewer say that about?
