Avoid at all cost!<br /><br />After seeing this movie I understand why there is not a single positive comment listed here: it's because this movie does not deserve any!<br /><br />The director is either completely unskilled, or he tried to go beyond what did lay within his capacities. This movie is a confusing mixture of a dime-a-dozen teenage horror flick and a story told through flashbacks/flash forwards which end up confusing everyone as to what is going on. Every time the 'regular' action gets remotely interesting, there is a cut to another scene in which the main character has some stupid therapy session. How boring!<br /><br />Seriously, I cannot believe this drivel was released. What amazes me even more is that the director has since directed many more movies - you'd expect the studios to never want him on a set again.<br /><br />The only thing remotely redeeming about this movie is the short scene in which the main character strips her pants off. And that's pretty sad.<br /><br />The effects are horrible (men in suits, fake fangs and with yellow contacts... ooh scary...), there is no plot to speak of (if you find it, let met know) and there is nothing exciting or fun about it.
