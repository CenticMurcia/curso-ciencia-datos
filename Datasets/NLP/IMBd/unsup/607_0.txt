Omg! I love days, it is so awesome. I have been watching it off and on with my mom, but now we have Tivo and we see it everyday. I love how everyone's secrets are coming out... slowly but surely. The only thing, only thing i don't like about this show is that it takes a mighty long time for the truth to come out or for something to happen, but i think that is what makes it a good show. I love it so much i am obsessed with the show. I want Shawn and Belle to be together and i want Stephanie with Max and Chelsea could take a hike because she is just so evil.I want Bo and Hope to be together and I want Billie and Lockhart to be together. What happened to Marlena? I want Jack to die already,(sorry) so Jen and Frankie could have a chance with their marriage, and i think Jack is just spoiling it, and Maggie moves around so fast first she was on Austin's rooftop and then the next scene she is at the infamous hospital baby sitting Jack. It's so ironic, yet interesting.
