Actually, for the short number of years W C Fields worked in Hollywood, this is one of his better films. It features Edgar Bergen & his dummies Charlie McCarthy & Mortimer Snerd. All these stars have good sequences. The idea of getting these stars together came from the old time radio show feuds they were having on the radio. If your into old time radio, get a hold of some of these classics.<br /><br />The film itself is ghost written by Fields about a crafty circus owner, Larson E. Whipsnade who is always one step ahead of bankruptcy & the law at every town he stops in. He is trying to help his daughter go to college.<br /><br />The best sequence is when Larson E Whipsnade is selling tickets to his shows & a couple of seedy characters give him a large bill to make change of to pay for the tickets. Whipsnade counts out the bills like he is giving them too much change by doubling the bills over. The cons don't realize this until they try to take off with the extra change.<br /><br />They return indignant to the ticket window because they have been shorted. Then Larson E. makes his most famous quote when refusing their refund, "Count your change before leaving the window!" The film itself is solid except for the ending which is a little fuzzy as to where the film is going from here. If it was left that way on purpose, no sequel was ever considered.
