Okay first I will give you a little run down I first rented this movie because I thought I heard good things about this movie. Later on in the night I started to watch it. I decided to smoke a little reefer before then started to watch at first I was thinking to myself okay not the best but maybe it will get better. I was really wrong. Who ever it was idea to put rock music on the movie you have to be out your mind I was high and thought to myself I must be out of it so I still continued to watch and sat through the whole movie. The story line sucked I could not believe this was allowed to be written I have seen some not so good movies but this got right to the top of the list.<br /><br />I decided I had to watch it again sober to make sure I wasn't on a trip. I tried to watch it last night but I fell asleep twice.<br /><br />I decided to watch it again today and I have to say I wasn't on a bad trip but I did rewind the DVD to the beginning of the music to make sure I was hearing what I was hearing. They only thing I liked out of this whole movie was the fact that the fat book keeper said 2 funny things and the German thieves kept acting like cowboys.<br /><br />I still can not believe this movie I was looking for a great World War 2 movie to watch and I get this. I feel very ashamed to even say I watched it.
