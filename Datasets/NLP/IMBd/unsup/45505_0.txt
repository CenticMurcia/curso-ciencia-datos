I went to the premiere here in Portugal. I attended for free and with friends, otherwise I probably wouldn't have gone.<br /><br />Being a fan of wrestling as I am, really has little impact on one enjoying this movie or not. Although the acting can be considered decent for a run-of-the-mill action movie, it's undermined by poor and lazy writing and directing.<br /><br />The writing fails to deliver, mainly because it fails to follow up on what you see in the trailer: the contrast between the extreme violence some of us come to and the people that profit or witness that very same violence. Seeing as they take the premises from "The Running Man" with Schwarzenegger and from the Japanese "Battle Royale", one would think "The Condemned" could debate this issue further. Instead, it revisits the superficiality that plagues the common Hollywood action script.<br /><br />As if the absence of story wasn't enough, the action scenes are also poorly directed. Shot from overly tight angles, the fight scenes are hard if not impossible to follow and their resolution is only clear when you no longer see one of the opponents standing.<br /><br />"Bottom line", as Steve Austin would say, is this movie is not worth the time of people who VALUE their time. And unfortunately so.
