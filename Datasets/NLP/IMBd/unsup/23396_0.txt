I just saw this movie and I'm simply disappointed. The movie was boring, the story loses its plot and is out of the track most of the time, only proper acting by well-known actors compensates a bit.<br /><br />The whole story with the prostitute in Will's car is just useless, and I think it was made up as a filler between the main story, because something must be happening in the movie, right?<br /><br />The ending is so screwed up I just can't believe it - I was expecting Will not to hold charges against the boy, but unexpectedly he makes up this stupid story about borrowing his notebook and all that stuff, and his wife confirms that (sic!) - what a nonsense! <br /><br />This movie is a waste of money and time - DON'T WATCH IT! <br /><br />Cheers
