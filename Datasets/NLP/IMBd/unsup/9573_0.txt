This movie, with out a doubt, made me laugh more than any movie I have seen! I love the plot. It's two completely absurd people who fall in love before ever meeting because they're both weirdos!!! It's SO great!!! But that's not all, Amelie decides she wants to do good in the world, make a difference, and she does in the most absurd and hilarious ways.
