After being the root cause of his kid brother's wedding being called off, Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey), a noted womanizer who sees male-female relationships as a strategic game to be enjoyed without becoming ensnared, is visited by the "ghost" of the first girl he ever had sex with. She tells him he will be visited by ghosts of his past, future and present girl friends. These are not ghosts of dead people but possess the shape and memories of the living women. <br /><br />I found the film to be more enjoyable than I expected it would be. I generally don't care much for Matthew McConaughey films. But he surprised me in this one.<br /><br />Although generally considered a romantic comedy, it is not a film aiming for laughs. It is a comedy in the sense of not a tragedy, in that it has a happy ending. Instead of funny, the story aims at giving the audience an emotional response.
