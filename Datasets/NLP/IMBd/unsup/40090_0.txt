I went to see this film, and if it wasn't for other people sitting around us, I would have walked out of the cinema half way through. There is no chemistry between the leading actors. There is very poor character development. Lots of bits of information is thrown in about various characters without linking it to the story. Ashwarya Rai's voice over after a while becomes boring. Lots of other minor characters are added, I think just to fill up the blank pages of the script. The spices are only an excuse to give a movie its title. I am sure some of spice add makers could have done more justice to the spices. The music in places is pathetic. Anupam Kher tries hard with his performance, but fails to add any relevance to the story line. This film does not deserve to be associated with Gurvinder Chadda. Is her name being used for promoting her husbands lacking talent?
