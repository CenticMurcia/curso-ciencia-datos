A true Manmohan Desai film tot he hilt...<br /><br />This was one of the late '70s movies whose mega success defied the logic of all movie pundits. A typical lost-and-found formula of three brothers (brought up in three different religions); the movie stands out for brilliant individual performances and "seeti"(whistle) comedy and dialogues. Besides the All-Time Amitabh in his memorable role as 'Anthony' and star-studded cast, it is the crispy one-liners and dialogues that lifted this movie above all. Practically every song in this movie was big hit e.g. 'Anhonee ko Honee' 'My name is Anthony...', 'Tayab Ali', to name a few. Don't miss to catch all the patented dialogues by the Villains - Pran, Jeevan.<br /><br />Back in my school, I remember my classmates reeling out dialogues at the back of their mind.<br /><br />A must have "Timepass" collection
