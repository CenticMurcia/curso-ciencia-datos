I sat through the first 45 minutes of this film thinking "my goodness, if the pacing were any slower I might lapse into a coma". Even though the scenes were sweet and beautifully shot, it was a complete mystery where the story was headed. I was intrigued by the main character's travelogue- the stories she told were of interest to someone like me who has not been to that part of the world. Similarly, the discussions at the Captain's table among he and the three women were interesting, but no more so than rambling chatter one hears at the average dinner party. I am in amazement that Mr. Malkovich agreed to play the role he did- his lines were stilted and somewhat hackneyed. At the end, when I finally did see where the plot ended up, I was sorry I stuck with it as long as I did. I don't remember the last time I felt so disappointed by a film!
