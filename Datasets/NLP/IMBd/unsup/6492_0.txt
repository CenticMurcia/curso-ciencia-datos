Excellent, excellent work of Billy Crystal as the director of this TV film, which brought me back to the 50-60s when I was still a child. NY Yankees have always been one of the best and most persistent team in any sport during the 20th Century and the present 21st one. This film gave you the story of the feat done by the outfielder Roger Maris when in 1961 he broke the former record of 60 homers done by Babe Ruth in 1927. It is true that when Ruth played each team played 154 games while in 1961 there were already 162, but the fact is that in any league or championship it is a real feat to bat 61 homers, and this is what Maris did. The film was able to draw well the figures of Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris. The first one was the most beloved Yankee player at that time while Maris came to the team just in 1960, so he was not so admired as Mickey. It certainly gave an idea of modesty by Rogers and chaotic life by Mickey at night, the friendship between them, and the way they played. The story is nearly exact, still in Baltimore, Maris had to face powerful pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm, whom he could not bat properly, so he failed to tie the Ruth's record in his 154th game. The pressure during the last games was against his will to break the record, something that he achieved in his last game against the Red Sox. Fans in New York look to be as fans from Rome in soccer, nearly always senseless, without given the appropriate recognition to whom deserves it.
