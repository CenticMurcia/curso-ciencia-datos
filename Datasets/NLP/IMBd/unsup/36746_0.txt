Mel Gibson plays a military test pilot who agrees to become the subject of a cryogenic experiment after the love of his life ends up in an 'irreversable' coma in 1939. Well, the experiment is completely forgotten about and he remains in the deep freeze until he is set free by some kids trespassing in an army warehouse. Mel awakens to find a different world, and, needless to say, love. What do you get when you mix a big star like Gibson with a sappy script and a mediocre director like Steve Minor: A sappy and contrived film. Boy, is it sappy. Boy, is it contrived. This is practically a convention of unwarranted coincidences, unresolved situations and unanswered implications. The film stirs to life on occasion, but it never manages to amount to much.
