Absolutely terrible, I read this novel when I was very young and although I didn't fully understand it, I was as haunted by Rebecca as everyone else in the novel was. When I found the Alfred Hitchcock version, I didn't agree at first with how harsh Maxim always seemed, but the movie really did the book justice, the setting and lighting. This movie however, was much to mushy and didn't follow the characters attitudes at all. Mrs. Van Hopper was portrayed all wrong, and Maxim wasn't handsome and debonair at all. Over all I'd say watch the Alfred Hitchcock version if you want beautiful settings and handsome actors that get to the core of the characters.
