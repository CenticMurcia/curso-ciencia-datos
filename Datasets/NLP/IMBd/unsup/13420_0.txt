Splash is the greatest romantic comedy of all time. Perhaps it even started the entire genre!<br /><br />I thought the story was excellent and John Candy was awsome (too bad he died). Tom Hanks was fine and the girl was ok (anyone could have done here part but it was ok. no biggie). <br /><br />I did think that this script should have been given to a better director which I thought did a mediocre job. Ron Howard -puke! did you see The Grinch -OH! How Awfully boring!! I would like to see A Beautiful Mind but I found out he did it and so therefore it will probably stink.<br /><br />Anyhow, this plays out like a fairy tale and one to remember, a keeper to buy on videotape and play for the kids or yourself.<br /><br />Even though I thought it should have been way way way better, I will give it a 10/10.
