Four youths decide to spend some time "surfing" (i.e. making out), when weird things start to happen.<br /><br />This one grabs you by the throat and doesn't let up. You'll be amazed by the intricate plot and the new (to me) but talented actors. The story is fresh and filled with enough surprises and scares to keep you on the edge of your seat. Darkly beautiful, the photography alone is downright mesmerizing. Several images will stay in your head long after the closing credits. "Lost Things" cleverly avoids the usual Horror pitfalls for a dark and disturbing, not to mention unique vision.<br /><br />So much for that, I can't continue with a straight face. "Lost Things" is nothing of the above, just boring and confused. Two stars out of ten.
