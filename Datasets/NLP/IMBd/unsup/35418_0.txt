XXX the sequel is not really like the first film because XXX played by Ice Cube is not a daredevil and doesn't do all those x-game type of stunts with snowboards or motorcycles. Sam Jackson is back as Gibbons. He breaks Darius Stone, now XXX, out of jail in one of the silliest stunts shown on film. Stone hops around the roof top of the prison like a cricket and hangs onto a helicopter to escape. The plot is also so silly. The bad guy is the secretary of Defense and he is plotting to kill the president and everyone who would succeed him at the Stae of the Union address. This would leave the Secretary next in line for Presidency. And he wants to build an army. It is all so implausible.<br /><br />And the train scene at the end was beyond silly. Stone jumps his car onto subway tracks going over 160 mph. Then stands up and hops onto the back of the train. I guess their wasn't much wind resistance at 160 plus.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Awful, Vin Diesel is not back which is what was good about the first one. I can't believe a movie with this plot got the green light. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this.
