Quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen.<br /><br />It was painful. Anything that makes a good film was absent - I thought at one point that it was a big joke. And the most ludicrous thing was, there were some big names here! Julia Stiles (though I loathe her), Freddie Prinze Jr, Henry Winkler, Selma Blair - even Ashton Kutcher, unrecognisable until halfway through (too long to be watching, I might add!!) in a bizarre role as "Jim Morrison of The Doors" for no good reason. It was try-hard, wannabe and unsuccessful in all aspects - even the main characters appeared to be wincing and cringing at times.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.
