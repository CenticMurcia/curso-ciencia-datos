I highly recommend this game if you like star wars then you will like this game. Good graphics good detail the light saber animations are awesome if you have a high speed processor and videocard like I do the yavin level is visually stunning especially with all resources maxed out you can see the rain fizzle out on the light saber. Definatly a must.
