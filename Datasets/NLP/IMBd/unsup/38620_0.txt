This show stands as a just insult to the entire comedy genre. It's the bastard child of the parody movies and Tom Green if it were born retarded. There is nothing but reoccurring skits and jokes that were never funny in the first place and lame improv skits from lackluster people. I have nothing against sketch comedy and find others such as SNL and the Chappelle show amusing, but where Tim and Eric when it comes to actual humour? It would seem they just stand around and make incoherent juvenile jokes and skits that only make you laugh if you are only drunk enough or dumb enough. This show is utter garbage and should stick to youtube or something where its lame demographic of pathetic 30-45 year losers can watch this on their own convenience and not make other viewers suffer slogging through this waste of space. <br /><br />In summary, do not watch this show if you enjoy life.
