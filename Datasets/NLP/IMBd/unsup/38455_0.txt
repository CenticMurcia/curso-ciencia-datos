Okay, Kirsten Dunst is great and one of the best aspiring actresses today; Randy Quaid made it nearly tolerable; but I can't get over the fact that this was really another typical American attempt to turn people against the system and gain distrust and dispise for authority. It was supposedly a "true" story; thus a real tragedy. The script was also a tragedy and the general story wasn't much better, though it does make one re-evaluate one's standards and perhaps learn something. There are of course much better films that complete this purpose as well. This too-long military demeaning flick is worth missing.
