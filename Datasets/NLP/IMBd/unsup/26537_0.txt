I watched this the other night at the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences special screening and was annoyed at one film historian introducing it telling us to "bear with it"" and making excuses for its pacing and style. I have watched and enjoyed many silent films, but evidently the influence of NIjinsky was not such a good thing on this one. I really found it dull and Douglas Fairbanks was too old for the part and went about it like a ham and cheese sandwich with extra meat. Anna may Wong was very good. the sets were a let down, everything about it was a let down. It doesn't help of course that the Michael Powell Alexander Kora version from the 50s with divine Sabu is one of my favorite films. I enjoyed hearing the rim sky korsakov cut and paste score actually, at least there wasn't some really annoying music slapped on as in the Gloria Swanson version of "rain" "sadie Thompson" also directed by Raoul Walsh and an infinitely better movie.
