this film was far from amazing, D D Lewis was very good and Leo De-Caprio was ok but that's where the praise stops. Diaz was terrible, her character had no layers and was deviod of any emotion. The scripting was inconsistent and the direction was sluggish and jaded. There was hardly any plot and the one that was there was full of holes. The humor some people pointed out distracted from the film rather than added to it, it was needless for a film of this nature, Gangs Of New York is meant to be about rivalry, revenge and drama, and although there were a couple of places where the dark humor really worked there were too many instances where the humor felt like tacted-on Hollywood cheese. If you want to get some cheep thrills by seeing a bit of violence and mild nudity then this is the film for you, if you are looking for a cinematic experience don't bother, it'd be a waste of a 3 hours of your life.
