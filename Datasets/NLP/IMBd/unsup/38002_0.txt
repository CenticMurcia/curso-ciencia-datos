oh god..please save the people who has seen this "comical acting, fatuous direction, futile story, insane dialogues,etc" which gave a non-stop unbelievable maligning experience till the end..people watching this will go into an irrecoverable coma..it was an harrowing experience..<br /><br />the director-what is he trying to make, it looks as though he was completely out of his mind..the viewers will not condone this piece of work..unfortunately this movie has the same director, story-writer, and also the leading actor..at least this time the blame goes to single person..simbhu takes the sole responsibility for making life difficult for viewers..he has given importance in exposing extreme vulgarity..<br /><br />music-this is the only good thing about this movie..it has some good numbers and good background score..but it doesn't make this rubbish watchable..<br /><br />nayanthara and reemasen - i pity them both..i feel that they would have done much better for any other movie..they were doing skin show in this entire movie..reemasen's acting was terrible..nayanthara has and always done glamorous roles..she does it so as to hide her acting inabilities..<br /><br />bottom line-what more to say..if you want to be peaceful please avoid this like dog sh**..if you want to terrorize yourself you are most welcome to watch this A-hole at the highest level..<br /><br />actually i would like to give it zero on 10..<br /><br />but the rating is 1/10
