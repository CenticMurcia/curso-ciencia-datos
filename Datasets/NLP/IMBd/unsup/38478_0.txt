When Grandpa and Grandma Addams get the rare Wontheimer's (?spelling) disease that is slowly turning them normal, Gomez decides to take his family to a family reunion, but end up going to the Adams family reunion instead, while an ordinary couple ends up at the Addams family home. This is the premise for Addams Family Reunion, a rather sorry entry in the Addams Family legacy.<br /><br />I'm generally a big fan of The Addams Family, whether the Chas Addams cartoons, the original television series with John Astin and Carolyn Jones, or the first two movies with Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston. I was not impressed by the animated series (neither the 70's nor the 90's versions) though I won't claim to have seen every episode. And I didn't like The New Addams Family television series (1998-1999) either.<br /><br />And that is my problem with Addams Family Reunion. It doesn't have the comedic charm of the original TV series, and it doesn't have the dark humor and closeness to the original cartoons of the Sonnenfeld movies. It does however have the feel of The New Addams Family, and indeed, coming out at the same time as that series, it seems that this was released to promote and be an introduction to that series.<br /><br />This movie fails on several levels. The humor just isn't funny and it lacks the darkness of the other entries in the Addams Family archives.<br /><br />Second, there seems to be a lot of miscasting here. I really like Tim Curry and thought that he would make a good Gomez. But for some reason, he just doesn't manage to pull it off in this one. Someone else commented that he did a "bad Raul Julia impression" and that pretty much sums it up perfectly. Darryl Hannah clearly tries to pull off her role as Morticia but she just isn't made for this role. The child actors playing the children and the actor doing Fester, simply do a poor job. Totally unconvincing and annoying.<br /><br />I don't expect much of a plot in The Addams Family-it's not the strong point of any of these works (and doesn't need to be for its enjoyment) but this one was just too ridiculous to work.<br /><br />There was an attempt, I think, to try and pull away from some of the traditions of the earlier entries and add some new things (like the man-eating mailbox) but the filmmakers seemed to miss the fact that most fans of the Addams Family want to see the old clich√©s and traditions.<br /><br />I didn't find this a very entertaining movie, but it might be worth watching if you're an Addams Family completest and you will probably enjoy it if you were a fan of The New Addams Family TV series.
