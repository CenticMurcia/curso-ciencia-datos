Lindsay Lohan is a wonderful Lola. She really did the Drama Queen very well. Also Alison Pill did well as lola's best friend, Ella.I really like the character Ella, because she was a goody-tow-shoes who thought she was going to grow up and be like her parents, but she goes past that and faces her fears with Lola. "Because of you I'm brave enough to be different." is one of my favorite quotes by Ella.<br /><br />Sam, the boy Lola likes besides Stu Wolf, should have been in there WAY more. The first time I saw Lola, Sam, and Ella all together as a trio i loved them. They're such a cute trio! Sam popped in and out of the movie only a few times.<br /><br />I can connect to Lola in a few ways. One way is i think of music the same way as her. It was kind of scary at the part when she gets disapointed when she finds out Stu Wolf is a drunk and she can't talk about his music with him, something like that just recently happened to me. I found out some stuff like that about one of my favorite singers that I was disapointed about. But i still love their music.<br /><br />Another way i connect with Lola is her daydreams. I kind of have the same daydreams as her. I loved how they did that in the movie, with the cardboard-like pieces and everything. I thought that was cool.<br /><br />Carla, the mean girl of the school, was not like i thought she'd be like in the beginning, but as the movie went on she got meaner and meaner. I got so mad at her when she was telling everyone that Lola didn't go to the party and everyone believed her, because I know how Lola must have felt. If I had the chance to meet a star that a girl I hated wanted to meet so bad AND crashed his party, and then no one believed me, I'd feel really bad and annoyed.<br /><br />The play at the end of the movie was ok. Some parts of it was cool, sometimes it was a little bit strange. Maybe it was because I didn't see My Fair Lady.<br /><br />The scene at the end when she sings "That Girl" was really cool too. I really like that song, but the song that got to me the most was the very last song when she explained the end of the story with Sam and everything. I haven't gotten the soundtrack yet, but I want it really bad, mainly to hear this song. I was listening to the lyrics, and I instantly loved this song. It's sung by lindsay, and it's about changing the world. I always have new songs that describe myself, but this may be the newest song to add to my list. Hopefully i'll get the soundtrack soon.<br /><br />The teacher was really goofy and one of the reasons this movie was so funny. i went to see this movie with some friends and i was sitting on the end with one of my best friends next to me, and we kept giggling. There are many parts in this movie that are really, really funny.<br /><br />Another thing in this whole story that got to me and really made me think was the change Lola caused. she caused a change in her best friend, a change in the most popular girl in school that also wanted all the attention, and a wonderful change in her rock star crush, Stu Wolf. "A wonderful person told me I was a drunk. And I didn't like it." I think the quote by him was something like that. When i saw the whole scene with Lola and Ella when her friend told her how she had changed her life, i couldn't help thinking, "I wish I could do something like that for someone." I want to make a difference, just like Lola.<br /><br />I think if you made a few changes here and there this could actually end up being my story. Except you'd need to change the title too. I think Confessions of a Teenage Dreamer would do the trick.In conclusion, this movie was good. I think the book might be a little better though. I can't wait to read it! I'd give it a 7/10.
