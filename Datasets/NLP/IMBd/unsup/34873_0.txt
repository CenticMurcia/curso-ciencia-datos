I have seen numerous bad movies over time, a result of a masochistic pleasure that my friends and I share in bashing horrid movies. I have seen The Final Stab, Cellular, Queen of the Damned, Jeepers Creepers, and Sleepover. And yet, despite all of this, Robots wins for the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Why is this? Why is this movie so bad that it ranks below Sleepover and The Final Stab? Simply because the aforementioned movies were all bad enough to be good. No matter how much they sucked, I managed to find some pleasure in watching them. Robots, on the other hand, was simply painful to watch, and elicited no pleasure whatsoever. The few jokes this movie possessed were either ripped from other movies and pop culture (a dying robot singing Daisy- what could have been a lovely joke, except that 1. It was ripping off a better movie and 2. The target audience has likely never heard of said better movie) or the yawn-inducing crude humor meant to impress modern five year olds who couldn't live without video games. Robin Williams added no amusement, as he tried yet again to reproduce the genius he managed to possess in Aladdin.<br /><br />Please, whatever you do, do not see this movie. It is painful to watch. Literally.
