This is one of Chan's Hong Kong-movies, and it seems to lack much of the basics that makes his better movies, well, better. When it comes to the fighting scenes, they aren't that bad. They are typical Chan-fighting scenes which involves many items in special ways. They are also funny, and especially one of them lasts long. Apart from that, there are nothing good in this movie. The story is nearly non-existing. This comes as no surprise, especially when we know that the story got changed from the Chinese to the English version. I really have to warn people from watching this movie only based on the film's cover. Here's why: There's a black man on the cover. Where the heck was he in the movie? I didn't see the blonde girl on the cover in the movie either. And military airplanes? If you haven't guessed it already: There are no such planes in the movie. If the movie had been any good, I guess they wouldn't have to make a halfway fake cover like they have.
