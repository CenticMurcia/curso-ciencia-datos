SHERLOCK HOLMES IN WASHINGTON is one of the better Holmes and Watson capers. Directed by Roy William Neil, the master of deductive reasoning Sherlock Holmes(Basil Rathbone)and his often bumbling parter Dr. Watson(Nigel Bruce)make a trip to Washington, D.C. after a top-secret agent is kidnapped and murdered after passing off hidden valuable microfilm inside the cover of a matchbook. WWII Nazi spies use an antique furniture shop as a front for their misdeeds and acts of treason. Holmes is pretty hard to get the best of even on this side of the Atlantic. It is humorous that Watson is baffled by bubble gum. A young Marjorie Lord is very impressive. Also in the cast: Henry Daniell, George Zucco, John Archer and Thurston Hall.
