1st watched 11/19/2002 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Paul Levine): Boring, slow-moving movie that eventually becomes about a couple of people trying to steal from one another the high-tech way(thru swiss bank accounts). It's a sad thing when the best you can say about a movie is a person's figure and looks. I'm sorry but I have to say it, the best thing about this movie is Kari Wuhrer's body. The rest of the movie was boring, worthless, and a ridiculous waste of money(for those who made it and for those who purchase or rent it). I waited, and waited, and waited for this movie to be over and guess what. it finally ended!! I guess I've pretty much said enough. Don't invest in this loser.
