It's a film about the personal adventure of discovering and pioneering a new country. It speaks of survival on one side - and the heroism and self-deprecation of the other. From opportunists, to isolationists - from patriots to disenchanted lovers - the film has everything a man or woman would enjoy (actually just a man). Bravery, courage, intrigue, romance, beauty and love., and tons of great jokes and humour! Watching this film is to step back to a world that doesn't exist any longer - yet to know it. It is to experience lives that have never been lived - but could have been real. It is to know pain and joy, pride and pity for characters that are a fiction - yet are so real that you can't help but get lost in their story.<br /><br />Amazing cast, memorable dialogue, unforgettable story. Through this film, Chris Farley will always live in my heart. Seeing it for the first time is truly the start of a romance with ideals that will live in you long after credits end.
