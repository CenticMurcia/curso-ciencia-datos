This is a film that caught me totally by surprise in so many ways. It was easily the finest film I've seen in a long time -- and therefore I'm not surprised by the polarized opinions regarding it.<br /><br />First: I never expected to find a movie called "The Anarchist Cookbook" at my local video store.<br /><br />Second: It is not what I expected from a movie of that title.<br /><br />Third: After defying my expectations, it then turned out to be something better than I imagined it could / would be.<br /><br />What is NOT surprising is the stupidity of the people who have written about it. I guess my missive is directed at the other people who have seen it and at the other people who DARE TO WATCH IT WITH AN OPEN MIND (a cardinal sin in this day and age.)<br /><br />What made Anarchist stand out for me is its unrelenting intelligence. It doesn't just quote Wittgenstein -- it MISQUOTES Wittgenstein! When I first heard that, I was shocked and I wondered, "What does this film think it is?" But as I started to absorb the rhythms of Puck, I started to understand what a poseur he is. That him (mis)quoting Wittgenstein was perfectly in character. That is something I have never seen in a film. (Yes, I've seen dumb characters. And I've seen characters who were dumb who thought they were smart. BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN it done in a way that does not draw attention to itself!)<br /><br />That whole Wittgenstein-thing made me reexamine the enitre film and made me worry that Mr. Susman is not just smart -- but he might be too smart for today's dumb audiences.(more about this later.)<br /><br />As Puck goes down the rabbit-hole, and the film turned from comedy to drama, I got a sneaking suspicion that I had seen something like this before. And then I realized: IT'S HAMLET!!!<br /><br />Puck is the Danish Prince who needs to get off his existentially lazy ass and do something. Like Hamlet, he blows every opportunity. It would be too much of a stretch to call Double D his Ophelia, but you get the point. And unlike Hamlet, Puck ends up doing the right thing, and we the audience root for him -- and laugh as well at sweet fortune that comes his way.<br /><br />In an era of irony upon irony, Susman has created an uber-irony: the subject of its wrath (and there is wrath amongst the mirth)is not just ideology, but platitudes. Of course the film is going to tick off anarchists -- because, please, there are no real anarchists. Anyone who says they're a genuine anarchist is either a liar, an idiot or both. What there does seem to be alot of though, are ignorant movie-watchers who cannot bear that their little PC shibboleths would be the object of scorn and satire. Yes this film makes fun of anarchists and hippies. But it also makes fun of Republicans and cops and everyone else who comes onto the screem. It uses humor, wit and dramatic narrative to kick every ideology in the nuts.<br /><br />Now as for the boneheads who think Fight Club is art...<br /><br />This movie is not Fight Club pt2. Fight Club is (sorry to say) a frightfully stupid film. What was it even about? Brad Pitt's abs? Yes, this film has voiceover and a bad apple character who takes over the life of a ennui-plagued young man -- yeah so? Unlike Fight Club, this film had the cajones to be about something. To make you actually think. And the twist at the end of this film was genuine, real, and funny as hell. The twist in Fight Club was probably the dumbest twist on celluloid -- ever. (Brad Pitt IS Ed Norton...Give me a break!)<br /><br />And as for those who compare it to SLC Punk...I see some similarities there as well. But that film was so poorly executed, so solipsistic and narrow in its focus, and so one-dimensional in its story that it left you wondering, "Who cares?"<br /><br />That said. Rent this movie. While not a shocking piece of cinema, it is a brilliant piece of filmmaking. It's the type of movie that studios don't make (because of the title), that film festivals don't like (because it's not PC enough to be at Sundance).<br /><br />This movie is for people with hearts, brains and balls. If you got that, then you should give this movie a try. But if you're a weak-willed PC automaton who thinks that independnet film must always laud all things PC, then you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />As En Vogue said years ago: Free your mind and the rest will follow.
