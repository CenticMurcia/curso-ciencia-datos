Following the success of 'Fritz the Cat' and the hasty killing-off of its main character by its disgusted creator R.Crumb, cynical shark and Saturday morning cartoon hack Steve Krantz cranked out this sequel. And apart from a funky musical score and some pretty good animation, it's much the same as the original - noisy, needlessly offencive garbage that revels in shock value for its own sake. The film tries to be 'hip to the trip' with endless drug references, sex scenes and racial stereotyping, but succeeds only in coming across as a complete mess. Once in a rare while, a good idea does emerge from the quagmire, only to disappear again in a welter of self-indulgence, grossness, gutter language and rank stupidity. And if you haven't got at least 70 minutes' worth of material to begin with, there's no way you're going to make anything like a worthwhile film - and it's not long before the Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat shows its true worth by including more padding than you'd find in a cheap mattress. Pointless hallucinatory sequences, meaningless 'experimental' scenes, bunches of re-used animation, 'far-out' light shows...you name it, this film grabs at all the straws it can find in order to struggle through its alloted running time. If you get bored before the end, you're not missing anything, because there is no resolution, no big finale, nothing. Krantz and company just keep sticking half-baked idea after lame 'joke' until they've finished. Rather than buying or renting this, invest in a couple of R.Crumb books instead. You'll be better served by them.
