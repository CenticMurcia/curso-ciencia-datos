'Robot Chicken'. Hmm, that's definitely and eye-catching title, don't you think? At least, that's what I thought when I first heard of it whilst browsing through my dad's collection of strange and funny series. I thought to myself, "A robot chicken? Why would anyone want a robot chicken?" So, out of curiosity, I sat myself down and watched what turned out to be one of the craziest and mind-bogglingly f*****-up adult television shows I had ever seen.<br /><br />Created by Seth Green and Matthew Senreich, 'Robot Chicken' was a bizarre twist on the term 'comedy sketch show' in which various actors and/or actresses would perform numerous scenes of comic hilarity to entertain the masses. It was along similar lines to another bizarre show titled 'Celebrity Deathmatch'. With this programme however, it went to the extreme. Firstly, it was animated using models and dolls such as a Barbie, Ken or Stacey, some even being customised to look like real people. They were made to move about with moving mouths and exaggerated eyes to create some sense of realism but with that "I'm so obviously a cartoon" style.<br /><br />Each sketch was ridiculous in the extreme. They contained either violence, excessive stupidity (so much so that it was annoying), blood and guts gore or outright, sexually explicit crudeness. Personally, this is what stopped me from giving it a full 10/10. But despite the foulness of the skits, it still made me laugh out loud, which is obviously what it has done with many other people as the show has continued on for a total of 4 seasons so far.<br /><br />Quite often, 'Robot Chicken' will parody a performer or well-known public-figure/group. Among such names was the late, great Michael Jackson, where he was supposedly showing up for court when an alien spaceship landed and the still coloured Michael Jackson jumped out proclaiming that he had been abducted by aliens in their mad bid to take over the world. Other mock-ups included the band N'Sync, where the last surviving member Joey Fatone must avenge his friends deaths by competing in a deadly martial-arts tournament. There are a lot more celebrities throughout, such as Britney Spears, Corey Feldman, Vanilla Ice, Harrison Ford and Aerosmith. Some of the characters are even voiced by their real-life counter-parts.<br /><br />As for the whole, "Why would anyone want a robot chicken?" issue, it has absolutely nothing to do with a robotic chicken, except for in the opening title a mad scientist straps a re-animated chicken in to a chair to watch all these insane sketches, for whatever mad purpose, I can't quite gather.<br /><br />But overall, it's an excellent show with no meaning or purpose to it whatsoever. But then, in todays society, who needs a show to make sense as long as it entertains the masses, which is exactly what 'Robot Chicken' does.<br /><br />Favourite Episode: #1 "The Deep End" - It has a great mock of the well-known film 'Kill Bill'. But this time, it's 'Kill Bunny'.
