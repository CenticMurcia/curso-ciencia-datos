I remember watching this at the drive in movie, it was second on the bill and it was the first really "adult" movie I had ever seen, thus it stayed with me. Rock Hudson, who we all know now was gay, is the lusty, straight high school coach and guidance counselor at a high school where teenage girls turn up nude, murdered. Angie Dickinson looked beautiful as the lusty teacher who deflowers a young student. The movie has it's good moments,and the ending was somewhat surprising, but overall it left me feeling "dirty" for lack of a better way of describing it. The female students were frankly all sluts, wanting to screw Rock Hudson in his office at the high school and the scene with Angie Dickinson and the young man in the bathtub was frankly embarrassing. I have never considered myself a prude and at 14 or 15 I certainly wasn't, but this movie was just creepy for the way the students all wanted to do nothing but have sex with their older, married teachers. Yuck!!!!!!
