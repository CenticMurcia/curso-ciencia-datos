What can I say?!?!?! A great, amazing film! One of the films you must see, before you die! A touching story of a parent, left all alone, who struggles to find his place in this world and most important to stay alive. Will Smith deserves an Oscar for this role. Amazing movie! I red about the goofs, but I ignored them. I think that the whole picture is more important than some little mistakes made during the making of the picture. I'm surprised really, because in the past two years I haven't seen a movie that touched me so deep inside. After watching the film a feeling came to me. The feeling that I can do everything. The feeling that the happiness is not so far away. Outstanding movie!
