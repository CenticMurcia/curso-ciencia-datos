"Crumb" is a documentary, and an emotional glimpse into the life of Robert Crumb. He is a frail, awkward man. A brilliant artist, and goofy personality. His art is rich in bizarre imagery, often sexually related. He is sensitive and passionate. As we meet his family, the story continues to unfold into weird and heartbreaking stories. Art is what allows Crumb to deal with his surroundings. It is about the power of art. A wonderful film.
