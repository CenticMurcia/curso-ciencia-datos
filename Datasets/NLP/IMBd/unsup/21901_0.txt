I truly enjoyed this film. I've always been told that I'm fairly mature for my age - I'm not even old enough to drive yet & I'm already learning & respecting morals. In this case, 'Don't judge a book by its cover'.<br /><br />Some parts made me very angry - when Merrick was mistreated & exploited like an animal that he certainly wasn't. He didn't deserve the treatment that people like Bytes & the person working at the hospital gave him.<br /><br />I forgot that I was watching a movie for a while & became incredibly angered far more times than once.<br /><br />I loved the movie a lot, but it made me incredibly inraged that people that treated John like that can actually exist.
