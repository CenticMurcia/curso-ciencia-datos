This is one of the rare films that are so bad that it's actually good! When I watched this with my brother we were laughing so much that our stomach were in agony for days... I just watched Cohen's The Stuff and there were similarities like Moriarty's wooden acting and really campy settings and lousy special effects. If you like bad movies this The Stuff is a must-see! Can't wait to own this on DVD...
