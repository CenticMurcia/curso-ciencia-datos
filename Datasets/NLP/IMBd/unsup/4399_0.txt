This film is definitely worth a try. I saw it last year at a film festival and everyone in the audience was just like me...laughing out of our chairs. I have to say that I would change the title but the film itself should do well. We all loved Jp Nickel's dialogue the best. Such witty and fast paced stuff. really, really, try to get a copy if it ever comes out on DVD. Does anyone know if this "Bitch" movie is going to hit the stores? Check out the scene with the drowning person...it is hilarious. Nickel's acerbic wit is dry as hell. I love this guys voice. I heard he made another movie called "Grim". Anyone know anything about that one?
