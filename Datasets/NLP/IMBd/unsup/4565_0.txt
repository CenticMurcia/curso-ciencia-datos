This movie is an utter perversion of Ende's Fantastica. I'm just glad that he didn't live to see this piece of horrible junk. I, unfortunately got this as a gift and after about ten minutes of watching it I was ticked off. The people who made this show, obviously, never even looked at the book. The fans of the book and the movies already went through enough with the creation of The Neverending Story III so we didn't need this blow to the gut. I don't know who in the world thought that doing this show would be a good idea. And I can't fathom how some people like this. Read the book people and you'll see my point. My advice to everyone is beware this show, DO NOT watch it. This show gets an F-.
