Needless to say, this wasn't the best horror flick I have paid good money to see. However, the film's one saving grace was the beautiful and talented lead actress. Actually, the two lead actresses weren't half bad they were just given a MISERABLE script to work with. They were the ONLY reason I spent 90 minutes watching this movie. Where is the originality? I felt the movie had potential in certain scenes, but unfortunately not enough to make this a cult favorite. The mask was cool and the haunted house had potential to be cool. I actually found myself a little scared during the chases scenes. Would I see it again...no...but I didn't mind checking it out once. I blame the writer/director for the film's demise.
