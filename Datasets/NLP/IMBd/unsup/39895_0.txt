This movie is so horrendous its funny! The acting is some of the worst I've ever seen, the plot is amazingly plain, and the action is terrible, this is officially the ONLY film to be worse than "Flesh Eating Mothers"! OK, so here's the plot, a crack dealer in a ski mask and gloves gets annoyed at an under-cover cop, who's having an affair with another cop, so he kills her, then goes on to kill the other cops family for no apparent reason at all, then he takes off the ski mask (again, I don't know why)and decides to start killing teenage girls until the city pay him $1,000,000. they do pay him, but he gets angry again and wants $2,000,000 instead, then he tries killing the other cop, only to get shot in the leg, I turned the DVD player off at this point.
