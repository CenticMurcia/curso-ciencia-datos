Hmmm...I really seem to be missing on something here. Practically all my fellow IMDb-users are full of praise for this sequel to Ringu, but I don't second these opinion. It really thought it was a dreadful movie and a very unpleasant cinema experience. How much I'd like to support the Japanese horror-business and encourage people to discover it, I just don't think this is a good representation for it. Personally, I think there's ONE big disease in the film industry: the "easy-money" concept! Small and simple films become a huge and unexpected success and that encourages the producers to shoot a sequel as soon as possible, in order to make even more money. This disease seems to have contaminated Japan as well now, since I really think Ringu 2 suffers from it. <br /><br />Absolutely NOTHING happens in the first 30 minutes of this film!! Than we're served a full quarter of suspense, exciting cinema and good character development. After that, it's downhill again till the end-credits role. A real shame actually, because those short 15 minutes of highlights really proved that there still was a lot of potential to continue the original story of Ringu. The plot involves the mind and will of the little boy from Ringu - Yoichi - taken over by the evil little girl Sadako. To itself, not a bad starting point but poorly executed. You're most likely to read a lot of comments that state Ringu2 is scary and full of suspense. Well, I think some people confuse suspense with complexity. Ringu 2 is nowhere near scary and I think slow and everlasting are more appropriate words. If you're interested in seeing a really scary Japanese movie, I suggest you check out "Audition" by Takashi Miike or even "Dark Water" by the same director who directed this film. Ringu 2 can easily be skipped
