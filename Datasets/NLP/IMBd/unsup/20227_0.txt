I really enjoyed the movie because it allowed me to see another culture than the one i live. I truly was amazed how they expressed themselves. I thought it was good to see young people expressing themselves thru other means than just violence. It is good to see that something good can come out of any environment that you are in. I like seeing the kids doing something different with there lives. There is so much they could get in to but they did not. This showed made me want to take up dancing. I think this helped a lot of people to stay in shape. I think this kind of dancing makes for an excellent work out, or just getting your anger out. I have already rented the movie and have watched this twice at home.
