I saw this movie at a screening a few months ago and I really liked it. Horror movies aren't usually my thing but my friends were going so I saw it. Of course it had all the typical stuff like blood and breasts and gore. It also had the most gruesome scene ever! I almost couldn't look. But it was also an intelligent and original movie with a story that kept me interested until the end. It's the story of Pelle. His brother is missing and he goes down to San Francisco to try and find out what happened to him. It appears that his brother's disappearance might have something to do with a reality show called Public Enemy Number One. A show where people vie for Public Enemy of the year by sending in home made videos of murders. In my opinion, when you see this at a video store near you, it's worth picking up.
