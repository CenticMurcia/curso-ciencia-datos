This film is hybridized by other culture.It's colorful,but it's insipid.This film is international commodity.Maybe the producer just want to get money from Korea and Japan by using Korean and Japanese in the movie.I'm a Chinese.I found it very stupid to listen to two foreigner conversing by using their stiff Chinese.The director want to express some ideas,but I think he chose a wrong method.These kind of film just look like a copy of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Maybe using anther way to express his idea will be impressible.In my opinion,unadorned movie is more cordial,and it is a good way to express Chinese culture.
