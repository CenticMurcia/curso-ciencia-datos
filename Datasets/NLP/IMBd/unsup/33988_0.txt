Had the filmmakers not tried to introduce a bit of artistic license into the film, I'd simply write it off as a sub-par slasher flick. But the lame effort put forward by this crew gives dilettantes a good name.<br /><br />The only positive thing one could say about this film is that the production values aren't horrid. That script though...my lord. Would it have hurt the filmmakers (as much as I was by viewing this junk) to invest even an hour thinking of something mildly original. Renting a film like this, I really don't expect much, but I did expect something.<br /><br />If you're thinking of watching this tripe, do yourself a favor - attack your brain with a fifth of tequila or something similar before settling into this garbage. Must pass...
