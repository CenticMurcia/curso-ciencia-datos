Amazing film! Although I have to disagree about the comment appeared here, mistakenly stated the wrong fact that the movie shows that Russia has been obsessed with war, as the great patriotic war was about people defending their home and families, unwillingly drawn into the battle of their lives by the fascists. the movie shows,above everything I think, the borders of human behavior under tremendous pressure, and the brilliancy of of some against the banality of others, often in higher positions, which caused many logically impossible situations, and made the turn of events amazingly chaotic. I enjoyed it very much, along with great editing and script, writing rare videos and excellent soundtrack are a beautiful bonus.
