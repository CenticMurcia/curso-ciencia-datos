Oh lord, was this ever bad. The worst action flick I've ever seen. I mean, Yu-Gi-Oh anime has better acting - and action. The plot is disconnected and schizophrenic, which wouldn't matter if the action were good, but sadly it is not. The action scenes are far too infrequent and disappointing. The actors playing these "bad girls" are so thin and soft that every shot of "action" is laughable. (I'd rather see the cast of Dawson's Creek take each other on.) The quick and choppy editing during the fight scenes is necessary to cover up the actors' inability even to swing a rubber prop convincingly. <br /><br />The director, Kenta Fukasaku, continues to spiral down in his inability to follow in his father's footsteps (Kinji Fukasaku, director of "Battle Royale", "The Shogun's Samurai", "The Yakuza Papers" and "Tora! Tora! Tora!".)<br /><br />The DVD cover claims "From the creator of Battle Royale". That's quite a stretch. That claim could be made only by the novelist, Koushun Takami, or director Kinji Fukasaku. And any comparison to the exciting "Battle Royale" does not stand up.
