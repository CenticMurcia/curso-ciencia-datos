It started out funny, petered off into darkness, and became an overdone artsy look at overdone art.<br /><br />Jerome is an artist who's been the underdog his whole life. He wants to go to Starthmore to learn art and launch his career, and arrives in the middle of a serial killer spree.<br /><br />His roommate is a hilarious typical wannabe-gangsta film maker who should have had lines after the first third of the film but didn't, and they bunk with a repressed homosexual fashion major used for good cheap laughs.<br /><br />Jerome falls for Audrey who appears to be a 28 year old who hangs around campus as a model without actually being a student or anything other than a once-lesbian b*tch.<br /><br />His rival is Jonas, a new student who looks like he should be at Boston College on a football scholarship about ten years ago. Jonas paints like a retarded twelve year old but not only wins the hearts and minds of his class, but also Audrey's attentions.<br /><br />Jerome is introduced to a failed alcoholic artist who has paintings of the victims of the serial killer. It is at this point you'll see the movie flops, and Jerome proves to be "too stupid to live" (which is what he shouts that all of humanity is.) The first 1/3 is a comedy with dramatic elements, the second third is a drama with comedic elements, and the final third is a bizarre dark fantasy that ends in a way I can only describe as "suddenly I am run over by a truck".<br /><br />Too bad; the acting was superb, the directing was good, but the script was DOA. I think this is at most worthy of a rental, but probably from Netflix so you don't feel ripped off.
