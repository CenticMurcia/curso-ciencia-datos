I expected to get a minimum of understanding of life in the Grande Chartreuse, of what brings people there, of why they are so few, of how they maintain this immense edifice, of their role in the making and selling of their famous liquor, a good dose of Gregorian singing, an appreciation of the architecture. Instead I got 3 hours of sketchy, incoherent and repetitive shots. Three close ups of faces were repeated 4 times, the rope of the main bell was activated many times, a dark screen with flickering candles was seen too often, the shaving of monks heads is shot at length, including several minutes showing the barber (not shaved) looking flabbergasted ! Oh ! yes, they sell the liquor, because on the left of the monk using a laptop there is a letter in French from a Wines and Liquors company (seen for 5 seconds). The movie also had too many shots purposely and gratuitously out of focus. In short, an exercise in artiness leaving much to be desired. Two thumbs down.
