"Snoopy Come Home" is the 2nd of the 4 Peanuts specials. In many ways, it's a unique Peanuts story (particularly for being a musical, dramatic and emotional motion picture). At the same time, its simplicity is extreme.<br /><br />This is an improvement over the previous "A Boy Named Charlie Brown" and a classic. There are many good things about it. The story is simple but solid, fun, dramatic and interesting. There is some nice score, such as the hilarious song "No dogs allowed" and the beautiful but sad songs "Do you remember me?" and "It changes".<br /><br />Unlike the first movie, here both Peppermint Patty and Woodstock appear, although Marcie is still missing. There is, however, a crazy girl named Clara who looks almost equal to Marcie, except without glasses. She's the one who names Snoopy "Rex". I call her "the terrorist", lol.<br /><br />Pepermint Patty's role is small here and, as usual, she's a tomboy. But she is surprisingly kind here. Really doesn't sound like her. Considering she's very quick-tempered and often unfair and obnoxious, she manages to surprise us here.<br /><br />Lila's role in the movie is minor. She is everything that Lucy and "the terrorist" aren't: friendly, sweet, kind and lovable. Lila was the original owner of the world's most famous Beagle. I think they should have found a way to make she and Charlie Brown meet sometimes, so that she and Snoopy had the chance to visit each other occasionally. Charlie Brown and Lila could even be friends...<br /><br />During good part of the movie there is a sad atmosphere: Lila's illness and loneliness, the Peanuts gang missing Snoopy a lot (mostly Charlie Brown, who is most sensitive about this). Like Charlie Brown, I hate goodbyes and I'd rather more hellos.<br /><br />The few things I don't like about this movie are when Linus and Snoopy hurt each other, the boxing match sequence with Lucy and Snoopy and, of course, the sequences with "the terrorist" (a real trauma for Snoopy and Woddstock) and most parts with Lucy. I just don't like Lucy, she's obnoxious, unfair and mean to Snoopy, Charlie Brown and even Linus. <br /><br />The artwork is extremely simplistic but perhaps a little better than in "A Boy Named Charlie Brown". Still, this artwork is clearly not at the level of "Race for your life, Charlie Brown" and even less of "Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown". <br /><br />The journey of America's favorite Beagle and Woodstock to visit Lila at the hospital is admirable, as well as everything they go through because of all those "No dogs allowed" signs (including one that forbids both dogs and birds, which is discrimination against animals).<br /><br />This movie isn't all drama, however. There are some comical parts, such as whenever Snoopy and Woodstock laugh. The laughter of both is hysterical to listen! And Snoopy's indecipherable growl-like speaking is always a full plate, as well as his characteristic signature with a footprint. Woodstock also has the loveliest whistle of all time - he really whistles beautifully!<br /><br />This should definitely be on Top 250.
