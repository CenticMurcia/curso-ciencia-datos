Scary Movie 4 left much to be desired. Grand total of genuine laughs: 3. Fart jokes just were never that funny to begin with, neither was seeing people get hit with miscellaneous objects every 4 seconds (approximately) for an entire hour and 20 minutes. Scary Movie 4 takes that sort of cheap humor to another level. Or perhaps just the natural level for a sequel to "scary movie." I mean, in earnest, it isn't even the level of humor that is the problem, but rather the monotony of it all. Fart joke, someone gets hit with blunt object, fart joke, pee-washing scene, another blunt object hits someone, someone gets kicked in the balls, poop joke. It all just becomes the same joke over and over and over and over again. See, i feel sad in side because this sort of satire could really have some potential if the real hilarity wasn't so overshadowed by the disproportionate amount of really dumb jokes that would best appeal to 10-yr-olds (who, incidentally, are not allowed to see the movie). For example, a real laugh could occur at the point in the movie when the dim-witted President ignores a global alien attack in order to listen to a children's' story. This sort of mocking is actually funny. Now when the next couple of scenes contain about 25 instances of people being hit with things, and three fart/poop/gross-out jokes, any substance the film actually had is washed away - or shall i say clubbed to death by blunt objects. At about 3 or 4 points in the movie i was so disgusted that i just wanted it to end! It was, quite literally, a waste of my life. Please, for your own good, heed my warning and do not waste an hour and 20 minutes of your life on something that is not, even in its most glorified form, entertaining or funny. If you have already seen it, i feel your pain.
