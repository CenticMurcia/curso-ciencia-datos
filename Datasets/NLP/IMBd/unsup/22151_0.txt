This movie is one of my all time FAVORITE movies!!! It is great, the actors are very talented. And, you can watch it with anybody without worrying about being uncomfortable. It is a very wonderful plot, and I think you should watch it! It took me a few times to watch it and like it, but it was AMAZING!!! Jerry B. Jenkins really pulls you into this movie and makes it seem so real. The music matches it perfectly (Nickel Creek). It takes place in a small town and makes you feel happy to watch it. I give it a ten, but it deserves higher then that! Anyone who doesn't like this movie, well they have their opinions, but they will, eventually.
