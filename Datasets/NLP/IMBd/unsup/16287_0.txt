This is a very gripping story, and Elizabeth Montgomery plays the lead role with a moving, emotional performance which couldn't have worked with anyone else. The story line is very strong and I didn't feel the need to turn to something more interesting which I find often happens with this type genre. It is well thought out, and has some great moments. I would recommend this to friends, which would be more to an adult audience, as the film does contain a couple of scenes which are not family viewing. If you're a Montgomery fan who hasn't seen this yet, then put it on the top of the list, because it's a brilliantly moving film, and her performance is well done.
