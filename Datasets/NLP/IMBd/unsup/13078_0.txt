For those who have seen the above mentioned movie, it was about the wedding: how can you be sure that the promised one is the perfect one?<br /><br />With "Dinner with friends", the married life analysis goes on and this time, it's about the time effect: after years, children, does love is still there or is-it extinguished and we must start it all over again?<br /><br />On the contrary of "Sex, lies Â…", Andie is now surrounded by a terrific cast. I am really surprised by the performance of Dennis Quaid, because he was more in action movie for me but he shows there a lot of deepness. <br /><br />The couples are really opposite to each other: the one that dissolves becomes happy while the one that rejoices becomes sad. It's like the split of their friends gave proof to their inner fear and they start to break up even thought they have all the reason to be happy! <br /><br />A good movie! I got only one deception: as it is a indoor drama, I am still wondering if there is poor people or working class in America, because the houses or the families are always top! No way for a cheap accommodation in those movies! I would take this as a contempt for common people!
