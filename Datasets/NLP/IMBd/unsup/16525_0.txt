What a wonderful Tarzan movie  in the classic Johnny Weismuller / Maureen O'Sullivan tradition.<br /><br />I won't say much about it at this time except that I really love the sequence involving Tarzan and Boy in the water; followed by the Boy's near-death going over the waterfall. That really captures the special flavor (it that's the term) of the Tarzan household: delightfully domestic, but with danger always nearby.<br /><br />Then there's the intermixture of serious things and humorous things: such as Tarzan disarming the men; while Cheetah disarms the Kleenex box of Kleenex, one sheet at a time.<br /><br />And best of all the final footage of Tarzan's jungle allies  especially the elephants and the apes  once again saving the day.<br /><br />All in all, a truly wonderful Tarzan movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
