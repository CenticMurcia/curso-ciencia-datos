Cats & Dogs starts off hilarious, and manages to put in some clever ideas throughout (such as the whole underground military base), but it just gets a little old. The animations for the talking animals was impressive (as was many of the animatronics), but the scenes with completely CGI characters (such as a lot of Mr. Tinkles) just looked way too cartoony. The movie felt as if it was stretched out, and could've had about 20 minutes shaved off of it. I was a little disappointed, but otherwise, it was entertaining.
