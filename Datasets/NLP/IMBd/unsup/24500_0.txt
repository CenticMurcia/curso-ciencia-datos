WOW! This is one heck of a t.v series. I got an episode of this with the paper and it is the most 80's thing I have ever seen right down to the Micheal Mann productions logo. And the best bit is that they are going to make a Movie out of it some time in 2006 with Micheal Mann himself directing it. If scarface was to be made into a television series this this would be it, the cloths, the cars, the buildings and those speed boats are all so stylised. Heck this show is better than the A-team. The total feel of Miami it embodied in the show and you have to embrace it, in the episode I viewed there was a arms deal with a Cuban guy(who i swear was the drug dealer with the chainsaw in scarface) and he had a real cool suit on but I won't tell you much more because I don,t like spoilers
