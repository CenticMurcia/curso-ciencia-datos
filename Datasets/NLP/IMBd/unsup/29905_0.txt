Starring Cher and Dennis Quaid, Suspect is probably one of my most watched movies. It portrays to the viewer the state of the justice system and the criminal justice administration system. It shows that there a people that when overworked, still care about their jobs and the people they deal with on a day to day basis. This is all set alongside a murder in which a homeless man is being accused of. In going after the truth it can only lead to one thing... I reccomend that you consider renting or buying this movie. It is a great one for the family to watch!
