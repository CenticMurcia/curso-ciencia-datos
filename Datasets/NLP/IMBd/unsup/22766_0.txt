In this film the director stays well ahead of us, pulling us into the baroque plot with a grin. Andy Lau and Takeshi Scaramachi are anti-heroes within a sexually charged subplot with Kelly Lin, cool and sexy with or without glasses. They work in the same field: assassination and soon they are seeking each other out for final termination. As with some stylish thrillers, ellipsis must be accepted. Oscar Wilde once said "The first purpose of life is to adopt a pose. The second purpose has not been discovered yet." This film revels in poses and extraordinary set pieces that are passionately beautiful. Beware how much you revel in the violence, stylized and chic as it is--even an assassin can feel sickened by his work. In some ways, the film parallels John Woo's "Face Off." A must see.
