Decent enough cast squandered by stupid plot, inept script, direction, editing.<br /><br />Dont expect any martial arts action either, the only fights are so badly cut and lit that anyone could have done them.<br /><br />Best moment: realising that Dennis Hopper's character is actually supposed to be Irish.<br /><br />Worst moment: realising that it isn't going to get any better than the opening scene.
