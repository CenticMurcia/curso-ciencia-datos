If you rent this movie, bring a long a peg for your nose, as this is an utter stinker. The main drive of a good gangster film, is the characterisation, the motives behind the violence. This has none of that, all it has is a grumpy Alan Sugar a-like moping round shouting and swearing. You don't care about him or any of the other characters at all, people drift in and out of the story without any sort of motivation. Its flat and dull, even the half decent car-park shoot out is spoiled with fake cgi blood. I will say one thing though, the torture scene with the drill to the knee, is pretty cool, but doesn't go any further than in the trailer. In fact, just watch the trailer, its much better than the movie itself. Proper wafty. If you want to see an intelligent French gangster film, with pathos and a sense of realism get 'The beat that my heart skipped'.
