Little girl Emily loses her mother and so she and her father move to a new house to start again. Things are fine till little Emily finds an imaginary friend called Charley and then all hell breaks loose. This is the scariest psychological/horror film since Psycho and at times i was shaking all over. Little Dakota Fanning ,who plays Emily,is absolutely awesome in this film and i will be watching her career closely in the future and though this is the sort of role Robert DE Niro,the dad,could play in his sleep,he still puts in a great though slightly muted performance. This film has everything,imaginary friends,murdered pets ,suspicious deaths and enough nail biting horror to keep you awake for a fortnight. Next time your child tells you of imaginary friend then you might want to think twice because you never know...........8/10
