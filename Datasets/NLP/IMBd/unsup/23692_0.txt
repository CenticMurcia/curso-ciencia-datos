Jason Stuart has showcased many of the worst gay stereotypes (aka "attitudes") in this low-budget snoozer, including his own obnoxious attitude. Waaah, poor Jason. He's getting older. I don't find his character or any of the other players here believable for one second. I wouldn't go out with him, but they don't allow any "normal" guys to dump him, only losers and freaks. Do we really think he would have gotten more dates when he was 20-something? There is no writing to speak of, and the direction often consists of film-student shots. Some of the supporting players aren't bad -- even some eye candy. But in the end Jason is way too obnoxious to save the film. Don't waste your time. Poor, poor Jason.
