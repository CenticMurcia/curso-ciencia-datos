The Insider is the story of Jeffery Wigand (again Oscar-worthy Russell Crowe), a former tobacco company scientist that begins to rebel against his former employer. With the help of 60 Minutes producer played by Al Pacino. Wigand tells the story of what the tobacco companies do not want you to know. He then realizes that maybe everything he is doing isn't worth all he has lost, (i.e. his family, his safety, his job). This film was a real controversial masterpiece of modern times. It was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, and though I agree with giving Best Picture, Actor, and Director to American Beauty, this film should have won something, possably Best Screenplay.
