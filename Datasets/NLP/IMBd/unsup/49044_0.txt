Leslie will never be as funny as he was years ago,it would take a miracle,the reason being he is accepting all these ridiculous scripts,just because hes in it doesnt mean it will change anything.Spy Hard has a very few funny scenes,and i find this film very similar to Nielsons other unfunny films like "DRACULA DEAD & LOVING IT" & "WRONGFULLY ACCUSED".I always wished their would be another Naked Gun,that is the only way Nielson can get his spoof fame back,now he is the same as any other star like Charlie Sheen in a spoof movie. Spy Hard wasnt funny,a very few scenes will make you laugh,i also recommend you avoid this.<br /><br />OVERALL FOR SPYHARD: 4/10<br /><br />GOOD POINTS OF FILM: First Spy Spoof<br /><br />BAD POINTS OF FILM: Terrible Script/Unfunny.
