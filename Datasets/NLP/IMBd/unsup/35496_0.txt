Bad acting (except MÃ¤dchen Amick, who is OK), awful dialogs, poor plot but could pass if not the dialogs and acting. Predictable and boring plot. I can go on and on with negativity. Just awful. The first 10 minutes is interesting and intriguing although poor acting is obvious almost from the beginning. Police finds dead men whose wife thought that he had died in boating accident five years ago. There were so many ways to keep the film interesting. I do not think that even good acting could save the film unless somebody would rewrite the script. The rest of the 90 minutes I consider as a wasted time. You can check if you have the same taste but I warned you.
