'Jaws' wasn't even around to rip off yet, so what was the rationale for this uber-silly retribution-of-nature allegory? We keep cutting to the same stock shots of frogs doing their best to look menacing, but the best they can do is hop up and down on Ray Milland AFTER he bites it. Of course, in the meantime they also send psychic messages to their buddies in the lizard kingdom - snakes can always wreak some havoc as can spiders, big lizards are well equipped to knock stuff over, and those turtles are more deadly than they look! As are Sam Elliott's bare-chested nature photographer/idealist/rhetorician, a pre-surgical Joan Van Ark, and a couple of African-American servants who eventually get to enact the new spirit of civil rights on evil old moneyed cripple Milland. AIP strikes again.
