So we have Paul Naschy joining an expedition in a Tibetan mountain region. Or somewhere, as this movie looks like it's shot for the most part in some forest in Spain. And then we have snow. And then there's sun and plants. I don't know Â– it might have been shot on some distant planet in outer space were continuity errors are part of your everyday reality.<br /><br />So, Paul Naschy stumbles upon some cave, enters it and finds two vampiric wenches (that's my guess) and has sex with them (both of them, at the same time, thank you very much). I couldn't tell if those sluts turned him into a werewolf, or if Naschy's character was already a werewolf to begin with. Either way, Naschy is a werewolf and he gets to wrestle around in the snow with a yeti (who just happens to wear a similarly looking werewolf costume, just like the one Naschy's wearing). And then I think this movie ended. I think I spotted an image of Buddha in this movie too, somewhere. Can't really remember.<br /><br />Good Badness? I'm inclined to shout "Yes!", but for the love of Christ possessed, I can't remember why... 1/10 and, uhm, I guess, ehrr, maybe 5/10..., meaning 9/10 for being the worst piece of rubbish out of the lot, and 1/10 because I couldn't laugh with it. So, that's 10/20, which would boil down to... Aw, screw it. This movie sucks and Paul Naschy is a sleaze-ball. 1/10, and no goodies for Naschy.
