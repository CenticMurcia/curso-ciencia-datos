I saw this movie as a motel movie shortly after vcr's became affordable/popular.<br /><br />I thought it was very funny and would love to see it again on DVD or tape.<br /><br />The rather subtle, dry humor mixed with slapstick comedy was very well done. I would certainly buy it if it were available.
