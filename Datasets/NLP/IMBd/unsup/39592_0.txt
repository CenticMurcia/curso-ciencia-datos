This movie fails to redeem itself, even after that possibility became miraculously available. I was certain that I was wasting my time through the first 80 minutes of gratuitous TV-preacher bashing (which might actually be appropriate if it were not handled with such apparent fiction and superficiality) when suddenly, at the very last moment, it seemed that a story was about to emerge.<br /><br />I was wrong. The only interesting tension in this film goes entirely unresolved and unexplained. It almost seems like this film was re-written in editing and they lacked the footage to explain the revision. So they released it. <br /><br />I can't believe I actually bought a used copy of this. I hate that I spent $5.99 for it. But I have to much love for humanity to return or exchange it. Someone else might end up with it.<br /><br />Only the producer can be blamed fully, but any director that would put his name on this movie deserves a measure of disgust.
