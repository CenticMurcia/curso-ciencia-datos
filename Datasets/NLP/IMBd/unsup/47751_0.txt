In Mid-1987, German Mastermind Andreas Schnaas Set Out To Make The Goriest Film In The History Of Cinema. The Final Product Was Violent Shi t, The Story Of A Mentally Unstable Escaped Convict Going On A Blood-Drenched Killing Spree. The Film Has Virtually No Plot And Serves Only One Purpose... To Make People Cringe With Delight At The Sight Of People Being Mutilated In The Most Diabolical Ways Known To Man! The Film Is Known For Breaking The Barrier And Allowing Many Other German Horror-Fanatics To Make Their Own Low-Budget Splatter Flicks. The Film Is Often Compared With Another Film Released That Same Year. Nekromantik. The Two Films Gained Notoriety For Being Extremely Gory And Were Banned By The German Government. Like I Said Before, This Film Has No Plot, And Was Followed By Two Much Better Films That Were Much More Story Driven. Watch Them Instead.
