As an AIP film with a title like this, criticizing FROGS would be tantamount to kicking a puppy...<br /><br />Wealthy Ray Milland and his brood gather for a 4th of July celebration at their bayou estate only to be picked off one at a time by snakes, spiders and what appears to be moss. It's pretty grim going. The film itself is not so much directed as it is nature shots spliced together with scenes featuring a mostly bickering family and one interloper (dependable Sam Elliott). It's not the worst movie ever made, but it might be the worst movie ever made about vengeful frogs. One is only left pondering whether Milland bothered to save ANY money from his heyday as a movie star in the 40s and 50s. This guy actually won an Oscar in his early days! Elliott isn't bad, nor is the supporting cast including Mae Mercer as "MayBelle" and Joan Van Ark (pre-TV stardom and<br /><br />pretty well put together in 1970s hot pants).
