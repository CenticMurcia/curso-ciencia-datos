Here's a summary of this unintentionally hilarious masterpiece.<br /><br />1) A girl sees a missing woman on TV and comes to the startling revelation that she looks just like her doll. The film then shows the doll, which looks nothing like the missing woman.<br /><br />2) A madman scientifically explains to his demented accomplice how he was able to turn a woman into a doll: "The pond turned her into wax."<br /><br />3) The accomplice admits to the girl that he's her stalker by brushing his teeth really fast, just like she does.<br /><br />4) The accomplice kills a dude in an alleyway by first throwing a noose around his neck. The noose becomes magically suspended from an invisible pole  which we never see  thus providing the leverage the accomplice needs to hang the dude. The accomplice then grabs some shrub-shears and snips some hair off the dude's head while muttering the grammatically incorrect statement, "I am barber." <br /><br />5) A girl is showering and sees the accomplice on the other side of her shower door. She screams, then ignores him. After her shower, she decides to take a bath, but the accomplice appears in the bathtub with his trademark mischievous smirk that hints at massive "weed" consumption. She screams, then ignores him. The accomplice then makes quacking (ala duck) noises from the ventilation grate (which measures 6 inches by 6 inches) in the bathroom. She screams, then ignores him.<br /><br />6) The madman builds a Frankenstein machine that's powered by electricity to turn the women into wax, apparently forgetting that the pond water was sufficient enough for his needs only a few minutes earlier.<br /><br />7) The accomplice kidnaps or kills girls and brings them to the madman for doll production. They get into an argument and the madman says, "I have this machine. I don't need you anymore." How the machine kidnaps girls is never explained.<br /><br />8) A girl is kidnapped by the accomplice and attempts to send her brother a picture of the accomplice playing with a doll in an effort to have her brother rescue her. She even types in "Help me" on the message. However, the accomplice sees her and takes the phone away before she can send the message. The accomplice sends the message anyway. The girl then shakes her head in dismay, even though she wanted her brother to save her in the first place. How the brother found her location in the middle of a forest from the rather uninformative photo is not explained. <br /><br />9) The dolls are lesbian nymphomaniacs. One of them distracts a girl by hitting a piano key, while the other sneaks up behind her for an ass-grab. I kid you not.<br /><br />10) The filmmakers couldn't figure out how to split up two people in a tunnel with no doors, so they just made one of them disappear.<br /><br />11) The accomplice hits a guy in the back of the head with a sledgehammer. The guy gets up with a nasty gash on his forehead, and stabs the accomplice with a sharp object, before passing out for 5 seconds. The accomplice falls down in the corner of the room, magically warps himself to the other side of the room and replaces himself with a stuffed dummy, all in 5 seconds. <br /><br />12) Some dolls are as big as human beings. They chase the characters with their CGI-deficient mouths. One of them knows karate, and kicks her stiletto high heel at one of the girls, who proceeds to catch it in her mouth.<br /><br />13) One of the girls goes into tough mode. She wields an axe but drops it. Although she does cut the accomplice's eyeball out. The accomplice appears in the middle of the forest soon after with a bandage on his head, as it appears that he planted first aid kits in the wilderness . . . just in case.<br /><br />14) The stalker accidentally steps in the bear-trap that he randomly planted in the forest earlier. After planning that a girl would escape, run a mile or so in a given direction in a 100-square-mile forest, and step on top of that 1-square-foot area where he placed the trap, he was slightly off in his calculations and suffered the consequences.<br /><br />15) The dolls create a super doll (with 6-pack abs). The super doll awakes just in time to get some steamy lesbian "necking" action.<br /><br />16) The deep morale of this story is revealed by the girl survivor: "Boys will never understand girls' dreams. Girls' dreams keep glittering forever. I won't let you destroy it." <br /><br />17) The girl survivor decides to keep the dead bodies of her friends and brother in her house as dolls. She talks to them regularly.<br /><br />18) The girl ponders, "Was it a dream or reality? I wonder." She gets surrounded by dolls and then turns into one. <br /><br />Roll credits. Enter deleted scenes.<br /><br />19) The girl and her brother play "paper-scissors-stone." <br /><br />20) In another scene we have the following dialogue:<br /><br />Girl 1: "Once in a while you own clothes." (close-up on girl's face) Girl 2: "What on earth happened?" (they look around frantically) Some random dude: "Yes?" Girl 1: "Hurry up." (they run away)<br /><br />21) The girls are at karaoke with lots of cartoon characters on the monitors. Suddenly, a bloody doll cartoon emerges on the video screens. No one notices.<br /><br />22) The accomplice chases the girl in fast-forward motion thru the forest. The girl catches her dress on a tree, then slingshots backward on her ass. The accomplice injects her with a serum of some kind. The scene abruptly cuts. The girl is then immediately seen running away from the accomplice in the forest, apparently unaffected by the serum. <br /><br />End Deleted Scenes<br /><br />Rating = 0/5 <br /><br />Enjoy.
