N. Chandra's Tezaab was given more than it's due. True the song "Ek Do Teen" is a foot-tabbing number & Madhuri Dixit shot to fame with this movie, yet what nobody seem to have noticed that it is a bad remake of Hollywood's action/ musical "Streets of Fire" (1984).<br /><br />Much publicity was given to the movie, which helped to make it a big success.<br /><br />Another flick used to make the movie a definite success, was adding a song number after the film's release.<br /><br />Nothing special about this movie if you're well acquainted with good movies & cinema.
