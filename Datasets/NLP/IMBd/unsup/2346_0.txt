I visited the Star Trek Experience in 1999 and was TOTALLY blown away by the ride! I loved the experience and still wonder how all of the trip was possible (maybe it's best not to know). Too bad it's pretty much gone, but I am glad to have had the pleasure of taking the trip! To this day, I don't know how it was done. The plot of the ride is that one of the members of the group is a distant relative of Capt. Picard and that in order to prevent a change in the time line, the group members must take off in a shuttle to avoid the Klingons. The ride has the members flying through space and over present day Las Vegas. Cameos by Jonathan Frakes and LeVar Burton.
