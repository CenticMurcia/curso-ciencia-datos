This film was viewed by myself on TV about 20 years back, I caught it again one night, & it was more dull than bad quality. The main failure behind it is a stodgy script, which, in hands other than the original author, had much potential, it was as if the filmmakers had started out with the priority of getting the right cast & movie makers, and expecting the rest would fall into place. Many years ago, my daily paper ran a story, this was that the producers behind it created the film as a tax loss, and it never had been intended to be a financial success, but to save the producers, who are experienced and many fold, on their tax bill at year's end. That would certainly explain the dreadful script.<br /><br />An original New York Times Online film review hints clearly at the suspicion of the tax break allegation: quote: "The Passage" is so awful you must suspect it was designed to be someone's tax write-off. As such it should be a smashing success. and later on: "In addition no less than six companies are involved in the film's production, "presentation" and release.'<br /><br />The film has minor compensations, the acting is not as bad as some reviewers allege, & it moves along fast enough to avoid the journey slowing one down too much. Not a good film in any respect however.
