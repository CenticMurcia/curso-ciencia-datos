Intrigingly convoluted and hauntingly refreshing, this show is easily the best show of 2006! A+ all around, for all involved. A show like this does not appear very often! Suspention of disbelieve is the primary attribute of any good story. Even though I could have chosen to disbelieve, it never happened. Every story hole in the plot and every incredulous moment worked for The Lost Room. Please don't ruin it by turning it into a series! But a sequel mini-series could work. Every actor performed their part with sincerity and poise. Also, I would love to see more from the creative talents behind this series, so impressed am I!
