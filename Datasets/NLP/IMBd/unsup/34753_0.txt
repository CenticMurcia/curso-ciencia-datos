I was looking forward to this movie a lot.I wanted to watch it with my grand daughters.I am glad I saw it first.I was so disappointed with it.I never got the connection with the horse and the girl,didn't work for me.I also wanted to see the big race?The one that saved the ranch?She said Flicka the horse came they opened the gate for them to run away?Whats with that?Now oh god shes missing get a search party.I would rather have seen Dekota fanning do the part this girl was a bit over weight for it. I was glad I never had to pay money to see it,but it's so weired to see the critics saying,I love this movie so good.My god come on don't drink before you see it.The guy ,father never got his emotions working for me.A I also had a hard time hearing him whispering his lines.He was to bland for my taste.Gary
