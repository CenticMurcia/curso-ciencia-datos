Or you'll hate or you'll love it, simple as that and I am quite afraid that I rather hate it. The story itself could have been interesting as we follow a couple who have to escape from their hometown (I suppose due to political reasons but that's never been explained) but everything is seen through the eyes of a boy who is called Harry (his new identity) as in his own created world his hero is Harry Houdini. Oh I wish I could escape from sleep during this movie as it's so dull and slowly filmed that you constantly watch the clock till it's going to end. Naaah sorry, films with a different view are always more than wellcome but they must have been made good as well otherwise...yup, otherwise you're bored.
