If you're into really, really, really bad films...this one's for you. It's so bad it's funny.<br /><br />Low Budget - Check; Bad Direction - Check; Bad Production - Check; Ridiculous Art Direction  Check; Bad Acting - Check; Bizarre Plot Twist  Check; Costuming & Props  What the hell?<br /><br />"Pirates of Treasure Island" is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. An average high school film student could make a better film on a $1500 budget.<br /><br />After watching the opening segment as the opening credits began to role, I had to rewind the DVD to make sure of what I had just seen. I seriously could not believe my eyes; I thought, "No wayI just didn't see a giant insect attack Long John Silver." The only positive thing I can write about this "film" is that it was "only" an hour and 15 minutes.
