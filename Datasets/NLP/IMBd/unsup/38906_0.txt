The best part of the movie was Emmanuelle who was real pretty. The plot was lame. It was funny seeing Paulie from "Rocky" in the movie. For a minute there I thought that Tomasso and his sister were going to have an affair, but that would not have been allowed on TV. I think I saw it on HBO 1 2 3 or 4 or Showtime 1 2 3 4 5 I can't remember. I guess the story did have a happy ending. I personally would not recommend it. I think I fell asleep before the end. I still wonder what Paulie was doing in that movie. Also the step-mother was a real witch in my opinion. She appeared to be very unforgiving and nasty. You may be able to find this in a video store, but it is not worth renting in my humble opinion.
