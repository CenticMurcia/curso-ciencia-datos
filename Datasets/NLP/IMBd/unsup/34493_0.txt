This is one of the worst Australian 'comedies' in recent years, and that's saying something. It easily ranks amongst the mind-numbing Skithouse, Big Bite, All Aussie Adventures and Comedy Inc.<br /><br />It easily ranks amongst some of the most over-rated and over-watched Australian shows of all time like Neighbours and Home & Away.<br /><br />All this show is is a bunch of self-indulgent, old, untalented actors and actresses playing stupid, annoying characters (i.e. themselves), recycling jokes from 'Big Girl's Blouse' and trying to be funny with cheap puns.<br /><br />What irritates me even more is that when 'Double the Fist', one of the all time greatest Australian TV shows ever made won the AFI for best comedy beating this show, every newspaper article afterwards winged about how this got it's arse kicked by a more deserving show.<br /><br />Wise up Australia! This show is crap.
