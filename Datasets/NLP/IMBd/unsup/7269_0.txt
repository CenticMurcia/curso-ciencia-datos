[ * CONTAINS SPOILERS * ]<br /><br />This is a Japanese animation film, or as some call it, animé, based on the character of Dracula. I don't particularly like animé, but it's not as bad as you might think. In fact it's pretty good. It is much more of an adult's film than for children.<br /><br />In modern Boston, there is a Satanic ritual being performed, and a young woman by the name of Delores is to be sacrificed. Count Dracula crashes the ritual, and takes off with Delores. Because he has so much love for her, Dracula cannot bring himself to drink her blood, and instead fathers her child, named Janus. Some of Dracula's enemies try to kill him, but, accidentally kill the newborn Janus instead.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dracula's enemies are preparing to finish him off. A team of vampire hunters including Frank Drake (one of Dracula's descendants), and Hans Harker (who is in a wheel-chair). And to top it off, Dracula has been stripped of all of his vampiric powers by Satan, whom he supposedly betrayed in a deal. He desperately needs another vampire to restore his powers and to avenge the death of his son, Janus.<br /><br />I won't tell what happens at the end, just so I don't spoil it TOO much and you decide to watch it. This is a pretty rare film, no one I know has even heard of it. It's pretty different, to say the least. If you can even find it, I recommend it to any vampire fans.
