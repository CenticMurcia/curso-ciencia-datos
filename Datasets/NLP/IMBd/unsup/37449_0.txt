A bunch of kids of indeterminate age take a cross country trip to, uh, New Orleans? Because they end up in Asbury Park, NJ. They WERE going to New Orleans, right? But they end up in Asbury Park because one finds a pamphlet in a restroom that trumpets the opening of the Dark Ride, a boardwalk attraction that shut down many years ago after twin sisters got killed. So of course the whole gang detours to this place and guess what? Most of them get killed too, by this hulking loony that's just escaped from a psychiatric hospital. And this particular hulking loony grew up inside this Dark Ride, being that he didn't look right so he was kept hidden. Maybe this is a "loving" tribute the the slasher films of the 80's, like The Funhouse & all those, but it's a dull tribute and falls pretty flat. The killer wears a little tiny face pulled off of a mannequin, which is sort of a nice touch but there's your Michael & Jason...although this thing is called Jonah. And it also seems like perhaps none of this "detour" was random either, it was planned out by someone & therein lies the twist of this, which by the point it's revealed you are so bored you won't care or you already saw it coming. I though I'd seen the worst of the "8 Films to Die For" already but now that I've proved I haven't I think I'll just stop before I waste any more time on them. "Abandoned" & "Reincarnation" are worth your time, but it sure seems like most of the rest are not. 3 out of 10.
