I wish there had been something like this when I was younger rather than my 70 year old music teacher who had no idea what was going on in the music I was listening to at the time other than the certainty that "that's not music that's just loud banging and screaming!" It's one thing to understand notes and technical aspects of being a musician but an understanding of attitude, performance, vibe, etc is a necessary trait that most music instructors lack. I got a kick out of watching him treat the kids as peers instead of condescending to them. Great finale as well. I really dug the movie. Teaching kids to rock is a noble calling indeed :) Can't wait to see it again when it comes out proper.
