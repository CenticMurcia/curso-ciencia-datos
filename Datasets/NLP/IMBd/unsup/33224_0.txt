When I entered the theater on November 10, I expected a film as good and exciting as the Japanese version. Instead, what I got was a piece of junk changed so much that it's almost unrecognizable.<br /><br />The movie's main meaning and the animation remains, but other than that, everything else was different.<br /><br />For example, Mewtwo was turned from a mischievous troublemaker into a 6'7" organism of evil heck-bent to destroy the world.<br /><br />The music was the best part of the original, but it's the worst part of the dubbed version. I almost gagged when I saw the end credits, which was one of the best parts of the Japanese version.<br /><br />If you're a Pokmon fan that hasn't seen this film, I would advise you to stay away from it. Watch the Japanese version instead.
