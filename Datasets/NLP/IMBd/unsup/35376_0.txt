It's really difficult to try and explain what THE HANGING WOMAN is about, but I'll give it a shot. A young man returns to his uncle's mansion shortly after his death to find out what really happened to his uncle, and . Upon his arrival, he discovers a woman hanging from a tree. He makes it to the mansion and informs the people there about the woman. When he returns to the spot, she has disappeared. He soon uncovers a plot to make an army of the living dead in order for world dominance.<br /><br />THE HANGING WOMAN is so erratic that you never really understand what's going on. There are also two other sub-plots in the mix here. There are also a couple more things that made me despise this film so much. 1.) Spanish horror star, Paul Naschy was woefully under-used at the necrophiliac gravedigger. 2.) The pacing was awful. It's only a 90 minute film, but it felt like it was four hours long. Mostly due to the fact that nothing is really happening for a good hour of the film. 3.) The incestuous relationship between the uncle's nephew and his nymphomaniac aunt. The love scene was just way too much to handle. And finally, 4.) The ending was completely unbelievable and rushed.<br /><br />Honestly, I can only really recommend THE HANGING WOMAN to Naschy fans. Even that's difficult to do. Skip it and use the 90 minutes of your precious life watching something that's far better (perhaps, HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB or THE WEREWOLF VS. THE VAMPIRE WOMEN. Two of my personal favorite Naschy film) instead of wasting it on this abomination. Trust me, you'll thank me later.
