AFTER THE SUNSET is the new movie by director Brett Ratner, it stars Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek as lovers and retired thieves living at the Bahamas. Woody Harrelson plays Stan, an FBI agent who has spent 7 years looking for them and has finally found them apparently living a quiet life making love and watching sunsets.<br /><br />Max (Brosnan) is not as comfortable as Lola (Hayek) with their brand new life style. Max is fighting with temptations coming from local kingin Don Cheadle who has his eyes on the $$$Napoleon Diamond$$$. The movie doesn't focus much on the heist and it focuses on the great chemistry of its characters.<br /><br />Salma Hayek and Pierce Brosnan have great chemistry as lovers, Brosnan and Woody Harrelson also... ? and Don Cheadle is great in his brief. Salma Hayek is hot and charming, Brosnan is smooth as usual and Harrelson is hilarious and that makes a perfect combination of talent and charisma that saves AFTER THE SUNSET from being boring or meaningless.<br /><br />The plot at the end is not going to shock audiences with something they don't see coming but the movie is more a comedy about heist with nice elements of romance and thriller than a serious heist film like The Italian Job,<br /><br />If you like good fun movies or simply, you loved Rush Hour, then you know what you'll get from After the Sunset<br /><br />8/10
