I think I must have seen a different movie than the others who posted reviews here, because there was very little redeeming about the dreck I watched. For starters, the performances were ghastly! These so called actors wouldn't have made the cut for a grade school play. I've also read the reviews that praise the night photography. WTF?? There is so much light in each scene in the woods that it looks like they were shooting in Shea Stadium with all the floods on full! Just where is all this light supposed to be coming from anyway? Of course the snail pace of the action doesn't help either. Very few clich√©s are missed: person slowly backing up not realizing the killer is behind her; girl limping slowly through woods to escape killer; killer slowly approaches vehicle just as it pulls away, etc. etc. Slow being the key word here folks. The story gets so repetitive that we know exactly what will happen next: person goes out in search of missing camper in woods (alone of course), stumbles over body of last person who went out searching (alone) and promptly gets whacked by Madman Marz. Snore. Special effects? Not really special at all. When Marz kills his family at the beginning it looks like the axe is splitting overripe melons. Look ma, no skull!<br /><br />If you've seen Friday the 13th, Sleepaway Camp or Halloween you know what's going to happen and pretty much who will be left at the end, though they added a slight twist to keep you awake. Too little too late I say.<br /><br />Now, on the positive side, I will say that parts of the film were equally as funny as Scary Movie. My favorite 3 comedy scenes are: <br /><br />1. The hot tub love scene. Was this supposed to be sexy? OMG! Clearly everyone associated with writing and performing this was a virgin.<br /><br />2. The mess hall stalking of the girl with the Melissa Manchester hairdo and voice that could call dogs. This one had me laughing so hard that I was thankful I wasn't drinking anything or it would have come out my nose.<br /><br />3. Richie's discovery in the basement of the farmhouse. The look on this actor's face is so slow and pathetic that I almost felt bad for him. I could practically see him trying to find the right expression, which, alas, never comes. Priceless.<br /><br />What did we ever do to deserve this? It's no wonder that most of these actors never did another film. Even Gaylen Ross used a pseudonym.<br /><br />For those of you who think this is a decent slasher film, I urge you to view Halloween, Friday the 13th, or Nightmare on Elm Street. You'll see the difference.
