I remember seeing the previews for this and really looking forward to seeing it. I thought it was going to be an honest look at the way a family changes when something like this happens to a parent, my family went through something similar when I was growing up, so to see someone like Harrison Ford take on this topic was something I really wanted to see. After I saw it, I was so disgusted. When something like this happens, the spouse and children have to adjust to a new life, and it isn't easy, and there's always a part of you that misses the kind of life you had envisioned. But in this awful movie, the wife is just pleased as punch that she gets to spend the rest of her life with a mentally challenged man, because he was kind of a jerk before he was shot, so you see, he and everybody else is better off because he was shot in the head and made retarded, the wife gets faithful husband, and the kids get the little brother they always wanted.<br /><br />They could have made an honest and interesting movie about what some families have to face.If the movie had been about what families really face in a situation like this, it might have worked. As it is, I am offended by this movie to the Nth degree.
