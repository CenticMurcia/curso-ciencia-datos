Burt Reynolds and Tony Randall in charge of the "apparatus" required to make a pass on a date, with Woody as one of a thousand soldiers make the rest of the movie worth the wait. The more times I see this, the more I also enjoy Gene Wilder's bit as an unusual doctor with an odd sense of compassion. If you like "intelligent-zany" this is for you.
