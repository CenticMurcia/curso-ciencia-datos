Title "FANAA"....as it says "Destroyed in Love"...well suits the theme.<br /><br />Rehan (Aamir Khan) is on a mission where he meets Zooni (Kajol), playing a role of a blind girl who is on a visit to Delhi for the performance. The story starts with them falling in love with each other. The dialog here are very interesting especially for Hindi / Urdu poetry lovers. It is a beautiful expression of exchanging their feelings in enchanting wordsÂ…truly mesmerizing. The viewers who are enthralled by this love story in the first half are astonished to see the twist of the second half. Here comes the silent message and the sad end (as the name suggests) where Zooni has to choose between right or wrong, between the life with her son and lover/husband who has returned after years or the country's wellbeing that is in danger if Rehan succeeds in his plan. Zooni chooses the right thing as taught by her parents. <br /><br />Over all, it is a good plot, well written and well directed. It is a love story with a twist finally depicting that the love for the truth and for the country is far greater then one's personal feeling. As mentioned, there is always a choice between good and bad but what defines one's life is the right choice.<br /><br />Lyrics are very melodious and the music is also very good that gifts us the hit song of the month "Chand..."
