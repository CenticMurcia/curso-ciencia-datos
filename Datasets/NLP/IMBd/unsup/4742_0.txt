"How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's so lifeless, stupid, ugly and inept, it's hard to believe that anyone involved, from the director to the scriptwriter to Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, titled, with a false generosity, "stars," received payment for their services. This is one of those movies where, frame by frame, you sit there saying, "How could anything this bad ever have reached theaters? <br /><br />"Lose a Guy" is meant to be a romantic comedy, but there is no romance, and no comedy. Hudson and McConaughey have been more charismatic in tabloid TV talk shows. There's no timing, no tension, no wit, no music, no flair, just inert matter moving, like sludge, in front of your eyes. Not even good enough for one of those days when you are exhausted from work and just want to watch *something*. Staring at a blank screen for ninety minutes would be more uplifting.
