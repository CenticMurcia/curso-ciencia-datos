Up to the time of his death in 1976, Jack Cassidy had played more villains (3)in Columbo than any other actor, and deservedly so. Had he stayed among the living, it is is probable that he would have appeared in countless others. Suave and sophisticated, he had that rare ability and screen presence which allowed him to play a bad guy who didn't have to be overtly evil and elicit hatred from the audience in order for them to want him to be caught. To me, that quality makes for the best Columbo opposition, because it places the emphasis is on the cat and mouse game, rather than just the simplistic good vs. bad. In this one, Cassidy plays a famous magician who murders a blackmailing magic club owner. The murder plot and cover-up is elaborate, but not overly and needlessly complicated. From the way Columbo first zeros in on suspect(without spoiling it - it revolves around the way the body fell and therefore how the murderer entered the room) to his piecing together means, opportunity and motive I found this one extremely intriguing and engrossing. The scene at the end with the letters is great. All in all, a top 5 Columbo for me.
