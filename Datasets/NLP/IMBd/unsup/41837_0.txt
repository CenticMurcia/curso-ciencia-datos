that the female love interest was just some random skank, she wasn't some amazingly rare prize that every guy would do just about anything to be with. In fact, she was about the worst female character they could have written to base this scenario around.<br /><br />Any straight guy willing to go to these lengths to be with a girl like that has some serious emotional and mental damage as well as baggage.<br /><br />As a movie, it was entertaining but all the while this ate at me. It was too much to believe without a better set up and more character development. Had they all been in college and Caleb suffering from some horrible insecurities, it would have been much more believable.<br /><br />There is a sequel, not so sure I'll give it a chance based on the huge flaw of this script that is specifically due to one character..a character that could be had by anyone after enough liquor on a Saturday night. Girls like that are everywhere to the point that they ARE the modern "girl next door".
