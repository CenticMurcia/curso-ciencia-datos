fast-paced. Hot young (and older) stars. Pretty good acting. The story is weak though...not much original. The drug bit has been used so many times (and overdone here) that its not funny. about the pacing, I saw an early screening, and I recommend recutting the last scene. The shot with the kid and the eyes is good, but the reunion with Joey Lauren Adams is overlong.
