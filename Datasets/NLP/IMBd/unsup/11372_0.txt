I saw this movie for the first time about a week ago and it is the funniest movie I have ever seen! It can be goofy sometimes, but it is so ridiculously goofy that you still laugh. If you like comedies I HIGHLY recommend this movie for your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />Lets ask Mikey to do it, he'll try anything
