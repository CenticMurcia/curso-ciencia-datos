I watched The Beginning a couple months ago. It vanished so quickly from memory that I forgot to write a User Comment at the time. Unfortunately, even for a sufferable fan of the genre, this installment of the Texas Chainsaw series is just one more sell-out like the others, beginning with the birth of Leatherface and leading all the way to yet another cheese-ball ending. For chrissakes, they even had the guy walk away to a narrated ending, a lone spotlight (a-la Mr. Bean), accentuating the 'island unto himself' theme. Pathetic.<br /><br />The birth and origins of Thomas Hewitt, with all the questions you never really cared about asking, get answered. From how the family ended up the way they were, to how Leatherface gets his first chainsaw, The Beginning wastes no time cutting through another franchise.<br /><br />One performance that stands out, simply because in my opinion, he's one helluva actor, is R. Lee Ermey. From the Texas remake, till now, the scriptwriters successfully figured out how to turn the real antagonist in the movie into a lame blow-hard, but Ermey makes the most of his paycheck, plunging into the horrible dialogue, encouraging Thomas to do the horrific until there's no point of return. Unfortunately, for you, the insufferable movie viewer, this is one doozy that no amount of pain medication couldn't cure. Good luck.
