Mike is my hero! Finally, someone who doesn't wander blindly through the most obvious horror movie setups without spotting them and pointing them out to anyone and everyone who'll listen to him. Unfortunately for the rest of the group, they don't pay attention to him until it's too late. This movie is completely fun and you'll probably find yourself smiling through most of it. Face to face with a flesh eating alien with the ability to shoot hypnotic ray beams from it's eyes? Throw the cat at it. Sure, the cat will run away as soon as it hits the floor...but at least it bought you a couple of seconds. This movie is filled with goofball comedy from start to finish and is a must watch for any fan of comedy horror.
