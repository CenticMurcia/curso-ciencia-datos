I bet on paper this movie is way better. The story is somehow intelligent and has a lot of clever twists and turns but, on screen, it has some failures and basically in the overall acting zone. I think maybe it's because the main role doesn't reflect the hard conflicts he's living in and with the exception of Byrne and Roth -both giving strong performances-, the rest of the cast is halfway through the intensity I assume was really needed to make us live the plot. <br /><br />On the other hand, I think the camera does a fine job trying to capture the best angles in order to show the deep core in the story and the settings helps a lot to the looks and mood, full of dark nights, gray skies and very cold buildings. Nevertheless, if on script this idea sounds pretty interesting, the way it is developed by the characters leaves a sensation of underplaying which is something sad due to the somehow edgy material written. You realize how clever the screenplay was once the film is finish, when you reconstruct all the matters and personal motivations in your head.<br /><br />Emmett's mark it's not a despicable thriller but is not a go-see-it-now either. I give it 6/10
