The best of Katt Williams. The best he's done. Very funny guy. Solid. Real solid. I even liked that jacket he was wearing. He's a funny funny cat. He tells stories with good punchlines. He makes you think about things I like that about him. It's not just the same old, same old. I've heard some of the jokes in other videos, but this first video is his best. Solid comedy for 70 straight minutes, with real audience reaction. You know it was true what the audience felt about him at the end. It was funny too. More physical comedy. Great story and punchlines. And at the beginning, I liked the short at the beginning too. Very relevant. You don't see that very often.
