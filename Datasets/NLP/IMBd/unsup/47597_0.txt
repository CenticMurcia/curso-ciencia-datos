I have listened (had listened)to PHC for two decades. The eponymously named movie seems quite to have been assembled by a craftsman with a remarkable difficulty exchanging a jumbled inner monologue with a coherent, external story telling monologue. However, since it is the GREAT ALTMAN, none dare say the emperor has no clothes. Well, I am at a loss to understand how you can take so many familiar characters, structures, processes, sounds and styles and extract from them the essence of their familiarity, humor, pathos, drama, and poignancy. It smelled of such preening self-absorption that I could barely tolerate the stench. Listening to the actresses and actors on talk shows in the days leading up to the release and to the day I saw it I was sure that the movie would be as magical and enchanting as the radio show (sans The News from LW). No such luck. They just cannot avoid behaving like little toddlers who come out and say "I MADE POOPIE" "LOOK AT MY POOPIE". To which the other toddlers clap and say "OOOOH! What GREAT POOPIE". Thank heaven JC Reilly and W Harrelson at least told some of the more lame jokes from the Joke Shows of PHC. The only moments of charm. <br /><br />A movie about death. Death of characters we don't know or care about b/c they get killed too quick to learn anything of them. Sorry. It isn't a personal attack on anyone. I just hated this one as much as I have hated every movie that Jim Carrey has ever been in.
