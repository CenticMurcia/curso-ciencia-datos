What can you expect from a B-grade sequel to a movie that, in spite of Mira Sorvino and some nifty special f/x, still failed to deliver a minimum of excitement? Not a lot - so you will be somewhat pleasantly surprised watching Mimic 2. Having seen ARRIVAL II and SPECIES II, I was prepared for the absolute worst, and I could not believe my eyes when this sequel turned out to be... well... decent. While not as pervasive as in the first movie, the f/x seem really high quality, and definitely don't give you that dreadful 'cheap' feeling. The story is predictable, including many of the most common cliches of the horror genre, but the photography and lighting do provide a nice ambiance, and manage to sell the story. Bruno Campos is absolutely awful as he tries to transplant (lamely) his character from Jesse, but Alix Koromzay (the female heroine) who comes back from the first Mimic to provide an appearance of continuity does a pretty good job carrying the movie on her own. Sure, it is not a highlight of American cinema, but it's entertaining eyecandy.
