"MALLRATS" is one of the greatest comedy's of all time! It's up there.. along with "Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back" and others.. I've seen all Kevin Smith's films and I believe the best two are "STRIKE BACK" and "MALLRATS".... I can't wait til the next Jay & Silent Bob flick... I hope it has Jason Lee in it! The guys terrific... This movie is hilarious.. Genius diologue! Kevin Smith is a genius. He's unique. Everybody should see Mallrats.. Only an idiot wouldn't like this movie.<br /><br />****/**** 4 out of 4 stars, baby!
