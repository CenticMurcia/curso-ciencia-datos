"It is a well-known psychological fact that people's behavior is strongly affected by the way they dress," claims the narrator. That sets up the premise of the cartoon which shows Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd both changing personalities as different hats fly on them. (A truck carrying lots of hats spills its merchandise in the forest where are two stars are, hence the different hats/helmets keep falling on their heads.)<br /><br />Bugs goes from army sergeant to game warden to native American to gangster to judge to groom. Elmer goes from hunter to, General MacArthur, to pilgrim, to a little lady with a bonnet to policeman to bride. Why bride-and-groom? "Because it always helps a picture to have a romantic ending," Bugs tells us at the end.<br /><br />I hate to spoil the party here but I did not find this cartoon funny, just stupid. I like Bugs Bunny cartoons but this one was just plain dumb despite an interesting premise.
