What happened to the 'second' hero who went back to 1777? Didnt the soldiers of 1777 document the 1st use of an UZI? Wouldnt a PLANE CRASH FROM 1777 BE NEWS??? The girl who 'died' in the plane crash didnt find it unusually shocking that she FOUND HER OWN DEAD BODY IN THE PLANE CRASH?? My god, this script must have been written over a lunch meeting with the producers. Awful, and just flat out stupid. 1 star because of the JFK Dollar from 2041.
