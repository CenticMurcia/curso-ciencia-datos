This film is an absolute delight, filled with fabulous performances by Stanley Tucci, Tony Shalhoub, Ian Holm, and Minnie Driver, I don't know how it managed to escape Oscar nominations. The sweet, poignant story of a restaurant proprietor and his brother, the cook's, attempts to keep their struggling franchise afloat is perfect fare not just for families, but for anyone who enjoys a truly well made film. Every aspect of this film sparkles, and provides a true cure to today's big bang, big money, flashtacular Hollywood films.
