This film starts off OK. It has heather graham in it, so I wasn't expecting much besides nasty sex scenes and bulging eyes (of which you get both in this film). The fact that she is supposed to be some folksy singer-songwriter is laughable because I've met this character time and time again in the downtown art scene.<br /><br />All of the dialogue, starting with Jeremy Sisto's entrance is laughable and obviously written by a man. If written by a woman, Hope (heather graham) would've reached for her pepper spray after Will's (Jeremy Sisto) initial pick up line.<br /><br />The movie goes no where fast, has a small up lift with the black box theatre style of the dinner, then continues on a downward spiral. The cast is amazing, and I'm surprised that so many somewhat respectable actors would sign to such boring banal work.<br /><br />The special features are a laugh and a half as more praise over Graham's beauty and perfection for the part is expressed. The producer says producer-like things like "many other actresses wanted this part but Heather was just perfect". Way to make it sound like Angelina, Charlize, and Drew all wanted to be part of this ishfest.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this for 3 dollars on Thanksgiving. I'll be thanks-giving this away on Ebay tomorrow.<br /><br />There are so many other problems with this film including editing, music, and character development but the other REAL comments speak for themselves.<br /><br />Jeremy Sisto...what happened?
