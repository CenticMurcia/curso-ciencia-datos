Dist. Atty. Martin Ferguson (Humphrey Bogart) has the chance of sending the criminal Albert Mendoza (Everett Sloane) to the electric chair. He depends on the testimony of Mendoza`s right arm Joseph Rico (Ted De Corsia). Rico is so scared that commits a mistake and dies. Ferguson passes all the case again and again trying to find a new evidence or witness. Through flashbacks, the viewer sees what has happened until the death of Rico. Today I have just watched this movie on cable television, since it has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil. I can not understand how the Brazilian distributors have not paid attention on this spectacular film noir. It is almost a masterpiece, and unfortunately my friends, who are also fans of movies, do not know this magnificent film. The story is very tight, and all the cast has an excellent performance, with another great direction of Raoul Walsh. The black & white photography is fantastic, with the use of shadows specially in the exterior scenes. It is funny how the title of this movie is changed, depending on the country (`Murder, Inc.', in UK, and `A Price For Each Crime' in my country). The fans of film noir and police story will certainly love this unknown jewel. My vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `Um Pre√ßo Para Cada Crime' (`A Price For Each Crime')
