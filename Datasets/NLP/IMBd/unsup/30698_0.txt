A former POW ( Ricky Giovinazzo) has troubled memories of his past back in Vietnam as now he's a family guy with a nagging wife and a weird deformed son in New York City. He's also looking for a job to help his family as he begins to now work for a drug dealer with a gang if he can get them the money he owes them until one day he finally snaps and gets revenge even on his wife and kid.<br /><br />A disturbing, bleak and interesting action drama that feels as a mix of both genres which is also a character study in it and it's one of the more serious "Troma" distributed flicks, it's also a interesting movie as well. There's plenty of drug use, gore and violence to propel the film especially on the troubled former hero of the picture with his nature of course and it's one of the most underrated war-related movies yet that has gained a cult following.<br /><br />A must see movie! <br /><br />Also recommended: "Men Behind The Sun", "Saving Private Ryan", "Rambo Trilogy", "Troma's War", "Red Dawn", "Day of the Dead", "The Toxic Avenger", "Hostel", "Cannibal Apocalypse", "The Exterminator", "Taxi Driver", "Eraserhead", "Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)", "Cannibal Ferox", "Surf Nazis Must Die", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", "Eraserhead", "Cabin Fever", "Full Metal Jacket", "Apocalypse Now", "The Hills Have Eyes ( 1977 and 2006)", "Mother's Day", "Caligula", "Uncle Sam", "Cemetery Man", "Black Christmas", "Freddy vs. Jason", "Terror Firmer", "Jungle Holocaust" ( a.k.a.
