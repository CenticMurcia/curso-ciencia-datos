Little Black Book has a lot of things, there is some romance, some deception and a little comedy added for flavor. However, the movie suffers from a dearth of generally likable characters.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple. Stacey (Murphy) is trying to find her place in life, and comes to work at a daytime talk show as an associate producer. She is happy with her boyfriend and job. Then one day, an associate, Barb, take an idea that was pitched during a meeting, little black books, and suggests Stacey go through her boyfriends and find out about his ex-girlfriends. Stacey, using the show as a guise, interviews the women, befriends one, and slowly comes to find that her boyfriend is not what he seems and their relationship is not as happy as she thought it was. This all comes to a climax on the talk show, where Barb has set Stacey up, and a confrontation between Stacey, her boyfriend and his ex-girlfriends occurs.<br /><br />The problem of this movie is that most of the characters are not particularly sympathetic. Stacey comes off as neurotic, paranoid and generally dysfunctional. There is no reason to really root for her to succeed. Her boyfriend comes off as a louse. Barb is simply cruel. The only one who is really sympathetic is one of the ex-girlfriends played by Julianne Nicholson. Her character is fleshed out in a way none of the others are.
