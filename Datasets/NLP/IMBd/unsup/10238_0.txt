This movie is so awesome. The anarchy, the insanity and pure emotions unleashed throughout the film. All of these factors make the movie both extremely entertaining and tantalizing. Yes, I agree that this is definitely a morally bankrupt flick, but you actually feel satisfied, and I mean like cartharsis, after the credits that roll finally end(yea, you gotta see the credits too)<br /><br />Above all, this is one of the best comedies I have ever seen in my life so far. And it's got a great soundtrack too :)<br /><br />Go Bulldozer! "I only attack one!"
