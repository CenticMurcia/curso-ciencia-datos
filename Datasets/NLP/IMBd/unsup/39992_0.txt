I agree with everything you said. It is all about flashing boobs, also masturbation. On top of that it is like seeing one big soap opera . I would of rather watched a soap opera than this movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. My girlfriend fell asleep in the middle of the movie because it was so boring. This is my opinion. If you buy or rent this movie it is a waste of time and money. Dawn of the dead and any other vampire movie beats this movie big time. Like I said this is an opinion I came up with. You make like this movie if you like fake blood, and body parts that look like scraps from a meat dept in your local store. Let me not go any further before I give the whole plot away.
