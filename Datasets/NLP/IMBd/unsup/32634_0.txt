----- SPOILER ALERT -- SPOILER ALERT -- SPOILER ALERT -----<br /><br />This film is bad in every way! Normally i newer comment film here on IMDb, but this film is so extremely bad, that I gotta warn people against it. It got no story, you don't know exactly what the point is, is the main character good or bad and fast you don't care. The photography is boring, trying to become something and end up extremely pretentious. The symbolism is SO thick that you can have to use a big knife to cut trough it. Oh sweet Jesus. And the whole holocaust theme is simply pathetic. The main character, an old Jewish man, is so annoying, and everybody just adore him "because hes so magic" (blaaaahhh), so I actually cheered on the Germans. The use of voice-over is simply pathetic, and make the film even more pretentious. The scene where the nurse gets introduced says it all: You see the feets from a beautiful woman walking down a hall. The camera pans up and you see her sexy legs and you notice that she is wearing a nurse suit. The pan ends up at her ass and its a nice, sexy ass. When you see this pan, the voice-over say something like: "The nurse, her legs is so sexy, and her ass is the best". Duh... yes, that what we can see on the screen. Don't have to tell me like I'm an idiot. I feel sorry for all the Jews that died in WWII, but its still not an excuse for making such a horrible film. zero stars from me...
