Pretty bad film with George Sanders and Lucille Ball starring. Their chemistry is about non-existent. This is supposed to be a murder thriller and for a change there is absolutely no violence shown as 7 women fall victim to a mysterious killer.<br /><br />Charles Coburn is the inspector of Scotland Yard yet he has no British accent. Lucille Ball plays a dancer doing odd jobs who works as a decoy for the Yard when one of her friends mysteriously disappears and eventually shown to fallen victim to this maniacal killer.<br /><br />Ball is essentially Lucy without the laughs. Despite what others say, she shows absolutely no dramatic flare here at all. I expected Ethel and Fred Mertz to intervene at any time to save the day.<br /><br />It becomes so obvious who the killer is. Sir Cedric Hardwicke, who was so good in "The Ten Commandments" and memorable as Henry Cabot Lodge in "Wilson," looks like a real odd-ball here.<br /><br />The ending is predictable even with Sanders, the lover of Ball, in the film confessing guilt to draw the real killer out.
