Jenny Wright is engaging as an offbeat young woman--a bookworm addicted to pulpy thrillers--who is stalked by a monster right out of the pages of her latest read. Nicely set in Hollywood, California, this B-flick unfortunately doesn't have the budget to cover its pulp-thriller aspirations. Director Tibor Takács attempts to build creepy-funny tension and atmosphere, but the script by David Chaskin is too thin, and lacks both the wit and panache for Takács to get the film over the top. And yet Jenny Wright is a lot of fun (she's like a kindred spirit to Joan Cusack). Comedic thriller has some memorable bits, but it needed more production finesse and substance. ** from ****
