The Simpsons TV-series are really good and i've watched every single episode (including the new season 20 episode 1) and from seasons 1-10 many times. I just hate one thing about the Simpsons. The boring "fill-in" episodes. The episodes with the singing, clip-shows and the 3 story episodes. The thing i love about Futurama is there is no bad episodes. I own all the seasons (in Finland it's 4 seasons, in U.S.A it's divided into 5 seasons) but not the new "movie-episodes". They really suck, the first movie was so disappointing and bad, but in the second movie, "The beast with a billion backs" was actually quite good. The writers of the show admitted that the first movie was terrible and said that they are still finding the right way to do futurama movies (1 movie, 4 episodes) and they have succeeded. Can't wait for the 3rd movie.<br /><br />10/10 and give the Simpsons also a 10/10
