Man... I thought I'd seen some bad movies before, but this is seriously the worst ever. Its so bad, that if you are even the least bit drunk or high you'll find this movie hilarious. There are 6-8 totally ugly chicks who all just keep getting naked. The production value is zero, think high school project done in a weekend. It was obviously filmed in a park, and nothing, no amount of seeing the people in the movie naked could ever make up for how terrible this movie is. Yea I laughed my ass off, but if you have to spend even one dollar on it, its overpriced. I caught it on latenight television, and I felt bad, really bad, for everyone involved in the movie. You can't plan on making something this bad, it has to just happen. A quick spoiler: the hobbits, or whatever they're called in this movie, enter a tavern which is supposed to be in the forrest in medieval time and make out on the tavern pool table, which looks brand new. Man... SO bad.
