Though I liked DIAL M FOR MURDER, this is not one of Hitchcock's classics, so the idea of a remake doesn't turn me off. And for the first 2/3, things are fine, especially since director Davis and writer Kelly add a twist on the "murder" that's smart and surprising. Douglas has played this part before, but he does it well, and Mortenson is good as well. But then there's a dumb twist thrown in near the end, and both Paltrow and David Suchet as the detective (who, as played by John Williams, was the best part of the original) are left twisting in the wind.
