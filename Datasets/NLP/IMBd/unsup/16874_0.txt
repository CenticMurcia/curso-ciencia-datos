It took me a number of years to see it. Always knew the music, but never took the time to watch it..for some reason or another. Few years ago saw it on a Classic Cable movie channel. I have not stopped watching it since. About a year ago, I BOUGHT THE DVD SPECIAL EDITION..I always find a reason to see it again. And I keep finding more things in it..to make it more rewarding each time. syl.
