While pre Matrix, this show only failed due to being a little too military, and too SF for mainstream audiences. It showed great potential, and some of the final episodes really showed off how this series could have progressed. But like Freakylinks and The Others, series can sometimes be too smart for their own good. Could have been great, but was never given the chance to shine, it's certainly worth a watch on DVD.<br /><br />There was some great acting in there, especially by D B Sweeney, and the ever cool Terry O'Quinn, it showed great potential for a good conspiracy SF thriller with parallel worlds. It could be that the timing was just wrong for it, being screened too close to the Matrix to be taken as anything but a clone.
