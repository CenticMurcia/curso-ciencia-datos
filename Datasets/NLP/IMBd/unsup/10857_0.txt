A scary and good old-fashioned joy ride that concentraits on an aging goverment agent, Peter Sandza (Kirk Douglas - "Ben-Hur") who finds help from Gillian (Amy Irving - "Traffic"), a teenage girl who's surprised to learn that she has special abilities and he relies on her to find out where a crooked adversary of his, Childress (the late John Cassavetes - "The Dirty Dozen") is doing with his psychic son, Robin (Andrew Stevens).<br /><br />Brian DePalma ("Carrie", "The Untouchables") directs here and he applies the hair-raising details where they're needed. John Farris used his novel in adapting the screenplay. Rick Baker's make-up and special effects are a delight to see and the ending is a good example of that. And legendary composer John Williams serves up a tense and enjoyable musical score. The opening theme is the best one to listen to.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, the performances are first-rate hands down. Douglas is reliable as he usually is, Cassavetes is up to his usual antics, and Irving shows here why she can looked upon to be a good actress.
