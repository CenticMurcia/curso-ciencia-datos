This is one of the worst animes I've ever seen. It is difficult for me to give an anime a low rating because I like the genre very much but this movie deserves a 2/10 at most. Unlike Ninja Scroll, this movie lacks character development, original and interesting story and good animation. Not even the gory fights make this worthwhile. My advice is to stay away from this one and email the people responsible for this to show how much you hate them for making something so awful and pointless. The only good thing about it is that it is short which makes the torture kind of bearable.
