After the notorious splatter period and of course massively praised "Heavenly creatures" - his very first motion picture with a slightly more serious look and feel, the insane New Zealander Peter Jackson directed "Forgotten silver" with Costa Botes. So far it is definitely one of the most ingenious projects of his whole career.<br /><br />"Forgotten silver" (just like Woody Allen's classic "Zelig") is filled with silly, senseless and absurd ideas and details to make it all sound a bit too suspicious to be actually true but not enough to make it completely unbelievable either. Actually I've seen real-life documentaries that are even harder to swallow than this. The big joke is that even if it sounds unbelievable it's a documentary and you have to believe it because documentaries always tells you the truth. If you can't trust a documentary then what is there left to trust in the world?<br /><br />So Peter Jackson once again did something highly forbidden and un-ethical and made a documentary that's only a one big, dirty lie. The dedication Jackson and Botes had just to tell a story of a fictional person is certainly something incredible and respectable. Swindle it may be, but nevertheless from the opening scene when Peter Jackson tells about his amazing discovery of Colin McKenzie's lost film footage to that last picture of McKenzie filming himself using a mirror "Forgotten silver" is a terrific and fascinating story and truly a first-rate documentary. 10/10.
