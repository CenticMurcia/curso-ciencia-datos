I decided to watch this film because I love Cary Grant and eventually I want to see every film he made. Unfortunately, this one isn't even nearly one of his best. Far too much of the humor relies on the audience buying into those wonderful 1950's female stereotypes. I mean, we have female army officers, nurses, acting like silly little girls. It's quite revolting. In other words, far from being a classic, the film feels like an unintelligent, unenlightened piece of pop trash. Compare this to another Cary Grant film that came out the same year, North by Northwest; or Tony Curtis's Some Like it Hot which also came out in 1959. On an intellectual and artistic level, Operation Petticoat doesn't begin to come close.
