I saw this movie again on Sky One last night, I had not seen it since it first came out on video (did it even get a cinema release?). I could not believe how badly made it was! The acting, even by Van-Damme standards was woeful. The special effects (if you could call them that!) were as bad as an episode of Dr.Who and the costumes were really bad. The scene were all the bad guys beat that guy up near the beginning of the movie is hilarious-they look like something out of a Michael Jackson video!! It is such a poor rip-off of far better movies like the Mad Max movies and Terminator. I found it very hard to sit through this movie, it was really an insult to my intelligence! Did the people who made it not realize what a pile of rubbish it was? Could they not see that? This has definitely got to be one of the worst movies ever made!
