The Scary Movies weren't great...but they were okay. Date Movie was stupid. Epic Movie was the largest pile of junk I have ever seen.<br /><br />I actually expected something when I saw that Kal Penn (he was in one of my favorite comedies, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle) so I viewed it. I only laughed one time the whole film. It was not even a movie.<br /><br />It had no plot-line. They just randomly spat out movie jokes that were so corny that they could not be considered jokes. This is not along the lines of the great Airplane, which actually delivered good spoofs.<br /><br />This film spoofs X-Men, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and Harry Potter. I have seen clips of Ulli Lomell films that were better, his new films at least. Please don't watch this.
