Unlike many of you online film nerds, I don't like most of the movies by Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. I don't like buddy comedies. I have my own friends (and Pittsburgh friends, at that!) so I don't need to cinematic ally 'hang out' with a bunch of pals. I didn't think I would like Why We Had to Kill Bitch (rented at the lovely Dreaming Ant in Bloomfield) but I really, really did. There was just so much funny and in so many different ways. It was like Aqua Teen Ren and Stimpy weird-funny and Sienfeld situational-funny and lovable bittersweet-funny. It was well paced, free, random, and just a really pleasant surprise. I watched it twice, and caught a bunch of stuff for the first time the second time around. I tried to figure out were in Pittsburgh it was filmed. If anyone knows please post it. Great movie!
