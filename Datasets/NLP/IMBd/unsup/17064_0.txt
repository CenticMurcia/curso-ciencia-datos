Grant and Russell are comedy gold in this picture. They have an excellent comedic chemistry. Russell deliver's Hildy's lines so naturally it was as though MacArthur and Hecht wrote that dialog for her, specifically. and still maintained the grit of the original.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of Ralph Bellamy but he plays the bright-eyed innocent with zest. And Grant is deliciously reprehensible as Walter Burns. I have trouble seeing what Hildy saw in him during their first marriage and that's as it should be.<br /><br />My only quibble is the inevitable 'woman gives up her own life for a man' scenario that is so much a part of 30's, 40's and 50's cinema post-code. Hildy is most alive when she's chasing the story and Russell looks a touch uncomfortable playing the 'little woman' moments. Less believable.<br /><br />All in all the best of the film versions.
