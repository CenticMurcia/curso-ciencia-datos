This show is amazing it has a combination of laughter,heartache,touching,funny,sad this show has everything.<br /><br />every year the show changes so much new house, graphic designs ,themes, drastic HMs changes and even a different big bro.<br /><br />SUMMER would not be the same without this show anymore as its now going into its eight year running and still going strong.<br /><br />the show always has the word CONTERVERSY attached to it almost every year but its worth it that what makes this show so unique and above all its lesser knock offs because each year is so different and more outrageous.<br /><br />the minute the hms enter and the doors are closed on opening night you have to follow the journey for 10-13 weeks to be able to become attached to the characters and love, hate them or feel sad happy for them. and thats what i love about it there is no other show like this on the telly.<br /><br />the best season was in 2004 the HMs selection was perfect and BB got evil and Nada won on a very emotional final night. that series had everything fun fun fun LOL moments, funny HMs, great twists, huge fights(FIGHT NIGHT ANYONE). great group and friendship developments.<br /><br />LETS HOPE FOR A BRILL BIGBROTHER 8 I LOOK Forward TO WATCHING YOU BIG BROTHER WATCHING THE HOUSEMATES.
