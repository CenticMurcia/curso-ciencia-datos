I viewed this movie tonight at the Daytona Beach Film Festival and was pleasantly surprised. This film had it all, adventure, action and great characters. The breathtaking aerial shots, fast paced action scenes, and character development all came together to create a truly entertaining film. In a Q&A with the director, I was amazed to learn that this movie was filmed with a 2 million dollar budget. I initially thought this was going to be a kids movie. However, the characters quickly drew me into their lives and the storyline touched not only my adult mentality but also took me back to my childhood sense of wonder. The relationship between the characters spanned all ages and reminded me the importance of friendship and family. Hats off to Rocco. I hope to see more of your work in the future. Thank you for making this film and for putting your heart and soul into it!!!
