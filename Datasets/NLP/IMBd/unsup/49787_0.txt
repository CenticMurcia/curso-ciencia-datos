This movie is a disaster from beginning to end and I justify my summary because even though it is suppose to be a terror movie there is not terror anywhere. The idea that normal looking dogs could ever be scary enough just by showing their teeth is something that beggars belief. Even if a genetic experiment was done on the dogs the movie is not scary at any point and look ridiculous. But there is something far worse and more sinister in this movie. We know they are good friends but it happens that once one of them falls victim to the dogs nobody really seems to care and they are left to their own luck. For instance, the black guy once he is bitten by two dogs in the cellar they don't seem even to try to rescue him from the dogs they shut the door and let the dogs finish him off or the guy they find in the woods wounded is left to be eaten by the dogs. This film is not believable at all and has many flaws. Why doesn't anybody grab a kitchen knife? I will not waste any more time on this review, I'll just sum it up. The plot is stupid, the idea ridiculous, not scary at all and full of flaws, discontinuity, badly written and thought out. My vote has to be 1 out of 10.
