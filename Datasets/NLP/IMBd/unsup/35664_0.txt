Intriguing premise completely wasted somehow by Carpenter and crew. Sorry guys, I generally love Carpenter flicks, but this one is horrid garbage. Nearly every possible suspenseful sequence is butchered. Not much to say outside of the synopsis, but imagine Carpenter at his worst, and it only begins to describe the debacle that is "Prince of Darkness". I spent weeks searching my local video stores with a friend to find a copy, only to be more disappointed than I have by any of his other films. I love "The Thing", "They Live", ... heck, even have a soft spot for his Village of the Damned flick. But this.... Well, Thank god for Victor Wong tho. 4/10
