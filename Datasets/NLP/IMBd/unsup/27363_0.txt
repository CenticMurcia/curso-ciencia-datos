Can't Believe it never came to theatres around my City! Can't Believe Blockbuster only has one in stock as a new release!<br /><br />Scream deconstructed the horror genre and then used the fact that we all new the "rules" to find new ways to scare us. In much the same way, only using a documentary feel, BTM jokes about the "rules" and Clich√©s. Leslie and his mentor joke that some things are inside secrets of the trade.<br /><br />The story is well thought out and crafted; a team of documentary film makers are following Leslie as he is about to make is mark on the sleepy town of Glen Echo. The film crew set him up as a peer to Myers, Jason and Freddy. Leslie takes them on a tour of the would be crime scene, fills them in on the "motivation" for his soon to be killing spree, introduces them to his mentor, and even solicits their aid in setting up the events yet to unfold. On the way he explains the process of slashing. He breaks every aspect of it down: from, sabotaging possible weapons, waiting for the sex to start, using bodies as diversions and time management, to having a good "Ahab" and "sole survivor."<br /><br />For me, these leading up to events were the best part of the film. In In last part, Leslie shows just how much of a manipulator he really is and we find out that the film crew, was part of his plan from the get go. This change works well because it satisfies the question of why the film crew would actually agree to document such a nightmarish evening without trying to stop it.<br /><br />Nathan Baesel steals the show for sure. A powerful performance.<br /><br />Great cameos, great references (even little girls skipping in white dresses as on Elm Street).<br /><br />Make sure you stay for the end credits as well. You know what is coming, but you still can not wait till it does.
