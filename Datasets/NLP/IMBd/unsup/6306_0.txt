It had to happen someday: a movie about people who DIDN'T succeed with their ideas.<br /><br />At least they got their fifteen minutes of fame.<br /><br />In "Gizmo", the excitement and virtue of creativity is embraced in full as a multitude of inventions from a ways back are shown, via newsreels. Some are pretty viable (indestructable head gear) while others are just plain silly (inummerable flying machines) but all show a lot of imagination behind the madness.<br /><br />You have to hand it to the inventors, though: they were trying to better mankind. At least it wasn't through weapons of war.<br /><br />All in all, "Gizmo" is a lot of fun, for the whole family, even. If you can find it, rent it, or even catch it on TV, watch it. Especially if none of your ideas ever succeed.<br /><br />You'll feel better.<br /><br />Ten stars. Let's hear it for the entreprenurial spirit!
