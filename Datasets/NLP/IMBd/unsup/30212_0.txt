This was a great movie. I bought it from a major department store last night and let me tell you that I have seen it at least 8 times. Yes it's low budget but the idea was great. So many people compare low budget and local artist to high, block buster, household name movies in which that isn't fair. If I had over a million dollars to create a movie then my movie would have the best graphics, story line, audio board, power house studio, and major name actors. Please give this movie and other low budget movies a chance. Another thing, these actors as well as production crew did a great job for the material they had to work with. The director also did a pretty good job. The only thing is using your time, budget, crew, and location wisely always play a major role in every movie. This comment is from an industry player who no's that the beginning is not the end for anyone. We all create greatness if we learn from past projects. To the crew, actors, and especially the director; keep up the great work..
