I've seen this movie a lot of times,in fact,I bought it after I saw it the first time and I'm still always looking for time to watch it again. In this movie we can watch pretty good performances;emphasizing one or two of them would be unfair because they all are incredible,however I can say I consider Robin William's performance in this film the best of all his filmography. Technically,the whole crew made a unquestionably good work.The BSO worthy of an Oscar is mixed with wonderful landscapes caught with a brilliant photography. Peter Weir surpassed himself too with his work in this film. This film changes the audiences lives and make them feel into the film,because they talk about problems and subjects present in our society and make the audience think deeply about them as well as Mr Keating does in the film.After seen it everybody wants to "be more",and you feel you can "be more" if you simply "SEIZE YOUR DAY".
