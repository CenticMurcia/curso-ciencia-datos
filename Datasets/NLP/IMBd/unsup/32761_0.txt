This movie is so horrendously bad that it is actually awesome!!! This is the kind of movie that revels (unintentionally) in its atrociousness. There is absolutely no saving grace to this movie whatsoever. Mike Berube as Neil the cameraman is the only member of the cast not 100% bereft of talent of any kind (he has 99% no talent). As for Mr. Patterson's writing and directing ability: One wishes he had kept his penchant for self-expression to himself..... However I am strangely compelled to give this movie a 2/10 just simply because it is so mind-boggingly heinous in its marginal attempts at acting , plot and story that this is without a doubt the most awesome god-awful movie I have ever seen....
