this movie is the definition of awful, this movie really sucked. It was a cheap rip off of a Woo film were the main actors put on fake British accents and shoot anything that moves. Now that's no reason to give this movie a one it could still be fun, right? No it can't the action sucked. there is no cool action moves or stylish camera-work just the camera in front of a guy who pulls the trigger on his gun. The only reason i give this film (if you can call it that) one star is because of the movie's case lured me into actually buying it and the beginning credits music, if you are stuck with the movie don't watch it you'll have a better time staring at the case and listening to the beginning credits music. in conclusion, this movie isn't an action flick because the action just will give you a headache, this movie isn't a comedy because it's not funny, and it certainly is not a British gangster movie seeing that the creators of the film probably don't even know the definition of cockney is, to sum it all up, as a good British Gangstar movie would say "stay away from this Brad Pitt". Recomondations: for a good British gangster movies look up Snatch, Lock stock and two smokin barrels, and if you seen those try to find Gangstar no.1. not as good but pretty close
