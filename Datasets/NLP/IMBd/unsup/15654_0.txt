I saw this flick in the new release section and just had to check it out, especially since it was from the talented filmmakers of one film that I saw of theirs. Wow! What a funny movie. I've seen the The-white guy-trying-to-act-black routine before but the filmmakers somehow was able to make this particular character more original and on top of that he's carrying an umbrella in his own store!! LOL. How funny is that? Everybody did a good job. I mean Todd Bridges was OK but the other actors were BETTER. They did a very good job. Props to the cast and crew. Hopefully there'll be a trilogy to this one like the "friday" franchise has. Jerzee Representin'!
