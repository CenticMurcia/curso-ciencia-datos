What a shame to see two fantastic artists disgraced by their (note to previous commenter: their is possessive; there is a location)participation in this depressingly foul diatribe. What a shame that the last 2 hours can never be regained.<br /><br />Some will say that I hate this because it's a "Chick Flick" but I disagree. Only the truly lowest common denominator of women and men will voice their support of this depiction of demented female depravity wallowing in their overabundance of wealth. Why do they call it eccentricity with the wealthy and crazy with the poor? The wealthy have the money to put a different spin on their foolish behavior.<br /><br />Please, someone remind me that Jessica Lange was sexy in King Kong!!
