Listen. I do not like to criticize my own country's movies for we are in the birthing pains of a stable film industry, but what the hell,this movie is horrific...<br /><br />Starting synopsis fresh from the newspaper, no spoiler intended during the movie. You can read safely.<br /><br />The story itself starts as sexist, misogynous and anti-abortion biased. A girl had committed adultery with a married man when she went to the university, and had a baby which had to be aborted. Now she is happily married, and expecting a baby, and her aborted baby's spirit,accepted neither in heaven nor hell begins to...<br /><br />STOP.<br /><br />First, the "married man" isn't troubled, the GIRL is. So, it is her sin that she must bear. Second, aborted babies linger between in heaven and hell and trouble people, indicating gross mistakes in theology. Third, it is a mishmash of every horror movie, with the stereotypical stupidity form Ring, Shining, Grudge added with a small girl with long hair. THe idea itself is stillborn.
