Like 'Pigs in a Polka' and 'The Band Concert', this cartoon short centres on a piece of music with an inventive animated theme - this time, the 'orchestra' are workmen building the 'Umpire' State building, whether the little elevator dog or the scrawny cats knocking pegs into the ground.<br /><br />Beautiful colour and music enhance this short, which was Oscar nominated but just pipped to the post. The foreman, with baton and whistle, monitors and directs the action, including an inventive bricklayer and a lift which can dodge obstructions.<br /><br />Wildly funny and well constructed, 'Rhapsody in Rivets' is a real find, and is a Merrie Melodie well worth tracking down.
