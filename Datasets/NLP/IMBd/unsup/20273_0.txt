Slapstick takes a back seat to wit and charm - especially wit. This is the Harold Lloyd film that contains the often-quoted scene where Harold imagines he is a latter day Shakespeare. One episode is so good it was copied decades later in THE GRADUATE. I won't say what it is immediately recognizable.<br /><br />The only disappointment is that one of the original day-dream sequences was cut following adverse comments at the preview. Apparently the audience wasn't into wit, and got bored waiting for more slapstick. (Nothing changes.)
