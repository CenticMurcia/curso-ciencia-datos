I have seen many movies. More than a lot of people i like to think. And with this vast knowledge of cinema, I try to appreciate every movie i see, and even if it is "bad", and try to find some redeemable quality in it. Upon saying this, I believe, and this is quite a statement if you knew me, that the motion picture "Spaceship" is the worst film ever made in the history of time. There is not a word invented yet that describes how absolutely horrible this is. There are no redeemable qualities in it. This movie was not enjoyable one bit. I got sick a little bit during it. It is an embarrassment to film, to society, to humans as a race. However, it is imperitive that everyone watches this movie, so as to remind them that this is the bottom of the barrel, that this is as low as it gets. Like the holocaust, we must be reminded on how bad film can be and to NEVER let this kind of thing happen again. Make copies of this movie and send it to everyone you know. Lest we forget.
