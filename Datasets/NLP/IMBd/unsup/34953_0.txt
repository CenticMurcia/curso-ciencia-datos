This cheap POS is unbelievably bad.<br /><br />The jokes aren't funny, often it's just grossness as a cheap humor substitute, the rest of time they're just flat, and even if they were they are so obviously coming that all of the humor has dissipated by the time that they arrive.<br /><br />The characters are cardboard and even if they weren't the actors all look like they are playing drunkenly drawn caricatures. Furthermore the actors are so obviously playing to a camera and getting cues that even if the first 2 problems with the character depiction weren't there you'd still have the realism of the typical elementary school Christmass play.<br /><br />This movie looks cheap, not just low budget but tacky colors and deserted scenes along with ham handed camera work make it look even cheaper than it likely was.<br /><br />God this sucks!
