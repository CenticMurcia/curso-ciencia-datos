This movie was fabulous, I don't care what anyone says. It was compelling in a way I haven't seen a motion picture BE in a very, very long time. It didn't appeal to the "awkward" sense of "brilliant" that compel some to give high remarks or head to the theater, but I'm telling anyone who cares to read it - it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />In it's opening weekend (10/24/03) it didn't break the top 10. Scary Movie 3 was number one, so this is an explanation of why this movie, however excellent, didn't make the big bucks. People in the USA want to see stupid, banal movies instead of intensively profound movies that grab you on multiple levels. It was fabulous. Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen were FABULOUS. It was just compelling and highly emotional. Go see it.
