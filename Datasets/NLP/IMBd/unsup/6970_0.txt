I saw this for the first time when I was six or seven, and the memory of it really stuck with me, since we didn't have too many TV programs in Romania, back then.<br /><br />I actually remember Hugh Grant's character being evil (think it was his only evil character) and how he (spoiler) collaborated with the Nazis... And I remember the girls, I especially liked Delphine (whenever I - rarely - see Mia Sara in something, I think about this role). Weirdley, Courtney Cox's face didn't ring a bell years later, when I got to see "Friends".<br /><br />I saw it six or seven times I think, there were years when mini-series were 'en vogue', but thinking of it now, I imagine it was pretty melodramatic. I'd love to see it again, though, and I hope I'd be pleasantly surprised.
