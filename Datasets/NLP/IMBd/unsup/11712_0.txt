This is the best of the screwball comedies with Dunne and Grant equally matched. It has puzzled me though that the more I read the subtitles in the DVD and hear the dialog I am convinced the two characters were each having extramarital affairs. It is never made explicit and each one denies they were having affairs but not convincingly. It was clearly the director's intent to make their fidelity ambiguous. Freudian slips and double entendre are used instead.<br /><br />Was this done by the director because of the Hays Code and how did the public react to all the innuendo about infidelity in the film at the time of release?
