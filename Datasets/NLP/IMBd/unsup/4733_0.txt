A very funny story of a reporter for a fashion magazine who is about to write a column about all the wrongs a woman can do in an early relasionship.The reporter has to selct a man who she shall date and make all the things a man hate women to do, like calling his mother, destroying guys night and so on. She is supposed to have him leave her in 10 days. The man she chooses is a PR-man that has agreed to a bet to have a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. ItÂ´s easy to find yourself in the story, amongst all the errors and all the forgiving that takes part between them. I recommend the movie to both women and men but not at the same time.
