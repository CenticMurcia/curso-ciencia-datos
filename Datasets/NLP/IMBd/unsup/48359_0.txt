There is nothing more painful than an unfunny comedy, and Skid Marks is a perfect example. Unlike a terrible horror or drama, where at least some enjoyment can be gotten out of unintentional humor, a god-awful comedy is just ....humorless. The acting here, aside from Dianna Agron, and maybe Tyler Poelle, is uniformly awful. If your main reason for watching it (as was mine) is to see San Diego locations, forget it, because in the 45 minutes I lasted before walking out, I saw none (and I never walk out of movies). I viewed a lot of bad movies during my time as a video store clerk, but this one may just be the worst (and at least those I hadn't paid for).
