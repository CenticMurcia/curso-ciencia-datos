This movie has made firefighters look like fools. This movie is insanely ridiculous and a complete waste of time and money. I am a firefighter and I don't want to be thought of as part of a group that supports this insanity. Its like Air Bud with Bad acting and a Fake dog!! Crap Crap Crap Todd Holland doesn't have a tract record of making great movies, this is without a doubt one of if not the worst movies he has done. he has made firefighters like idiots, I can tell you FF are not. I wouldn't even let my own kids see this in fear of them going stupid or thinking that this is how FF truly are. Nobody in my firehouse supports this movie. The Lassie TV Series was good in the 50's and 60's, its almost like Lassie reborn but... totally bad.
