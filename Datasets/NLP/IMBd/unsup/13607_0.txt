COMPANEROS (4 outta 5 stars) Terrific spaghetti western/buddy movie co-starring Franco Nero and Tomas Milian at their best! Franco Nero plays a Swedish opportunist looking to cash in on a fermenting Mexican revolution. Tomas Milian plays a young hotheaded rebel who suddenly finds himself becoming one of the leaders of the resistance. Starting out on opposite sides of the conflict and butting heads at every turn, they soon develop a mutual respect and team up to save the day... or die trying. It's the same old plot, yeah (really, what is the difference between this film's story and, say, Duck You Sucker or A Bullet For The General?)... but the story is well-constructed, the direction assured and the performances are fantastic. Milian is in especially fine form... apparently he felt a bit threatened by his co-star's screen presence and sought to steal scenes from him at every opportunity. Nero, trying to hide his youthful good looks with some prosthetic wrinkles, may be stuck playing the straight man but he still gets his share of screen "moments". Another great score by Ennio Morricone... the reprise of the title track at key moments always fills me with delight. Director Sergio Corbucci's work may not match the visual poetry of Sergio Leone but he created a fine body of work as well, and this is one of his best!
