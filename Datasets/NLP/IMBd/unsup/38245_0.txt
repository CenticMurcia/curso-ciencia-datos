This is exactly a film for the people who think that film history starts with Pulp Fiction. It's a cliche-ridden crime story with supposedly cool dialogues and sudden lapses into sentimentality. If one can watch Christopher Walker doing his psycho thing for umpteenth time and can buy Steve Buscemi as ruthless hitman, then one might enjoy it.
