I hope that Marijka makes a better choice as per representation!!Beware of wolves in sheep's clothing Marijka!!!She was talking about being represented by some part-time operation in Ireland??There are a lot of very reputable and "connected" agencies in Ireland and the u.k that would love to represent this young lady i am sure.However my advice to her is to forget Ireland and actually go to the states where she is being looked at anyhow.Keep your agents to a minimum and go for the best in the business and not some mickey mouse operations that are run part time.You should try Lisa Richards in Dublin who represents Colin Farrell and also Lisa Anne porter.They are two of the best as is Karl Hayden by all accounts.
