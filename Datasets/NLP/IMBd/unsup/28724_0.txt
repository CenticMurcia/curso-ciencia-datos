I don't think I've ever used the phrase, "a movie everyone can enjoy" to describe a movie, but I'll do it here. OK, done. I'll give props where it's due, for a PG movie for kids, this was surprisingly engaging, non-clich√©, and very, very well written.<br /><br />There aren't a lot of fantasy movies I like, and that has to do with the way they're presented to you. They present the world to you in an already existing state, bombarding you with everything without gradually introducing you to its various elements. They present these life or death scenarios without truly exploring why we're supposed to care about the world's inhabitants in the first place. I like this movie because we're learning about the world at the same rate as the four kids here (assuming you haven't read the books, which I haven't). In fact, it was the great acting done by the kids that kept me interested enough in the "pre-fantasy" portions of the movie before we finally entered the fantastical realm, after which I cared enough about the characters to be invested in their ultimate outcomes.<br /><br />**The character Lucy single-handedly kept me interested with her GREAT acting in the beginning where she was prominently featured. She was better than a good 70-83% of grown actresses that I've seen, and probably 98% of child actresses not named Dakota Fanning and a select other few. I loved her response when asked by the faun about the human beings' hand-shaking ritual. "Yeah, I don't know, why DO we do that??"<br /><br />**I loved the interaction between the kids. I loved the tension there. In most PG movies the good guys are usually black and white, you don't have ugly things like traitors, jealousy, and greed.<br /><br />**A mark of a well-written movie is how many times you DON'T have to say to a character on screen, "why are you doing that?" or "why AREN'T you doing this?" Prime example, in the beginning after Lucy returned from Narnia as she re-entered the wardrobe, the character specifically knew that she had been gone for apparently hours, so as she re-enters, the first thing she does is to shout out to everyone who inevitably will be worried about her, that she's OK. After they question her, she then realistically asks, "wait, what? You mean to tell me that after our hide and seek game, from your perspective I must've disappeared for hours, and you didn't wonder where I was???" That's perfect. That's exactly how a real person would behave, and the actress pulled off the well-written lines just as perfectly, as she questioned her siblings with a confused look. I'm pointing this out because I can specifically think of other movies with analogous situations where the lines the character would've said would've been ALL wrong, and the intonation with which the actor delivers the line would've been so unrealistically understated.<br /><br />I only have a couple complaints:<br /><br />**When the lion is lying dead on the concrete slab, and Lucy and Susan go up to him, I don't understand why Lucy was so easily talked out of using the injury healing potion she was given by...Santa Claus earlier. She first begins to use it, but then is told by Susan that it's too late, implying that since he's already dead, the potion would do no good since it's meant to heal injuries only. But how did she know the exact boundaries or properties of this magic elixir? It's MAGIC. How do you know that it won't revive him? No one specifically ever defined its limitations. Besides, what's the worst that could happen? Just pour the liquid on his wound, worst-case scenario is you get red dye on his fur (I didn't know until later you're supposed to consume the potion, not apply it directly to the wound).<br /><br />**I didn't like the sword fighting scene between Peter and the witch. It just looked weak, like they were struggling to swing the sword(s). Peter, I can understand, since he's a kid, but the witch should have been a lot smoother using the dual swords.<br /><br />**This one is minor, but, the grown versions of the kids at the end just looked very goofy.<br /><br />Those are hardly plot holes or badly written scenes however. If my only major gripe about a 2 hour+ movie is the non-use of a Phoenix Down on a fallen Red XIII, then it's a pretty good movie. Sure the overall arc of the story may have been predictable, but there were still plenty of dramatic moments along the way and you enjoyed the ride. The plot didn't feel contrived, it was believable for what it was, and the characters are extremely likable, to the point where I was hoping that even the CGI animals don't get hurt or killed. This movie has a lot heart and certain charm to it that leaves you happy for seeing it.<br /><br />***Random personal trivia: I finally saw this three years after the movie had come out, but it wasn't random. I've always had it in the back of my head that I would eventually get around to seeing this, and it was all because of an enduring three second image in my head that I remembered when they advertised this movie on TV. It was the scene at the end showing a front view of the lion and the four kids as they walk towards the camera, towards the coronation area. As corny as it sounds, there was just something noble and inspirational about that scene.
