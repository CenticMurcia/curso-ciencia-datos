I saw KINKY KILLERS on Showtime the other night; and, I thought the title was totally lame, especially given the content. I cannot believe this was rated TV-MA; it should have been R.<br /><br />The film; and, its corn-ball 70s throw-back plot, just doesn't live up to its potential. The acting is wooden, the plot is twisted, non-sensical; and, drawn out to the point of boredom. Half the cast could have been played by the same person, they look that much alike. There is so much idiocy going on that you cannot tell who is whom; and, what they are doing.<br /><br />And, what no one can look up "Polycarp" on the Internet... I mean how lame is it that the word is such a mystery? <br /><br />Everything about this movie is one clich√© after another -- the overworked cop, the inattentive spouse, the "renegade cop," the manipulative shrink... oh, what a waste of time.
