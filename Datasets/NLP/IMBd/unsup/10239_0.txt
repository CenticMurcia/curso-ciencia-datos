Hilarious comedy of disaffected youth in Korea. Stylish and action packed (and a close second to Glengarry Glen Ross in the most swearing stakes). Bored again after their first attack on the gas station our 4 heroes return and start running the place with the staff held hostage - the situation begins to go out of control after run ins with the local gangsters, the "delivery boys union" and the cops. If this film comes within 100 miles of you don't miss it!
