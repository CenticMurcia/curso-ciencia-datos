This could have been very interesting but the film maker wanted to talk about "the characters" in the school and the school director (who comes off as a 40 y.o. peter pan with ADD and a foul temper) rather than the obviously hard working and gifted musicians that make up the "star group" of the school. That is a pity because they could have had for once a documentary about kids finding their way rather than losing themselves but the filmmaker went rather with the caricatural: -the genius overachiever (the good) -there's the tortured teenager (the bad) -the 9 year old twins who would not know what a beat (or singing in tune) is if it came up and hit them in the head (the comic relief) -the school director who spends his time screaming and berating these kids like it's boot camp time in full metal jacket (bare in mind these kids are between the ages of 9 and 17)- (the ugly) - Even after their triumph at the Zappa fest you don't see him once high five a kid or give him or her a compliment. Mind you that might be on purpose: You get the feeling that the filmmaker had a rather set agenda and wanted the characters to be seen in a manichaean fashion. There is a lot of editing. Overall not worth the watch unless you want to spend your time reading between the lines.
