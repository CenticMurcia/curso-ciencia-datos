I was beside myself with glee when I first heard of this movie. The book it is based on has been a book I have read and reread as well as given to children and adults alike over the years. So I was HORRIBLY disappointed at the changes made in this adaptation. Key elements left out, characterizations gutted, the mythos it was based on trivialized.<br /><br />After such great adaptations as LotR, Narnia and the Potter books to see this classic ruined was a sad sight.<br /><br />The books concepts depend on British folktales and legends (Arthurian based) and the movie seems to have tossed that aside in an attempt to woo American audiences. The family is changed, leaving out the close knit structure that is the basis of the story.<br /><br />Don't see this movie. Don't let your kids see this movie. Do yourselves a favor and read the book.<br /><br />Someday someone will make this movie with an eye to the source material.
