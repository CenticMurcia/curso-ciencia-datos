Finally, a movie that has succeeded in properly portraying the small-town working class family. For such a short film, all the major characters are amazingly complex, as they captivate the audience with powerful transitions wrought by financial and social crises. Director Doug Sadler has extracted some of the best acting out of some of Hollywood's most underutilized talent: Cherry Jones playing Julia Tyler, the strong, persevere-at-all-costs mother; Robert Knott playing Will Tyler, the cash-strapped father who loves his family, but who falls apart and seeks escape when his plans for providing for his family fail; Sarah Paulson playing Merrill, a young woman with psychological problems rooted in her childhood; and new-to-Hollywood child actress Tara Devon Gallagher playing 11-year-old Emma Tyler, whose sudden need for a medical procedure becomes the source of the crises and redemption, and through whose both simple and profound perspective the beautiful story is narrated.
