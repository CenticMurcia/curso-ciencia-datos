Simply put, this show can be summarized in these short examples: <br /><br />DAD, YOU DIDN'T GET JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE TO PERFORM AT MY PARTY? WAHHHH!!!! YOU ONLY RENTED A 45 ROOM MANSION FOR MY PARTY? I WISH I WAS NEVER BORN!! WAHHH!!! A LEXUS SUV????? I WANTED A LEXUS CONVERTIBLE SPORTS CAR!! WHY DO YOU HATE ME MOM AND DAD!!! WAHHHH! WHY WON'T YOU GET ME A DRESS LACED WITH 1/10 KARAT GOLD THREADING AND OUTLINED IN DIAMONDS AND EMERALDS???? MY PARTY WILL BE RUINED! WAHHH!!<br /><br />"My Super Sweet 16" is basically 30 minutes of nothing but that. No matter how much money is spent on their 16th Birthday Party, the person turning 16 will complain.<br /><br />What is so special about turning 16 anyway? I remember my 16th birthday. I only had a get together with my close friends at my house. That was it. And the presents I got? Not much. Some money from relatives, a video game or two, and some other minor things. I didn't get a car, I had to pay for mine straight up with money I earned. So basically, if I got 1% of the stuff these kids get in "My Super Sweet 16" I would be very grateful.<br /><br />This show could have been something. MTV could have had this show revolve around 15 year olds from unpriveledged families and/or areas of the country who otherwise would not have had enough resources/money to throw a decent 16th birthday party. But instead, MTV decides to have the show revolve around extremely privileged and rich kids; whose parents probably make 6 figure incomes; and live in upscale, high end neighborhoods; in houses which the real estate value is probably over 1 million dollars. It's a real shame, because these kids are very ungrateful, even though their family has more money than just about most other families in the entire world.<br /><br />These kids will likely never understand what its like to be unpriveledged and have to earn or work for something. Instead, they will just cry to mommy and daddy whenever they want something and they will get it. And once they turn 18 and leave for college(which their parents will likely pay for all), they will just continue to live off of some trust fund for the rest of their lives without having to earn anything.<br /><br />The most telling thing about my review is that I am a conservative republican who gets tired of people complaining about the rich people in our country and think that the wealth should be spread around. I feel that rich people are rich because they work hard. With all that being said, I am still disgusted by the people and money spending in this show.<br /><br />This is a bad show. Only watch if you want to watch spoiled 15 year olds cry, kick, whine, moan, and make total fools of themselves, so you can feel good about yourself not being on the low level these kids are.<br /><br />MTV, Drugs, and Alcohol - The 3 brain rotting resources in the world
