I honestly believe that any positive review of this film "Hide and Creep" must come from friends and family of the crew on this nostril flaring stinker. Retail shops such as Hollywood Video and Blockbuster must be forced into taking movies like Hide and Creep with the promise of cheap fees or royalties. The people behind Hide and Creep may think they're paying homage to greats like Night of the Living Dead and Evil Dead, but all they are really doing is creating a waste of time for any human being dumb enough to fall for the fake reviews on the DVD cover art. I hope, no, I pray that these southern goof balls never touch a camera again and stick with what they're good at...watching movies, not making them.
