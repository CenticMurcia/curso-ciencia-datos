Some genius in the casting department wants us, the viewers, to believe that Perky Meg Ryan is a surgeon, and not just a surgeon, but one who's never had a patient die on her. I suppose she's never seen ER, either. Anyway, Whispering Nicholas Cage, the guardian angel who's supposed to be taking the dying man's soul into the after-world is mesmerized by Perky Meg Ryan who, one has to admit, isn't feeling so perky. In fact, he watches her as she sits and has a good cry, which is all well and good, but shouldn't someone be doing something about that soul who's just wandering around the hospital?<br /><br />So Whispering Nicholas Cage, who frankly doesn't exactly scream--or whisper--angel, goes and talks to his Angel Buddy(tm) and they have a deep discussion on whether or not people see them, just as they hang around a convenience store that's being held up. Angel Buddy(tm) declares that no matter how despondent Perky Meg Ryan has become, she doesn't need to see him. <br /><br />But Whispering Nicholas Cage goes back to the hospital anyway to console poor Perky Meg Ryan. She sees him looking in on another patient, and they talk. His name is Seth, and he starts to meet up with her at random times. That and he watches her when she can't see him, too, which is just a shade too close to angelic stalking for comfort. So it turns out that the angels live in the library and listen to the sunrise. Great. Perfect sense. And the patient that Perky Meg Ryan has just saved is actually a fallen angel. <br /><br />Whispering Nicholas Cage takes this fallen angel out to lunch to pump him for information and learns the meaning of Free Will(tm) which God has given to all his creations, angels included. Perky Meg Ryan also learns that Whispering Nicholas Cage is an angel, mainly by stabbing him, but is totally turned off by this fact. She tells Whispering Nicholas Cage to buzz off, she's going to go marry her boyfriend in Lake Tahoe.<br /><br />SPOILER!!!<br /><br />This makes Whispering Nicholas Cage not so perky and he leaps off a tall building in a single bound. The only time, in fact, when he doesn't whisper is when he's ecstatic that he's bleeding. So he runs to the hospital where they tell him that Perky Meg Ryan has run to Lake Tahoe to get married. (Didn't she tell him that earlier?)<br /><br />Let's recap, he's been shot down by Perky Meg Ryan, fallen off of a building, ridiculed by construction workers, and then mugged of everything including his shoes by random guys. And he's still glad he's human. He wanders around barefoot in the rain for a while until a guy takes him to Tahoe. He finds Perky Meg Ryan once again not so perky because she's just dumped her boyfriend, and they have a night of wild passionate sex.<br /><br />The next morning, Whispering Nicholas Cage scalds himself in the shower and Perky Meg Ryan gets hit by a truck. Frankly, I'd say being a human has pretty much sucked for Whispering Nicholas Cage. He spends the rest of the movie sulking, and yet, just in time to deliver the moral of the movie, Angel Buddy(tm) reappears and asks him if it was all worth it. <br /><br />Of course he says yes, but I don't buy it. Sorry, but one night of wild passionate sex does not a lifetime make. Perky Meg Ryan should stick to fluffy romances that at least don't pretend to have a moral. And I don't know what Whispering Nicholas Cage should do, except perhaps get that nasty case of laryngitis taken care of.
