Review for Falling Angels<br /><br />The definition of acting, the way I've learned it is creating the illusion of reality. Now a substitute for that in the dictionary might be see; Falling Angels. I know that I'm not alone and not doing so bad, when I see other people trying to figure out life. The three girls in this story are pretty much left to figure everything out for themselves. Their role models are an absent alcoholic mother and a twisted alcoholic army dad, who every time he sees them, they stick their hands out, for a cleanliness inspection. This is why I watch independent film. This is why I joined Film Movement and thank you, director Scott Smith. A slice of life; getting into the personal drama of other peoples lives. These people react to situations as real people do, without saying, "I'll be back!" and then killing every one in the building with a machine gun.
