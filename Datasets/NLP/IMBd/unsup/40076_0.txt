The sequence where the train was blown up was filmed on The Bluebell Railway in Sussex mostly because the filmmaker was given the track without disturbance from visitors. They had two attempts at blowing up the train on successive nights and managed to break one of our home windows in the second attempt which happened at 1am with no warnings! One of the worst film crews EVER who didn't even clean up properly. The main reason being that there were foot and mouth restriction (which the filmmakers managed to ignore). One consequence was they had to park the caravans a quarter mile away and then walk the actors to the set and also use a "simple" lighting rig to simulate a full moon which reflected light off the clouds and manged to cause a complaint from aeroplanes landing at Gatwick Airport 10 miles away! Only the local farmer was happy as he got a new road laid for free! Truly the worst most disruptive film EVER (and we have film crews like other villages have buses).
