I'm a gigantic TPB fan. I've seen every episode at least 10 times, and I love them all to death. In my opinion, though, this movie was lacking. What I saw was a 2-hour long repeated joke. It poked fun at the same things the show pokes fun at, but it just seemed repetitive. "Ha ha... Lahey's drunk." , "Ha ha... Randy's fat." , "Ha ha... the sh*tmobile is sh*tty" , or "Ha ha... Ricky's stupid but surprisingly cunning at dealing with cops and courtrooms." These are things I've laughed at a million times before in the TV show, but the movie was just overkill. It seemed almost as if Mike Clattenburg and Robb Wells just picked their favourite jokes from the entirety of the TV series and turned it into a movie script. Seriously. I could've sworn they were directly copied and pasted.<br /><br />Even though the TV show manages to make us laugh at the same things over and over, it still has variety to it, and each season kicks ass (even season 6, which a lot of people dislike). I think the fact that this movie wasn't part of the actual storyline made it what it was. Since it wasn't part of the actual storyline, I think the creators wanted to show the rest of the world exactly what Trailer Park Boys is all about. To do that, they just took the best of the show's material and added a lot more drama. And they pretty much took out J to the R-O-C (he had what, 3 lines?), which I think sucked.<br /><br />So yeah, I really wanted to love this movie and walk out of that theatre with the biggest grin on my face, but nope. They didn't give us anything new or interesting, just the same old stuff we've grown used to (and if ANYBODY thinks TPB is the same thing season after season, you're just dumb). It works for showing newbies, but it's not for the veterans.<br /><br />Hell, I even blazed one before I went into the theatre.
