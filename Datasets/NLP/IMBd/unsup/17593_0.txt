This movie is required viewing for all parents trying to relive their high school glory days through their kids. Only one adult looks good in this movie and it ain't Walter M. This movie is a classic example of how adults should not behave during their kids' sporting events.<br /><br />This movie is probably rated higher than I normally would because it was one of my favorites growing up. I actually thought that music from "carmen" was original "the BNB's" song. Now watching it again after twenty-some years I see my tastes in movies has changed but it was still surprisingly good. It definitely made up my mind - I have absolutely no desire to see Billy Bob's version. The plot - stereotypical come-from-behind-feel-good-for-your-effort sports movie that I will admit this is one of the pioneers for that genre. The acting lukewarm - the dialog - forced, but it is still worth it to demonstrate what jerks we can all be trying to be supportive.
