Two scientists (Eli Wallach and Robert Culp) head to an Antarctic science lab to relieve another doctor who has been sending back crackpot messages. They find the doc dead, having locked himself in a room and left the window open so that he froze to death. Naturally, this method of suicide perplexes both men, but still have a job to do in testing chimps for outer space travel. They go about their business, but things start to slowly go bump in the night. Are they not alone? Is the station haunted? <br /><br />This is a superior TV movie from back in the day. The cast is mainly the two leads and both Wallach and Culp are fantastic in their roles. The setting is really great (think Carpenter's THE THING, which it looks very similar to) and the tension really builds perfectly. Best of all, the film's mystery really pays off and you will be rethinking everything you've seen 75 minutes prior. To say anything more about it would give it away.
