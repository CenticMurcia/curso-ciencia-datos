This movie arises emotions from several issues that we hear about everyday- from a justification for the war on terror(All the terrorist leaders are in favor of a ruling system similar to the one carried on by the talliban) to women's right's. Women in the west have made remarkable progress on their plight to social equality and today they take on every sort of important role in our society. Well this is were "Osama" hits us with the brute culture shock that globalization can bring by showing how in some areas of the world women not only have made little progress in gaining social equality but the very society in which they live, has deepen the disparity they fight against.<br /><br />It's a story so sad that will bring up a feeling of anger and disgust from any devout Tibetan Buddhist.
