Free Rainer is a German movie from 2008 starring well-known German actors Moritz Bleibtreu and Milan Peschel. Rainer (Moritz Bleibtreu) is a TV-producer whose only goal is to have the best quotes he can get, to have the most beautiful girls and as much cocaine as possible. After a hospital stay he realises, that he has stopped at nothing for his quotes. He decides to change his life; the guerrilla-campaign against the entertainment industry beginsÂ…<br /><br />This is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. The story is very innovative and critical of society on a high level. 'Free Rainer' is a wonderful anti-globalisation movie, gripping and very entertaining. The actors did a great job; Hans Weingartner demonstrates again after 'Die Fetten Jahre Sind Vorbei', that he is one of the best German-speaking directors of today's industry. Last but not least also the soundtrack is wonderful, beautiful pop-songs math perfectly to the story.<br /><br />'Free Rainer' is a must-see movie for all interested, critical of society (German-speaking) people!<br /><br />10 out of 10 ranking-points for this movie!
