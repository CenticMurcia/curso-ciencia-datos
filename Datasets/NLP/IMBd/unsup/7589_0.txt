An 11 year-old girl befriends an injured man unaware that he is a paedophile killer.Her mother winds up having an affair with him which makes the girl jealous so she sets out to seduce him as well."L'Immoralita" by Massimo Pirri reminded me a little bit an infamous "Maladolescenza",but it was not as graphic.Still the sex scene between the girl and the killer may certainly upset some viewers,albeit the girl is clearly replaced by an older body-double.The story of "L'Immoralita" is morally dubious,however the acting is quite good and there is enough sleaze to satisfy any self-respecting smut peddler.I'd recommend this film for fans of Italian exploitation.7 out of 10.
