The guy committed the murder so he could have a good documentary to be made out of, but this film has so many plot holes like a swiss cheese: How did the blood get on Jim Seurd's clothes if he didn't commit the murder. What ever happened to Steven "Johnny" Avkast? His body was never found. How did Jim Seurd die in prison?<br /><br />It's obvious that this psychopath is the one who sent them the message on the IRC and Jim Seurd was probably a real psychic.<br /><br />It was all a great idea for a mysterious documentary, but the film makers failed to explain several reasons. If the Jersey Devil did exist and this was not a murder piece for some psychopath trying to gain the spotlight, it would make sense if Jim got blood on his clothes, if Steven did disappear, and Jim died in prison mysteriously. They could have explained it all.<br /><br />Rather than a switch from doc to regular film (why the heck is the picture still the same - in bad quality?) they could have the psychopath just leave his documentary camera running as he killed the woman. But we know this "Last Broadcast" documentary is a finished piece so he would have cut that part out.<br /><br />I have a better ending - how about that woman tries to make out the picture and she sees red eyes and a row of sharp teeth? Yeah, let's leave the Jersey devil thing intact because their "clever" idea failed - it just doesn't fix with the rest of the film.<br /><br />Or another way could be a doc within a doc within a film (like Scream 3) where the special effects could be cut out and the psycho would be filming a "Blair Witch Project" type of documentary and the film part would be the police finding the pre-produced doc in the possession of a man they just arrested. And at the end they could have shown the same man in the holding cell.<br /><br />All this stuff could have been a better way instead of what these film makers just made. My preference would be that the Jersey Devil did exist in this film. The documentary had me glued on the screen because I was anxious to see what would happen (like a real documentary) and I got deeply disappointed anyway.<br /><br />3 out of 10
