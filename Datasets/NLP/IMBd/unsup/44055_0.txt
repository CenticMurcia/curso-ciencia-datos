Attention was somewhat lacking after twenty five minutes of this film. While the beginning was interesting, the film itself was simply not as entertaining as the transport car get smashed to bejesus and back.<br /><br />The whole premise of this film is during a party, the convict that escaped after the transport vehicle was destroyed escapes and hides out on the rich slut estate. The boyfriend cheats on his girl, and in the end it's the male and female main character, the slut, and the cool horny guy who stay the night after a couple of party goers get killed. Aside the token stereotypical Scottish grounds keeper, the film was pretty much boring. Only two of the kills (including the death scene in the killer's origin which isn't as far fetched as it would seem if you read the news) were really believable. I'm sorry but a beer can to the skull would crush and wouldn't penetrate into the brain. While that guy wasn't dead, even the force used to drive it against the skull wouldn't do that much damage.<br /><br />In the end, the killer becomes inhuman and manages to stand atop a car going 45 while trying to continue his bloody rampage and just won't die. While the premise showed promise, the film was just way too out there and definitely not all that interesting. They made the killer too inhuman and pretty much made it so he could move from one place to another in a matter of seconds, while if I were to run the same distance, it would take ten minutes. A ludicrous film filled with bad acting and bad writing. Only thing it did for me was make me really horny, which really wasn't a help for my single life.
