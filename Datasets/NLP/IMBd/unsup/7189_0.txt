I put this film into the same category as "Lonesome Dove" and "The Singing Detective" (the BBC version), my two favorite TV films as an adult. "J.T." is television at its finest, never to be seen again. I was lucky enough to experience it when first broadcast in 1969 when I was seven. It struck me very deeply in the heart and stayed there. Now, as a 45-yaear-old teacher, I've found a tattered copy of the novelization in a used bookstore. I presented it to my 4th grade class and they LOVED it. They are currently writing about it. I think that "J.T.'s" longevity is a testament to its quality. The novelization is, by the way, still in print and can be found through Amazon, etc.<br /><br />This film has a great pedigree (Robert M. Young is a legendary television director, and Jane Wagner has been writing theater, etc., for a long time.). Kevin Hooks was perfect, and yes, went on to become a fine adult actor and director.
