I used to think that Cuneyt Arkin films are things that should be ashamed of. He is such a man that in every movie he flies up, saves the world, destroys an army or a kingdom on his own. Stupid isn't it? Bu what about Matrix? Transporter? Vertical Limit? Triple X? Mission Impossible the Movies? I do not think they are much too different. Watching a person defeating hundreds of people is great fun without thinking the logic in it. So I think Turkish producers have discovered this 20 years before Hollywood. Cuneyt Arkin's films have been paid great attention. This is the result of the producers' invention about people's likes.<br /><br />Special effects? Surely a very low budget gives you this. Did you know that the monster costumes were all done by Cuneyt Arkin himself? It is a horrifying experience for movie as an art, but do you know that lots of actors and actresses that have acted in Turkish movies have been living very difficultly? Lots of them have died in misery.<br /><br />As a brief, this may not be the worst movie but definitely the worst director I have ever seen. But if they had had the technology and the money that any ordinary Hollywood film, the thing may not have been that bad. If you want to laugh, watch it. If your stomach would feel bad when you see a bad movie, do not watch it. But this is not what the Turkish movie is.
