Awful dialog, a plot that makes no sense, speeded-up car chases, gratuitous explosions, paper-cutout characters (not substantial enough to be cardboard). A German-Indonesian co-production in which the actors speak whatever language suited them, and then all the voices were badly dubbed at the end.<br /><br />Nothing about this film appears credible; you may find it unintentionally hilarious, or you may just wonder why they (and you) bothered.
