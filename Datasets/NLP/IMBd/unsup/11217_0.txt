This film is not for everyone. It has the typical Bollywood treatment, complete with a multitude of bright colours, pretty dancing girls, long dance numbers,and catchy tunes. The sets and fighting scenes are poor. The direction is disjointed and the editing clumsy. Nonetheless the film has great charm. The tragic tale of Prince Asoka, the great emperor and disperser of Bhuddism, probably bears no greater resemblance to history than does Shakespeare's MacBeth or Anthony and Cleopatra. But it does have something profound to say and its format as a tragedy can be moving. The lead actors are competent and the script is deserving of better treatment. Don't expect too much and you may find yourself moved by its colour, pageantry, charm and message of the value of peace and fullfillment over war and ambition.
