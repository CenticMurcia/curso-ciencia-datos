"Mifunes Sidste Sang" is brilliant!It's very humorous and funny and there's a good balance between irony and sadness.The acting is excellent and the direction is even better.Usually I'm not a fan of comedies but this film totally cracked me up!Gotta love especially the performance by Jesper Asholt(Rud).My highest recommendation.
