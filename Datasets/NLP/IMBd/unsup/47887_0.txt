Just didn't survive the aging process. Poor acting, a messy story and all too sixties in film quality. I hadn't seen Caine as bad as in this one before, but then again I haven't seen that many flicks with him in them. I was surprised to find this film scores as high as it does, why is beyond me. The film's ending is highly unsatisfactory, like a part is missing. Maybe I need lobotomy to understand the greatness of this film. Not funny, not good. Go do something useful instead! (4/10) (I must also admit the remake/tribute 2003 flick Italian job was not much better. Completely different story, but as shallow as this one)
