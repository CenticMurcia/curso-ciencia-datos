I was a bit hesitant about renting out "Red Dwarf" the first time one of my friends recommended it too me but I got it out anyway because I always like finding a new fantastic show, and this was definitely all that and more. While in the early series having a tiny budget used on props and the sets it still managed to produce fantastic story lines and new characters every episode, it was when they got a bigger budget(Season 3 or 4 and over) that they really let their creative style loose going to different funny dimensions, meeting equally funny new character's and with jokes about what different dimensions existed they still had great character jokes, which really made the humour of this show something to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The character's in the show are a great example of how character interaction alone can make a show 100 times better, and in this we see such a wide range of character's, lead and co starring that make this show great on its own even without all the other dimensions (This was, as I said earlier most of what the first 2 or 3 seasons were like). First there is Dave Lister, who is a slob but is also a deep down very caring and compassionate guy and to the writers credit, they really make it so that just when you think Dave is just a useless slob they write an episode which reveals more about that character and how he is really a good guy. Then there is Rimmer, and prude sort of fellow who has always wanted to become an officer but, not being able to, due to being a complete incompetent worker and a general nuisance to be around has convinced himself that he is a great worker, but has not been promoted due to being so good at what he does (Head Vending Machine Maitenence man). Anyway, as the series progresses he is one of the best walls to bounce jokes with between him and Lister, and while they are always fighting deep down they both don't hate each other and Lister is actually quite understanding of the fact that Rimmer is a complete and utter Smeghead. After that there is Kryten, one of my favourite character's in a TV show in the 20th centuries, from him trying to be more human to his pathetic whining he is another great wall of jokes with all the character's. Last of the main character's from the early seasons (Kochanski replacing Rimmer for a small time in season 7) is the obnoxious but oddly lovable Cat, who is a descendant from a cat Lister smuggled aboard (Which is the reason Dave was put into stasis and how he became the only human alive) who has now become a human looking and sounding up himself cat mutant who has an odd addiction to fashion. All these character's make the show what it is and what it always will be.<br /><br />Overall the time has become a classic that will (Hopefully) live on forever bringing in new waves of followers. Red Dwarf Forver!!!.
