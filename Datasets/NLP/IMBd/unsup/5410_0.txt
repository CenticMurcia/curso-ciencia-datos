This film is a complete crap that hasn't a single thing in favor. OK, maybe just one: It's Andie Tecec! I'm talking about the woman, not the actress. She's hot but as an actress she's as lame as any other thing in this movie! <br /><br />It's a completely ridiculous movie: tremendous stupid plot, bad characters, bad actors, hilariously bad screenplay and totally unfunny "supposed to be funny" moments. <br /><br />Now that I have finished watching it I just wonder why I didn't have looked at this movie's IMDb rateÂ… I guess it would have saved me one hour and half of a bad cinematic experience! <br /><br />Well, it's a complete 0 out of 10, but I've to score it 1/10, right??!!
