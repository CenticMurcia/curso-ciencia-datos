While Shu Qi is, of course, exquisitely beautiful, her robotic acting quickly becomes boring and is not what makes So Close such a great action film. Thankfully, the film is primarily a female 'buddy' film, focussing on Shu Qi's kid sister co-bandit Vicki Zhao and Zhao's evolving relationship with policewoman Karen Mok. Zhao and Mok manage to infuse a standard HK action plot with emotion and complexity, and the film becomes "The Killer" meets "24 Hours." Great cinematography, great action, and loved the shots of Zhao biting her lip with tension and Mok mouthing words at Zhao. Could have done without two gratuitous flying scenes of Zhao near the end, though, which add a jarring CTHD note to the otherwise enjoyable action. But the final sword fight is magnificent. Zhao could become a great actress.
