This movie was a tax scheme. Investors were told they could write off more than 100% of what they invested in the movie. This is, of course, impossible. The investors had to reimburse the government. I think "Lucky" went to the federal pen. Not surprisingly this movie is terrible. It bored me out of my skull when I saw it as a kid. Anyone who claims it is a good movie is out of their mind. William Shatner is at his best in this movie, which is to say he is hilariously hammy. I also recall having a nightmare about the wailing (no pun intended) theme song: "Looking for a frieeeeeend. Looking for a frieeeeeeeeend." The good thing about the movie is that the people responsible actually got what they deserved--hard time.
