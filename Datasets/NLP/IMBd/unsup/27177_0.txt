Every other commenter has covered almost every aspect of this movie, so I'll focus on the part that cheesed me off the most. <br /><br />When the male lead finds out that the woman he was chasing and the woman that was helping him had been stringing him along for *MONTHS* to see if he was worthy.<br /><br />They humiliate him, get him arrested, label him as a pervert in his neighborhood and almost kill him with a flower pot among other injuries. When they are finally forced to revel their treachery and the one he has been pining for declares him worthy of her love, he says "Okie Dokie" and forgets about getting his penis crammed into a Chinese finger trap then pushed out front of an audience.<br /><br />Yeah, right. A real person would have given up on both of those women since they are obviously defective.
