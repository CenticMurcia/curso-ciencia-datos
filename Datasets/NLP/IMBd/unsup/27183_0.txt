By the end of the movie, Chad Donella is forced to choose between an ex-model with a innocent personality, and a Once overweight girl with low self esteem, and a personality that is just as sweet the model, only not as accommodating to rejection. Your sitting there, and YOU couldn't tell him which one to choose. So he decides the low self esteem is his True Love and the Model gave him the half heartbroken, "lets be friends so I can still be around you" bit.It just didn't seem to fit the light-heartedness that prevailed through most of the movie. Other than that, your in for some LOL material that will have you saying "That ain't Right" in between roars of laughter.
