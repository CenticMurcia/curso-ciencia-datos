I guess I am the dissenting vote here, but I didn't particularly like GASMAN. Some of it isn't the fault of those who made the film, but was the fault of the people who put this film on disk. That's because the accents were at times very hard for me to understand and there was no captioning on the DVD. To the average American, some British accents are tough to understand and my mild hearing loss made this a particularly frustrating film. However, what the film makers could have done better was providing a context for this short film. You gather that the man has two families but you are left asking so many questions that aren't explained in the film. In other words, it's a short film that has left out key portions of the narrative--and this just seemed sloppy. It's too bad, because the basic idea behind the short was interesting.<br /><br />By the way, this film is part of the CINEMA 16: European Shorts DVD. On this DVD are 16 shorts. Most aren't great, though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying--it's just a shame about the captioning.
