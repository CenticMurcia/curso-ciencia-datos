Dil Chahata Hai is a wonderfully crafted film with an exceptional work in cinematography by Ravi Chandran. I can't think of one moment in the film in which I was dissatisfied with the framing and the pixelation. Also, I must call special attention to the song "Tanhayee." It is wonderfully filmed. Kudos to Chandran's craft. Dil Chahata Hai also has an incredible storyline of interweaving 3 different storylines into one big picture of life in progression. This films gets you away from Bollywood because it is not focussing on some stupid love story. This film is not quite Hollywood because it has some principles of independent films going on within itself. Although, love is not the strongest thought expressed in the film, it is definitely the motivation of the story's progression, or else the film would have ended at the intermission. Also, the story of Sid is kept on the sidelines, while in the true essence of the film, that is the story which is the most honest and strongest one. The film's sound design is incredible. It is probably the only film in Indian Cinema with SyncSound in it. Also, Ehsaan, Loy, and Shankar's music is always a strong underscoring factor that triggers a heightening of emotions at the exact appropriate times. The soundtrack is definitely worth buying thanks to this somewhat renaissance music in Indian Cinema by the trio. Aamir Khan's work is exceptional. Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna have reinvented themselves in this film which is totally worth watching. Although, a little old to play their parts, I let out a suspension of disbelief because the film is just so much fun!
