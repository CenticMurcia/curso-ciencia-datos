Saw the film this morning at a Sunday Times preview and I'd like to think that more than a few of you will be eating your words when you see the finished product. It's beautifully put together, with lots of humour, the attractive Colin Firth and many superb performances. Celia Imrie creates a colourful character in Mrs Quickly, Imelda Staunton is fantastic as the cook (Mrs Blatherwick) and Angela Lansbury is expertly cast as Aunt Adelaide (despite the feathered dress making her look like a turkey!) As guessed at on another thread, Nanny McPhee does teach the children - that manners matter, you should be responsible for your actions, and that actions have consequences. It isn't dumbed down, there's certainly no 'dopey dialogue' - and there's also no annoying Americanisms as beset Charlie & the Chocolate Factory.<br /><br />At first glance, you could imagine Emma Thompson giving a very over the top performance, given the warts, over-sized nose and tooth. Instead she gives a careful and considered performance - everything in the right measure.<br /><br />Enjoy Nanny McPhee for what it is - a large dose of magical escapism with plenty of laughs for good measure. A few rude words and food fights to keep the kids (and parents) happy, oh and a dancing donkey, but overall a film that is lots of fun. Can't wait for the DVD.
