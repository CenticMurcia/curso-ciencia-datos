Yes, the lead here looks like Hercules and there are a lot of ladies prancing around in skimpy costumes, but that does not a good movie make. The story is a jumbled mess that really does not flow well, the actors are not the best of caliber, and of course it doesn't help that this Hercules movie does not have all that much action in it. In fact, most of the movie seemingly has Hercules sitting around on a chair and making it with a strange looking gal. Meanwhile, there is a war about to break out between two brothers I think, but can not be 100% positive. There is also a rather pointless scene where Hercules must fight some guy who always gets back up and laughs annoyingly. Herc has his companions and his wife to worry about as well, but for the most part you are going to want to drink those waters of forgetfulness that send the movie to the very long pointless subplot of Herc in the clutches of the very bizarre island girl and her many serving girls. All in all just not enough of a plot or action to get anyone's interest up.
