I wish the movie would make a decision as to whether to be a horror movie or a suspense thriller, instead, it can't make up its mind and ends up being neither.<br /><br />For the record, I guessed the "twist" of the ending 10 minutes into the movie... too obvious...<br /><br />It must be my misfortune, lately, none of the Japanese horror movies seems to excite me anymore. I want Ringu back! Now, that is THE way to make a horror movie.<br /><br />
