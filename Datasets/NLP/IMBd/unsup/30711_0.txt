The only thing I hate about this film is the idiotic cover which pretends to be a Rambo rip-off. The film itself shows the No Future life of a Vietnam-Vet in where he really gets pushed to the No Return stage so he has to rescue his family from their hopeless situation. If you watch this film based on the cover or the Troma-logo,don't bother, chances are that you feel rather drained after viewing.
