I lied on Bananas, THIS is my favorite Woodman movie. It's perhaps the most accessible, mainstream early Allen film. After Woody's wife splits on him (what took her so long!?), Woody turns to best friends Keaton and Roberts to help him back into the romantic saddle. Bogie also appears - flawlessly portrayed by Lacy - and attempts to assist Woody out of his doldrums with decidedly mixed results. What eventually happens, along with the Manhattan story line, suggests the Woodman's later real-life escapades. Of all of Allen's films this one for me has the most timeless moments, particularly involving his many dating mishaps. Woody's luckless character is part of a great comedic lineage that goes at least as far back as Bob Hope and has been seen as recently as George on Seinfeld. A comedy classic.
