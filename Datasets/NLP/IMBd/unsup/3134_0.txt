All I knew about Jack Cassidy was his sons who were in the Hardy boys. He died before I got to know him. I think this is my favorite Columbo episode with him as a magician with a secret, he was a Nazi in Germany during World War II. Cynthia Sikes plays his lovely daughter who is clueless about her father's identity and history but she is memorable and she is better known for her role in St. Elsewhere. Sadly, I hated reading about Jack Cassidy's tragic death. Wherever you are Jack, we miss you still after 30 years. Columbo always catches his man or woman even in this episode. As Columbo always says, there is no such thing as a perfect murder. Just when you think he's got away with his crimes, nothing could be further from the truth. If you love Columbo, you will love this episode and how he catches his man is just as much fun to watch and learn.
