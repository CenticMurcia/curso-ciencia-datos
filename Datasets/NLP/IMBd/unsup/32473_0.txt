the mouse.that's right,i said mouse.there's a mouse in the movie,and even though it has the briefest of cameos,it was the best actor in the(alleged)movie.for some reason,i watched this right to the bitter end. i don't think anyone involved in the movie knew there were cameras involved.you can't fake acting this bad.it's a real talent.nor can you fake making a movie this horrible.and this is the end result. it wasn't really a movie.more like a collection of scenes strung(loosely)together.i'm not sure how much this thing cost to make,but i feel confident in saying i have more than that underneath my cushions.brutal,but still nowhere near as bad as Dracula 3000.a very reluctant 1* for the mouse's performance.
