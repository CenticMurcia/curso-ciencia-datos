To call Tim and Eric's Awesome show good job genius or edgy, is to fall victim to their singularly humorous and successful joke, which is convincing people that their extremely shallow, lazy, transparent act has some merit.<br /><br />There's nothing innovative here. Tim & Eric are hardly breaking new ground in their show, they are simply taking satire and intentionally subtracting things like timing, characterization, storytelling, insight and humor(essentially all the things that make satire entertaining)in favor of randomness and gratuitous gross out shots.<br /><br />The show is based on the premise if that the mere act defying conventions while ridiculing them in and of itself is interesting or entertaining. And that is where the show fails because at the end of the day its even more vapid and than the conventions it is trying to satirize.
