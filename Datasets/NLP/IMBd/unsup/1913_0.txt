Tho this movie was uneven, the quirky humor was invigorating. I rated it 7, partly because there were some concepts I had not seen in movies previously.<br /><br />The young leads were personable and presented their characters quite admirably. Their car itself becomes a personality in the show.<br /><br />You will find several actors you haven't seen in years. (Some shine in the light of this movie; others, well... 'nuff said.)<br /><br />The Music of "King Sunny Ade & His African Beats" was refreshing. The Juju Music was at the same time full of energy and joy... & was gentle almost like meditation.<br /><br />If you are looking for a pleasant diversion, strongly unique in places, I highly recommend it.
