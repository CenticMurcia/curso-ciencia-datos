Cheech Marin is a great talent. In his film, "Born in East L.A.", he clearly shows a man that has a good understanding about the issues at the heart of this entertaining movie. For some years now he has been by himself as his partnership with Tommy Chong ended.<br /><br />Mr. Marin makes an important point in the film. Rudy, his main character, is a man born and raised in East L.A., as the title indicates, yet, he is deported to a country he probably has never been to. His roots are American, yet being in the wrong place, at the wrong time, trying to do a favor to his cousin, he is hauled to a detention center for illegal aliens and deported to Mexico.<br /><br />Of course, the arrest and his deportation serves as the basis of a clever comedy that is easy on the eyes and have us laughing throughout the many funny situations Mr. Marin has created for himself and his crew. Daniel Stern is good as Jimmy, the man that exploits Rudy. Paul Rodriguez has some good moments as the newly arrived guy that keeps thinking the messages he hears in Rudy's answering service come from the Jesus image behind it. The lovely Kamala Lopez is easy on one's eyes, and the great Lupe Ontiveros plays Rudy's mom.<br /><br />"Born in East L.A." is a funny movie with a message.
