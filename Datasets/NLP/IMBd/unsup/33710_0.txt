Quote "What's wrong with you? You seemed to have swallowed a large poisonous insect?" <br /><br />Quote 2 "I've been drugged, kidnapped and driven through the desert in the trunk of a "beeping" rental car and forced to watch you blow two men apart. The last part I am willing to forgive. But I will not have you call me baby!"<br /><br />Can anyone believe that this was made in 2003??? The script is just too stupid to believe Gary Oldman and Ving Rhames said yes without a gun to their heads.<br /><br />Direction issues.. Sister has overdosed and magically this women who only knew she was in trouble turns to the graveyard to help save her?<br /><br />Bill Sage looks more like a porn star than a police officer and the porn star in the early scene looked more like the town drunk than a porn star.<br /><br />Then hero Ving Rhames catches one of the men who raped his sister and beats him up then the police sirens are in the background suggesting they are coming. The bad guy says "diplomatic immunity" and instead of running away the hero shoots him dead. It is worth watching cause frankly it's impossible to believe they allowed it to be released. The writers are probably working for CSI series now!
