Do not watch this movie.<br /><br />I got this on DVD free in a special PS2 promotion and I am saddened that I have lost 2 hours of my life due to this film. A friend of mine didn't believe it could be as bad as I said it was and borrowed it off me. He still hasn't forgiven me.<br /><br />Not even worth considering if you find it in the bargain bin. In fact, if you see it on a shop shelf then RUN AWAY! As fast as you can.
