An incredible example of the state of animation! I would guess that within 5 years we will not be able to actually tell what is real or what is animation. I liked that in the beginning that they did not have the characters speaking so you could have that opportunity to just appreciate the animation.<br /><br />Fun story~ Aladar is a great new addition to Disney's favorite characters!
