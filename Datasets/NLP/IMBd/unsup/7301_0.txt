You want conventional? Forget it! This film is for those who love a delightfully skewed view on life, in this case the so-called life of one Renzo Parachi. After the death of his mother, into his life comes a whirlwind of a well-meaning shyster in the form of Alonzo Turner (aka Robbie Coltrane), at once turning his life upside-down while simultaneously bringing out the inner opera-loving Renzo. This film ranks as one of my favourite films because of its delightfully skewed world that at the same time holds true to itself. Renzo can never be considered an everyman but, if we're honest, we can maybe hear an echo from somewhere within.<br /><br />Well acted, well written, well shot and edited. If you're looking for formula comedy, you'd better off with some other film. Otherwise, sit back and enjoy the ride.
