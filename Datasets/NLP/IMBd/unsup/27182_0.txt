I think this movie is woefully underrated! It is like a low budget, raunchy inverted-HIGH FIDELITY without the music stuff.<br /><br />Speaking of which, let me emphasize -raunchy-. This is the type of movie AMERICAN PIE's advertising only presents itself to be!<br /><br />To say anymore of the plot would rob the unsuspecting audience of the cultivation of a sort of geek emotion called 'this JUST might be a good movie.' Sure, it could have said a lot more with a lot less, but if your expectations are low, this gem will be a real surprise.<br /><br />GIRL FEVER would play great to any audience of 15 - 20 year-old men, provided they are not *all* the sort concerned with the volume level of their televisions. Or that sort of girl, who knows these days?<br /><br />In summary: GIRL FEVER is not perfect, but this movie should have its own cult following. (Albeit a very small one.)
