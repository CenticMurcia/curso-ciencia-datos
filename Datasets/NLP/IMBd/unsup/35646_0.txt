One day my girlfriend suggested a film called `Killer Nerd' (Which, to my knowledge is only available from `Mooovies' in Bristol, Vermont). I thought nothing of it other than, `this'll probably be another Horror flick that I won't really pay attention to or remember.' It's not as if the name doesn't make it abundantly clear what the plot's going to be, right? Right you may be, but a regular horror film this is not. In fact really, a horror film this is not.<br /><br />I was right in my initial fear of watching this film. I thought it was going to be bad, I was right. I thought the acting was going to be poor, I was right (BOY was I right!?). Still, with a plot that would make Arnie blush and more stereotypical characters than can be seen outside an episode of Buffy, the film plodded on. Poorly. I could honestly say I have never in all my life seen such a poorly put together, utter joke of a film. By far the worst film I've ever seen.<br /><br />However, I know a lot more films that I didn't enjoy nearly as much. The sheer poor quality of the film makes it so bad that it bypasses the usual stage that a bad film has where you'll sit and cringe and either turn it off or just slug it out painstakingly till the end. Far from it, with Killer Nerd you can get almost as engrossed in it as if it were a decent film.<br /><br />The writers of this film are either lucky or genius's. If you see this film anywhere do not miss your opportunity to see it.<br /><br />Nerd. Nerd. Nerd.
