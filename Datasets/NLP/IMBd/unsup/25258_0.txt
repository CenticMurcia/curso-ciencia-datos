after watching a couple of episodes... i was totaly hooked! man this is one of these shows that no matter how much you watch, you just can't have enaugh. the characters are simple, but every single character has a certain something that makes them interesting, plus you don't just have one type of comedy in the characters, physical comedy and jokes are writen all over the place, from wannabe snobbish to down right hilarious. Overall i advise anybody to watch it.
