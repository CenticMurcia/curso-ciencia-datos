Hello,I just wanted to say that I loved the movie,the ending with the duet song was just great,I cried.I love movies like that.I have been trying to find the movie to buy ever since I seen it,please tell me how I can order it.Thank you so much,God Bless.Naomi was just great in the movie and the young lady that sang with her has a great voice,I am surprised that I haven't seen a album out of her.It was as if it could be real life.All the actors and actress were just great.I have also seen Naomi in Touched by an Angel she does so good in movies like this.I cant wait to see more movies like this,thats what we need on TV more family stuff.
