I had my doubts, but was surprised and pleased that Blue Smoke was much better than my expectations.<br /><br />Using flashbacks was a more effective way of presenting Reena's past and present in the movie. It helped create the picture of who she had become and why. I could understand many of the changes made to accommodate the transition from book to film. In some cases preferred the movie version (the book had a LOT of graphic violence).<br /><br />Alica Witt did a very believable strong, fierce Reena, showing how she had grown to deal with the tragedies that had made her feel, understandably, vulnerable and fragile. Scott Bakula ... ah ... he just gets better and more seasoned with every new role he takes on: compassionate and kind, but stern and demanding when needed.<br /><br />The relationships before she met Bo were as heartbreaking in the movie as in the book. Though I couldn't decide if the one she had with Hugh was even sadder than the original version. Was it worse that she was gun-shy and only on the brink of a new, deeper relationship as in the book, or taking the chance of accepting a marriage proposal as in the film? <br /><br />I honestly didn't think I'd like Matthew Settle as Bo, but he convinced me with his scene in the backyard when he *finally* got to meet his dream girl.<br /><br />The strong sense of family, and how their love and respect for each other also helped form Reena into such a determined, focused woman was carried through in both versions. <br /><br />Personally, I thought how the movie dealt with the villain(s) was a nice twist and fitting ending.<br /><br />Leaves me champing at the bit to see Carolina Moon.
