Like many people, I grew up "Loving" Annette Funicello. This wonderul movie has so many treats besides her biography. It depicts life in the 50's in Hollywood - Walt Disney's discovery of Annette, the making of the Mickey Mouse Club, a young Paul Anka, Frankie Avalon, and later Frankie Avalon & Shelly Fabares playing their adult selves. Most of all, the film has such "heart" and is so moving & inspiring as Annette discovers and deals with her MS disease. Hopefully soon the film will go to DVD and some or all of the profits will help with the fight of this disease. If you are lucky enough to catch it on TV - tape it!!
