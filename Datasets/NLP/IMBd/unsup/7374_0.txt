I saw this film at the Palm Beach International Film Festival; Cobb Cinema, Jupiter, Florida. Really enjoyed this film and thought the acting was very good. It was family fare which would appeal to male and female tween agers as well as others. It is the type of movie I'd like to take my grandchildren to see. It is adventuresome and thrilling without being fantasy. It had me laughing at some points, inhaling sharp breaths when on the edge of my seat, and nearly crying at other times.<br /><br />I'm hoping it comes to the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival so I can take my granddaughter to see it and encourage my friends to go. Otherwise we'll have to wait for it to be released in theaters. Thanks for a really good movie. Ginny
