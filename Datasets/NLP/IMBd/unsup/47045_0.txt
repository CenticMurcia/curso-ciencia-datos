The film distractingly switches between black and white and color, as well as time. It goes from the present to the past, and back a number of times through the feature. We are shown how several individuals live in the drug environment(ending up in prison), getting the feeling we are to be sorry for the way they have lived their lives.<br /><br />The dialogue is filled with four letter words. Maybe that's the language that is used in this community, but it seems to add little to the content of the story of this man's life.<br /><br />If there is a message in this film, it's the wrong one. Drugs and prisons seem glorified and accepted as a way of life. We all have choices. The people depicted in this film, for the most part, made the wrong ones.
