Randomness can be funny when done correctly, however just being random doesn't automatically mean that something is funny. I watched numerous episodes on many different occasions to try to give this show a fair chance and to see what all of the fuss was about. What a waste of time. This show seems to be compiled of sketches where the writers feel that if they put down the first thing that pops into their head then it will automatically be funny.<br /><br />I've heard people describe this show as being "genius" or "ground breaking" and telling people that if they dislike it they just don't "get it" and must be into lame, predictable comedy. Hardly. This show is typically liked by hipsters who fancy themselves to be on the cutting edge of comedy and think that the more absurd or nonsensical something is, the more intelligent and genius it is. Kind of like people who go to modern art shows and rave about what a genius someone was for putting a snow shovel out on display as a work of art.<br /><br />The series is filled with just a bunch of random things happening that are supposed to be funny just because they're random. Here's an example: Two men are sitting in a restaurant having an orange juice drinking contest. One man, a plumber, drinks so much orange juice that he turns into a giant chicken. The other man, dressed as a graduate, drinks so much orange juice that he begins vomiting uncontrollably. Then the plumber-turned-chicken runs across the room and dives headfirst into a stack of yellow rubber duckies. The end. That was something I wrote off of the top of my head that is in a similar vein to the skits shown on this horrible series. Hardly genius, just completely stupid.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, randomness can be funny when it's done correctly (examples are Stella, Aqua Teen, and of course Monty Python, etc). Simply throwing a bunch of random things out there and calling it a comedy sketch is anything but funny or genius.
