Just finished watching this and have to say that while we usually find IMDb to be spot on in regards to movie details, this one has a mistake on it. The character played by Brittany Murphy is not named Ally, but Maggie. At least thats the way it is in the Australian movie.<br /><br />About the movie itself - I personally found it a bit slow and hard to stay involved in it. I was able to get up and leave the room several times and upon returning found that not only did I not need to go back to see what I missed, but that I was totally indifferent to what I missed.<br /><br />It definitely didn't hold the kids interest either.
