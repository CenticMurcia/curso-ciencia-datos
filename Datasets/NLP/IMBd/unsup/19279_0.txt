Although clearly the most historically accurate and interesting film on this subject made thus far, there were some liberties taken.<br /><br />Henry Nash and his "compadre" are fictional characters but are very helpful in moving the plot along. The same is true of Chris Noth's character, Craig Wadsworth.<br /><br />Bucky O'Neil, properly spelled "Buckey O'Neill", was a real and important person both in, and before the battle. One of the most important people in the history of Arizona, he was actually buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full honors.<br /><br />William Tiffany died, probably of malaria, while awaiting transport from Cuba. He was not fatally injured in the battle.<br /><br />The Marshall character portrayed by William Katt is, most likely,a composite of correspondent Richard Harding Davis (1864-1916) and correspondent/photographer James H. "Jimmy" Hare (1856-1946). Both obviously survived the battle and become well known newsmen.
