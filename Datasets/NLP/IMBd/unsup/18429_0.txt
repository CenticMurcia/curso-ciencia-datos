This is a delightful tale of an orphan born in Newgate prison where her mother was waiting to be hanged. This film is NOT to be confused with the disappointing film, "Moll Flanders", also released in 1996. Gypsies take the infant, Moll, to a small town where she is raised by a wealthy family with two sons. One is her first love, but he passes her to his brother who marries her. After he dies, she marries a businessman, who leaves her when his fortune is depleted. Moll then marries a ship's captain, who takes her to his prosperous Virginia plantation. She learns a shocking family secret so she returns to England alone to begin a new life. She meets and marries again, but this time her true love, Jemmy, is not what he appears. He has no fortune and makes a living as a highwayman. They part and she marries again. When the next husband dies, she is left a pauper. In desperation she becomes a thief. She is imprisoned in the place of her birth, awaiting the a sentence to be carried out. Moll is a survivor. Will she cheat the hangman? I enjoyed this film very much because of its refreshing blend of drama and humor.
