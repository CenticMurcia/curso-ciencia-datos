After the ending in Ringu, there were a lot of questions left and Ringu 2 just pulls you back in.<br /><br />In Ringu, Reiko and Ryuji are the two who deal with the task of unlocking the mystery. Ringu 2 shows the deadly force of Sadako's fury as people are drawn in without even knowing it. There is more information revealed about Sadako with a pinch of ambiguity as well. Hideo Nakata's presentation and camera shots are unique and add a creepy feel. Certain scenes show the aftermath of what happened and it left my imagination trying to picture what had happened? After the events of Ringu, it's safe to say that some people are skeptical and don't believe in the curse...and find out the truth the hard way. The soundtrack, like in Ringu, sets the mood and tone for the movie as flashbacks and visions add more questions.<br /><br />I enjoyed Ringu....a LOT. When I found out there was a sequel, I had to see it and was pleased. More psychological terror from the land of the rising sun.
