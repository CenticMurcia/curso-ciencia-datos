If you can suspend your disbelief for a moment or so this movie will be even more enjoyable to watch. It is hilariously fun with just enough silliness not to interfere with the plot. Princess Esmeralda discovers an evil afoot while Don Juan comes through as the ever valiant swordsmaster with a quick wit and even faster sword. Miguel adds to the mix with his outlandish style of humor and well placed moments of timely exits. All of the action works itself well into the finale with the evil Krankenmal. Dakota, Jose and Douglas along with a great troupe of other cast deliver a fun filled, exciting performance that is reminiscent of the comedy and exploits known of them on stage in live performance. I would recommend this movie to anyone wishing to own a good comedy that is entertaining for the whole family.
