THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: I remember this film was heavily advertised on television showing drawings of some hooded thing walking around and a voice-over saying that it had arrived on Earth. I was too young to see what was presented in the amazingly misleading ads as something similar to ALIEN. I am now happy that I was too young to see it because I finally saw this film on television and there are a bunch of birds flying around and some down and out actors looking embarrassed to be there but nothing resembling the claws and eyeball on the poster art. I think it was actually some kind of devil/demon OMEN/EXORCIST rip-off that was sold as an ALIEN rip-off. Come on guys, please decide who you are ripping off. This movie is a rip-off even if you don't pay to see it because it steals your time if not your money. I can't believe anyone likes this movie but I think it's a total waste of film.
