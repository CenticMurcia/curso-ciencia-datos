This movie has certainly "grown" on me. There are very few weak parts in it. Even the extras are outstanding. There is both social and moral content. Lana Turner's character grows up and my, what a thinker she is. And so is the persistent Robert Young. Everyone wins. This is what I consider a feel good movie. I also loved both the band music and the opera scene music. If you like Walter Brennan and Dame Mae Witty, you'll have to love them in this movie. Alan Mowbray has a good bit part. I love seeing Eugene Palette manage something without goofing it up. Even he sparkles. And I've become a fan of Jimmy Conlin who plays the role of the bartender.
