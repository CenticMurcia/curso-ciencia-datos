I became interested in watching the film because David Lynch had produced it. Unfortunately, it is a terrible film, not worthy of Lynch's talents. It is an unofficial remake of the 1936 movie "Dracula's Daughter." Many scenes are mere recreations of the 1930s classic, but once the movie deviates from the older film, the story ceases to make any sense. Despite its artsy attitude, I don't think the film was trying to do or say anything meaningful. Half of the movie was shot (in b/w) with a fisher price camera, but I never understood what the director expected to get from this technique; it adds nothing to the story. In fact, these sequences are so grainy that I could not tell what was going on (what's the point of a technique that prevents the viewer from watching a film?). The movie's saving grace is Peter Fonda, who plays an updated version of Van Helsing. He is fun to watch because he is clearly enjoying himself. Sadly, it does not work as a horror film, or as a black comedy. Pretty lame effort.
