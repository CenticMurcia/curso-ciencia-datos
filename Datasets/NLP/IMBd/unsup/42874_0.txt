This game is god-awful! It's based off of the second Harry Potter film, which was good. So I decided to pick this up. Guess what? THIS GAME WAS TERRIBLE! The graphics are very good, but everything else? Insanely crappy.<br /><br />First of all, you have to play as Harry Potter. He's cool in the movies. He can do things. But in this game, he can't even walk right without getting killed or some crap like that. Second of all, Ron is gay. And so are his homosexual brothers, Michael Jackson and T.R. Knight. Whenever Harry messes up on something(which he always does), the three Weasley douchebags say stuff like "That was ****ing rubbish!".<br /><br />And plus, the game is stupid, so in conclusion, I say that this game is lame. 1/10
