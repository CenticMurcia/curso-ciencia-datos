Really, watch something else.<br /><br />I can get down with action films... but this one is just a bit too ~hardcore~ for its own good.<br /><br />I know, in a film, you're supposed to suspend your disbelief, but when is enough enough? The rooftop jumping, toilet dropping scene is proof enough for this.<br /><br />If the goal of these two Catholic boys was to destroy those who were considered "bad" in the eyes of God, why did they not kill Willem Dafoe's character, seeing as homosexuality isn't accepted in the eyes of God, especially by the Catholic church?<br /><br />I'm wondering why Willem Dafoe even entertained this script. Maybe he bought too much junk on eBay and needed some cash. Maybe he just wanted to wear that pretty dress some place. I don't know.<br /><br />I do know, though, that we now make fun of the guy who loaned it to us.<br /><br />And he'll never hear the end of it.
