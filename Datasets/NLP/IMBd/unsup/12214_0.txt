These directors have never let me down: I was addicted to their work when they did Thirtysomething some 15 years ago and since then have always been amazed by their subtle touch.<br /><br />This film could so easily have been nauseating, but the superb acting made up for the rather predictable character played by Michelle Pfeiffer, while the child was perfectly cast. As for Sean Penn? Amazing.
