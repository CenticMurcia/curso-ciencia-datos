I had heard good things about this film from other people who have seen it, but you know how it is, you have to see it for yourself. Well, I have seen it and I recommend it to anyone who has the chance to see this film. First off it's not an easy movie to take, the subject matter is intense, but not in a bad way. It's all due to the brilliant performance given by Damian Lewis that you get so emotionally involved in his story. Right from the start you see the agony of William Keane (Damian Lewis) as he searches for his missing daughter and you can't help but feel like your in his situation, his emotions leap off the screen and come right at you. Then you start to see how tortured he is, especially when you learn he's suffering from schizophrenia and he's basically self medicating himself. This film is worth your time, and has a good cast. Damian Lewis should get most of the credit, he's performance is Oscar worthy. He was his character, not an actor playing a mentally unstable man. His performance reminds you what acting is really all about.
