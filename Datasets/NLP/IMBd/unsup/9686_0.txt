Aside from the technical issues of directing, the movie was a total failure, those who did not read the novel have seen nothing! Waheed hamed's lame adaptation ruined the whole spirit of the book, the lines are more of a "Nadia el gendy" or "nabeela edeid" film.<br /><br />The whole scene is supposed to be set in the early 90s, yet nothing in the customs or the events can be of the 90s.<br /><br />Special lines and scenes are added for Zaky el dessouki (Adel emam) only because he's a famous comedian and the audience would like him to throw a joke every now and then although it's totally unnecessary,Taha's (Mohamed emam) clothes are not of his social class in anyway!<br /><br />The amazing spirit of neutrality that one can find in the novel has been brutally destroyed in the movie where you can take sides easily.<br /><br />The soundtrack is nonsense, people in theatres were laughing most of the time specially in the Gay love scenes as the proper music for the moment is lost.<br /><br />All I can think of is that those Old guys desperately tryed to seize the moment and have their share of the new Egyptian film industry cake that the young actors built over the past 8 years or so!<br /><br />Guess i'm obviously biased , but that's how I see it.
