Expecting a sophisticated take on a Philip Dick story from Steven Spielberg is like expecting a gourmet meal at McDonalds.<br /><br />Spielberg proves he's completely inadequate to take on the nuances and depth of the source material with his flash-but-no-substance approach. Tom Cruise ably proves he's an incredibly weak actor who has no range or depth.<br /><br />The script is pretty good and could have been made into a fabulous film in the hands of a capable director like Soderbergh. But as it stands, it's utterly mediocre and derivative and, most important, astoundingly forgettable with the sub-par talents of Cruise and Spielberg.<br /><br />
