This is really a masterpiece of American children's cinema. It manages to be obnoxiously preachy and sticky sweet one moment, and then violent, offensive and stupid the next. If your kid has a really sick sense of humor, this is the perfect movie. However, if you don't think they'll enjoy seeing a guy get hit on the head repeatedly with a brick and have 1000 volts pumped into him while using the sink (that is just SO funny) then you might want to look into something else.
