So I watching TV. on the net and I came across this show called "Reaper". I immediately became intrigued because it seemed like the title of show that could possibly be somewhat interesting. However, from what I've seen this show is nothing but a rip off on Dead Like Me which was made five years earlier. It has the same idea of a young person being torn from "normal" life and being forced to deal with the question and curiosities of death. The only difference between the two shows is that this reaper works for the devil, and this show is not funny and the actors leave much to be desired. If you like this type of stuff (tastefully morbid and ironic things), then I highly recommend you check Dead Like Me Out. It is only amazing.
