Seagal had to make good movies from 1988 until 2001. Today you die and into the sun, or belly of the beast were good, but movies how Out for a kill or the foreigner or out of reach weren't good. They were very bad. Black Dawn isn't a good movie. Black Dawn isn't a good mainstream movie. Black Dawn is that what the people to make in the toilets. This movie is bullshit. Its boring, bad and terrible. The actors are very bad. The cuts very bad and the story is terrible. This Movie is the second part of the Foreigner, but the foreigner was bad, and now makes Seagal a second part of this bad movie. Why?? Doesn't he have enough money?? Today you die was so good and cool, but this movie is the bad movie of all his bad movies.
