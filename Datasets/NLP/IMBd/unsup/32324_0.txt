Sorry, I don't see how the first half and second halves of this film tied together. OK, there were soldiers in both. As two separate films it has hope.<br /><br />The pace in the two halves (films?) was entirely different. As were the people. Everyone was a "slacker" at the start and the solders were driven in the second.<br /><br />However, I liked the two sisters who befriended the two young men, gave them soda and offered pot. I'd like a movie about them! Didn't see them at the mall.
