At the beginning of World War 2 the German navy positioned the pocket battleship Graf Spee, ready and waiting to prey on allied shipping, which it did with deadly efficiency. Following a major sea battle with a British task force the Graf Spee was forced to seek refuge in a south American port to make repairs. The cameras of the world's press focused on Montevideo as the German ship struggled to regain its fighting ability while the Royal Navy converged to attack when it was, inevitably, forced to leave. A brilliant espionage operation convinced Captain Hans Langsdorff that 1/2 the British navy was waiting for him, so he scuttled the ship in the harbor and subsequently shot himself. Those are the facts and they're wonderfully re-created in this riveting film. Powell and Pressburger paid meticulous attention to detail and it shows throughout. I really admired their honesty in showing the battle and what happened later as objectively as it could be, whilst still (always) remaining good entertainment. Peter Finch gave a fantastic, intense performance as the doomed Captain. The real Langsdorff was a man of the highest intelligence and integrity, a tragic example of a fine man who found himself forced to serve an evil regime, and Finch truly conveyed the battle Langsdorff must have been fighting within himself; conscience versus duty. In the end his conscience won. Captain Langsdorff took his own life in a hotel room, lying on an old "imperial" German navy flag, a calculated insult to Hitler. I'm glad the Graf Spee was destroyed but sad that Langsdorff was one of SO many victims of this terrible war. The Battle Of The River Plate is an excellent portrayal of this true-life drama. Well worth seeing.
