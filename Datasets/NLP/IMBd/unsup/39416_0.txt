This movie deals with the problems a man faces with too many problems in his life. It is OK for a rental . If you like John Ritter( I liked him better in Three's Company), then you might like this movie. It was directed by Blake Edwards(who directed the movie "10"). The movie is almost like a black comedy , other times trying to be a drama. Only watch or buy if you like the main star John Ritter!!Skin Deep is a semi enjoyable movie for John Riitter fans.
