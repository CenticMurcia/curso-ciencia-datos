I give this movie a 9 because I've watched this movie a record 32 times (if not more in bits and pieces) and still manage to fall off the chair laughing through most parts of the movie.<br /><br />I watched it first on a VCD and later found a featured DVD a few years later for a few extra quid. I would still pay for any material about this movie that I can lay my hands on.<br /><br />The confusion at the cell with Stan, the sleepless nights and their many reasons, the break-in break-off relationship with Mona, the intimidating judge 'who's just aching to throw Vinny in jail', and the twisted excitement in the end; all give 'My cousin Vinny' everything a serious comedy needs. It's quite surprising that Joe Pesci has never been set in the lead role in a comedy till date. The reel-life chemistry between Marrisa Tomei and Joe Pesci has been quite appealing and could never be any better or even the same if any of the actors were played by anybody else.<br /><br />The movie, however failed to get the recognition it deserves, but I'm glad I watched this movie soon after its release.<br /><br />I recommended this highly for anyone who visits this page and for those trying to make a decision to watch.
