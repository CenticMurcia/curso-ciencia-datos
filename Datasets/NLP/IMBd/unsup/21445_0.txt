Spoilers Ring 2 is a very, very good film that I gave 8/10 I would have given it a 9 but didn't because it gets a bit to overly supernatural. And because of this as a whole it loses some of that great spooky atmosphere that made the first film so magnificent. But having said that it does contain some of the best moments of both films. - The reporter who said he would then never watched the tape being freaked out when trying to erase the tape of the now dead girl. - When they see Sadako's mother combing her hair in the mirror (what you see in the tape) the way she glides out of sight behind a wall then peers round. It's hard to explain what I mean but if you've already seen the film you'll know what I mean. - The climax in the well. - And the ending with the dead girl sitting behind the reporter in his room in mental ward.<br /><br />Also I wouldn't really call Ring 2 a sequel it start from where the first finished, if you play them back to back, there like one big 3 hour spooky movie. If you've never seen Ring 1 and 2 then you should go and see them straight away they are the best Horror films of the 90's (well Ring 1 is, and 2 is not far behind).
