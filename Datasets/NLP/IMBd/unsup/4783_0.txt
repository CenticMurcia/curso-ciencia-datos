I have been looking forward to this movie. After all it sounded half decent and had Bruce Campbell in it. I didn't like Lucky McGees previous movie May that much. Fortunately the director improves with his second movie The Woods. The basic plot is that a girl is taken to a secluded private girl school deep in the forests where she soon starts to suspect something weird is going on in the school. The actors are good, the plot is good, dialogue quite sweet and Bruce Campbell gets to wield an axe. It's good to see him in another good movie besides the Evil Dead trilogy and Bubba Ho-Tep.. and I don't know what obsession Lucky McGee has with lesbians and bloody mayhem endings but it's fine with me.
