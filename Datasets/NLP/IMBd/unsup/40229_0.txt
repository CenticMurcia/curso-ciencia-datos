And what sucks is that I really like Spike Lee. I am the only one of all of my friends who like him, and give him props whenever possible. I think most of his movies are great, with the only exception being School Daze and now this one. This movie suffers from the same problems as School Daze, only amplified. They both suffer from the "all over the map" syndrome. I am totally open to Spike Lee preaching, Bamboozled was a great movie with an important message, but it was just one message! I'm sorry, but I really couldn't keep up with all of the different sermons Spike was giving in this movie, and I didn't really understand them either. So, this is the best I could figure out: The government is evil, large corporations are evil, aids is killing blacks and whites don't care, (these are the easy ones) then I guess that Spike is trying to say something about fatherless black children which is hard to understand, then I guess he also has an opinion on sperm donation, but what is it? Also he thinks that blacks are suffering from diabetes due to hateful corporations/govt/white people, etc. Also the same score from Bamboozled is used without any changes at all!!!! This movie is too ambitious for its own good, and it exemplifies everything that Spike's critics complain about. Save your self some time, and rent some of Spike's great work like Bamboozled, Clockers, Do the Right Thing, Mo Better Blues, 25th hour, Malcolm X.
