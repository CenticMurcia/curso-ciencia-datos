I would only recommend this movie to people who would like to see a laughably horrible version of a great play. All the actors are horrible, except for whoever plays Bottom. They deliver their lines incredibly dry. The costumes are also bad, as the female characters are in mini skirts most of the time. Surprising, considering the movie takes place in Ancient Greece, or, at least, it's supposed to, but the director decided to say it was in Athens, when all the costumes and sets look like the Victorian times. The editing in this film is nonsensical. The fairies, instead of being graceful, disappear and move thanks to the magic of film cutting. Human characters find themselves in random places in between lines of monologues, even in between lines of dialog, where it makes even less sense, when one character is suddenly up a tree. It's a funny movie, but not because the play is a comedy, but because it's all so horrible.<br /><br />Thumbs down, way down.
