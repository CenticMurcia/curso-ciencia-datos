I watched this movie, because I had promised my little sister to join her. I have seen all the other Otto-movies, because my family loves him, but I don't really think he's funny. So I went to the movies with a very negative attitude, thinking that I am going to be terribly bored. That really wasn't the case! Although everybody knows the basic story, the film is still interesting and I had to laugh and smile a lot of times. Sure, it is very stupid, but this is that kind of movie that is so stupid, it's already funny again. The comedians are great, except Harald Schmidt who should stick to offending people, that's what he is good at. I loved Nina Hagen as the bad stepmother and Ruediger Hoffmann as the person in the mirror was just hilarious! The only bad thing about the movie is the song that they are singing all the time. You won't get it out of your head afterward! Everybody who just wants to be entertained should watch this!
