Oh boy, where to begin on this one... I won't go into the plot or story, because it's non-existent. It's a 100 train wreck that sometimes tries to be a sci-fi film, but attempts to insert some action and CGI money shots. It fails miserably, being a Michael-Bay-esquire version of what a sch fi movie is supposed to be.<br /><br />Keanu's acting speaks for himself, he is pretty much playing the same character as he did over the past 15 years (post-Speed Keanu). Kathy Bates is wasted on this one, and she FEELS she's on the wrong place, you can see it right through her acting. John Cleese appears on the cameo that shows how DEAD his career is. From Python to this, it's so SAD to witness his scenes...<br /><br />Of course, we have Jaden Smith, at yet another ANNOYING scenery chewing piece of child performance, that makes you roll your eyes in disbelief. You can just FEEL his dad right next to the camera, paying off the director to keep him in this film.<br /><br />Filled with plot holes and an anti-climatic Deus Ex Machina, the classic 1951 film is murdered on this 2008 travesty, a sign of how awful Hollywood has turned. I cannot stress this too much: avoid.
