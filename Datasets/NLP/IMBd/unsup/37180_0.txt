"Dear Director, What movie you've just created is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever seen. At no point in its rambling, incoherent poorly adapted story were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone who saw this movie is now dumber for having seen to it. I award you no good review, and may God have mercy on your soul."<br /><br />Honestly I would have rather watched Step Mom. Honestly. There was never any sense of what these signs even do. I still don't know. Why is the so called insanely evil "Dark" so harmful? Never once during the entire movie was there even a hint of wonder.<br /><br />What about the old ones? At the end of the movie I just though they were there to talk cryptically and pretty much do nothing. <br /><br />I think I just saw the worst movie ever made. I do have the sense that the book was probably great (I never read it)... it is a pity it wasn't realized in film.<br /><br />Save your money...don't rent it or buy it.
