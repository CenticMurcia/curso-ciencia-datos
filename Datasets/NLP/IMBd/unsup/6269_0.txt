For an Indie movie this had it's moments, my girlfriend liked the coffee I loved the redneck;god he was funny! The fact he grossed out my girlfriend rocked, rent it and look for the ring. Good job guys I try and support Indie Movies simply because I am tired of the same rehash Hollywood spoon feeds us. For the love of man this is at least a hundred times better than survivor.
