After teaming up in "Foul Play," Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn reunite in this Neil Simon send-up of and tribute to those old-fashioned screwball comedies. It seems that Chevy was minding his own business, when he is kidnapped to rob a bank by two ex-cons, who make a habit of getting trusting faces to do their work for them. They go through with it, with Chevy staring right into the security camera. Being thrown from a moving car afterwards, a bruised Chevy makes his way to his ex-wife, Goldie, who, of course, is now married to the county d.a., played wonderfully by Charles Grodin.<br /><br />At first, it reminded of me "The Talk of the Town," the one where Cary Grant is wanted by the law and Jean Arthur gives him shelter, unwillingly. Then, it felt like those Doris Day/Rock Hudson movies. Then, as it neared its wacky courtroom end, it felt like "What's Up, Doc?" which was a remake of "Bringing Up Baby." With me throwing all these names at you, do you feel like watching an old movie? <br /><br />Well, this will do. The stars' chemistry and charm make for most of the appeal, and it is quite easy to take and pleasant with its presence of 80s stars George Grizzard, T.K. Carter, and Robert Guillaume (from "Soap" and "Benson.") Having said that, it's not as good as Simon's greatest films, like "The Odd Couple," "The Sunshine Boys," and others. (I keep thinking though that 7 is too low and 8 is just a little high. As it won't take a 7.5, I'll give an '8' to give it the benefit of the doubt.) But it is much better than "Foul Play," whose main asset besides Goldie was the very funny Dudley Moore.<br /><br />The viewer may be left wondering about the ending, though. It makes me feel like Neil Simon didn't quite know how to end it, for it stops very abruptly. But, if you're in the mood for some madcap shenanigans and haven't ever seen this, you're in for a treat. "Seems Like Old Times" makes for a good time, courtesy of Neil Simon.
