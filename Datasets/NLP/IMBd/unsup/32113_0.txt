I truly enjoyed this movie. It is one of those movies where it seems that the actors were just given free reign to have fun with their parts. Oliver Platt steals every scene he is in, and the Colombian Cartel members are quite amusing as well. Liam Neeson and his group therapy session is quite enjoyable as well. Even Sandra Bullock is amusing, especially when giving a colonic. This is a movie that looks like it was fun to make, and it can be just as fun to watch. This is not a taut thriller, a gritty cop film, a clever spy movie, or an intellectual comedy. It is fun. Have fun with it. If you don't like to have fun then go see the new Time Machine. If you do like fun then watch Gun Shy.
