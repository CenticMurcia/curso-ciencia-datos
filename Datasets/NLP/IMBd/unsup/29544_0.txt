As the only film Mitchell & Petrillo did together, this was an obvious attempt to duplicate the feel and tempo of a 1952 Paramount Martin & Lewis movie in virtually every detail. One wonders if there wasn't legal action against the producers of this picture for the obvious cloning of Martin & Lewis!<br /><br />Sammy Petrillo has the Jerry Lewis of 1952 nailed down perfectly and even above that--as a caricature! Duke Mitchell wasn't as good a Dean Martin, though, but a passable leading man and singer. Lugosi fans will like the big role he has in this picture. Too bad they weren't given other picture offers. The female and supporting players are all quite good. For a cheapie that was shot on a budget of $50,000, it has good production values--even the gorilla transformation scenes! Since this film is in the public domain, it turns up often in dollar DVD displays at many discount stores.
