While I thought Elisabeth Shue did a wonderful performance of a new mother going through the anxiety of post par-tum depression, the supporting actors were not as engaging. Her emotions were believable, but the storyline was extremely confusing. Perhaps because that was the whole point of the movie? Was the entire theme centered around the confusion, fear, and anxiety that most new mothers face? Because the ENDING completely destroyed any sympathy I had for what the main character. This movie left me with a HORRIBLE, unsettling feeling. I don't want to spoil the movie for everyone, but to the comments posted prior, I actually DID have to watch the movie again. There are subtle foreshadowing events that reveal her insecurities building...not only as a mother, but also as someone responsible for another life. I just hoped for a better ending.
