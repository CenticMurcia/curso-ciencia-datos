There's something very endearing about The Darling Buds of May. The bright English country side coupled with bright and life filled characters made this show very heart warming and easy to watch. I remember watching it with great interest as an adolescent and it's something that's stayed with me into my adulthood.<br /><br />For it's time, The Darling Buds of May was showing a different side of British society. Although the Larkins weren't nessicarilly "wealthy" they were happy and they were very supportive as family. It's a breath of fresh air to watch such characters and the situations they get into.<br /><br />I recommend watching this show, it's heartfelt, touching, the characters are very real and the scenery is breath taking.
