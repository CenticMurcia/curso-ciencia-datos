The TV series was as funny as war, and here's a belated spin-off that serves no purpose. The first question has to be: what the hell are Martin Sheen and Miguel Ferrer doing in this? Sheen has a glint in his eye that screams 'where's my cheque?', and they've both made crap before, but they deserve better than this. So does Jensen Daggett, who brightens things up a bit by just being lovely. Admittedly there are a couple of decent gags that should be recycled in a superior movie, but more often than not a tumbleweed will roll by following the sound of another of ALF's one-liners thudding lifelessly to the floor. As TV icons go, ALF just isn't one.
