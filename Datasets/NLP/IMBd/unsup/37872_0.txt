OK, let me just start off by saying that if you aren't 15 and madly in love or in a mid-life crisis, this movie will seem extremely extremely cheesy...<br /><br />By cheesy, I mean "I wanted to feel in my body as much pain as I feel in my heart" (get over yourself)... and the actor is meant to say this without laughing. Seriously though i found some parts of the dialog excruciating. As well, who talks about their recently turned lesbian ex-wife to a complete stranger? <br /><br />Also the story itself seems to have been written by either a 15 year old or a midlife criser. It's just so cliché... the young couple with a tragic end, the alcoholic father, the cutely naive 40 year old who gets his heart stomped on over and over again, and above all, the wise old black man. I think it's about time for Morgan Freeman to find other parts to play... It's also cliché in that everyone falls in love at first sight, somehow confusing lust for love.<br /><br />The acting was overall OK, though sometimes Kinnear makes you raise an eyebrow. Truly, I think the producers noticed the movie wouldn't have cut it, so they decided to throw in a few naked chicks and I guess it works, I mean i stayed till the end. The only reason i stayed though was for Alexa Davalos (bom chicka wah wah).<br /><br />This could have been a really really good soap opera.
