I checked out this German silent film early in my film collecting days to get another look at the intriguing Louise Brooks, a controversial actress of her day whom I had read a lot of glowing tributes to her by critics. However, like the other movie I watched her in, "Pandora's Box," this, too, I found boring. It was way too soap opera-ish. Hey, everybody here isn't a drama queen. <br /><br />The clincher for turning me off on this film was the anti-Christian bias, something prevalent since film began. Here, we see a gym instructor with a big cross around her neck, in which the camera showed in closeups twice to make sure we got their point, and the woman was a sick sadist. This is ploy filmmakers have been doing for years, right to this day. <br /><br />Too much talk in here was not translated, either. That gets frustrating to watch. Brooks gets an inordinate amount of attention and praise simply because she was a big feminist before her time, so Liberals gush over anything she did, even it stinks. Case in point.
