the entire movie seems like it was an attempt to get a few girls naked. the plot is horrible. the acting is worse.<br /><br />looks like it was filmed on the cheapest camera available. the soundtrack was the best part of the flick, and even it wasn't that great. i'd rather have my eyes gouged out than be exposed to the shittiness of this movie again.<br /><br />i regret paying the price of the rental. it was like paying to be insulted. over and over again.<br /><br />if i had wanted porn i'd have stuck to the internet. to be honest, i could probably find a better quality movie on youtube.<br /><br />i sincerely hope that no one ever pays to see this movie again. i hope even more that no one ever gives the hacks that made this piece of crap enough money to make another movie ever again.<br /><br />i've seen better from first year film students.
