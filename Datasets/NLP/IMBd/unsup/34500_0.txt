Just watched it. I was so eager to watch it after all the praise it got from IMDb and even a loyal facebook fan base. Stay away. The whole movie is predictable, besides the twist - which had me in hysterical laughing fits, it's plain ridiculous. The movie is one clich√© after another, the acting is not too bad, but the story is just lame. I don't understand what separates this film from other 'teen slasher/horror' movies. How can someone describe it as a horror? It was utterly lame. Me and my gf predicted the film in 5 minutes. What's the point of watching something so predictable? Even the twist didn't save it. Enough with these repetitive projects, create something original. I can also admit that I enjoyed Midnight Movie more than this. Stay away not even for a rainy evening.
