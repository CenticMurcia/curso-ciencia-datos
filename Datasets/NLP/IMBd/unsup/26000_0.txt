This movie sucks...A LOT. This movie ranks #2 on my worst movies list (The first one of course, being Hard Rock Zombies). I'm not the biggest fan of the Howling Series, but, just because this movie was horrible doesn't mean I'm not gonna try to finish the series. I liked 1, 3, and 6 and I have yet to see 2, 5 and 7 (I hear 7 is much worse than this) <br /><br />The movie is about an author named Marie (Played by Romy Windsor) who after a nervous breakdown, is sent to the town of Drago, along with her husband Richard. What they don't know is that Drago is haunted...By werewolves, which we don't see on-screen until somewhere towards the end. How droll. <br /><br />I feel that summarzing this movie is just as tough as watching it, again. I would rather eat my own feces and snot and down it with milk mixed with Kraft EZ Cheeze (I'm lactose intolerant btw) and Clorox and Drano than have to watch this stupid crap again. The song "Something Evil, Something Dangerous" performed by Justin Hayward from The Moody Blues can't even save this. Even worse, the song sounds so damn familiar to the Deadtime Stories theme by Taj (Deadtime Stories is really good 80s cheeze btw) After getting this out of the DVD player, I just smashed the disc into tiny little pieces, which is what this sewage leak of a movie deserves. Hard to believe that John Hough, the man who directed Disney Favorites like Witch Mountain and Watcher in the Woods. This "movie" could also be seen as a very boring 2-hour infomercial for Coca- Cola, as there's a good amount of product placement in there for Coke. Avoid at all costs. I wish I could give this a zero, but I'll just have to settle with a one.
