This is one of my favourite films of all time. It has such a feel good factor that I get it out and watch it at least three times a year and have done since I was kid, surfing with my friends in Cornwall in the early eighties. Following the lives of three friends from 1962 to the "great swell" of 1974, this is a beautifully shot movie with warm characters that you grow to really care about. From the opening credits with, believe it or not, the wonderfully mellow voice-over provided by Robert England, to the final mega surfing scene the story pulls you in with it's glorious scenery, great acting and superbly shot surfing scenes. Based around Milius's own experiences this is a classic and in my opinion, the best surfing film ever made.
