This is a 1943 movie. The main storyline revolves around a madman killing young girls while casting the blame on a fugitive leopard...original? Hardly... CHARLIE CHAN AT THE CIRCUS (1936) showed the same device (but it was a gorilla there). The psychopath finally confessing that he's a victim of his urges he cannot control...original? Hardly... 1931's M (Fritz Lang) showed the very same device, so I'm sorry dear mr. Tourneur but you didn't fool ME there. In a city full of Mexicans a tough guy impresario plans a coup de theatre that backfires and a leopard is let loose...people start to die. First is young Teresa...her gargoyle 150kg three-inches-thick-eyebrows mother won't understand her fear of darkness and send her on errands at night to buy...wheat for...tortillas (!!!) so that she's killed on the doorstep of her cabin. Second is a well-off girl who goes on a secret date in the cemetery, overstays and meets her doom. Third a dancer... In spite of its lack of originality, acting is fine, plot contrivances work and atmosphere is good. Worth watching. Were the main actresses hot or what...? One struggles to believe the dancer died in 1985 nearly 70...
