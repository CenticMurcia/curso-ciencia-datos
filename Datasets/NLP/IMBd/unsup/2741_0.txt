This was a really good show that should have given Apes fans more episodes to enjoy. It is a shame that only 14 or so were produced. Each episode had an interesting story line that provided the viewer insight to the ape culture. The two main leads were very likable and had flaws that required the help or encouragement of the other. Roddy McDowall did a fine job playing the sympathetic ape, Galen. The show did not try to mimic the films but created it's own story lines in an ape setting that was set apart from the films. I would have liked to have seen more stories involving this trio and perhaps even some type of resolution/conclusion to Allen and Burke's continual evasion from the apes.
