But only because it is the worst, worst movie ever made. It is horrible! C.Arkin starring (or maybe "black-holing") in this movie claims today that with this movie they managed to create a miracle with the given resources at that time. The question is "why did you do it then?" Was someone threatening you that either you make this movie or he'd kill you? But, still for any viewers around the world this movie could set the lowest limit of how a movie could be made. Collect a few puppets and add some household gadget to the interior of your car, don't forget your motorcycle helmet or maybe you can borrow it from a policeman or construction worker. Challenge this movie by making your own one!
