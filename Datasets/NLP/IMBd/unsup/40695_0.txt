As a kid I loved most of Don Bluth's work, they were original, and had plenty of dark elements to them. But if I had to pick which was his worst film, easily it's A Troll in Cental Park.<br /><br />The plot execution is as generic as you can get, a troll with magical powers is different from the others, he leaves and finds two kids, one of them doesn't believe in the supernatural, and they embark on some kind of adventure which leads to them fighting against the troll's mother, a tyrannical troll queen.<br /><br />This film reunites An American Tale voice actors Phillip Glasser and Dom De Luise, sadly they're wasted and their chemistry just doesn't work like it did in their American Tale days, not at all. Cloris Leachman, love her or hate her, is a great actress but her she just overacts her whole performance.<br /><br />Honestly, I saw this movie only once or twice as a kid and it bored me to death and I just didn't feel engaged by it, just not at all. Not to mention some scenes made me cringe, like the whole "Gus is crying" scenario, just unbearable.<br /><br />Still though, the animation is beautiful, but it doesn't make up for how many faults are in the film.<br /><br />Don Bluth's done better, but this was just embarrassing.
