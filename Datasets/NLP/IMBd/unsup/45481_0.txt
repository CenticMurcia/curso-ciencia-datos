I saw this film not too long ago. I borrowed it from a friend who bought the DVD in Canada. I thought 'Well? Let's see what this film is like..' To tell you the truth, I think director Albert Pyun's fourth Nemesis installment has sunk more lower than a submarine. Hitting the ocean floor or the abyss. In this film, there's so much talk and less action. I couldn't believe what Sue Price has got herself into. Stripping nude in the film as she carries gun, kill a few guys and that's it! Although she maybe good in the film.. I would've thought there would be more action. But it seems that Albert Pyun decided to tone it down in this crappy flick. Obviously the movie itself was set in 2080 AD. But it seems it's set in the 90's in some ghost town with nobody there. There was a scene where Sue Price's character, Alex fires one shot at a helicopter which was totally out of proportion. I thought Mel Gibson's character of Martin Riggs of Lethal Weapon would shoot the pilot dead within 3 shots. Anyway, this film is not as good as I thought. It was terribly done. Shame this fourth Nemesis movie really ran its course. I don't blame Sue Price. I hope in future, she gets better and decent roles than this. So for Sue Price, 10 out of 10! Well? You do the maths.. As for the film? 0 out of 10! Not my kind of film! Sorry..!!
