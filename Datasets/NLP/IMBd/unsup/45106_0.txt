Lady In The Lake (3 out of 10)<br /><br />Phillip Marlowe movies marry us to the detective's point of view. He is in every scene, and we never see what happens behind his back. The Lady In The Lake takes this one step further. Here the camera itself is Marlowe. The majority of the movie is Marlowe's P.O.V. -- the camera shakes when he gets slapped around, and "our" eyes close when he kisses the girl. No Stedicam, of course, so the camerawork is pretty stiff, but not nearly as stiff as the acting.<br /><br />The Raymond Chandler plot is as good as you might expect, and I allowed myself to accept the gimmick; however, the acting is worse than I have ever seen in any A-movie of the studio system. Beyond horrible. Did the actors feel silly talking to the camera? <br /><br />Lila Leeds is stunning in her brief turn as a receptionist. If I had to be busted with pot, like Robert Mitchum, I'd do the perp walk with her any night.
