This is a film from Turkey which tells one of the real stories of this land. It is a sincere work with suspense, you will pursue something that you don't know yet! The common problem of the movies in Turkey is about the subjects that they handle. They try to deal with the matters which have no effects on the audience, because they don't belong to us! Unlike the others, this movie is about our villages, our people, our way of thinking, our culture in short. <br /><br />The main statement of the movie is "Hopes never die". Yes, life fights against you, but it will win when you give up! It says that the divine justice is not so immediate, you should be insistent!
