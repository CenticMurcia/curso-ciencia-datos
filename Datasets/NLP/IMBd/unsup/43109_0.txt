Anyone who's not seen this, don't feel pressured by the supposed controversy. The whole thing is as entertaining as being steam-rolled into your armchair by a Lee Harvey Oswald documentary. Why the harebrained duo, Range and Finch, picked this subject is obvious when you scan the hair-triggered rags and the inflamed threads on this board.<br /><br />To explain my low rating. It earned the slothenly four during a long slip from a decent five when it failed to convince me that its creation was justified. Put simply, this was perhaps the most disrespectful tirade against a political figure I have ever seen; they flushed thousands of Franklins down the toilet and this bobbed up? There was no message beyond the flimsily appended, "Patriot ACT, wah wah wah... Patriot ACT, wail cry wail!"<br /><br />Pathetically shallow.<br /><br />Or was it? If you put on your special investigation specs and look closely there's a veiled finger pointing at Cheney. Could he have been the second gunman at the Sheraton? Was his motive for the assassination piggy-backing into office? He had demonstrated a keen ability for the murder method earlier in the year and numerous trips to the table would have furnished him with almost as much aortic experience as his crack team of cardiovascular surgeons. All that's left is opportunity. How convenient then that he doesn't show his face until the President is already critical, and then only to try to derail the investigation and cover up his misdeeds.<br /><br />Very suspicious. Thought provoking! One thumb and a pointer finger up!
