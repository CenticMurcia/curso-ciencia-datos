Lets face it, Dean and Jerry probably considered this one for about 14.5 seconds before passing. Still, this roll of celluloid gave me a few jolts to the funny bone. The odd teaming of Lugosi and two very sub-par NY entertainers is amusing by itself. And, as the packaging claims, this movie has everything- romance, horror, humor and songs. Naturally, they don't go on to say that the QUALITY of all those things is a bit shaky. This film does go a long way toward proving that the French are actually RIGHT about Jerry Lewis, whilst offering up some of the silliest goof-ball antics and dialog I've seen in a while! But, if you come across this baby in the dollar DVD bin as I did...you won't regret buying it.
