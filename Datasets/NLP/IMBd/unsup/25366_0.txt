This is a classic "bad film" that seems made to be butchered up by Mystery Science 2000/3000 - and only by that process be made watchable. The special effects consist of men in rubber suits, and the plot is just comic book material. Its inconceivable to me that anyone would actually like this movie for its own merit, but it is the kind of movie that becomes funny just by the fact that it was made. The fact that the movie was featured the cover of "The Great Book of Movie Monsters" (Jan Stacy and Ryder Syvertsen) shows the movies only merit: its limited role in the 1950's cheesecake style horror flick. The trouble is that this movie is so cheap that it would even disappoint 10-year old kids of the 1950's. My rating" 2
