A little slow and studied, but very worthwhile and ultimately moving. One of those modest little films that are awfully good but you may have to oversell it's virtues to get your friends to see it. Some will love it, a few will shrug and say "So What?" I've seen it twice now, I like it even more the second time around. The long, long single, almost wordless shot will move you or annoy the heck out of you if your impatient. By the way, my native Italian friend (who loved the film) says Tony Shalhoub is much more convincing as an Italian man speaking English than as a an Italian man speaking Italian.
