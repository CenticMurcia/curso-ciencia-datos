Oh man I wanted to like this movie. It has a great cast and it is a small independent film. And I really admire Ben Affleck. I like his story of his leap to stardom. But I think his loyalty is what got in the way of his good sense. Because how he got suckered into this film has to be becaue of brotherhood. Now I don't know if this is true or not but I read somewhere that Casey Affleck was very instrumental in getting this film going. It was his baby. And perhaps big brother decided to add his name to the film just to help him out. Whatever the story is, the film is trash. It isn't funny, it isn't interesting, it isn't even remotely likable. And Christina Ricci is so incredibly annoying in this film that I wanted to shoot her every time her winy voice invaded the soundtrack. " Yuaa wwwuuaanna gyet sum cwoffee? " Arrrgggh, please stop the insanity. I am kind of upset about it too because I generally enjoy indie films, there is a freshness to them. But this wasn't fresh. It was just down right annoying. Don't ever see this, unless you are about to head to the gym for an intense workout. This will give you new frustrations to take your anger out on.
