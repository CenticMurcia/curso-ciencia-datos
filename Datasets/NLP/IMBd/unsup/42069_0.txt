Words cannot describe how terrible this "film" is. I would honestly rather watch House of the Dead four times in a row than ever sit through this garbage again. The girls are hot, there are couple of steamy, but brief, lesbian sex scenes -- but they are not worth a rental or even the time it would take to skip to them on an online copy of the film. The acting from Marc Senter (The Lost) is excruciatingly horrible and the filmmakers just wasted his talent. The plot makes no sense and I can't tell if they were trying to make the film comical or disturbing. It is NOT disturbing in the least and if it was supposed to be comedic, a film about a transvestite spewing "Yo Momma Jokes" for the entire runtime would be more entertaining and humorous than WICKED LAKE. The cinematography in the film is terrible and it looks like the director forgot to clean the camera lens because there are an alarmingly vast amount of noticeable water marks in certain scenes and the picture is washed and incredibly grainy. The acting is beyond awful, the score is OKAY, the plot (I stress that word) sounded cool, but the movie is not. What's even worse is that the filmmakers actually think they made a good movie, which they didn't. (At least they were kind enough to spare us with the numerous fake IMDb accounts tactic claiming this to be the greatest horror film ever made.) It looks like anyone can make a film these days, so grab your friends, any object that has a camera, and get to work!<br /><br />THE WORST MOVIE OF 2008, HANDS DOWN.<br /><br />A complete waste of $17 & and hour and a half.<br /><br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
