The glowing reviews this movie has garnered are downright appalling.<br /><br />Yes, the production values are bad and the makeup is laughable, but that's not my primary gripe. I can look past such things quite easily if the film is good  e.g., Last Supper (2005). Yes, the budget was small, but that's not my primary gripe. I can look past such things quite easily if the film is imaginative  e.g., Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989). Yes, the scariness is virtually non-existent, but that's not my primary gripe. I can look past such things quite easily if the film is entertaining  e.g., Diary (2006).<br /><br />The problem with Long Dream, as I see it, is that it lacks any memorable moments whatsoever. And this is all despite its intriguing premise, which was most certainly wasted on this endeavor. There are both psychological and philosophical concepts to be had with regards to extended dreams, regardless of production values, budget constraints, or a lack of scariness. None of them are employed with skill in this movie. Everything is glossed over in the most superficial of ways. Characters fear death, but such feelings are expressed through dialogue instead of actual experiences, which makes it very difficult for the viewer to connect with that fear.<br /><br />In like manner, the psychological effects of extended dreaming are very shallow. I suspect that the environment is the primary culprit here. Restricting almost every scene within a bland hospital hampers the negative psychosis that presumably afflicts the characters. Interaction with outside persons/events would have been a better decision. It would have also allowed for a more imaginative application of the intriguing premise as well as provided greater opportunities for improved imagery, which quite frankly sucks here. I can't understand why some are comparing the visuals of this turd to those of Uzumaki (2000). You people should get your eyes checked.<br /><br />And please stop making comments like, "If you liked Uzumaki, you'll definitely like this." Why would you make such a comparison? The films are absolutely NOTHING alike? I have serious doubts regarding the logic behind some of the positive reviews here. It's almost as if Long Dream gets a free pass on everything just because it's low budget or because it's made by the same people who made the impressive Uzumaki. I disagree. At only 58 minutes this movie should never regress into boredom, but it most certainly does. It's really nothing more than a few generic doctors walking around attempting to diagnose some patients who claim they have extended dreams. A pity indeed.<br /><br />I've personally seen over 150 East Asian horror movies, most of which are from Japan, and many of which have puny budgets. Even so, Long Dream is definitely on the bottom end of that list. Check out my user profile for a listing of films you should see instead of this. All of them are better than this movie. That much I can assure you.
