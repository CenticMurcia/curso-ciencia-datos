Bette Davis and Leslie Howard give classic 30's performances while Humphrey Bogart gives one for all ages around the interior of a roadside dirty spoon and filling station in the American South West. Meanwhile director Archie Mayo stays out of the way in filming what is basically a two set stage play. <br /><br />Based on the Sherwood Anderson Depression era play about a hostage situation and the cross section of people it brings together it's a touch dated but nearly the entire cast is flawless with Bogart's Duke Mantee holding center stage. He's one of the darkest villains in film history but by risking everything to meet up his moll becomes every bit the romantic the well versed wandering dreamer Allan Squier is. Leslie Howard is charmingly, fatalistic, Bette Davis has never been more cute and innocent and this could be 100 plus film actor Charlie Grapewin's finest performance.<br /><br />Interspersed between the hostage situation and the romance of the star struck lovers is a socially conscious message that mocks a rising fascism with a buffoonish para-military local group and raises questions regarding other ills plaguing the country at the time. One minor but intriguing scene between the black gang member and the very staid black chaueffeur of the wealthy hostages raises an interesting message about equality. <br /><br />One could argue that if they'd moved this play off the stage and given it to Milestone and his tracking obsession it might have made a finer film. It would be impossible to get better performances however.
