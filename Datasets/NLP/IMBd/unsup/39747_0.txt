The city couple Andy and Elisabeth Farmer, played by Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith, leave the city life to move out to the country. He is going to write a novel, but things doesn´t go exactly as planned. Lots of disasters make their new life go awry and it seems country life wasn´t as simple as they thought. <br /><br />In Funny Farm, all the magic that made the first Vacation-movie so great is missing. Even the silly sequel, National Lampoon´s European Vacation, seems rather fun in comparison. The jokes are predictable and rarely hit the spot. It´s difficult for Chase to do anything with this material, his acting skills definitely deserves better scripts. Madolyn Smith is not bad as his wife, and it´s rather surprising that she hasn´t done any acting since 1994.<br /><br />With a pretty promising plot, the movie could have been a funny trip to the countryside, but Chevy Chase has done much better movies.<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar is seen in a blink-and-you-miss-her appearance, and this might be fun to check out for Buffy-fans. But this itself is not a reason to sit through this movie, it´s simply to dull.<br /><br />* ½ out of * * * * *
