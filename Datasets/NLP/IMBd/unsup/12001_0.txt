I saw this movie on Sci-Fi a while ago and it sucked. The acting sucked, the directing sucked and even the landscaped sucked- everything sucked. It's about this cult that attacks people and uses them as sacrifices to the devil. At least, I think that's what it's about, I could care less really. It's a movie full of flaws, bad acting and it's not even scary. It's just one of those movies that you will find at your movie store on DVD with a crappy cover, still there (no one rents it) with no good reviews on the front of it. I could go on and on about how much "Devil's Prey" sucked but then I would be wasting my time as I did when I watched this poor excuse for a horror movie. The blood is fake in this film as is the acting. Bottom line, don't watch "Devil's Prey".
