I had a dim memory of a movie I saw while very young in the 1970s about a computer called Colossus that tries to take over the world. I remembered only a few things about it: that it was out of human control, that it executes people, that it speaks through a very creepy spherical metallic speaker with a pre-Cylon computer voice, and that the movie SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME.<br /><br />So I recently buy the DVD, half expecting to be let down by my adult, cynical eyes. Fortunately, all the above-mentioned items are just as I remember them, and better, the rest of the film is well-done. The technical aspects of the story are questionable, as with all evil computer stories (ever hear of using wire-cutters, people?), but after reflection, not as questionable as I thought.<br /><br />The setup for the story is a new supercomputer created by one Dr. Forbin (Braeder) which is placed in complete control of the U.S. defenses, including nuclear missiles and anti-ballistic missile defenses. The computer soon detects that the Soviet Union has a similar machine and wants to connect with it. Forbin talks the president into allowing it, and things spiral out for control from there very quickly.<br /><br />Bu the best part of the movie is the moral of the story. Dr. Forbin, after activating his new computer, attends party at the White House and publicly states his wish that not only will his machine prevent war, but that it will also herald a new age of human advancement, in which famine and disease and pollution and overpopulation will be eliminated with the help of Colossus' vast computer power. Later in the film, Colossus offers EXACTLY these very things, much to Forbin's bitter disappointment.<br /><br />How many tyrants attain power promising these very things? "Give me unlimited power, and I will build a Utopian future! Along the way, many people may have to die, and you will lose your freedom, but in the end I will set it all to rights." The difference is that Colossus may very well be able to deliver on its promises, and this actually makes it MORE frightening than any bumbling human dictator. Human tyrants are driven by flawed ideology, thieves' greed, or psychotic motives, and they are guaranteed to die after a few decades, like any human. But Colossus' menace is its cold logic, lack of ideology, and it's ability to learn and survive almost without limit.<br /><br />Forbin, in his struggle to contain his creation, is joined by his fellow scientists, including the beautiful Dr. Markham (Susan Clark), a professional scientist. She adds immensely to the human side of this story.<br /><br />The film is timeless. The look of the 1970s technology may be dated, but it's appropriate for the Cold War era this film is a child of. If you are a sci-fi fan who likes to think instead of watching brain-numbing action, this film is definitely worth a look.
