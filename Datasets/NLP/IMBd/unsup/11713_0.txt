Irene Dunne and Cary Grant were wonderful together in this film as well as MY FAVORITE WIFE because the writing was so exceptional and the chemistry between them was terrific. Even though PENNY SERENADE (also starring the pair) was pretty depressing, it was also a quality film. I almost believe they could have told them to ad-lib together for 90 minutes and it would have been wonderful! I think part of the reason I liked the film so much is that both stars had a wonderful way with light comedy. This movie doesn't have a terribly complicated plot--a man and woman are divorcing even though down deep they are still in love. However, because of the chemistry, writing and excellent direction, it's almost magical. See this film, then see MY FAVORITE WIFE--they'll satisfy nearly anyone.<br /><br />So, if the film was so good, why didn't I score it higher? Well, the bottom line is that for Cary Grant he made a few other comedies that WERE better (ARSENIC AND OLD LACE and BRINGING UP BABY). Plus, the movie is so similar to MY FAVORITE WIFE--another Grant and Dunn comedy.<br /><br />By the way, a couple things to look for: Yes, the dog "Mr. Smith" is the same dog that is "Asta" in the THIN MAN movies. Also, as usual, Ralph Bellamy DOES once again play the boyfriend who is destined to lose the girl (Irene Dunn). Just like in countless other movies, Bellamy is inexplicably left bride-less by the end of the movie (as in HIS GIRL Friday and HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE among others). Third, this film seems to have possibly been the inspiration for the later Hitchcock film, MR. AND MRS. SMITH. If not, then at least they have a lot of similarities--intentional or not.
