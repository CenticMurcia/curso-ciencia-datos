Sisters of death is an awful movie. Save yourself some money and buy something different. I learned the hard way and bought it and it sucks. There's not one scary part in the whole film, and it drags on and on. Sisters of death is definitely one that will put you to sleep. Save yourself the trouble and forget about this movie. I read about the movie before I bought it and it sounded really good, I am a horror movie fan by far, but this movie is a bomb. Steer clear of this film. Bad, bad, bad, and more bad. This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. It should have been named Sisters of Talk , because thats all that happens.
