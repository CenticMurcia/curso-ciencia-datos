The acting in this movie was so bad, especially with the killer. When he came charging at them at the end on the ATV, I was laughing so hard, my side hurt. They could not create a parody of this movie and have it be any funnier. I pride myself on seeing really bad films, but even this one hits a new low. Not even worth the bargain bin. What a waste of film and time. I hope they never work again. The only thing scary about this movie is if someone was duped to seeing it at a theater. The only thing that scares me is if they make a sequel. I can't believe they were able to gather together so my people that lack any talent. Just... bad.
