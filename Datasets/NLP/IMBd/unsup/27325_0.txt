VD is a convict, who escapes from a jail bus & then helps Rosanna arquette. Her land is about 2 be destroyed by Joss Ackland. He's old-lol. Well, VD fights off some bad guys who try 2 terrorize Arquette & her 2 kids. VD also gets beat up by a cop & 1 scene, he opens show curtain & see VD showering, what a gay cop. VD gets taken care of by Arquette which leads 2 of them having uh, sex. This is a pretty good movie, but it doesn't show his martial art skills like Bloodsport. a must see.
