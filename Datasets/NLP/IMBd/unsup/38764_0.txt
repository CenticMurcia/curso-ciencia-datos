I just didn't like this one, not a lot to be entertained by. It centers around a main character that is holding his balance between having bad luck and just being stupid. Most of the events are difficult to believe because there's no possible way this guy can't figure out the situation. But there you have it, he can't. The atmosphere tries to be grim, but it really steers more towards boring. Then we have the psychological approach, because our hero is usually alone. You usually get to know a movie character best when he's alone. Either way, all these scenes just seem really art-house, let's just film him doing some everyday thing and hopefully it will look smart. It's not about the plot, but the plot is so weak. And if you really want to make the viewer think he's intelligent you should just get rid of the story all together and randomly edit in shots of a wheelbarrow or whatever. Either way, this was pretty disappointing, whatever point it was trying to make. Worst thing probably is that I didn't care about the main character. I just didn't care, that made it difficult to watch.
