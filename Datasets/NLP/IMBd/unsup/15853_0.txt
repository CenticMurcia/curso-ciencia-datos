I can't say enough about how wonderful I think this film, and the TV series is. It is just so incredibly FUNNY! All your fave characters are in it - Hedges, played by John Alderton is as gorgeous as ever (yes, I do like him!), Potter the caretaker is played by the hilarious Deryck Guyler and the hopeless headmaster Cromwell is played by Noel Howlett. Not forgetting the pupils of 5C of course! This is a must for all fans of the show, and it explains how Bernard met Penny for the first time. All teachers must watch this film! EVERYONE must watch this film!
