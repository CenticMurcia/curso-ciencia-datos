Being a horror movie buff, I tried really hard to like this movie but it was awful. The characters were cardboard, I didn't care about any of them. There was no suspense, no scares, and nothing to keep your interest. I found myself yawning and looking at the clock. <br /><br />The one character I did enjoy was the Aunt played by Sandy Dennis. She is so wacky, I loved her dialog. But she can't save this abomination of a movie.<br /><br />The spiders scene was the only scene that showed potential, but even that was color by numbers. There was absolutely nothing original in this film.<br /><br />The climax of the movie was as laughable as a soap opera and just as stupid. Even watching with an open mind and checking your brain at the door will not help this clunker.<br /><br />Don't even bother renting this stinker of a movie.
