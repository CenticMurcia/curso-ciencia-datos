I was fortunate enough to catch this powerful documentary at the 2004 Hotdocs festival in TO. The film was shot over a period of ten years from 1992 to 2002, and follows a group of Palestinian children as they grow up and turn to violence to guard their refugee camp.<br /><br />Go see this movie if given the chance. It provides a rare and refreshingly caring glimpse into the personal lives of people usually portrayed as terrorists and monsters. The movie works especially well because the director has a personal relationship with the kids-turned-fighters in the film.<br /><br />This is not self-indulgent "stick it to the man" left wing propaganda; it's one of the most human films you'll ever see regardless of your political views.<br /><br />Peace.
