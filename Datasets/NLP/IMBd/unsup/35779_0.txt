Well, if you have nothing yo do... you can rent this movie and watch it for fun. This movie is one of those movies that we heard in jokes, it's so bad that in the end is funny. The "special effects" are not what they called, the story is too predictable and the actors... well, you may see it. I saw this movie in video club, I rented and my first thought was: "oh, this must be a special edition in DVD of an old movie" and then you check the box of it and it says that this movie was made in 2003. If you see the clothes, cars and the TERRIBLE (in both senses) snow that seems more like spheres made of paper; you think that if I were the director I'd prefer to do no movie, instead of make this thing. But after all, I must admit it, I have a lot of fun watching it, I suggest that the genre Comedy appears on this screen.
