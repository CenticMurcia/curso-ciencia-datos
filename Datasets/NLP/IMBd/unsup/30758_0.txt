This is a tawdry, cheap and offensive little movie that should have been strangled at birth. Not only an offense to the brilliant film it allegedly is a sequel to, but to anyone who might rent or watch it on that strength. Dismally acted, scripted and shot, it is one of the genuinely worst movies I have had the displeasure to see.
