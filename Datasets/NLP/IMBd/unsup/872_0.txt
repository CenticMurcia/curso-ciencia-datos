When many first see this film, they will be surprised when they notice that it is a silent film even though made in 1931. While Hollywood had just about completely switched over to talkies by 1929, several nations still produced silents well into the 1930s--among them France, Japan and China. You really can't hold this against the film, as the studios in China simply didn't have the equipment, money or know-how to make a talking picture.<br /><br />The story of the Peach Girl is rather familiar and I've seen several movies with very similar plots. A rich man falls for a poor girl but their marriage is forbidden. Despite this, the lovers consummate their love and the girl is soon pregnant. When discovered, she is cast out and the young man behaves horribly--only trying to correct his error when it is too late.<br /><br />Because the story is rather familiar (I have seen several variations on this story made in both Japan and China), it is very competently and beautifully done. In addition to lovely cinematography, the recent restoration features an exceptionally nice piano score that really suits the film well. A lovely late silent film.
