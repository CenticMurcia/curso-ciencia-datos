I saw this production in Rochester NY and thoroughly enjoyed it. The subject of the short showed creativity and innovation. It provided a humorous approach to different people's relationships and their perceptions of those relationships. Great idea for a topic and very well directed. This would be a terrific short to show on an airline flight. It would provide a great snippet of entertainment.
