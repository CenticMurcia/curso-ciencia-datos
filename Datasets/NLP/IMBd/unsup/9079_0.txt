Dr. Michael Hunter (the excellent actor and producer Andy Garcia) is a psychiatric traumatized by the suicide of his son. He is separated of his wife and his rebel teenager daughter lives with the mother. Barbara Wagner (Teri Polo) is her former student and now responsible in an orphanage for the teenager Tommy (Vincent Kartheiser), a boy traumatized by the death of his mother. Deep secrets will be revealed along this brilliant story. The plot starts as a drama, and as far as the characters reveal details about the real facts, the viewer gets more and more evolved by this surprisingly excellent psychological thriller. The story is very credible and realistic, the direction is tight and the performance of the cast is marvelous. Andy Garcia is the producer of this low budget, but excellent movie. A couple of months ago, I watched `The Man from Elysian Fields', also a low-budget good movie produced by him. Andy Garcia is selecting good screenplays for producing and revealing also an excellent producer. I regret the title of this movie in Brazil (`No Limite do Silêncio'  the translation would be `In the Limit of the Silence'). Do not ask me why, but in Brazil most of the movies have their titles changed. The distributors believe it makes the movie `more commercial'. The original title `The Unsaid' is perfect for the plot, but unfortunately, Brazilians have to deal with` In the Limit of the Silence'. This movie is highly recommended for lovers of a dense, dramatic and psychological thriller. My vote is eight.
