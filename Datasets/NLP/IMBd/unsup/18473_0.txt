I've seen all the adaptations of Jane Austen's most famous novel Pride and Prejudice and I have to say that this 1995 mini series by the BBC is by far the best. It has succeeded in so many levels. It excel in essentially every aspect. It is faithful to the book and the sincerity to the time and place is brilliantly thought out. The costume, sets and scenery are exquisite. The music and choreography are superb.<br /><br />The whole cast has a class I had never seen before. They deliver their lines with such passion and intelligence. Every single character is unforgettable. Colin Firth as Mr Darcy is perfect. He has the right strength of character. He is believable as a proud and yet good hearted Englishman. He showed just the right amount of emotion and yet he made the viewers understand his feelings.<br /><br />The whole film showed the wit and humour of Jane. It is truly a sparkling comedy of manners. I've seen the new movie and it has a depressing feel about it.<br /><br />The mini series is a must see.
