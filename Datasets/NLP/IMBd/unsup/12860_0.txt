Look, I admit that I am a sucker for pretty, witty women who can pull off being cute without overplaying it. So, it makes sense that I would love this movie. But, if you are tired of standard Hollywood fare where everyone is either Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock, then give this little movie a chance. Sure, it is designed to appear to the romantic in us, but what is wrong with that? Maybe we could use a little more romance and a little less cynicism these days.<br /><br />And I know that some people will struggle with the difficulty in believing that a woman who looks like the star of this film could fall in love with the men co-starring opposite her, but the fact that the men don't look like Hugh Grant is another thing that appeals to me. Even the star looks like a real person, hair a mess, little make-up, swollen eyes. But, without the Hollywood veneer, she is even more real, more lovable because she isn't perfect.<br /><br />Enough reading. Go watch the movie.
