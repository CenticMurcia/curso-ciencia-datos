We have to agree for the full 100 percent with Jesse from Australia: After about 30 minutes we stopped this.... Very poor audio, poor camera-work and very bad acting of some amateurs. And the dialog being out of sync, made things only worse. <br /><br />The quality of acting and sound made us sometimes think, it was an X-rated version of Dracula, where the explicit scenes were taken out. <br /><br />Jesse wrote that one should wait until somebody else is renting it or wait for the 2-Dollar-bin..... We don't think it is even worth it.... Just a waste of time. <br /><br />If you like this kind of movies, you better rent and see "Dracula 2000" with Gerard Butler, for example
