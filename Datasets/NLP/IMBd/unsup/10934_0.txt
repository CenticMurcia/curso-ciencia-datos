my 20 month old son loves footloose he first watched when he was 6 months old and now watches it 2-3 times a day its fantastic and dances every time its on and follows the steps that they perform he knows footloose is about to start as soon as the paramount picture comes up on the screen. i recently had to buy another copy of this movie as he had worn the first one out he also has a copy in his granddads van so he watch it whilst out.if there was ever a remake of this film I'm sure my son would love it just as much a the original one. i think it amazing that a film from the 80's can please a 20 month old baby it amazed me and my family and i hope he will continue to like it a long time yet
