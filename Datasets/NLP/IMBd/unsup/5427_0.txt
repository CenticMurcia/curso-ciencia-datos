When I heard about this film I thought that it was going to be a dumb porno about prostitutes or superficial like some other programs that I have seen that tried to tap into the true world of prostitutes. I decided to give it a chance because I knew and respected the work of the American actresses in the film. I felt that this movie was very artistically done and I loved the mixture of languages, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, Hungarian, English etc. This mixture of language displayed how widespread this profession is. In this movie a variety of prostitutes were shown from girls working with agencies, to girls working alone to girls trying to do porn. It also showed some of the male's perspectives of the business and their involvement. I especially liked how it touched on human trafficking and sex slaves because many people do not know that some prostitutes are forced into the profession. Overall an extremely well done movie.
