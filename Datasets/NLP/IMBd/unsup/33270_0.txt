Oh man, this movie is just so bad it's good. I bought this movie at f.y.e for a dollar, and it was worth it. It's a beat em' up action with a strange amount of porn, and just over the top kungfu. During the movie, it often seems like the actors mouths don't match to what their actually saying, (if you can call them actors) even know the movie is American. Sometimes I think this movie consists only of stunt doubles. The lead actor seems like he could be Fabio double, and the main 'bad guy' could easily be a Patrick Stuart look alike. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone with a good sense of humor, a love for kungfu action, and a dollar in their pocket, go buy this movie!
