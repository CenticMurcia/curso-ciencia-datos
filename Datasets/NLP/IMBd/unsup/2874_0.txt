Dustin Hoffman accomplished another great role as political comedian Lenny Bruce, whose comments always irked the establishment. Bruce truly paved the way for George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, and everyone such. Probably the best part was when he commented on the two gay teachers who'd gotten fired ("There was no situation where a kid came home saying 'We had five minutes of geography and ten minutes of c---sucking'.") Not surprisingly, they arrested him after that.<br /><br />I have to admit that I've actually never heard any of Lenny Bruce's albums (except for a few lines out of "The Sick Humor of Lenny Bruce"). But anyhow, "Lenny" is a masterpiece.
