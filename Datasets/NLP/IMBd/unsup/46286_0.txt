I want to ask Christopher Paolini : <br /><br />" How dare you ? How could you let such a disaster happen ? This movie, if you will call it that, contains absolutely nothing, not even a hush, of the world and lovely history and so on from your well told and thought, mysterious feelings......only the Names !!!!!!<br /><br />It should be a part of you and your soul. I am so down !!! Shame on you !!!"<br /><br />Did not Peter Jackson give the world an example how you should have to get such a stuff into an epic movie. <br /><br />Now it's only very fast and much too early produced and filmed only for MONEY !!!! And then...it isn't even good. I mean, there is nothing......nothing from the actors...nothing from the special effects.. and what do i care about the landscape if I don't find and feel any sign of the original story which i love ???<br /><br />If you compare for example, Saphira and Gollum. Saphira, as a character in the movie, has nothing to say what's good about.it's very bad animated.....horrible !!!!!!!!<br /><br />So on, I'm German, and therefore i can't any more describe with words what anger i feel and how much I'm disappointed.<br /><br />!!!! It's A CRIME !!!! <br /><br />Thank you for reading and i cant't imagine, even in my darkest dreams, that anyone, any damn person who read the books, could not be angry and disappointed about how such a great story is ruined, only for the money.
