I watch One Last Dance quite often since I purchased it. I get emotional when I watch the dance because it is so beautiful. I watch Patrick Swayze quite often and I am overwhelmed as to what all he can do. I think he is a very talented individual His wife is very talented, too. I am so glad they decided to put One Last Dance on the market because I have been trying to purchase it for quite a long time.The dancers in the film are very good, too. The story line is very emotional for me, too. I recommend this DVD to everyone I talk with about purchasing DVD's. I enjoy hearing Patrick sing--of course, I enjoy Patrick no matter what he does. The more I watch One Last Dance, the more I want to watch it. "Max" does an A-One Performance. I recommend everyone to get this One Last Dance.
