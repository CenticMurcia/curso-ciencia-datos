I started watching anime for real about 2 or 3 years ago and during this time I've managed to see around 10 different anime and at least 500 episodes. And I can defiantly say that this 13 episodes short anime is by far the best anime ever made. <br /><br />The only ones that come even a bit close to Elfen Lied are Death Note and Trinity Blood and those are almost even half as good. If it was possible I would probably give Elfen lied 15 out of 10 possible points.<br /><br />The only bad and sad thing about it is that it's, like I said before, only 13 episodes. I wish they would make more but I guess it would by now only ruin it.
