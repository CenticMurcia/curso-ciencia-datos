Rocky v has become somewhat of a curiosity to me. I read highly negative reviews for the film and expected a lame rehash of the first. I was very polarized by the moral messages it has. The film was far from perfect, and fell flat with the glum ending, so naturally, i was highly disappointed.<br /><br />Rocky loses his money and his boy begins to resent him. He moves back to the streets of Philly with Paulie and Adrian and begins to train a new fighter, Tommy Gunn. Tommy is bombarded by the press and agrees to fight professionally. He betrays Rocky and hurts Paulie. Thankfully Rocky kicks his ass.<br /><br />What i didn't like at all was the fact that rocky ended up where he started, with nothing to show for what he had achieved in the past. The film is astonishingly wrong headed<br /><br />This movie is different to the others, it has a different message, but its still the worst of the series.
