Damn this movie sucked, never in my lifetime have I been so angry and disappointed after wasting my time watching this piece of junk! It contains nothing but bad acting and a lot of awful effects! There is no plot at all in this movie and the things that the characters experience does not hang together at all. I cannot believe that anyone would rate this movie higher than rating it as awful (must be some kind of "sympathy act" if you choose to anyway). I seriously do not wish for anybody to waste money nor time on this movie.<br /><br />Damn this movie sucked, never in my lifetime have I been so angry and disappointed after wasting my time watching this piece of junk!
