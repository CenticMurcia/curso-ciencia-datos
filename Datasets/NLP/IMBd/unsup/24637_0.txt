I would be nice if the people who control the rights to the show, <br /><br />. remaster them and release all 97 episodes to DVD. <br /><br />. I found 95 of the episodes, but haven't found the "Th Bride" episode and another. <br /><br />. Outer Limits, <br /><br />. Twilight Zone, <br /><br />. One Step Beyond, <br /><br />. The Inner Sanctum <br /><br />were the shows to watch for sci-fi, horror on TV as a kid. <br /><br />. All of the programs, not only entertained but also made you think, dream and look at the world, thinking of the future.
