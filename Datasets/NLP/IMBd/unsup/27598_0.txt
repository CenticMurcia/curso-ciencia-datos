I just saw this movie it was like a timemachine, I was back in the 80's. That was positive. The movie has the same charm and humor as in the first Dundee. So if you like Crocodile Dundee you must see this movie.. this is a good oldfashioned movie without any big special effects. See it...<br /><br />
