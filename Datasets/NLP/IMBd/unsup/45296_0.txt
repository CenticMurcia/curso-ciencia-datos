Do not believe the reviewers who write that this is "overall, not a bad film." This IS a bad film...a very bad film. The only reason I gave it even two stars is that it has some intriguing scenes with FFM, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />To begin with, the first few scenes appear to have been grafted on to the rest of the film. Why is everybody doing a Broadway show around the transport craft? (And shouldn't they get out of there when the airlock is opened to launch the ship?) Why does HK off his buddy and take his place? Hey, don't you think you ought to fasten your cargo down with straps or something before you zoom off and become weightless? <br /><br />After that, it gets really bad. KD and FFM are having a little May-December romance at the hydroponics research station, which is inexplicably unmanned except for them. (not that they actually do any research...they're too busy running around in lingerie, taking showers together, and flashing butts. And that's just KD.) Looks like a pretty sweet life to me...Earth is going to hell, but they just keep subsidizing this silly research station so KD and FFM can enjoy themselves.<br /><br />Then Satan comes...HK with his big buddy, Hector the Robot. Hector is one of the new demigod-series robots, but he looks more like a demitasse-series. He is a big old goofball. He's never even threatening.<br /><br />But that's enough of all this. Bad FX, bad script, no believability, OK musical score, and dumb plot. Don't waste any chance you have to miss this.
