I have read many reviews of this movie that state that it is not good.<br /><br />IT IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE.<br /><br />Comparing it to other movies that are not in its genre is an unfair comparison. It's apples to oranges. You must compare this movie to other movies of its genre.<br /><br />It's cute, action-packed, exciting, has a plausible story line, beautiful lead actresses, quirky characters (and each main character has a focused personality, not just shied upon), great cinematography, great editing, great directing. And it's set in New York City. What more could you want?<br /><br />IT IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE.
