This game is pretty good, but I liked both Call of Duty 2's better. But this was still a good game. The only thing that I think is bad about it is that there only 13 levels. In Call of Duty, there were 27, and in Call of Duty: Big Red One, there were 14. I would have given this a ten, but I took one star off for that. I also took one star off because at first, the levels seem like they are long, but after you play them for a while, you start to get bored and you realize that the levels aren't that long. I took another star off for that. But the rest of the game is pretty good. It has a really good story that follows the campaign that followed D-Day, and the battles through France between the Americans, British, Scottish, French, Polish, and Canadians against the Germans. It's a pretty good game that, I thought, was kind of a sad ending. Another good thing about it is that instead of fighting and finishing one campaign at a time, you switch off between missions between factions. This was a pretty good game. 8/10.
