Having read many of the reviews on this site I have noticed that numerous people claim that one either understands and loves the movie, or hates it. I happen to fall into the latter category as this movie is not only unorigonal, but fails to be funny in almost every way possible. The fact that this film could even use the line "Mime's a wasting" shows the low class of the film. Personally, I love dumb comedy movies (Adam Sandler and Chris Farley included) but this film failed to be funny on almost every level. I did not laugh once, and didn't even appreciate any of the jokes' attempts to be funny. The only scenes worth watching are the ones mentioned previously by RedDevil, whom I happened to view the film with.<br /><br />Many have commented that this is a dark comedy that deals with alcoholism, however I have two major points to make contrary to this. First of all, this film is by no means a comedy if you use the standard definition of comedy. This definition of course is something that is funny. Secondly, this film does not deal with alcoholism well at all. After seeing this I felt no need to stop drinking, unlike the scenes in Requiem for a Dream. Overall, this project not only lacks polish, but ambition as well. The plot is useless and I couldn't help feeling that the movie made no point. I would like the 87 minutes of my life back, but seeing as that is impossible, I would like to keep anyone else from viewing this shoddy workmanship.
