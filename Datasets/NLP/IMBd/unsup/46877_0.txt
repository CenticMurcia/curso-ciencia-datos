I thought Moore's Bowling for Columbine was brilliant, but Fahrenehit 9/11 was a little too much propaganda (although he hit some heavy notes such as the failure of the media, corporate irresponsibility and class-ism) for me. This movie, however, is more of a far-right conservatives response to intellectuals' claims against right-wingism. What has been happening, particularly most recently, is that academics and others such as liberals have been holding up a mirror to conservative America and conservative America doesn't like what they see, so they try to shift the blame on liberalism by screaming anti-patriotism. I don't think Moore hates America, I think he hates corruption. I remember at the end of Bowling for Columbine he said something along the lines, "I think as Americans we're better than that" regarding gun violence. I don't think this man hates America, he just doesn't roll himself in the flag before he goes to sleep every night. Criticism against a government or politician doesn't constitute anti-patriotism or hatred for one's country, except in fascism. This movie simply set out to hate liberals and charge them for anti-Americanism instead of presenting issues logically and coherently. What is most unique is that when I voted on this movie, the most votes were 10s and 1s. Something like 36% said 10 and 39% said 1, with small percentages in between. More polarization adding to the continual decline of the United States.
