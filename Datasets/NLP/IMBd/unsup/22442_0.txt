A strange collision of film-noir, performance art and Sirkian melodrama, Singapore Sling is an absolute must for fans of extreme film-making. The film tells the story of a wounded Sam Spade-like detective captured by two women he's investigating and becomes coerced into participating in their disturbing torture games.<br /><br />Although the vomit and cruelty get a bit much, the most haunting aspect of the film are the strange, surreal monologues presented by both women during the course of events. Their performances are so off kilter and deranged that it would be virtually impossible not to feel like your skin is trying to crawl away.<br /><br />The cinematography is shimmering black and white with Greg Toland inspired deep focus. It's not hard to believe that this may be one of the most aesthetically beautiful films ever.<br /><br />The film isn't really 'gory', but it's very upsetting and totally confrontational. An adaption of an avant-garde Greek play, the film can feel stagey sometimes, but as mentioned above, it's exceptionally cinematic.<br /><br />Watch it with someone you love or shiver alone!!!
