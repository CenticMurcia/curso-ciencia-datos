The original Scooby Doo cartoons were silly and predictable but had a certain charm and colour which has endeared them to a generation of kids. A later series added Scrappy who was the most irritating cartoon character before the intentionally irritating Poochie in the Simpsons. Scrappy's contribution to this shocker is him pointlessly urinating on Thelma (obviously no one house trained him) at which point this tiresome character is dropped out of the mystery machine.<br /><br />Don't worry though there's plenty more tiresome characters where he came from.<br /><br />Extremely juvenile comedy with a lot of knowing postmodern irony topped off with over the top cgi monsters. The original poorly drawn cartoon looks positively sublime and subtle by comparison.<br /><br />Avoid.
