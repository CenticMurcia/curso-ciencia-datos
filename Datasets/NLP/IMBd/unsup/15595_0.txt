William Powell and Myrna Loy were paired together in 14 films. Most notably, "The Thin Man" series stands out, but a little lesser known film, "I Love You, Again", is a gem of a comedy, and the two stars shine brightly.<br /><br />Larry Wilson (Powell)while saving a stranger's life, receives a blow on the head. This makes him "wake up" from suffering amnesia. In reality, he is George Carey, con man. It seems that nine years earlier, Carey received a blow to the head, which turned him into Wilson.<br /><br />During those "missing" nine years, Wilson has married Kay (Myrna Loy), worked as the manager of a pottery manufacturer, and been nothing but a cheap, teetotalling, boor, whom everyone in a sleepy Pennsylvania town loves. Except for Kay. She has grown tired of Wilson and wants a divorce.<br /><br />This scenario is given to you in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, and it's off to the races in this delightful comedy.<br /><br />Of course it's ridiculous, and of course, everything works out in the end. But who cares, Powell and Loy are superb, and that's all we really care about. Myrna Loy will break your heart with her beauty and grace, and that little up-turned nose. Powell is utterly charming as Carey, and hysterical as Wilson. They are the ultimate dream team.<br /><br />Expertly directed by W.S. Van Dyke II, with great support from Frank McHugh, Edmund Lowe and Donald Douglas (in what could be called the "Ralph Bellamy" part).<br /><br />8 out of 10 stars
