Okay aside the video was pretty bad a number of other things is way wrong with this undersea Turkey. One, it's a complete rip off of other sea going monster movies, the creature design is almost total rip off of WAR-LORDS FROM THE DEEP, the basic premise is a rip of CREATURE OF THE BLACK LAGOON and near the end the creature changes his pattern and rapes the Mayor's daughter, that's HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP. Another thing that made no sense is why? Why did the Aquanoids stop for 16 years? Another thing is the Mayor, a corrupt Mayor wouldn't be running around shooting people, that's what Thugs are for. Plus, they kill the Aquanoids and the Mayor tries to kill them anyway, HELLO! The evidence went boom into a billion pieces, there was no need for that. Plus when the Deputy kills the Mayor saving Venessa's life, he's arrested. He's a deputy, the Mayor had a gun, he had the right to do it. This is just stupid and a waste of time! Don't bother, I give it the NOOSE!
