This is by far the worst Dennis Hopper movie ever put to film. The chicks in it were nasty, the guys in it could not act, and the story was weak as it could be. The only reason I bought it was because it was on sale for $5 at our grocery store. I feel that they should give me $20 for suffering through it. Stay away from this. I am sure that it is historically accurate, and if so these were the dumbest saboteurs in all of history. Not to mention the director, and producer. I hope Dennis fired his agent after making this T@RD.<br /><br />I could go on and on about this waste of film, but It simply bores me. IMDb is comparing this to "The Count of Monte Cristo" Have they lost their minds. The count is a classic tale of revenge and determination. The "Inside Man" just sucks.
