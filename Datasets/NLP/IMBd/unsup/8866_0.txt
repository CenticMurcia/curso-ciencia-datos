Foyle's War is unique in it's blending of history and fiction. I just finished watching a special feature that filmed the stunt preparation for a spitfire crash in "Enemy Fire". I am amazed at the thought and detail that go into making these films.<br /><br />This is one of the rare productions that makes you think 'outside the box'. Anthony Horowitz has really perfected his craft in putting together scripts,a cast and a crew that can carry off a challenge like this. The concept of a detective solving crimes during a war is in itself a thought-provoking basis for a series. The challenge of balancing right and wrong is integrally woven into each show, and I find myself thinking about moral dilemmas presented in each episode long after watching.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series for all ages.
