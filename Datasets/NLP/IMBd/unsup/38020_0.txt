A poorly written, directed, and acted fluff with a couple of laughs. Kirstie Alley supplies the film's only electricity. It follows a rich New York couple evading the IRS, as they hide out in the home of an Amish family (a la Witness).<br /><br />The humor sprouts from your basic clash of cultures fare. The forced sentimentality is dredged up as the New Yorkers realize they may have something to learn from the Amish. Actually, a fairer treatment of the Amish than most films. However, why one of them has a French accent is beyond me.
