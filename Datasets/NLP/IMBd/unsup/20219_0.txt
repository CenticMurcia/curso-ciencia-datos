This film should go down in history as a "what the heck was the audience thinking?" kind of film. It is positively awful. I heard all about the Sundance award, the good reviews etc and like most people, went to see it thinking it would be great. It starts off okay but within about 10 minutes it turns into this music video that just never stops. The story is totally unclear, it's impossible to connect with the characters and the constant use of MTV techniques gets very tedious and boring very quickly. It's good to see filmmakers using different styles and modes of storytelling but the key words here are "tell a story". There is no story to this film, just a bunch of kids who crump to cool music and then talk about themselves for a few seconds and then crump again. It's relentless and annoying. A really poorly-made documentary.
