awful, i was forced to watch this unrealistic account of the events of 9/11 for part of my media course and by the end, i wanted to quit my media course and move to Tibet to become a Buddhist monk leaving behind what i believe to be the end of Western Civilization. The characters are unbelievably patriotic and wooden. Especially the man who tried to stand up to the terrorists in his unrealistic, calm, America idealistic manner and in return got stabbed, if i was on that plane and witnessed that, it wouldn't be the terrorists stabbing him, it would be me. Now in the real events i have researched what happened and found that poor man was stabbed without knowing what was going on. Now being an American production they felt the unnecessary need of presenting him as an American hero that stood up to the terrorists. It's pathetic, Americans once again trying to rewrite history so its looks as though they have gained a victory from the tragic events, you lost, accept it as a tragedy please.
