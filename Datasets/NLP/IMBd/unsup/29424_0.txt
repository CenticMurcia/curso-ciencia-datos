I must confess before you read this that I am truly a period costume freak, and this time period is one of my favourites.<br /><br />That out of the way, I still enjoyed this movie. In fact, I had avoided seeing it after it had screened, then after it was released on video... until my best friend and I decided to give it a whirl.<br /><br />I was NOT disappointed. I was even expecting to be disappointment, and was instead actually pleasantly surprised. Angelina and Antonio are both admirable actors and are not hard to look at either. Sure, it's got sex, love, period costumes and scandal... but so do a lot of other movies that aren't even half as well-made as this one. If you don't expect great things from this movie, if all you want is a decent story with some beautiful eye-candy, then this movie is great. You may even be enthralled like I was with the way the plot twists and turns, or how the power over someone is all in the mind... or the heart.<br /><br />Overall, give Original Sin some credit and the benefit of the doubt. It might surprise you.
