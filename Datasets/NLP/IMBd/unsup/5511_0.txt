I've been waiting to see this movie ever since it won several awards at various film festivals. Well, it was worth the wait! It's playing in theaters in just 3 cities so far, so make sure that you keep your eye out and catch it when it comes to your town. The other reviewers here give an idea about what the film is about, so I won't duplicate their efforts. I think that the consumer ratings (averaging 8.3 so far) let you know that this is a high quality product. It'll be interesting to see if Blue Hill Avenue gets any Academy Award nominations this year.
