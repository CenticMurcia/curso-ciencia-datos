This is a film that may have been groundbreaking in its time, but as the years go by, it's increasingly dated. The animation ranges from fairly sleek to scribbly; the stories range from gritty to juvenile. Although the use of sex, drugs and violence in animation was something new and controversial in '81, the thrill is gone. The viewer is left with the film's faults and what can serve best as a time capsule of violent Amazon spank-art.
