This is a really good made for TV movie. Daryl Hannah turns in a top rate performance. Direction is excellent. The pacing is fast and I never lost interest during the whole movie. There are good supporting performances all round particularly Peter Fleming as Mcall. This went out on TV3 Ireland January 2006, just the tonic for a dull winter's Friday night!. I noticed at the end that it was made in Canada. Usually what we get here from Canada is pretty awful but this one is superior in a whole lot of different departments. If it is low budget it never shows. There are lots of clever twists so anybody could be a bad guy! Watch out for this one!
