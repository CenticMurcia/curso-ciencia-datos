In 1992, BBC give us Ghostwatch which scared me and kids around the UK on Halloween. Then in 1998, I came across this film and was scared even more! I love all things about Aliens and this film wasn't a let down, in fact, it's amazing! It's pure horror and it's freaky to watch them all get taken one by one, I hid behind my pillow throughout the film! A lot of people call it cheesy and rubbish, but to me, it's great! I mean after Ghostwatch in 1992, which was a hoax too, but that doesn't matter. If it can scary you to death and make you believe it's real, it does it's job! So I hope to get this film on DVD very soon, it would be very welcome in my collection!
