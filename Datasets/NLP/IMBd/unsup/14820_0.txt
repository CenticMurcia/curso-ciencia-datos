I graduated from UT (Texas) with a degree in Biochemistry... I am familiar with DNA sequencing and testing (including forensics) and a couple of things bothered me about the premise of this movie: 1. DNA markers do not always transfer and may easily be lost over a few hundred years through interbreeding, (let alone thousands of years as they are testing in this film).<br /><br />You may have Celtic blood, but may be lacking some of their recessive DNA markers and only have Anglo-Saxon DNA markers because you had relatives in what is now England from 800 years ago.<br /><br />2. The film does not conform to the scientific method in the testing of their hypothesis (a group of peoples from the Eastern hemisphere traveling to the Americas and establishing a society)... in other words it is all opinion and proves only that there are Asian genetic markers found in what is left of the Native American population still surviving today.<br /><br />Assuming there even was a tribe at some point containing markers that would verify the claims of the Mormons, the majority of pure-blooded Native American tribes have completely vanished or died off. It is impossible to prove or disprove their claims through limited samples of DNA testing trying to find one (or maybe even several) tribe(s) from a thousand years ago. To really disprove the claims of the Mormons, you would need to test every tribe's blood since before the time of Christ, with a sufficient number of random samples to generate reliable statistical measures.<br /><br />Also... the movie is clearly biased based on the sponsor. Just because someone has a degree or is on T.V. doesn't make their claims holy writ.<br /><br />Take this movie with a grain of salt... it may be INTERESTING, but it is NOT PROOF in the least in terms of supporting or disproving the beliefs of the Mormons.<br /><br />If you want my personal opinion, it is a waste of time trying to disprove any religion. They are all unique and interesting and tell us all something about ourselves as a human race. It would do people well to learn more about the facts and beliefs of religions to further their own knowledge of the world and its many unique and wonderful cultures.
