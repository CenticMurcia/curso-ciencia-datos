i have seen a lot of bad movies. I'm serious - my friends and I make it a point to watch some crappy horror movies, and we have a heck of a time making fun of them. I thought that I had seen some of the worst of the worst - this film smacked me around and made me cry uncle.<br /><br />it has some of the worst production quality possible. it really seems like they made it a point to make a terrible movie. you know how in a lot of movies, there's always that one redneck a$$-backwards guy who says stupid things and a complete moron? take that guy, give him a camera, ten extras and ten dollars budget, and you get this movie...<br /><br />only worthwhile if you're seriously drunk and wasted, and even then, it's a questionable draw (and i rented it for free!)....
