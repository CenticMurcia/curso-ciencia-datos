I recognised a name or two in the cast, then I saw that it was a Hammer Horror film, so I thought it was worth at least a try. Basically a younger Victor Frankenstein (Ralph Bates, replacing Peter Cushing) is the misunderstood scientist, who is determined not just to study life and the human body, but make it. With the help of some grave robbers and his anatomical knowledge, he wants to create what could be the perfect human specimen. Of course the Monster (David Prowse, the man inside Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, replacing Sir Christopher Lee) created is an aggressive thing that obeys a few orders to get meaty rewards, but ultimately it is not a perfect specimen. Also starring Kate O'Mara as Alys, Graham James as Wilhelm Kassner, Veronica Carlson as Elizabeth Heiss and Bernard Archard as Prof. Heiss. This is supposed to be a remake to Hammer's original Curse of Frankenstein, it is not counted as the sixth in the series because of this fact, and because it is a little ridiculous. Adequate!
