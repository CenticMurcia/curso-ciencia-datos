TV flying movies usually have cardboard sets and phony shaking cameras and lame shots of wrong aircraft types. Not this one.<br /><br />As someone who remembers the true story this movie was based on, and as a private pilot I take off my hat. The story is a bit weak - what TV movie isn't? But the sense of fear one gets, trapped in the mountains, hurt, out of touch, beyond all help, freezing to death, is really exciting and I think accurate.<br /><br />The aviation sequences were amazingly detailed, true and well shot, way more than many big features, like Turbulence and Alive, both of which fell down in the accuracy departments. Good work.
