This was Dennis Potter's simplest TV play, drawn apparently from vivid memories of his childhood in the Forest of Dean during WW2. Successive productions though became increasingly elaborate, obscure and reflecting obsessions with his own disabling illness and young women largely as sex objects. His increasing reputation coincided with an Emporer's clothes syndrome where each offering became ritually hailed as a masterpiece.<br /><br />This is a faultless production where Potter's spot-on script and characterisations of a group of 12 year-olds are coupled to the novel but very successful device of having adults play children.<br /><br />It is a simple original dish made of the best ingredients and impeccably cooked. Something nobody can fail to fully enjoy and appreciate.
