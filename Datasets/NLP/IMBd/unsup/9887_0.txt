Michael J. Fox, Ed Begley,Jr and the legendary Kirk Douglas are ALL likable performers- no question about it. Too bad they're stuck playing TOTALLY despicable and UNlikable characters in this movie! After being introduced to one greedy, scheming relative after another for the zillionth time, WE GET IT! The love of money is EVIL-DUH! Even those characters the audience is *supposed* to think are likable (Fox's too-loyal girlfriend and principled hippie dad)fail to be. The girlfriend keeps threatening to leave Fox if he doesn't walk away from this mess- again and again. After the zillionth empty threat instead of thinking he's risking losing a good girl (like the script would want us to believe), I got the idea she was JUST as unprincipled and manipulative as the rest as she definitely STAYS to the end. Oh, and his dad was portrayed too much like a utopian hippy to be believable.<br /><br />I DO urge everyone who has the chance to watch the opening credits for the Late Jimmy Durante to sing his signature song of 'Inka Dinka Dinka Doo'! Durante definitely steals the show because he is the ONLY vaguely likable character in this whole movie! Yeah, Fox does a good imitation of Durante but is it worth going through the REST of the movie to see? I think not.
