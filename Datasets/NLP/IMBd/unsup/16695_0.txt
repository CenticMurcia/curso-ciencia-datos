This movie radiates with star power! Kevin Costner lights up the screen! Truly, he is a wonder to behold as the suspicious boyfriend! Oh, those eyes, burning with intensity...<br /><br />Okay, yeah, Costner's presence doesn't help this movie. But truth be told, nothing could. It's really the kind of movie you get when you put a bunch of people together who think they have what it takes to make a decent film, but don't.<br /><br />And while you might think this is regular slasher fare, I say nay! Though this has some slasher elements (i.e. a ski-masked killer and topless college girls), it's really a hackneyed detective thriller trying to disguise itself as a true blue horror flick.<br /><br />Detectives investigate as nubile young ladies are killed by a masked madman. Of course, preceding each kill sequence is a very leisurely-paced scene of the future victim getting down to her skivvies and beyond. The killings are sporadic and dull, failing to generate any kind of suspense or momentum.<br /><br />But wait, there's more. See, the victims all know each other. What's the connection to the killer? What is the murderer's maniacal motive? Will you be able to wait ninety minutes to find out? <br /><br />While it was compelling watching several young actresses disrobe for any and all reasons, the script, acting, cinematography, and direction were incompetent enough to make it hard to sit through.<br /><br />So as a suspense film, this doesn't cut the mustard. But if you want some softcore porn, and you're too embarrassed to go up to the video store counter with the real thing, this might fit the bill.
