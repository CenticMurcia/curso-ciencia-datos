Reading all the negative comments I wasn't gonna watch the film but with SMG in it I just had to. I was pretty surprised to say the least. It is a good film. It explores philosphical debates about the self, I, the void in your mind etc. the end message is excellent to all those who examine every second they exist: dont look inward at yourself; look outward at the world and enjoy its splender. The scene when Alan got real high on 3 hits of LSD was very funny. I just don't see what's so bad about this film. Its worth at least 6/10.
