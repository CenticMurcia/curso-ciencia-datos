I haven't got a clue why this film got such good reviews, especially in the press. It's a boring, irritating "film" in which nothing happens. The story is ludicrous: it centers around two ex-roommates/friends who meet again after six years. Their lives have changed, they've become more mature. We can see how they were years before, through a series of flash-backs.<br /><br />This is a film by Mike Leigh, who has been praised for making such strong character studies, in which the story is less important than the people. SECRETS AND LIES was in the same style and is maybe his best known film. Although this was also an uninteresting and cold film, it had something of a story in it. You got (in a certain way) a chance to know something about the characters. But this film is a total disaster. What did these actors for example eat: were they on speed or what? why did they act this way? The Ricky-character for example is good for a few unintended laughs , but I think the director told him to say whatever words came to his mind, so that he could mumble through the film.<br /><br />But the true uninteresting, even irritating characters are the main ones: the two girls. You never quite get to know them so you never get to care about them. The fact that they act as lunatics and talk the same way doesn't help either. It's almost impossible to understand the conversations, especially in the beginning. And what do they actually talk about? Does this have a meaning? The film is filled with such a stupid dialogue.<br /><br />I can't recommend this film to anyone. It's simply to dumb. And if you would choose to watch this film(and sit through it!), you got to ask yourself the question in the end: why in God's name do we need such a film? I dare you to watch it and tell me, cause I simply don't know what good these 90 minutes did to my life. 3/10
