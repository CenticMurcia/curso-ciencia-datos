Where to begin... This movie tries so hard to be dark and say something sarcastic about GenX kids that it abandons all attempts to explain itself. Note to filmmaker: Just because your movie is inexplicable doesn't mean it's profound.<br /><br />Some movies disturb you to catch your attention... not this one. Not that it's not disturbing--it is--but it just never holds your attention with any of this. Chances are you'll be bored watching this movie, even with a slew of sex scenes and a decapitation.<br /><br />James Duval's confused looks and line delivery invite comparison to Keanu Reeves. Rose McGowan's lines are not only unfunny but increasingly irritating as the movie goes on. The best parts of the movie are the cameos by Skinny Puppy and Perry Farrell...<br /><br />The best way to watch this movie would be with a bunch of sarcastic friends. The more you rip it apart and laugh at its attempts at drama, the more you'll enjoy it.
