'Kejar Amerika' interestingly got a share of good comments from IMDb users. Funny because for a movie that didn't get a theatrical release in Indonesia (that's saying something because they put anything on theaters here as long as it has picture and sound), some people who admitted to be scholars even had time to write long comments on it.<br /><br />I saw this at its first screening (with many walks-out). The movie was jaw-droppingly bad. Technically-inept with a direction that could have come from a 13 year-old. The acting is embarrassingly awful with a convoluted, super-dumb plot that only managed to create some unintentional giggles for the first five minutes, until it becomes a total boredom. Clearly written by someone who doesn't speak Indonesian because the dialogues do not make much sense. <br /><br />How's this for a story: an Indonesian boy whose biggest dream is going to the U.S. won a lucky draw from a soft drink company to go to California. Well, actually the bad guy arranged his winning, so they can smuggle a paper containing a formula for a powerful drug in his back pack. Why don't they just e-mail the goddamn formula?<br /><br />The rest of the story is just an excuse for over-acting and director Sungkar's ambition to make a movie. Sungkar is Canadian and he probably thought Indonesian audience are very stupid to swallow his movie. Well, guess the audience are smarter than he thought.<br /><br />Avoid at any cost. This is no excuse for low budget film-making. This is simply unwatchable crap.
