Simply put, this movie is awful! IT has nothing to do at all with the first movie, and lacks a plot- and a heartbeat for that matter. The first Pet Sematary is truly a classic and Stephen King would let Gage Saw his achilles' tendon (as he did to Jud) if he saw this god-awful sequel.<br /><br />SKIP IT!! 3/10 (riding on a good effort by Furlong)
