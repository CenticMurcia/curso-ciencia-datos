Not the greatest by any means; but decent for a low end budget horror flick. Sheriff Berger(Robert Englund)watches a vicious serial killer named Chambers(James Brinkley)die in the electric chair...twice. At a going out of business hospital morgue, Chambers arises and does his thing...rip the heart out of the doctor doing the autopsy. Two young patients, Sara(Merideth Henderson) and Walter(Nathan Stephenson)struggle to stay alive as the hospital soon fills with blood. The ruthless killer makes it proof positive that he relies on souls of others to survive.<br /><br />Henderson out acts Englund in this creep thriller. Also in the cast: Laura DeCarteret, Michael Cram and Lori Hallier. HEARTSTOPPER does have some special effects that neither makes or breaks this bad scary movie.
