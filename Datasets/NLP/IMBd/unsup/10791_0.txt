PANDORA'S PARADOX is a great film that crawls under your skin without the help of dialogue. It uses the universal visual language of cinema to tell a tale of secret desires, control, manipulation, death and rebirth. Good and evil are not portrayed as opposing values, but as the reflection of each other, bouncing over Matthew Saliba's carefully developed characters. For the viewer, the film feels like it's 10 minutes long. If I judge by its reception at the Fantasia International Film Festival, film goers love it. Matthew Saliba is a talented filmmaker and I hope he will continue exploring symbolism and metaphors in cinema and continue to develop his unique style. His blend of personal, yet universal issues and crude (in your face) treatment with wild, creative imagination is not ordinary fare. This makes him an extraordinary filmmaker.
