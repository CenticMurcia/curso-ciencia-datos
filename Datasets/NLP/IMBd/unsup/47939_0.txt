This movie is a victim of its own hype and clever editing on the trailers. There are several reasons why this movie doesn't work, although it did have potential. The first reason: The Army isn't retarded. They are portrayed as cro-magnonesque, flying 2 Raptors in to fire on the GORT which ultimately fails, leaving someone whom we are assumed to be in command saying to an airplane hangar full of troops "Anybody else got any ideas?" Secondly, the military would be in charge, and there would be much more collusion between department heads then led to believe. Kathy Bates, who gave an average performance (probably not her fault, her script was bland) is the Secretary of State, and seemingly the Secretary of Earth, as none of the other world leaders are even involved. Instead of world leaders, we have Jennifer Connelly, an astrobiologist, calling the shots. It isn't really plausible that the US military would allow a civilian to be the first contact for alien visitors.<br /><br />Acting was....OK. Jayden Smith needs a little work, but again his script was pretty poor, as is the editing with some cutaways with him and Klattu. Keanu was a pleasant surprise, as he looked and acted as stoic and un-feeling as possible, and did it well. Jennifer Connelly held her own, but wasn't fantastic.<br /><br />The end of the movie is abrupt and anticlimactic. There seems to be a reason that this was released in the winter, as it didn't have the punch to be a summer action blockbuster. 4/10.
