I was just an ordinary guy who had no special interest in cinema. This film first shook me with its great music, which I later realized as being a classic move by Ozon, then with its setting and ending. These were things that you can't find in standard Hollywood products.<br /><br />I have a special place in my heart for this film, and I know that it is not possibly a 10/10 quality film, which is the "Seventh Seal" of Bergman for me, but "Swimming Pool" is a really good place to start your journey into the real world of cinema. You will understand what a "lost teenager/generation" means and how this term is dramatically different from the standard youth in American films.<br /><br />It also doesn't contain the weird storytelling that many French films have. This means that you will watch an actual story where things really proceed. If you want to see what I mean, you can try another Ozon film, "Under the Sand", after this one. Charlotte Rampling is also present in that one but I can honestly say that actually nothing "happens" in the film.
