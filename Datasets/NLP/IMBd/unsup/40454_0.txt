Dice Rules- Zero Stars I was about to write my review of Dice Rules, I couldn't come up with anything to write. This movies was very ugly and terrible. What was Andrew Dice Clay thinking when he decided to film this inexcusable piece of garbage. The first thirty minutes of the film is nothing but pointless "comedy" sketches which makes Eddie Murphy's Raw opening sketch look like Casablanca and thats a good thing. There is nothing funny about viewing women as sexual objects. Fear of women is common for Clay. Word of advice, keep it secret and don't exploit are minds with it. Now the MPAA gives the NC-17 rating to movies that don't deserve them like Last Tango In Paris and Y Tu Mama Tambien but Dice Rules deserves that rating and I hope the MPAA doesn't change their minds about it. This movie is sick twisted and one of the worst movies of the 1990's.
