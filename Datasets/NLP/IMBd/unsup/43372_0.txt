This is an unfortunate film that was, unfortunately, made. When the great Peter Sellers died, the PP series should have died, too. The Pink Panthers were absolutely tied to Clouseau. However, the greedy Blake Edwards tried to go to the well again and the result is this travesty. There are no words to describe how bad this film is. This is an unfortunate end to the PP series of films but at least Edwards didn't try another one. I wish he hadn't tried this one.
