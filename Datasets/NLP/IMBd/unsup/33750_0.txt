This movie was disgusting and an absolute waste of Linda Manz's acting abilities. It was dark, the plot stupid, and the sad thing is that due to a sociology project in college I've OWNED this piece of trash for fifteen years. The only reason I've never pitched it is because there's very little with Linda Manz in it to begin with. I do not know what the writer's were thinking (and speaking as a published author, I don't think I WANT to) and one would assume that Dennis Hopper, having now attained a modicum of respectability will never lay claim to this piece again. In fact, I'm surprised he's never demanded to be removed from its credits.<br /><br />I find it disturbing that anyone would rate this movie a ten. Bad lighting, pathetic support casting, and an obvious underlying tone of incest does not a good movie make. In fact, anyone who dared to give this movie a ten should watch it again and then spend a week in the incest recovery unit of their local hospital. . . I can guarantee they won't see much of a difference.
