This movie was quite disappointing. I sat down, ready to watch the last Peter Sellers Pink Panther, and got a retrospective with a throwaway plot pieced together from outtakes and non-Sellers moments introducing well-known clips. I should have stopped the tape when Somebody takes the Pink Panther without even tripping one alarm.<br /><br />What starts out as a movie funny enough to watch, even if the plot seemed a little overdone, screeches to a halt as soon as Clouseau's plane vanishes. The closest anybody comes to trying to solve the mystery is the scene when the reporter is threatened by the mob boss. Otherwise, it's just a retrospective.<br /><br />I was getting the feeling the movie wasn't going to move before David Niven's character (dubbed badly and most distractingly) made those comments about how the world needed men like Clouseau, etc, etc, indestructible... yawn. From there on, with the exception of Clouseau's youth flashbacks, the only great laughs came from clips pillaged from other movies.<br /><br />This movie's comedy leans heavily on Dreyfus' new relapse, a subplot that was getting tired ever since they disintegrated him in "Strikes Back" Just when it seems that the movie is going to start moving again, it does. To the credits. Clouseau is not found, that is a mystery for the next movie to solve.<br /><br />Peppered with characters I never thought or cared to see again, (Colonel Sharky, et al) the plot is shaky if even near-nonexistent. This documentary laughingly called a movie gets a four only for the top-notch job editing together cut scenes into enough plot to get the audience to stay for the other sixty minutes. Don't waste your time on this movie more than once.
