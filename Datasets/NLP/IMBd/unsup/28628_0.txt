I rented this and i thought: "oh, this looks like a nice action flick!", as i took this from the shelf.<br /><br />Damn, i was so wrong.<br /><br />It's got some mediocre action scenes, annoying actors with annoying voices, a Vinnie Jones totally out of shape and A LOT of "clever" comments by just about everyone. I suggest you go and check out "Man on Fire" instead. There we have a movie that's worth mentioning, as opposed to this one.<br /><br />I'm no good at writing reviews, so you'll just have to see it for yourselves. Such a mess.<br /><br />4/10
