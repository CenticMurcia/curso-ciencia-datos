The movie wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be. I Mean i went in thinking it was going to be the worst thing ever but the cast was pretty entertaining. It was just so damn boring and there was nothing scary about it. It could have been such a better movie if they didn't do anything but talk and scream the whole damn time. And you never quite know what they are screaming about! They didn't even show how anyone died. And the ending....so what exactly happened to Carmen? Are we supposed to guess? I can't believe i even watched it to the end. I seriously fast forwarded through the scenes to actually see where it was going and it seemed like i was fast forwarding through the same thing over and over. All they did was scream and shout which was pretty annoying! And the lesbians were driving me nuts! They kept touching each other.It was so annoying. I mean don't get me wrong i have nothing against lesbians since i myself am bi, but you don't have to be touching your girlfriend every 5 secs. And it wasn't even like sexual or anything. Plus one of the girls Spanish was so thick you could hardly understand her. Not to mention the only time they didn't touch was when you wanted them to! It was a waste of time but it just irks me that this had potential if you actually had a plot.
