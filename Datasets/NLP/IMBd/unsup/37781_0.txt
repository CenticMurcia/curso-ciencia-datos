I'm a sucker for gross-out splatter flicks, or over-the-top horror of any kind, so I end up watching a lot movies I later wish I hadn't wasted the time on. Such a movie is Heartstopper. An over-the-hill Robert Englund heads the rest of the no-name cast, playing a sheriff who watches a serial killer fry in the chair. Englund sends him to a hospital morgue where the killer, possessed of some kinda demonic power, comes back to life with an urge to rip out hearts. Englund is killed by minute 30 or so in the film, but he only has about 10 minutes face time with the viewer. I guess he made his money and left. There is absolutely no plot, no drama and no thrills in this flick, not to mention zero acting, and we are subjected to a series of about 6 or 7 heart ripping scenes for about 85 minutes. If this is enough to make you want to watch this movie, have at it.
