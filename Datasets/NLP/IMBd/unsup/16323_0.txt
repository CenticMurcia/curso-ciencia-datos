I've always found it neat when classic cartoons play famous songs to move the action along, and Friz Freleng's "Rhapsody in Rivets" adds to that. This is one of the many instances* (it may have been the first one, in fact) where they play Franz Liszt's inimitable "Hungarian Rhapsody #2". In this case, a construction foreman conducts/instructs the builders to that tune as they erect a skyscraper...with a surprise at the end.<br /><br />The Academy's decision to not give this cartoon an Oscar was matched only by their decision to not give "The Shawshank Redemption" any Oscars. It's one of the all-time classics and one that I recommend to everyone. Among other things, it goes to show that a cartoon doesn't need dialog to be great; as a matter of fact, that makes it easier for people in other countries to understand. Available as a special feature on "The Bride Came C.O.D." DVD.<br /><br />*Other Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons that play that song are "Rhapsody Rabbit", "Back Alley Oproar", "Wise Quackers" and "What's Up, Doc?". Many years later, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck played it in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit".
