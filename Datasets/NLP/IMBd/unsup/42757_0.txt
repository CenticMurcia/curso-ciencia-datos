Starting out like one of the Hollywood Star caricature cartoons like 'The Coo-Coo Nut Grove' or 'Hollywood Steps Out', 'Slick Hare' quickly distinguishes itself by injecting Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny in amongst the other famous faces. These cartoons are mostly recommended for movie buffs who will still recognise the stars being parodied (here they include the Marx Brothers, Carmen Miranda, Ray Milland, Frank Sinatra and Humphrey Bogart) but 'Slick Hare' offers a chase between Bugs and Elmer for anyone not interested in celebrity spotting. The combination of these two elements doesn't really work that well, the caricature routines slowing down the action whenever it threatens to get going (culminating in a tedious, overlong dance routine from Carmen Miranda and Bugs). A further problem is that the central chase is quite uninspired, with only a scene in which Bugs orders pies and then puts them in Elmer's face really standing out. Bugs also seems excessively brash and obnoxious in this cartoon, from his loud "Am I the first to arrive" routine at the beginning of the cartoon to his frenzied cat-calling at the end. All in all, 'Slick Hare' is a lumpy and jarring experiment gone wrong.
