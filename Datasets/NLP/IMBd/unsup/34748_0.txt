If you just want to watch a sappy horse story, okay, this movie is one. But if you think you are going to see a movie based on Mary O'Hara's book, you will be sorely disappointed and disgusted. There was absolutely no reason to 'update' the story. Mary O'Hara would 'turn over in her grave' if she'd been forced to watch this travesty. It is not 'true' to the book. It is NOTHING like the book. The original movie "My Friend Flicka" starring Roddy McDowall, Foster Preston, etc. is far far far better a movie.<br /><br />You should rent it, you'll see what I mean. Better yet, actually READ the book, since apparently you did not if you think THIS movie is 'true' to the book.
