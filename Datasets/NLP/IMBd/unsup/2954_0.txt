I love comedy mixed with horror/drama movies, such as Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness, Dr. Strangelove, Love and a .45, etc. But this movie ....... SUCKED!!! I got my poor wife excited into watching a great, funny horror movie, "Better than Shaun of the Dead," which we loved, and after 45 minutes she got up and quietly walked away and left me to watch it alone. I just fast forwarded it and didn't even bother watching the accompanying short movie.<br /><br />I feel like finding out who the reviewer on the CD cover was that said it's "Better than Shaun of the Dead." That's the reason I rented it. I want to tell him that he's an idiot.
