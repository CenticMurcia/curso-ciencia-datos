1933's "Double Harness" is a precoder based on a play of the same name. Before playwrights like Clifford Odets championed the working man, plays dealt with the upper class, as does "Double Harness." William Powell is John Fletcher, a committed playboy, and Ann Harding is Joan Colby, who believes marriage is a business. She isn't in love with John, but she believes she can be of use to him in his family enterprise, which he neglects. They become lovers; she arranges for her father (Henry Stephenson) to find her in John's apartment. He strongly suggests to John that he do the right thing, and John leaves it up to Joan - does she want to marry him? He's surprised when she says yes. On their honeymoon, they agree to stay married for six months and then divorce. Then a funny thing happens: love.<br /><br />Ann Harding came from the Broadway stage; she was a sophisticated, mature, dramatic looking actress with a rich speaking voice. Actually by 1933, her career had begun its decline (though she worked on and off until 1965). Like Kay Francis, she is an elegant, independent heroine, a type which had faded out by the 1940s. Here, her Joan is strong, droll and earthy. Powell was an actor whose appearance didn't change from role to role, but he was able to internalize a character so that he always seemed different. He became associated later on with Nick Charles and some wonderful comedies, but in this era, he's quite serious and as always, wonderful.<br /><br />Dated due to the different mores of today but no less entertaining.
