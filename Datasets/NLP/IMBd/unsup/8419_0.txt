Yeah OK, I'm giving this flick a 7 because I really dug it in the day (although of course not nearly as much as Star Wars which I saw at the Lowes theater in full surround sound, now that was an all time high!). But to this day occasionally I'll hear George Peppard say witha stogy in his pie hole "We Got Us Some Killer Cockroaches Here!" Evidently I'm not the only one who loved that quote because IMDb has it as a highlighted quote. Peppard obviously the true professional that he was must have repeated that line over and over again till it came out just perfect, if I was a fly on that wall, lol. But I mean anyone who watches this flick now for the first time will give this maybe a 4 if they are a post apocalyptic flick lover type like me, and a 1 or 2 if not. It's only because when I saw this flick I was a young teen who thought Jan Michael was cool (I had a haircut like him, and later I came darn close to buying a bar by Clark AB in the PI called the Airwolf Bar because the chicks there said I looked like him, oh my was I stoned cold drunk that time). I saw Jan in "Buster and Billy" and he kicked the crap iota two dudes and than smashed their skulls in with a cue ball, plus he killed Charles Bronson in "The Mechanic" (with a chase scene that must have inspired the DeNiro flick "Ronin"), so Jan Michael was not to be trifled with at that time, no way. So all you people who are giving this flick 1 star, obviously you never saw the flick in the 70's when I did, with its very cool post apocalyptic scenes and its very cool RV that had missiles and could go over oceans in raging gales, and Jan Michael, and of course one of those lines you can't get iota your head, George Peppard screaming "We Got Us Some Killa Cockroaches Here!". I think I'll avoid watching this again because I'd hate to spoil those classic 70's memories, of growing up and wanting to be as cool as Jan Michael Vincent.
