After reading some reviews and watching some clips from "Enchanted", I decided to give the movie a try. I grew up with the Disney Princess movies, so I thought a parody of them would be hilarious. Unfortunately, I could only last about forty minutes before I had to turn it off.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie is hilarious. The song sequences were so over-the-top, a great parody of the classic princesses. In addition, Giselle's reaction to New York City is pretty funny too.<br /><br />However, as soon as the lawyer and his daughter were introduced into the movie, things went downhill quickly. The lawyer was just so unlikable, and his daughter was annoyingly unrealistic. In addition, Giselle's antics went from being cute to annoying. (I think the scene that really put me off was when she drank out of an aquarium and spit out a beta fish... Nasty stuff.) It's a shame, because the premise of the movie seemed so good. It just got stale too quickly.
