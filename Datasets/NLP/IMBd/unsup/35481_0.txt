This is an insult to the Zorro legend, it is just awful, the filming is overexposed, the acting by some of the cast is way over the top, Alain Delon for most of the time walks about with a few days growth of beard, and poor Stanley Baker, not a good film to nearly end his career on, and l don't think the director Duccio Tessari knew what he was doing, and that awful awful music every time Zorro appears, if you ever have to see this film you will know what l mean, to many deep closeups, and added sound effects of swords clashing together spoilt this films, well for me it did I don't like giving a film a low mark, but as Zorro is my favourite film character this is a disgrace so 1 out of 10
