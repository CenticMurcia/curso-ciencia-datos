Yes, I saw this on Mystery Science Theatre, and it was very, very bad, but that guy's shirt made me laugh for at least 10 minutes straight. (They wisely did not comment on it, and just laughed at him too). I would say that is enough to give it a 2 instead of a 1, and besides it wasn't as bad as "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank."
