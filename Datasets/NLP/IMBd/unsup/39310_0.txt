My girlfriend talked me into seeing this movie because she loves Christmas movies. I don't generally mind them either, so I went. I was bored. I'm not often bored, especially at the movies, but maybe that's because I'm careful about what I pay ten bucks to see. I was truly disappointed in the lack of comedy, writing, or anything else that usually goes into making a movie. Tim Allen wasn't funny, Martin Short was REALLY annoying as usual, and the head elf this time around is a little nervous guy with a lisp. Who the filmmakers ride as if it's a stroke of comedic brilliance. The only thing this film had going for it was that it has Santa Claus in it and was released at Christmas time. Boo, Hollywood. Shame on you. But I guess I fell for it, and maybe kids who marvel at shiny things and bright lights liked it.
