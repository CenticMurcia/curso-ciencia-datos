Powell and Loy starred in 14 films. Although this is not one of their better efforts, their charm and chemistry makes it worthwhile. Powell is a shady fellow who snaps out of a nine-year amnesia spell to discover that he has become a shrewd businessman and a pillar of the community during this time except that wife Loy is about to divorce him because he's too dull. The premise sounds better than the execution. The bit where Powell goes into the woods with the boy scouts is not very amusing and is too drawn out, causing the film to lose momentum. Van Dyke is reunited with Powell and Loy, whom he directed in several of the "Thin Man" films.
