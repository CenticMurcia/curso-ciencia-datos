The movie is playing as I type this. How I netflixed this I have no idea, I think it was the National Lampoon tag. This is the worst move I've seen...ever. This is worse than Demolition Man, worse than Sleepless in Seattle, worse than The Replacements. I can't believe how bad this movie is. I thought the beginning was a lead in, and she was going to have a penis or something, but I'm slowly realizing that this movie is serious.<br /><br />The acting has got to be some sort of b-league intro to acting class rejects. I can't believe Michael Douglas's son is this bad. I might get really hammered to see if I find this more amusing, but I doubt it. Maybe they're going for the college stoner crowd. But are you kidding me?!?<br /><br />I hate myself for having sat through it this long.<br /><br />Charlie
