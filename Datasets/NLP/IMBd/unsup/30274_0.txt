I happened to think this was a great movie based on true events. It reminded me of how hard our fore-mothers had to work in order to win the equal vote.<br /><br />Hilary Swank did a fabulous job of playing the determined Alice Paul and Frances O'Conner was great as her effervescent sidekick Lucy. The only part I thought was unnecessary was the "relationship" between Hilary and Patrick Dempsey. Such a lame attempt at romance in the middle of an already interesting film. Angelica Houston was also a strong force in this movie as the venomous Ms. Catt. I really dug how it was filmed, the scenery, costumes, and the type of music used. I totally enjoyed this movie for its ability to be educational and moving and yet integrate light-hearted vignettes. Of course there is the happy ending that everyone knew was coming! I would recommend this movie to any person interested or curious about woman's sufferage or just wants to watch a great movie. GO VOTE LADIES!!! IT WOULD MAKE THESE WOMEN PROUD!!!
