The story is circonvoluted, with many loopholes and inconsistencies. The prose -including the writings of Lorenzo, the main character- is rather corny. But we are told to forget those loopholes, and rather penetrate one of the holes in everyman's fantasy island, and end up somewhere else, where women declare to us unrequitted love, remember the one-night stand they had with us as a glorious moment in their lives or choose us as their wild sex partner, in a world of limited pain and certain forgiveness.<br /><br />We are sent by Menem into a different place. A place where feelings, and not the story, counts. The place one will remember for a long time: where the tidal flow made by full moons is also the flow of our soul, where we can see happiness as an island -or rather, a raft- in the midst of a sea of indiference, where we can find Luc√≠a's loving and admiring eyes and smile, and live in them forever.<br /><br />
