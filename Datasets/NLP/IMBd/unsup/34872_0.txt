Yes, you've guessed right, this is yet another computer-animated film, filled with unnecessary morale and boring jokes. This worked out pretty good a few years ago when Pixar released "toy story" and "a bugs life" because then it was original and groundbreaking, the new visual style made you forget flaws in the story. However, while Pixar continues to evolve the genre by actually adding some story content, Dreamworks refuse to let go of the classic un-original storyline.<br /><br />It's about a Robot who travels to a new city to start a new life and i ask myself, haven't I seen this before? This movie reminds a lot of "a bugs life", despite the fact that you get the need to puke every time those uncomfotable morale-scenes show up. I think I laughed one time during the whole film, and the film is filled with jokes, silly and real childish, I don't think anyone over twelve years will laugh more than I did.<br /><br />I don't think that a movie can survive using special effects only, and since this movie is like one, big special effect with no interesting story whatsoever I have to give this movie 4/10. Dreamworks, you have to evolve a little!
