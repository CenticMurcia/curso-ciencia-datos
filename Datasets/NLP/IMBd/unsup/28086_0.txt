<br /><br />I started watching the movie while flipping through the channels procastinating from doing something actually worth time when I found this interesting. Indeed, it had an interesting story which was presented very well and had some pretty good laughs without trying too hard. It's very good as a comedy, but as a drama it's somewhat bland. The characters don't connect to each other on a dramatic level and you really don't feel for them, but they are still entertaining to watch. Some parts had potential to be deep, and I think Pierre Brault could have pulled it off. Dan Lalande didn't do it for me in the dramatic sense but I did like him when he wasn't supposed to have emotion. He reminded me of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty in a way. I think it could have worked better, but overall a pretty nice movie.
