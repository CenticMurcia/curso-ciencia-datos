You need to have the proper perspective when watching these types of films..they're crap..we know they're crap..so enjoy the crap. I thought this was a weak story, however there were some enjoyable characters and the plot is classic...loner loser geek gets revenge on all those who have harmed him...we have all fantasized about that kind of thing. I found this little jewel of cinematic pooh on a collection called "Night Chills" and trust me..this is one of the better films in that collection...I personally love crappy C and B grade movies because I'm sick of the Hollywood factory made movies that have the same stupid plot as the last 50 Hollywood movies I've seen
