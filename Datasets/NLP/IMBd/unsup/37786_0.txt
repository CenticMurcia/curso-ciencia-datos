I expected alot more from this film, I thought it was going to be more into lesbian witchcraft or something weird like that with all the shocking suspense that most 70's films give us. This film was about two young girls that go out and look for a job and one of them finds a job modeling for a lesbian agent. The agent takes her on her first job as a model at a resort home that is run by a group of witches. One of them a perverted old man, another one is a lady that looks like a man but dressed as a woman that comes up creeping on the young girls from time to time, another is a geeky photographer trying to loose his virginity and another one is a man that wants to get the virgin first before the cult does. The agent falls in love with one of the girls and the only lesbian scenes in this movie are two in which she looks at the girl in a mirror as she undresses and the other is when she kisses her. the girl does not care for the agent because lesbianism isen't her style and therefore sets her goals in taking the agents place as high priestess in the cult. the two of them end up using powers against eachother for the title. This movie was slow and unmoving. This was hyped up to be about some lady that is the head of a cult and was supposed to be a sadist or something. It wasen't what it was supposed to be about and therefor I found it disapointing.
