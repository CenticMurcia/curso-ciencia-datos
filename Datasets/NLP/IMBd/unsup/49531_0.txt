I read a lot of bad reviews of this movie and I saw it 2 times in almost 4 years, but it remains not funny. Well, I have to admit, some things are really original, but that doesn't mean it's well performed. The actor's couldn't act and the director is the star is the producer is the screenplay writer! This picture was doomed to fail, because only Welles and Tarantino can do this. If you're planning to direct a movie you've written and payed for, and acted in, fine, go ahead, but don't show it to people outside your family.<br /><br />But I don't want to write too many bad things about this (cult?!) movie. This picture is good because it's bad and that's the reason you should see this film: to watch and learn how you shouldn't make movies. And if you watch it when you're happy, you can see that the clich√©s were showed for a reason.
