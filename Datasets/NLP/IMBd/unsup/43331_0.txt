This is a very but very bad copy of "River Wild, The (1994)", the acting is ok but the script and the mistakes in this movie are so much and so clear that at the half way you really start to ask yourself if they doing such stupidity on purpose, i give you some examples of really absurd moments of the movie. So overall it is a very bad movie, but if you persist to have your own opinion about it, don't read further because from here on i will give some SPOILERS.<br /><br />They looking for guys and police blocks the road, then we see them turning right because they go that way for they little day off just before the police setup, you really think the police wouldn't stop them to do a little control? Nope they seem like taking a coffee break there! Where in the hell did they get suddenly the extra lifeguards suits (sorry don't know exact name being French) ??? A moment she says when the helicopter fly's by that they don't control the River that's why they can't be seen!!! LOL that is the most stupid thing i heard, you really think they would not survey rivers? Specially when some escaped prisoners are around there. When they turn the boat he catches the gun, for what? because it won't work for a good while when it is in the water, second of all where in the name of god did they get the guns?<br /><br />And more things all the way on like this... But the best and most stupid is the friend that suddenly turns against his so said love and kids, and believe me it isn't a stranger because at the end he explains much more about the kids you can imagine. Anyway some are really not scared to produce such crap.
