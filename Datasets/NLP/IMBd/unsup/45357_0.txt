It's easy to say, "Not enough Cro-Cop!" with a film like this. Then again, that's what MMA highlight DVD's are for. I agree with another viewer who saw this film as a bit Van Damme-ish, it is very much so. On that note, it's about what one can expect for a first effort. The film lacks the cheese of Bloodsport, though Mirko lacks none of the credibility that Van Damme does. Cro-Cop is, with little doubt, the best pure striker in the fight game today, utterly lethal kicks and punches proof positive when his knockout record is reviewed. Whether it's the left high-kick that put Igor Vovchanchyn and Aleksander Emelianenko to sleep or the straight left that broke Bob Sapp's face, Cro-Cop's striking is without question. His acting, well, that's another story. It needs work. That said, it certainly wasn't any worse than anyone else's in the film. The genre of the martial arts hero may be in a bit of a lull (unless you're a vampire), but a man of Mirko's considerable ability may just be able to revive it. If, that is, he chooses the fake fighting over the real thing.
