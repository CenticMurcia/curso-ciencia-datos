This is the kind of film that gave liberals a bad name. Clich√©-ridden, sentimental, patronizing; you know you have a bad film about American Indians when you have noted British actor Trevor Howard pretending to be one. Of course all he does is lie on his back mouthing Cheyenne with a very bad accent, so I suppose the director hoped his presence wouldn't interfere with this precious little message film; but it is the key to all the wrong that follows the opening sequence.<br /><br />I confess I only got half-way through the movie; but it stank solid for sure, so I just had to get out for a breath of fresh air, and by the time I got back, the movie was over - thank god.<br /><br />Everybody over-acts; all the events are predictable. The cinematography is wretchedly television-style, and the muzak is so banal, my girl friend had to take a break to wash her ears out - I mean. this film would define "mediocre" except that some mediocre films are at least watchable; so I guess this is just a really bad film, after all.
