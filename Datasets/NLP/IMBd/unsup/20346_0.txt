To be honest, the ending of the Gundam Wing series was so anti-climactic that it was horrible. It did not fit with what the entire series had going for it throughout its run. The mecha are beautifully brought back again for one final hurrah. The story is engaging, the characters (though textbook heroes) are still well-written, and that's it. The series ends, and what a way to end it. Top notch.
