Upon reading the production of this film nearly 2 years ago I was excited to see another TCM movie. The original series were great and the remake of the original was all right. When I finally saw this movie I was this disappointed for many reasons. <br /><br />001. It offers very little background on Leatherface and The Beginning shows him to be a ruthless killer. Yet in TCM (remake) he has feelings. This movie made him be a monster like Freddy and Jason.<br /><br />002. Who in the hell cast Jordana Brewster? This woman does nothing in this film except run and whine. I'm glad she was killed off. Sorry, Jordana but TCM just wasn't for you.<br /><br />003. Why does Hollywood always want to kill everybody? Sure it was great for the first few remakes but in every movie you lead the audience to believe someone will actually survive and you kill them off like 10 seconds before the credits? Get some new material!<br /><br />004. One good thing about the movie is how the Sheriff came to be. He kills a cop then passes off a masquerade of being one. He's even more evil and bigamist than the first. The whole soldier/marine torture was just brilliant and the bubble wrap almost death was alright. It had me going!<br /><br />Things that made no sense:<br /><br />001. The biker chick. What a waste! She makes the survivors crash into a cow on the road; planning to rob them and the damn woman gets shot by the Sheriff. Dumb! Thanks Sheriff! <br /><br />002. The hook impaled in the woman was too gory. Why? <br /><br />003. The fat lady that says "Oh my, my, my". It was hilarious when they shoved her against the door. She must weigh 500+ pounds. <br /><br />004. The birth scene should have had more details and more background on Leatherface. <br /><br />005. Leatherface's personality in this film. No more sensitivity. Just steel heart!<br /><br />Throughout, the movie provided a few good scares. Too much hyped scenes and the ending was just dumb. Why make a movie if you plan to kill everybody? You could've let Jordana survive like Jessica Biel in TCM and Burns in TCM The Original. Hollywood needs to reconsider what they plan to produce and remake. If not before long, hit movies like Grease, Jaws, The Godfather and Scarface will be remade. Stop the remakes and be creative. Overall, the movie did not pass with me. 4/10 stars. Sorry!
