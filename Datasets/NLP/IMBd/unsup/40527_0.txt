I'd heard a lot about this film - apparently the original was superb and nicely psychologically dark. This, however, was just a disappointment, Positives of the movie: the two lead 'men in white' had their nicely eerie moments, and played their parts pretty damned well. Some of the forth-wall breaking was very well done, however it just wasn't done enough. The father's acting was good, and his pain was well simulated.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film...I thought the moments of drawn-out nothingness were, at times, effective. But when you look at the brevity of the film, and the amount of cinema time actually wasted, it just didn't seem to add up. Naomi Watts was wooden and pretty appalling, the dialogue had definitely seen better days, the supposed 'brutality' was surprisingly disappointing.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from what I thought was going to be a standard horror movie. Perhaps the main reason I was so disappointed was because at moments the screenshots, dialogue and directing seemed superb. However, it was lost in bad dialogue, mediocre acting and a poor sense of suspense.<br /><br />Watch the original. This remake was a complete waste of time.
