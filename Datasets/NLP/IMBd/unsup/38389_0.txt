I frequently receive free movies passes at my place on employment so I get to see lots of movies that I normally couldn't bring myself to pay for. "Slap Her, She's French" is the type of film that I would have been very, very angry/embarrassed if I had paid to see it.<br /><br />If you took every bland, unoriginal American comedy and removed the two or three funny lines you would have "Slap Her, She's French". This film is nothing but a waste of your precious time. The only positive thing about this movie is the fact that the lead actress is reasonably attractive.
