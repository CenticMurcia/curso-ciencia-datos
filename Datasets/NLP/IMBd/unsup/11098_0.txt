Although Richard Shepard's basic plot line isn't at all original, (although, what plot is?) the cinematography is extrordinary, and the acting is even better. Never before have I gotten so much into a character such as Madeline Foster, that I nearly forgot that Maura Tierney wasn't doing "bad girl" things behind Billy Morrissette's back...
