This Rumble was far lower than last years. Three of the matches were just awful and the whole 'Rey Mysterio winning' seemed just to be built out of Eddie Guerrero passing away and when WWE uses Eddie's name to make money out of it they are sick.<br /><br />Results from the PPV:<br /><br />Gregory Helms defeated Funaki to win the Cruiserweight Championship which also consisted of Kid Kash, Paul London, Nunzio and Jamie Noble in a very good match. The Boogeyman defeated John 'Bradshaw' Layfield in a terrible match (poor John). Rey Mysterio won the Royal Rumble last eliminating Randy Orton. John Cena defeated Edge to win the WWE Championship (Why even bother to have made Edge champion for 2 weeks?). Mickie James defeated Ashley in a p*ss poor match. Kurt Angle defeated Mark Henry to retain the Heavyweight Championship in a poor match.<br /><br />Obviously The Rumble and The Cruiserweight match were the best matches on the card, but overall could have been MUCH BETTER!<br /><br />Overall Grade - C+
