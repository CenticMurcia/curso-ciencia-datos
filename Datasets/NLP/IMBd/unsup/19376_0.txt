The Circus<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />This is my first silent film I've ever seen. I was about 12, surfing the channel on television in my parent's room then I saw Charlie Chaplin did very hilarious stuff under the tent, which come to me as The Circus. Ordinarily, I'd dismissed it as another black and white film because I was just a kid at that time. I will not see The Circus until many years later when I saw it again on television. It has always left impression on me since I ever saw it. <br /><br />It's kind of sad that Chaplin didn't really mention this film at all because I believe it is his finest film next to The Gold Rush. Charlie Chaplin would again play The Little Tramp whose tried to escape from police because police believe that he steal someone's wallet, which he was falsely accused of. To hide from police, he just enter the tent and did more hilarious stuff than clowns did and audiences just reacted well to The Little Tramp.<br /><br />As the story progress, we can see the relationship develop between The Ringleader's daughter, whose is the rider for The Circus and The Little Tramp. It's very funny that Chaplin cannot pass the audition for The Circus but is very funny when it comes to showtime. <br /><br />It is amazing feat that his famous tightrope walking required about 700 takes, which is best part about the movie. We can see the monkeys are doing some harm to The Little Tramp. Excellent mixing of the suspense and comedy since original tightrope walker had left and The Little Tramp replace him. The story will say that the Girl fall in love with handsome tightrope walker and left The Little Tramp envy with green. <br /><br />But The Little Tramp got good heart and is witness to their wedding. As The Circus left, The Little Tramp just sit on some box and pondering for a little bit before pick up piece of paper with star on it and crumple it then throw it away. Then just left the scene. <br /><br />This is very excellent silent film, which is very enjoyable. The Circus is few of several silent films that rank on my top 100 but it's rank higher than silent films on that list. <br /><br />Can't think of another enjoyable silent film than this one.<br /><br />****/****<br /><br />
