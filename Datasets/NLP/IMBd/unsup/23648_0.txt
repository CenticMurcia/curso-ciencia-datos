My first thought was to say that The Unknown was a masterpiece given the tools and abilities of the period in which in was made, however, the more I think about it I think it is a masterpiece period. The idea of a film this intricate being silent seems like it would hamper the plot in some way but I think the lack of sound was made up for by the actor's facial expressions and interactions with each other. Each actor was able to express their emotions about a situation of another character by merely looking at him or her or body changing their body language. The music also added the affect of the film. It was constant throughout the entire movie growing more rapid and feverish as the suspense grew. The only aspect that I would have liked to have been changed is for the plot to be elaborated more. i would like to how long Alonzo had been pretending to have no arms and what happened between him and the doctor. Overall I think that this film was excellent, it was a pleasant surprise.
