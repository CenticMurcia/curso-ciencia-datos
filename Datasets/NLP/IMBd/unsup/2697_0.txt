I, too, wish that there were re-runs of this wonderful program (but on one of the broadcast TV channels, since I don't have cable). There were so many episodes that brought tears to my eyes, just because they portrayed what were so true-to-life happenings. I never missed an episode and would purposely stay at home between 6:30-7:00 PM on Sunday nights so that I could watch it. My very favorite episode was the one where Corky hides quite a large pig in the house, attempting to save it from being slaughtered (I think). That was hilarious. Showing how much a person (namely Corky) with Down Syndrome can accomplish, was a real ground-breaker for TV. Also, Chad Lowe, who portrayed a young man who was HIV positive, was wonderful, for the same reason. <br /><br />"Life Goes On", but unfortunately, no longer on TV - at least not here in Minneapolis.
