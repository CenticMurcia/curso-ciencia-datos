Okay okay...so this movie wasn't the most technically sound movie ever. When it comes to low-budget horror, they seldom are. However, get past the bad dubbing and stupid plot, and this one's actually fairly entertaining. The plot seems to have been stolen from a 70's Jaws based porn movie. two shark hunters find loose women and invite them over to have sex with them. Nude swimming and threesomes abound...until a "giant killer shark...the biggest ever sighted" shows up to ruin their sex games. The effects in this one are pretty shoddy(the "man" hanging out of the shark's mouth has to be seen to be believed), and most of the underwater scenes of the shark are laughable...you know that shark isn't that big. But get past these fallacies, and the movie is enjoyable. If you enjoyed Jaws and like the "naughty" things in life, then you'll probably enjoy "tintorera" and all its gratuitous gore and nudity(the only bad part is the naked men...blah!)
