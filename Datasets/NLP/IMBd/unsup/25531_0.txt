This is a film that is very much overlooked by most Bogart fans, not because of his acting, but the story line may have been great in 1947, but is not very thrilling today. Humphrey Bogart,(Geoffrey Carroll),"Dead End",'37, plays a struggling artist and also a man who loves the ladies. Barbara Stanwyk,(Sally Morton Carroll), "Sorry,Wrong Number",'48 plays the wife and begins to become very uncomfortable living with her husband. Geoffrey hands Sally a drink of milk before going to bed and she gets all upset and throws the milk out a stain glassed window. Alexis Smith,(Cecily Latham),"The Eternal Sea",'55 gets herself involved with Geoffrey and they have fun as told in the days of 1947 with no sleeping in bed together was allowed. Geoffrey works on a painting of his wife and has it under lock and key and eventually she opens the door and finds a great big surprise. Even Nigel Bruce (Dr. Tuttle), "Dressed to Kill",'46 appears in the picture and gives a great supporting role as the family doctor. If you are a Bogart fan, you will want to see his performance and especially his facial expressions, something like the "Caine Mutiny"54.
