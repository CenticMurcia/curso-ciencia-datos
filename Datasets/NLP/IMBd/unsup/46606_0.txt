I saw "The Bachelor" tonight with my boyfriend at the dollar theater tonight, and even though I loved the classic romantic story, and even got a few laughs out of it, I noticed some subtle messages in the movie that disturb me.<br /><br />When it comes down to it, this movie seems to perpetuate a Hollywood stereotype: you have to be young, blonde and thin in order to marry a young, handsome millionaire.<br /><br />I noticed that although there was a diversity of women represented in the hundreds of bridal extras, they were portrayed in a negative light as they bickered, shouted, argued, begged, whined and accused each other to get the bachelor.<br /><br />Also, in a time when minority roles on TV and in films is actually shrinking, it was most disappointing to me that neither the bachelor character nor his girlfriend had anyone who was of a different race or disabled, etc., in their circle of close friends (people that stayed with them throughout the movie). Notice that none of the bachelor's former girlfriends were disabled, overweight, or of another ethnicity. I find this hard to believe as the movie is set in racially diverse San Francisco.<br /><br />This movie has other flaws which have been pointed out by numerous other reviewers, but this is one that is a lot more subtle that I hope will be corrected in other films in the future.
