I really liked this movie maybe because I have always been interested about psycology (and not working in that field though I have always wanted..). I have watched this movie twice (and that's a lot because normally I watch movies only once). Both times after watching this I felt that world isn't fair. I cried few times because world isn't fair.... So when you watch this movie be prepared to watch it with time. You really need to think about things.. I think that if you don't like this film you don't like these kind of films at all. But if you "like" this film you "like" film like The Heart is Deceitful about all Things. I really care about children and about their behauviour and it's really important for me to understand what they are feeling. This movie shows that how difficult and how important is to understand and listen that what they have / need to say.
