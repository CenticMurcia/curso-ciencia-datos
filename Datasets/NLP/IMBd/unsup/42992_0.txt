As a died-again Christian, I watched this movie to better learn how the challenging notions of God and religion had been presented in cinema over the years. What we have with 'The Rapture' is a story filled with quite a hook (promiscuous swingers), tragic twists, and gut- wrenching moments (anybody read 'Jude the Obscure'?), quite enough to get anyone watching. What we also get is a lopsided sermon on the hard-line lessons of the Bible, without much in the way of counterpoint.<br /><br />Which warrants a warning to all non-believers: this movie will beat you over the head with the line 'Love God', along with other arbitrary notions of religion (e.g. "Mommy? Where's heaven?" "In the sky."). As such, sitting on my couch felt like being trapped in a cultish, Can I Get an Amen sort of rural church, with my mom holding my wrist down so I couldn't flee out the back door.<br /><br />What this movie lacked, and which Mimi Rogers demonstrates so well in the final act, is the notion of faith in the face of overwhelming doubt. Instead of portraying Sharon as the insightful and thoughtful Christian, Tolkin asks her to embrace the ultimately doomed notion of blind faith. Ironically enough, that tends to be the quickest way to see the light--that of cold reason and reality.<br /><br />To have painted Sharon as a more compelling traveler on the road to faith would have quickly turned this into a masterpiece. Instead, we are left only with a bold reafffirmation for those who already believe.
