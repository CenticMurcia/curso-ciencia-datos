I can imagine every kid who ever saw this film begged, and I mean BEGGED their parents for a Mogwai for Xmas!!! I probably did, I can't remember. And even if I did, I wouldn't admit to it!!!<br /><br />This film is great. Spielberg had a hand in this film somewhere, you can feel it. Yep, this one appeals to both kids and adults.<br /><br />A nice plot, some great SFX and animatronics, and some good acting make this a film for nearly everyone.<br /><br />The initial story, about a boy who gets a cute, fluffy pet for Christmas, is known to everyone. The Mogwai itself is sooooooo cute, and the way it speaks and sings furthers it's cute appeal. So it comes as a shock when the boy who owns him ends up breaking the three important rules that he must abide by, and all hell breaks loose!!!<br /><br />Don't feed them after midnight. Don't get water on them. Don't ever expose them to sunlight!<br /><br />All of these rules are broken, and what ensues is comic/horror chaos.<br /><br />The Gremlins themselves are nasty little things. Grrrrrr!!! They can either be out-and-out menacing, funny and stupid, or both at the same time. It was nice to see the mixture of comedy and horror in this film, and it works all the better for it.<br /><br />The music plays a pivotal role in letting us know when we should be scared or when we should laugh. It's a weird kinda sound that is made and works well enough to suit the mood of the film.<br /><br />The one-on-one between Billy and the Stripe, is actually very tense, and violent. I mean Chainsaw's, razor sharp blades? Phew!<br /><br />My review has so far been a mixture of comments in no particular order, so without more time being wasted, go and watch this film.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Enjoy!
