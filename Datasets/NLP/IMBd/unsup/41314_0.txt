I honestly watched this movie from beginning to end, I had the worst headache of my life and even watching Ulli Lommel movies couldn't make me feel worse. I can honestly say the only plus to this movie was that there was hardly no dialog, because the acting wasn't even worthy of being called acting.<br /><br />The story and characters are extremely unrealistic, this movie was inspired by the man advertising on internet to eat somebody and getting a response. Lommel tries to apply this on a seemingly normal 16 year old girl. The guy writes an advertisement on the internet "I want a girlfriend who is ready to do the ultimate sacrifice" and she responds. No dialog is spoken, so it's hard to say what they see in each other, but he seems like a nice guy. Out of the blue one day he says "I want you to eat my heart" and tries to justify it, she, I guess, says she dosen't like it and dosen't want to see him anymore (or they should not see each other for a while), but somehow he convinces her to kill him and eat his heart, why is never explained, neither is why he believes in this act.<br /><br />Lommel's explanation, I guess, is after the girl has killed the guy she puts the heart, liver and something more on a grill and walks around, her "father" has dialog... he died from *some* disease and has written her letters. One of the letters is "when you meet the perfect guy you should do anything to make him happy." Honestly, that is not how you reason to eat anybody. But honestly, this is a Lommel movie, he obviously lacks socials skills and don't even know what people say to each other - hence the lack of dialog.<br /><br />Was this movie scary? No. The actual killing isn't very graphic, you see her stab into nothingness and they show a wound. That's about it. Was there suspense? No. Did this movie make any sense? No. Was this a waste of time? yes.<br /><br />Honestly, you learn nothing about cannibalism, the characters are unrealistic and the movie is mind-numbing boring.
