Sigh ... another underwhelming Pooh product. I have extreme prejudice for the A. A. Milne books, which makes it very hard for me to enjoy any movie other than the original, but I try to set that aside to let my 2-year-old develop her own love of Pooh. She found this movie alternately scary and boring. Why, why oh why, must films ostensibly for tykes be so, A), amped-up and frightening, and B), based on the morality of sitcoms? You know what I mean -- if you reeely reeely *want* to do it, why, you *can* do it! And then then you all talk about the lesson you just learned! I miss the gentle randomness of the original. I also missed the look of the 100 Acre Wood. I did find this better than our last rental attempt, "Roo's Springtime Adventure," which was flat-out icky
