This would have been a great 20-minute short film. Wait, it already was that? Yes, it was. It was a very good and clever short film, but the powers that be fell prey to the idea that bigger just had to be better. Sadly, the extra 80 or so minutes adds absolutely nothing. The movie is slow, drags along and isn't as funny or clever as it could be. Way too slow introducing things, and the inept caucasians and uncaring African-Americans just aren't amusing after the third or fourth wacky misunderstanding. The ensemble of no-names is solid, save for a handful of "actors" who seem to have missed a few classes at acting school (the doctor and the border patrol officers to name a few). The rest, however are not given much to work with.
