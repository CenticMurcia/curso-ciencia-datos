Cold Steel is one of the most atrocious crime films I've ever seen. It's little more than a tv movie of the week with foul language, and it's badly written to boot. Sharon Stone ends Cold Steel with the immortal line, "I hate sushi". Perhaps 'screenwriter' Moe Quigley is one of Joe Eszterhas' biggest influences.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.
