I absolutely loved this film, It had every element in place for the perfect action film and a whole lot more. David Carradine plays one of three brothers involved in a scandal brought on by one of the brothers partners, putting the three right between the crosshairs of the fearful Tanaka clan. Carradine is exceelent in this film, just such a bad mother. Michael Berryman was good in his role as a standover man for the Tanaka clan, and finally a toast to Lee Van Cleef who plays the father of the three brothers, who is one of the last of the old fashioned tough guys. Definetely Fred Olen Ray's best film ever, with the best script he's ever worked with, as well as some of the best staged stunts I have ever seen with Ray's name attached as director to. I just can't believe I bought this film for one dollar. It just goes to show when someone says there not much you can buy with a dollar, I will give them an Armed Response.
