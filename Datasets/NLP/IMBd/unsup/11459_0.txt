I would have enjoyed this more had it had all of her videos from the era on it - most notably, it's missing the very memorable "Erotica" (according to rumor, in order to avoid a Parental Advisory label.) However, the DVD is still very much worth owning for any Madonna fan - her genius for visuals is at its peak during the videos from "Ray of Light," especially in "The Power of Goodbye" and "Frozen." This collection definitely showcases her at her best, during her later years, and the visual effects are superceded only by the music.
