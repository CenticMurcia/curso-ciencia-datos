I don't know who is really to blame for this totally uninteresting, formulaic, unmoving film.<br /><br />By watching the Project Greenlight series, you can see that nobody knew exactly what type of movie they were making. From Erica Beeney, to Kyle and Efram, Chris Moore, none of the Mirimax studio executives. <br /><br />There does not seem to even be the potential of a good story in this movie. At least nothing that hasn't been seen over and over again.<br /><br />This is what happens when too many people get involved in the development of a script. This is just a mess.<br /><br />I wish I could say that the acting made this film better, but it doesn't.<br /><br />A waste of one million dollars.<br /><br />3 out of 10
