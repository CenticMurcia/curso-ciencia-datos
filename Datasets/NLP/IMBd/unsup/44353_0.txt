There seems to be an unwritten, but rigidly enforced rule in Hollywood these days, that every movie must be black even if it's not. No longer can you make a movie for white people, even if it's ostensibly a white movie ... it's just not pc. <br /><br />Like all bad "pc" movies made during the past 10 years, The Shrink Is In constantly assaults you with pounding RAP. Also very pc, it has a white lead with a black neighbor who is her best friend. And of course, there are black faces planted in almost every scene of the movie. <br /><br />If you can stand this cultural assault, you have to put up with an inane plot and marginal acting suitable for a Grade B chick flick. Which is what this woman-looking-for-love to mend a broken heart is.
