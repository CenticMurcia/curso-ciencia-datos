Excellent acting and input my the Aamir Khan....excellent feels understated. The characters were well defined and expressive. The director has finally managed to bring our Aamir's potential. His acting is simply so natural and marvelous that no actor in Hollywood is comparable to him including the overstated SRK.. A must see though its does leave u slightly emotionally wrecked but kajol is looking very pretty too. Nice change from the annoying Preity, ash or Rani. Aamir has changed his look throughout the movie and managed to carry each of them with maturity and excellence. Its just amazing to c him wear his attitude and not expensive designer wear.<br /><br />Very refreshing and well made. Aamir simply grows on u with each scene!
