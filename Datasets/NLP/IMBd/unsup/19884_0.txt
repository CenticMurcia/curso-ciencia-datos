This was rated a mere 1 based on sheer disappointment. I love all of Guest's movies but something happened or I should say didn't happen here. The movie was over before it stated with a running time of slightly over an hour and it appeared as though Guest just plain gave up and quit so the studio called in a editor to finish the project. Here we have one of Hollywood's most consistent and greatest ensemble cast and it is wasted on the scale of "The Thin Red Line". To top it off we have many many more faces everyone will recognize, too many. You just didn't care about any of them. The only saving grace was the take on Inside Edtion with the magnificent Judy Lynch and the clueless Fred Willard. But these were not scenes but bytes. The whole movie bytes. Go see "Stranger Than Fiction" and see a real movie. Just to write this makes me sad, I so loved all the other movies Guest and company have done. As Willard's character kept saying in the "Mighty Wind": "What happened???????????"
