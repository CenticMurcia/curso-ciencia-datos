An all star cast leads the best original screenplay of 1947. Cary Grant is my favourite actor, and Myrna Loy, best remembered for her trademark housewife equal in "The Thin Man" are two of Hollywood's brightest comics together in a pretty funny film. Throw in teenaged seventeen year old Shirley Temple falling for a shining knight in armour/playboy/artist Cary and her Judge sister, and a fun packed comedy results. Somehow, Cary playing another play boy who the women keep falling for cannot convince me of the stretch. <br /><br />There are great scenes, notably at the races. This only further proves that Cary may very well be the funniest straight actor to appear on the screen. The supporting cast itself is a great one, and the leads are fantastic.<br /><br />This film has been well directed, but not enough to meddle in the great performances. Screenplay manages to simply enough combine humour and creativity. A light hearted romp and good entertainment.<br /><br />It's a little lesser known as many of these actors other films always overshadow it, but it is still a good example of 1940s film making, with top talent at its best.<br /><br />Rating: 8.25/10
