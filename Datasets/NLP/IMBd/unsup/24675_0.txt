i quite enjoyed this film. the only problem i had with it was that i wanted to see more of gina mckee's character explored - i think all the characters were spread a little thin and it could have been better if there was more focus to fewer characters. mckee was the highlight of the film (she often is) and her storyline was especially good. <br /><br />overall i thought the family dynamics were great - in a horrifying way. the parents were terribly distressing. i found the brother storyline slightly confusing and unnecessary. i would like to have known more about him or nothing at all.<br /><br />anyway, i thought it was a decent film, worth seeing by all means.
