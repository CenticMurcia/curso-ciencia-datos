What a lame ending. I kept watching it to try to figure out just what was going on, and was so disappointed and confused when they revealed the ending. This movie made no sense. The only positive I can say is that I didn't turn it off because I genuinely wanted to find out what the heck was going on. But unfortunately, it just kept spiraling into more and more plot twists until nothing made sense. Is she having premonitions? I don't know. Is she crazy? I don't know. Are her kids in trouble? I don't know. Are we in the present or the past or the future now? I don't know. Is this all just a dream and Suzanne Plechette is lying next to us when we open our eyes? That would have been a better ending, honestly.<br /><br />Skip this movie. You'll thank me.
