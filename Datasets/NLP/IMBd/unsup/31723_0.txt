If I was a foreigner and I heard that Americans were coming to visit my city, I would cringe if I had seen this show beforehand. The wife is not bad at all, however the husband... is an idiot. Representing America in a foreign country you should be the epitome of manners and etiquette. Instead, I see on the show when the idiot asks for more hot sauce in Mexico there was no please and no thank you, just an assumption and very little effort put in to speak the native language. It is great to see many of these places that I may one day visit but now, I have to make up for the ignorance and feigned appreciation of the Americans who ventured there first? Thanks... appreciate it. I would really like it more if 1) The husband at least was replaced... ugh how can she stand him; 2) The couple or maybe even single person.... yeah that would be nice studied up on the local culture and customs and language prior to visiting anywhere. And for anyone that doesn't know, # 2 above is an unspoken requirement for traveling to any foreign land. It is about respect for the people and the culture and the understanding that there is MUCH MUCH more beyond the borders of our country that is has a depth of history and culture much greater than ours. We are babies in the eyes of the world and I find that often, the uneducated traveler behaves as one as well.
