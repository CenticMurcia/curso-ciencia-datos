Although the title references a meal, Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds leaves the viewer starved for something resembling entertainment. <br /><br />Phillip J. Bartell -- remember the name. This hack has written and directed (for want of a better term) possibly the year's worst film. It even makes Open Cam and Sideline Secrets seem like masterpieces. There is not one funny scene in this film, not ONE. He directs the cast to recite their lines exactly the way they did at the table read.<br /><br />The insultingly banal plot follows Kyle (poorly acted by American Idol's Jim Verraros) who gets dumped and then is turned on by a nude male model in his art class, who claims to be straight. Kyle's pals Gwen (Emily Brooke Hands, surely the shrillest actress on the planet) and Tiffani (Rebekah Kochan) aim to find out so Kyle takes him to a "going straight" session. Ugh! <br /><br />Why can't gay filmmakers and producers write films that don't insult us? Why are the quality gay-themed films all made by straight writers and directors? This is 2006 and saddens me.<br /><br />Quite accurately the title points out this is a sloppy film. Do yourself a favor and skip this cinematic meal.
