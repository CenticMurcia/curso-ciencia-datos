I made the mistake of brushing off this movie for years until Netflix made it easy to catch up on hard to find Italian films. When people call a film sleazy, I think of crude, cheap technicals, not plot or theme. The photography, lighting and art direction are astonishing in Nude For Satan. These elements alone are what makes this film worth seeing. The plot is incomprehensible but that doesn't matter. I watch Italian horror films for the visuals and the lavish art-house style. There is a level of artistry in even the cheapest Italian productions, with few exceptions. Rita Calderoni's nude body in nearly every scene is another inducement to watch NFS. She's utilized much better here and looks better than in Delirium.
