They shouldn't have bothered leaving it open for a sequel. As bad as this was there's no chance in hell of a second movie. Plus, in one scene the agent asks for room and the manager clearly hands him a car key!! A car key, anyone who can't tell that was a car key, needs new glasses. Plus, let's talk about the climax for a moment. It's bad enough our star blindly follows order and kills everyone who wasn't killed by the six monster fish, but after he kills the fish, the Government blows them up. I'm sorry, if the Government can't keep a simple burglary secret, then I can't believe they could get away with making illegal bio-weapons. To future film makers out there. Here's a hint, if you want to make a good movie. One people will watch and want sequels to. Then please, please spend more then a mere 25 grand, I can't stress this enough, spend more then 25 grand. It's impossible to make a good movie with that low of budget. Use this as an example of what not to do.I give this steaming pile of rotting fish the NOOSE as well.
