I had just started to watch CSI and was flicking through the the Sky channels and found Navy NCIS on the FX channel. It only took one episode to get me hooked on to it, I like the characters seen to interact and gel with each other. First there's Gibbs the boss played by Mark Harmon, Gibbs is a great character he is serious when it comes to the job but he also has a humour side to him that works well with other characters.<br /><br />Di Nozzo is funny and again works well with his humour especially with Gibbs.<br /><br />Caitlin started as the new girl and it has been interesting to her build with her fellow NCIS agents through out the series, It's a shame that actress Sacha Alexander wanted to leave and the producers decided to kill her off, maybe would of been better for her to transfer and leave the door open for future guest appearances.<br /><br />Abby is the scientist, maybe a female goth version of Gil Grissom and actress Pauley Perrette portrays brilliantly.<br /><br />David McCallum plays Donald Ducky Mallard the coroner who is often found going off on a tangent and what were the creators drinking the night they come up with that name.<br /><br />Agent Timothy Mcgee is the latest addition to the show, he started as computer whizz and now has been promoted to a field agent and his scenes with Abby are great.<br /><br />Long live the NCIS team and I look forward to future series.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning that Alan Dale stars as Tom Morrow the head of NCIS, most of the soap watching community will remember him in Australian soap opera Neighbours.<br /><br />Well the above was written after watching the first 2 series of NCIS, so now I thought I would comment on what I think of the show in series 3 and 4.<br /><br />Got to say it has got even better, not just the stories but the development on the characters. First there is the introduction of Ziva David the Mossad agent who is now working with NCIS. Her character has fitted in well with the rest of the team and her interaction with Tony is good and at times very funny.<br /><br />Next there is the new director of NCIS who is Jenny Shepherd who is played by Laren Holly, her and Gibbs have a past and it is interesting to see them be reunited and of course Gibbs getting use to her being the boss. Gibbs left then came back (as we knew he would), Agent Lee also joined the team very briefly and does make occasional appearances due to her romance (if you wanna call it that) with Jimmy Palmer.<br /><br />Also the story of Tony falling in love, Jenny Shepherds obsession of capturing an arms dealer and Magee's bestselling book have kept the series fresh and interesting, and have shown that it is not just one show one story.<br /><br />Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Time for another update as season 5 comes to a close in the UK although we are getting to see the first episode of season 6 a few days after it airs in the US.<br /><br />Another great season from beginning to end, which seen the end of the Frog and also the end Tony's romance with Jeann. Some good stories throughout the series and what a great ending, Jenny Shepheard killed off not sure if she wanted to go or the producers decided to get rid of the character, the ending also see's the disbanding of the team Ziva goes home, Mcgee goes to the cyber crime unit, Tony goes on board a ship and Gibbs gets a new team.<br /><br />Part of the new team is agent Lee who we have see before, I have read on some websites that fans wont be watching if Gibbs has a new team, the team will be back together,the producers are just making it more unmissable they know that it would kill the show if Tony, Ziva and Mcgee were written out.<br /><br />Looking forward to season 6
