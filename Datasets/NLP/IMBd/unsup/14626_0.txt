Here is a movie from the "biggies".. the YASH-RAJ, who seem to be thinking that a sales is everything even if the product is a total crap. The whole movie is so much pain to heart and brain. OK, bollywood movies are generally unconvicing, but even in the David-dhavan kind of un-realism, you expect a comedy plot, sufficient to make you feel, time worth spent. Here seemingly "underpaid" writers wrote 1/3rd of the dialogues and repeated each at least 3 times to make a regular 3-hr movie. Director Kunal Kohli somehow manages to make sure that none of the scenes, I mean not even a single one, is something one could think logical. Even hypothetically logical.<br /><br />After watching this movie, I have more respect for the directors and writers of recent movies I watched like "Begin Cirus", "Taxi number 9211". True, ther is no limit to how stupid a movie can be, and funaa proves the point.
