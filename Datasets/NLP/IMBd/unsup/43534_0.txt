well it wasn't until i saw MARNETTE PATTERSON on CHARMED that i remember seeing this show. i watched the whole season one shows that came on. its to bad the WB replayed the shows again on Monday night. because they only had eight shows to air from the same season. on top of that when season two got ready to start i didn't see any promos for it. oh well they moved the show around and rating when down. and it ended so i guess you can say that i like the show. but it wasn't something i would rushed to the TV and watch. because in my eyes it was just another mild hit show that came from the WB.just another story base on movie stars right
