I went into this film without realizing it was by Carlos R. I won't explain the storyline as you may have read it already by now - I will however try to rationalize why it may be loved/hated.<br /><br />This "artistic" film is not meant for the regular masses of people - that much is clear. It however goes a step ahead by trying to create a niche group amongst the "sophisticated" critics/viewers as well! It's a "short story" shot in exaggerated long moments of nothingness. You will be viewing the (deliberately) expressionless actors looking into space like zombies in addition to the Mexican landscape, roads, people, roads, sun rising, (did i mention roads?) etc with no coherence. It was during these long shots, I realized this film was reminiscent of another rather *boring* Mexican film I had once lost 2 hours of my life to.<br /><br />It wasn't until the much talked about "Real Life people" sex scene that I paused, checked and found it was indeed a film by Carlos Reygadas! At least he has succeeded in imprinting his style even on normal audiences! Once a director does it (ie Geriatrics Sex in Japon) in a movie, its considered artistic by the niche critics but to do something like that again in another gloom of a film? I call it a disturbing fetish crying out for media attention! Let me get this straight - the film is not about sex primarily - it also is *supposed* to be about human dilemmas of morality, class divides etc.<br /><br />However we never get to see it, comprehend it or actually feel for it. It's a film which will fulfill those niche audiences and allow them that seat of authority which they can have and enjoy.<br /><br />PS. This film will be enjoyable in 4x Fast forward.
