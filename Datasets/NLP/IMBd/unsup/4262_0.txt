Just like the TV series "Lost", it seems all exciting while you watch and wait anxiously for the ending, which is supposed to explain everything, but when it ends, nothing is explained.<br /><br />The whole point to movies like this is the ending which is usually a really fascinating twist, explaining why things happened the way that they did, e.g. "The Others", "6th Sense". This one had absolutely no conclusion and left me feeling cheated and like I had wasted the last 2 hours of my life.<br /><br />At least it's fun to sit here and write how sh1t this move was and hope someone reads it :) By the way, I can't stand the TV series "Lost" either, and I did understand every single word in the Matrix, so I'm not dumb.
