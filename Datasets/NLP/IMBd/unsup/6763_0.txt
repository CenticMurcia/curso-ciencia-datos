I certainly loved Babar as a kid, and have a soft spot for it now. I love how it is simple, and that it is lovely and cute. Children will definitely love it, and I do seriously think it is one of the better animated shows to come out in the 80s and 90s, most cartoons these days with one or two rare exceptions are awful with bad animation, lacklustre humour, poor music and lacks even juvenile appeal, or are shows that started off good and now are mediocre at best(Spongebob Squarepants I am looking at you!) Back on target, the animation in Babar is truly lovely, simple in design but has a certain elegance about it. Also the music is exceedingly pleasant, and the characters and story lines are endearing. Not only that, it is educational, and you learn good morals without feeling as though it is being forced down your throat. All in all, lovely to watch, really charming and I for one love who simple it was. 10/10 Bethany Cox
