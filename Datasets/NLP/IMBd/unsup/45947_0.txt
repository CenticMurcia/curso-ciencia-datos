Wow, I just rented this at Starworld video and found it to be very very, not good. It was awful, I mean COMON! It looks like Redge stole the props from the Renaissance festival. I think the Knights had a bigger goal...to kill the director and crew for filming pure dick. I really felt like taking this VHS and throwing it to the birds...and perhaps hitting a car in the mean time. This film is a embarrassment to the movie crew's life. I'm just fed up with even thinking about this awful movie. This review is concluded with a review score of the generous 1 out of 10. The story was just so stupid, it doesn't belong on screen. I rather watch MR.Hands. I want to shoot myself with a crossbow after watching this mess.
