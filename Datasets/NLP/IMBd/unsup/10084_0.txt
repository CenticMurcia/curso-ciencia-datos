The whole movie was to sell toys. Even Leader one was awful when he didn't want to save Cy- kill, the nut. Is this the same Leader- one? Not that the psycho didn't deserve to be saved, they should have put more thought into this movie not just to sell more toys. The part of the lava scene was unrealistic and they should have added more young go bots. Get rid of those weird rock creatures and put in some young guardians and renegades. They are girl go bots so I resume that they can reproduce since they have souls of men and brains. The only smart people in this entire movie were the girls, Soltaire, small foot and A.j. It would be better if you had a hot shot guardian trying to get himself in trouble than three old pros and a rebellious renegade fighting with old rusty renegade.
