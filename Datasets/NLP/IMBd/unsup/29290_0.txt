Awful black movie about a protest organized by the women of the hood to stop violence and make peace between the gangs. As long as the men don't agree to put down their guns there's no sex. Close to amateur with a non-existent script or storyline it seems the director asked a bunch of people to improvise accordingly to the premise of the movie using as much foul language as possible. The performances are as fake and incompetent as you can possibly imagine. Like I said it feels like these people aren't even professionals.<br /><br />Most of the movie is spent on monologues of a man or woman in front of the camera talking about relationships in the most vulgar way of course. The other half is a bunch of women insulting men and vice versa. Add a generous amount of close-ups on every woman's rear and some stupid jokes in between dealing with sex and taking advantage of the usual black lingo and you got Miami Tail. While it may have a good message at heart, the execution is so mediocre and appalling that one must think twice before even calling this cinema.
