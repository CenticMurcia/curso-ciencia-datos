If you like movies with no discernible plot, with protagonists you don't care about, that leave you wanting to slit your wrists, by all means watch this! I gave it 3 stars because at least it was somewhat original in terms of visuals and had a surprise ending. But seriously, I have never had a movie with no real plot make me feel so depressed. It was horrifying, but not in the sense that you WANT in a horror movie. <br /><br />Word of caution - if you have ever had an abortion, had a fetus die or have any sensitivity to this topic, don't watch this movie, as it has some REALLY disgusting and emotionally sickening images/themes.
