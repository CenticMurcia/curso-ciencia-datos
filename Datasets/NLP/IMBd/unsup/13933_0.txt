In Adelaide, the wife of Dr. Brian Cowper (Robert Coleby), Jill Cowper (Judy Morris), is developing her thesis at home to finish her Master in Anthropology. When the plumber Max (Ivor Kants) unexpectedly arrives for a routine check and maintenance of the piping in the bathroom, Jill stays alone at home with the talkative weird stranger. Along the days, he tells that he spent some time in prison, making Jill frightened with his presence. Her friend Meg (Candy Raymond), her husband Brian and the super's wife finds Max a simple, but nice man, but Jill does not agree. When there is a problem in her bathroom and Max needs to stay with her for a longer period, the tension between them increases and Jill finds a way to get rid off the plumber.<br /><br />This low budget and theatrical film is a claustrophobic and scary study of human nature, based on the relationship of two different characters of different social classes spending a period together. It is also impressive how far a stressed person with culture and education may go and how amoral can be her behavior staying alone with another disturbed and lonely person that she can not understand. The direction and performances are outstanding in this suspenseful and efficient thriller. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Encanador" ("The Plumber")
