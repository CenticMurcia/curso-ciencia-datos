A single woman and her 12-year old daughter (whose name is not revealed) lose their jobs when the Taliban shuts down the hospital they work at in Afghanistan. Needing to survive, the woman decides to disguise her daughter as a boy by cutting her hair off, putting her in men's clothing, and calling her Osama. Osama gets a job, but is soon taken away by the Taliban for military training with all the young boys in the village. This is beautifully filmed but extremely painful to watch. Most of the violence is off-screen, but there is still disturbing imagery in this very realistic film. It is incredibly suspenseful watching the lead character go through her days, hoping that her secret isn't found out. The lead actress, who was a panhandler before making this film, gives an exceptional performance and the look of sheer terror and pain never leaves her furrow-browed face. Osama is depressing and bleak, as a movie about the Taliban's violent oppression of women should be. My Rating: 9/10
