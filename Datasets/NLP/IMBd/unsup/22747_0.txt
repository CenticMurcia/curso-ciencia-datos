I just watched Bhansali's rendition of Dostoevsky's White Nights and I have to admit what a visual treat it has been. From the costumes, to the dialogues, to the sets and settingsthe whole film is superbly done. But one aspect of the film that thoroughly enthralled my pallet is Ranbir Kapoor's acting. This latest addition to the Kapoor Constellation in the Bollywood galaxy signals a refreshing breeze of change in Indian cinema. His soulful eyes are reminiscent of Raj Kapoor in 'Mere Naam Joker'The happy-go-luck protagonist that spreads joy and laughter to the whole world but is left alone to wipe his tears of sorrow. The man that feels happy by providing other people with joy. His yodellings are a dead ringer for Shammi Kapoor's wild "Junglee" ways in the snowy and green valley's of KashmirYAHOO! The omnipresent umbrella in the film that symbolises the bond between the lover and the loved one has hints of 'Sri 420', in which Raj Kapoor professes his love for Nargis under a similar umbrella during the monsoon downpour. And to further the familial references there is a showing of Mughal-e-Azam in the film, where Prithvi Raj Kapoor plays the all-powerful Emperor of HindA force to be reckoned with that will see to it that the young lovers Salim and Anaarkali do not consummate their love. Mise en abîme. Sonam Kapoor's Sukeena (Nastenka) is a tad forced at times and could have been acted betterBut the other female lead of the film was played to perfection by Rani Mukherjie. Gullabjie, a rose with a thorny temper is scintillatingly portrayed. Her shimmering costumes and the witty/snappy tongue is a delight to watch. Saawariya has made me Baawariya. A must see. 8/10.
