This movie is really cool even though there are to much early 90's reminders in it. I just love the scenery and the acting. you want to watch a real swedish gansgta movie rent this one. Liam was the kind of gangster he played in this movie ( he has changed to the better now.. he found god). I really hope they will show his upcoming movies on cinemas.
