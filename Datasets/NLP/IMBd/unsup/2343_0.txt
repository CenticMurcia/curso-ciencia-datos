Very well done, you enter expecting to go into a "back to the future" type ride and then they "transport" you onto the Enterprise (They actually change the floor underneath you!) You get to battle Klingons on the bridge, ride a turbolift, etc. One of the best ways to spend a few dollars in Las Vegas.
