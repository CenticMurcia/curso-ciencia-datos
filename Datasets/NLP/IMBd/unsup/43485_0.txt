I bought this film being an avid classics collector especially of some of the old horror actors like Lugosi and Zucco(a great arch-fiend such as the role of Dr. Moriarity in some Sherlock Holmes endeavors) I found this movie tried to hard to be scary and campy. although it had an aura of the gumshoe mystery to it you could easily get the feeling that the film was almost plotless. However, being Lugosi's only color film it wasn't so bad that I wouldn't have it in my collection. I rated it a hesitant 4 (I debated with a 5).
