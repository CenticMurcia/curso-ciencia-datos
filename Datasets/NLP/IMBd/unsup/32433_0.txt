Carlitos is a felon, upon getting out of jail around Christmas time, a junkie no good "friend" , Mike, shows him a claw he stole from someone. It seems some demonic forces want said claw back and decide to torment Carlito for it instead of his friend who is busy shagging Carlito's wife. Shades of "Evil Dead", and "Hellraiser" abound, but bargain basement shades, with a horrid story, below sub-par 'special' effects, and atrocious acting. Steer clear of this dreck. Fangoria endorses some god awful films and this is NO exception. As a matter of fact, I implore you to read "Rue Morgue" instead as it's so incredibly much better.<br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />DVD Extras: Fangoria Article; Theatrical Trailer; and Trailers for "Slashers", "Wilderness", "School's Out", "Angel of the Night", and "Lady of the Lake"
