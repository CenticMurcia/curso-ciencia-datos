Has anyone actually paid to see this movie? whether in the theater or renting the movie? I caught it channel surfing one night and paused only long enough to figure out what I was watching and recall why I hate Leo. The only reason I am even wasting my time to write a review is because someone needs to counter the endless stream of 9s and 10s on this sight. If you ask me, this only degrades the quality of IMDb.<br /><br />As for the reality, it is not even close. I spent two years in the tropics and life is very hard. You are sunburnt all the time, not tan, and sick from the monotony of the food, tropical diseases and storms. ***Spoiler follows*** watching Leo spear a dozen fish on his first try followed by a macho, "I provide!" moved something within me that I didn't know existed :{D= ***End of Spoiler***<br /><br />What else is on!
