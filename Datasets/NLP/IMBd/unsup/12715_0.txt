I struggled to figure out what was it all about but failed. The duel between a man and a woman in love is seen by me as the most exciting genre on Earth however what this movie offered was, with exception for some sequences, awfully boring and senseless. I would rather blame it on script which was raw and weak despite all the credits of the writer. The whole film is one and the same recurrent scene and plot turns urge a huge question mark in respect to normal human logic, patience and reason. It is hard to conceive how our good Lord could share the throne of the world with Devil but human relationships are always understandable. The characters in the movie mentioned a word love' a couple of times but whatever it was in the end the kind of relationship those two people had in the course of the movie gives a clear indication that it was not love even at the beginning - that was all what the bare lust can produce and you could still cheer yourself up with catching the flashes of the seductive Salma's body. For other sort of emotions, watch The whole wide world'.
