I'm starting to like French action movies. This one reminded me a little bit in its feel of Kiss of the Dragon, minus the kung-fu.<br /><br />The colouring and mood of the film are dark and edgy, as are its characters. Jean Reno delivers a good time, as per usual.<br /><br />I will say that the plot twists to the point of nonsense, but it's still a good ride.<br /><br />The film also has a hint of an Islamophobic air, given the current geopolitical climate, but not to the point of being overt.<br /><br />In all, one of the best action films I've seen in a while, highly recommended within its genre.
