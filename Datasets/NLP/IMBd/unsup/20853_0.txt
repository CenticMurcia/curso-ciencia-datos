I remember being rather excited about this show when the railers first appeared, even rushing out of the room whenever they came on as to not spoil the clips through over-saturation. This all seemed painfully ironic when after five minutes of the first episode I saw the same sketch, in a marginally different location, then another, and another. Not only this but there was a distinctly unfunny voice-over by the great Tom Baker and the worst laugh track I'd ever heard (since usurped by Hope And Faith's). By the end I had decided that I need never see another episode of Little Britain, apparently it was all in the trailers anyway. Occasionally dipping into "new" episodes every now and then has done nothing to disprove this.<br /><br />Please try their earlier show Rock Profiles instead, it is far superior.
