This seems to me to be a very odd choice for Hitchcock, and not altogether successful. The movie has a nice feel for small-town New England in the fall (at least as well as I recall it from my teens), and it is quite funny occasionally, but overall it is just pleasant. You know that the characters are quirky because the script says they are, but it often seems forced. Shirley MacLaine is quite good at what was a trademark of her "cute period", but casting John Forsythe as a painter seems very strange. Also, every print of this movie that I've ever seen is quite muddy-looking, but I have no idea if this is intentional.<br /><br />If you like Hitchcock (and who doesn't), you will probably enjoy this if your expectations are low enough. It's no Rear Window, but it's not Topaz, either.
