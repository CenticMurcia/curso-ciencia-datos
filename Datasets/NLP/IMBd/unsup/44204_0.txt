Emma Roberts, Don Cheadle, Kevin Dillon, Lisa Kudrow and Don Cheadle all star in one stupid film. 2009 has had some fantastic children's entertainment. We had Up and Where the wild things are, both made my top three for the year. We also had Night at the museum 2, which wasn't art but was still decent. But before all of these good films, we had Hotel for dogs. Trust me, don't check into it. You can see what the hell is going to happen in this film once all of the characters are introduced.<br /><br />The plot is simple stuff. A brother and sister(Emma Roberts and Jake T. Austin), who are living with their stupid foster parents(Kevin Dillon and Lisa Kudrow) decide to open up a hotel for a bunch of stray dogs. Them and their friends help also.<br /><br />While watching the film, you can definitely see where the hell it is going. You know that eventually the hotel for dogs will become a big thing. They will try to keep it a secret from the adults. They will get new foster parents. A lot of this film is unfeasible also. How would they get the money to make all of this crap? Where would they get the money for the dog food? They are kids. <br /><br />All I can really say about this movie that is good... well, not that much. Not even the dogs could save it. Well, perhaps they do a little bit. The dogs in the film are very cute. But besides that, the film is kind of like dog crap. It's not a total mess, but it's one of the worst films of the year. Predictable, cheesy, and a ton of other things, please be sure to stay away from this film.<br /><br />Hotel for dogs:*1/2 out of ****
