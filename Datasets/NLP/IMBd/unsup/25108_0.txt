I was thrilled to see this great film released on DVD. It's such a shame it wasn't given proper presentation when it was first released theatrically. They have done a fantastic job with the DVD. So many special features. The Director's cut, the featurettes, even a section on the authentic native American costumes, all give a fascinating insight into the difficulties in making a movie like this. My hat's off to Tab Murphy's writing and direction, and of course Tom Berenger (the perfect Lewis Gates)and Barbara Hershey. Thanks too, to HBO for producing a fine DVD.
