Every time a Hollywood writer can't figure out a clever ending, he or she decides to turn the baddie into a CIA "agent" so he can get the girl and live happily ever after. In this trashy, waste-of-time flick, once again the thief becomes our man from Langley. Of course the CIA does not track international (or domestic) art thieves, but what the heck? We need an ending, let's use that old fable. Who will care? Only the brain dead will be able to watch this horror through to the end and learn the secret identity of Bandares. A waste also for fans of Meg Ryan, with or without Botox. And the weeping chef on the lawn only adds to this mish-mash of a film. Pity the people who paid box office prices to sit through it. Hope the popcorn was worth the price.
