The animation was the good part, and the ONLY good part. See, Disney has lost its charm by this point (it's lost it for years--at least since the 70's, when the films became more savvy than charming) and they were trying to necromance a charming movie. But you can't slap savvy on top of charming. It just doesn't work. Instead of the atmospheric silence of the original film, we have hideous pop songs slapped in when the characters aren't yapping. Thumper's siblings are inexplicably turned into very annoying little sisters (Hint to Disney writers: Having screechy characters yell out "big bwother!" isn't cute). Faline and Bambi are suddenly in looooove with each other, ignoring the fact that they'd still be in the cootie phase at that point in time if you paid any attention to the original film.<br /><br />In other words, fine, Disney can be savvy or hip, whatever. Just don't try to wreck a charming classic with it. Make a whole new film with new characters and release your animators on that. They deserve better.
