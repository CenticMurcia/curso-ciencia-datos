As far as B movies go, this one's up there. The acting isn't great, the plot's a little cheesy... but the movie still has very redeeming qualities: First off, the Dodge Turbo Interceptor is a bad-A car. Also, the movie never really drags on, which is a hard thing to say for most B movies. Lastly, even though their acting may not be real hot, Gutterboy and Skank are fairly believable (and hilarious) characters. If you like Charlie Sheen and want a glimpe into his humble beginnings, check this one out!
