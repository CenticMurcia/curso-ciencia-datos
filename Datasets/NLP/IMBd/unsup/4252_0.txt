"Salt Water Tabby" is another nice little classic by the duo Tom & Jerry. It is one of their funniest, apart some violent gags.<br /><br />For one thing, the designs, general quality and artwork of this short is quite pleasant, like in much of the cartoons from those times. Because this one takes place in a beach, on a Summer day, it gives the impression of being a «Summer blockbuster». He he he!<br /><br />There's lots of humor and funny gags on this one, starting by the way Tom introduces himself to that pretty female cat and the way he tries to impress her. Another funny thing about Tom is that he eats her hot dog and drinks her soda.<br /><br />Right after that, there comes more comical moments: our little rodent friend Jerry is in the picnic basket, throws a tomato and a banana peel and eats salami from a few sandwiches. Next, Jerry throws a couple of eggs to Tom's eyes. Tom's eyes sure look funny with those eggs and some "decorations" - lol.<br /><br />However, the most hilarious moments of this short are when Tom drinks sand instead of sugar in the coffee. That is so funny! And then Tom, tormented by the sensation of having his mouth full of sand, drinks water from the bucket, but it's ocean water and Tom spits it straight to the female cat's face! Oh my God, that is hysterical! It's true that Jerry is kinda mean by doing those things to Tom, but it's just so hilarious!<br /><br />Overall, aside the violent gags with a crab and some of other kind, this short is among the most amusing by Tom & Jerry.
