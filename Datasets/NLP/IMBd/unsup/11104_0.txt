I only watched this movie because of Adrien Brody and Moira Tierney of ER fame. Adrien Brody literally stole this movie with his chilling and riveting portrayal of a kidnapper. I never expected this caliber of acting in what I consider a B-grade movie. I can now look forward to seeing him in THE PIANIST...he is awesome.
