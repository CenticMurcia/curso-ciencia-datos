I do not understand what happened with this movie. It had the potential to be alright, but it just sucked. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Sutherland are good actors, but what they were doing in this movie was not acting. It was horrendously bad, especially on Sutherland's part. I think that deserved a Razzie Award for sure. The "monster" was atrocious, i have seen better special effects on TV movies. This one reminded me of a big batch of mean "Batteries Not Included" aliens. Dumb. Although I did enjoy Pacula's performance, she didn't have much to work with, but she did make the best of it. 3/10 - doesn't surprise me that this one flopped.
