What is the use of watching a thriller if you already know what is going to happen. Well,there could be some surprises thrown in that make it worth wile. Apart from a couple of creepy moments this movie has nothing interesting to offer. From the start you know how everything will play out. This could have been just fine if this movie delivered on other fronts. Apart from one element there are no redeeming factors. I can't talk about this element without spoiling the movie. But it does gives a bizarre twist on matters. Warning: Don't expect too much from this twist however since it is the most ridiculous twist I have seen. Some explanation could have made it more acceptable. Is this movie a waste of time? If there is nothing on television and you have nothing better to do than you won't be sorry. As long as you don't expect too much.
