I couldn't stop laughing, this could easily become a cult classic for it's over the top writing, acting, music, everything. There were some hotter erotic scenes that were probably the only reason anyone ever watched the entire film. So predictable and ridiculous that it's one chuckle after another, so I guess I enjoyed it a little, but most likely not for the same reasons the film was made.<br /><br />Apparently I need to write 10 lines of text to be considered a full review, I thought I summed it up in 2 sentences. This movie has no direction, it wants to be too many things and ends up nowhere. My only comment on De Mornay is that although she had her moments, on stage and being sultry, it seems to me she has about as much talent as most strippers.<br /><br />This film is basically a failed attempt at anything, and a disgrace to the original.
