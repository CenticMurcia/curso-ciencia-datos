I really loved this film. I am still thinking about it! I also live in Parkdale and this place and its people are close to my heart. I also found the film to be really funny and I feel that I got to know each of the characters. It was really human and sensory. I am also interested in the process of making the film and the community's role, and would like to find out more info on that.<br /><br />The film also was relevant to me because I am currently working on a report to the Premier of Ontario on the Roots of Youth Violence with Mr. Alvin Curling and the Chief Justice Roy McMurty (please see www.rootsofyouthviolence.on.ca). We have been talking with youth and many others about their experiences with violence. I will strongly recommend that my colleagues (and friends and family) see this movie, as I think it is important for them to get a better understanding of some youth's lived experiences and their community's realities here in our city. <br /><br />I thought having the community discussion after the film was really important too because the film leaves you with a lot of hard questions and you want to talk about it. <br /><br />Anyway, thank you for this film. It was wonderfully done and acted. I am going to see it again. I liked the way it was shot and the scenes, which I can appreciate more the second time around. <br /><br />Peace, Lu-Anne Brezina
