I think that Kevin Bacon was the best Actor to play Ren Mcormick in the movie which now I OWN LOL. But really I love this movie and everybody they picked for the parts for the movie were perfect. The only thing I have to say is that it is so SAD that Chris Penn Died who played Willerd in the movie when I found that out I almost cried because he was found some were in Hollywood and it was i heart attack and he did gained a lot of weight since the movie footloose it you got to his name on this site you will get all the info about his death. When it happened and what exactly what happened. Just so y'all know. But this still is the best movie of almost all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
