Don't waist 2 hrs. of your life on this film. This movie is such a disappointment. the whole thing just has no direction. goes from one thing to another back to first and then on some other tangent. Worst off they knocked off Joe Dawson. I am a huge Highlander fan own the series own first film own final dimension and own endgame. This one like the second Hilander movie is not worth owning. Oh am I the only one who thought the voice of the guardian sounded like Christopher Lambert (Conner McCloud) at times? I had hoped for so much more of this movie. AAAAAA AAAA AAAAAAA AAAA AAAAAAA AAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAA AAAAAAA kk80kkk kk lololol nkn o 5
