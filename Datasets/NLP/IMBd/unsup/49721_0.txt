I have seen some truly awful films in my life, but this scrapes the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />It's as if a bunch of film-school try-hards were sent to Japan, without a script, and told to produce the most pointless cinematic experience possible. Partway throught the film, these film-school rejects meet a representative from the Japanese Tourist Board who pays them to insert further meaningless 'postcard' views of Japan.<br /><br />So, what could I learn from this film? - Gee, aren't the Japanese quirky and strange - Gee, isn't it difficult when I am in another country and I can't speak the language - Gee, isn't it strange that I feel alienated when I am in another country and make no effort to genuinely appreciate the culture or people - Gee, even shallow people can 'connect' when they meet other shallow people and decide to have a good whinge.<br /><br />The most insulting part of this whole mess is that it is currently rated, on this website, as the 175th best movie of all time.<br /><br />I weep for humanity.
