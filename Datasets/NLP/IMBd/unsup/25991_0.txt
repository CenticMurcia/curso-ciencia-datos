Howling IV (1988) is simply awful. This direct to video movies makes part three a cinema classic. Although the film-makers went back to producing a sleazy film (like part two). The results are pretty bad. They followed the tone of part two too closely. The resulting product is a bore. The acting is bad, the directing is bad, the storyline is bad and the cinematography is....you guessed it! Bad!! There's nothing worth noting about this movie. The actors are not pleasant to look at. Not one slightly attractive woman. The werewolf head was badly constructed. In one scene it looks like one of the eyes in it was burned out. Somebody should do more than one take!<br /><br />Like I already stated, this movie is nearly unwatchable. I can't find one thing I enjoyed about this movie. Well, I lied. The best part was the end! When I saw the credits roll I immediatly took the tape out and sent it back to the video store. I was afraid it might make my VCR sick!<br /><br />Not recommended.<br /><br />F<br /><br />P.S. I've seen worse believe me. Like The Strangers. But at least there was a part in that film that made it entertaining and the actresses were easy on the eyes.
