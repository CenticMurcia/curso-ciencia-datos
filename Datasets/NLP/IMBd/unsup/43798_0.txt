I don't understand how two teenage boys that put paper into machine instantly come out with a woman. It doesn't make any sense at all to me and that was the whole plot of the movie. All the boys wanted was to have a girlfriend and she ended up being ten years older than them. Plus they didn't know what to do with her. Then why did they create her in the first place? If I were Lisa, I would be running away from those two as fast as I could. The music is horrible and the special effects are the cheesiest I have ever seen. Then the piano comes out of the chimney and I don't have a clue what that has to do with making a human woman out of paper. This is one of the dumbest plots I have ever seen. Take it from Milhouse, nerds are smart.
