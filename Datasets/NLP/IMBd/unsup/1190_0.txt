Despite the summary above, this film actually does have some saving graces - 3 of them. Well, if you're a young male, that is...<br /><br />It's not worth talking about the plot of this film, there isn't one. It's not worth talking about the acting, there isn't any; not even from Robert Englund, who (frankly) ought to know better.<br /><br />However, young men take note: There are 3 pairs of deliciously natural-looking breasts on display at various points in the film. All totally unnecessary for the furtherance of the (non-existant) plot, but nice to see anyway...<br /><br />Oddly enough, if you're willing to ignore 1h29m of drivel, the final twist at the end actually bears a semblance of originality. Also, watching Jerry Trimble apeing Kurt Russell (albeit badly) is a hoot!<br /><br />If this film could be awarded zero stars, frankly that'd be all it deserved. One star is way to generous, but as that's the minimum I can give it, that's what it's got.
