I'm pretty sure, many who reviewed this movie here, have used this summary line. It's just the fact that it is true. It seems that most people can only love or hate this movie. They can not be indifferent about it though ... Which is of course something that suits Mr. Stone better than a "the movie is OK" statement. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't like that! <br /><br />And as much as he wouldn't like that, the same bitterness (or maybe hatred) is coming from Quentin Tarantino. He absolutely loathes what Oliver Stone has done with his material (original script is by Tarantino). Although I can't say, what a more accurately Tarantino script would have looked like as movie, I can say that I do like what Stone did. I'm more than satisfied with his interpretation and re-imagining of Tarantino's original draft! <br /><br />For some it might be too violent, for some too crazy (some shots just seem ... out of this world, which is of course the point). The colour palette Stone uses is also incredible (especially the green tone for certain emotional charged scenes, because green represents something in the movie ... when you watch it you will figure it out), but he was also experimenting a lot with this film. He used different cameras, different lenses, different formats ... anything he could get his hands on that would produce "film".<br /><br />This paragraph sees a comparison with another movie, if you don't want to read this, just skip it! Many have compared it to Bonnie & Clyde, but for me there are more parallels to the Terence Malick movie Badlands to be found here!<br /><br />And of course his experiment was incredible successful (I'm not saying that you will like it, but that was what Stone was aiming for!)
