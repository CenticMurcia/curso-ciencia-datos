I have always been a Fan of the Beautiful and Talented Annette Funicello. In fact I own a VHS of this movie that I was fortunate enough to buy on eBay which was sent out prior to the movie being shown on television. I understand that these are sent out to the Lucky folks who decide on whether on not the movie should be part of an awards show, like the Oscars etc. On the top of the cover it says " for your consideration" Outstanding made for Television Movie, A Dream is a Wish Your Hearts Makes, for your consideration Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or Special, Annette Funicello. This VHS has of course become a Prize in my Annette Collection. The movie is Wonderful. It gives a lot of insight into the life of Annette. Seeing Annette again is a great experience, especially now that the disease MS has done so much to her physically, and yet she chose to do this to help make all aware of the devastation of this disease. She is so Warm and Lovingly kind in the movie that you can't help but Love and Respect her. It is definitely a Movie worth watching.
