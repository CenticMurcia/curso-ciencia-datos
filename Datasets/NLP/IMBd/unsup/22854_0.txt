Well, having sat through countless low-budget monster flicks in my time, Gary Jones' SPIDERS is like a breath of fresh air. Okay, it's all very predictable, with the old conspiracy style "government creates some kind of horrible hybrid monster via experiment that goes wrong" storyline being utilised in the same old way countless movies have before. However, it's to Nu Image's credit that they've produced such a fun, energetic monster movie, which more often than not actually manages to betray it's low-budget origins very successfully.<br /><br />Even the performances are all pretty good, at least as far as these "B" movies go, although the script gets progressively more desperate as the movie goes on, particularly during the excellent TARANTULA style finale when the giant spider wreaks havoc in the city. Indeed, despite the sometimes laughable dialogue, SPIDERS succeeds where it might have failed, in that the special effects are quite superb. Okay, we're not talking top of the range Hollywood here, but the KNB guys have produced their magic again with some very impressive animatronic effects sequences. The CGI spider also comes across very well, and I was hugely impressed with the finale, where I couldn't believe so much had been achieved on such a low budget.<br /><br />No, it's nothing ground breakingly original, but then it never pretends to be for one minute. SPIDERS is pure and simply a "fun" and at times "creepy" monster movie, and comes highly recommended.
