This isn't a good movie, Starring usually good actors like Hill Harper, Taryn Manning and Michelle Rodriguez that don't seem to focused this time maybe they fought it would be like a vacation shooting the movie.<br /><br />Two people have bigger roles than them, I don't know their names nor would I want to considering how awful they are.<br /><br />The movie is NOT SCARY, while being trapped by devious dogs from hell they manage to have a good time drinking and stuff.<br /><br />Not much more to say really, I guess if you already are afraid of dogs like some people are then you might get scared but otherwise, no.<br /><br />Being a guy who's had a lot of dogs, I could tell that the dogs were in a happy mood for most of the time, which is good for the dogs BUT bad for the movie-watcher because all the tension is thrown out the window.<br /><br />And the end was incredibly bad as well, because well I won't spoil it BUT the end is not satisfying.
