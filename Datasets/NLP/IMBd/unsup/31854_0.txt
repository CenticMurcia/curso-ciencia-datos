This was on the Comedy Channel a few months ago, and I loved it. I thought it was the most hilarious show I have ever seen. I saw Lano and Woodley live once a couple of years ago in Mount Gambier (where I live, and they were so funny then as well. <br /><br />I saw The Island from about a quarter of the way through, and I don't think I stopped laughing through the whole thing. When Woodley grabbed the fire extinguisher from behind the stage, and Lano is like, "You can't use that. It belongs to the theater. We're trapped on a desert island!" I laughed so hard I almost cried. And when Woodley just ignores him and puts the fire extinguisher on various parts of Colin's body, going, "I'm going to freeze your back-knees, and then I'm going to freeze your right eye, so when you walk down the street, everyone will look at you and say 'oh, look at him. He can only move one eye because the other one was frozen with a fire extinguisher'," and so on and so forth. He just keeps rambling on about freezing him, and then it turns out that the fire extinguisher is empty, because Colin had been mucking around with it before the show. <br /><br />Anyone who has seen this show will know what I say when I say, I loved the stage hand Clem. Also, how Woodley just changes the end of the storyline so that they get off the island safely. AND, when Woodley says, "Oh, I was just worried you'd fall off the stage and land on your cock." For those of you who don't know, there was a fake chicken on a wire attached to Colin's pants. <br /><br />My absolute favorite bit though, is when, at the very end, they are in Heaven and on wires and spinning around. When Wooodley bounces on the wire and makes the thing tilt and makes Lano bounce, and Lano is going, "Oh s**t," every time he does it, I was laughing so hard I almost wet myself.<br /><br />The Island is hilarious. Hire the DVD, and I am sure you will be more than satisfied with what you get.<br /><br />Here is a quote:<br /><br />Colin- Okay, we're going to make two teams. Woodley- (putting his hand up and jumping up and down) Ooh, ooh, ooh! Colin- What? Woodley- Can I be on your team?<br /><br />I give The Island 10/10 any day!!!
