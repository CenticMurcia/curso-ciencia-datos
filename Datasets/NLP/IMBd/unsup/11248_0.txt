This is a comedy about a widower who wants his three daughters to be married. Bridgette Lin is a hard as nails police detective, Maggie Cheung is a social worker and Chingmy Yau is a doctor. They almost bribe men to pass themselves off as their boyfriends, to make their father happy. You see a lot of comic slapstick, especially from Bridgette, who kicks major butt. The guys in the film are fun to watch also. A film like this rests on the stars, and Bridgette, Maggie and Chingmy make things work. As an added and very welcome bonus, the really great comedic actress Sandra Ng plays the gold digging pen pal of the father, who comes to Hong Kong and wants everything. Not to be taken too seriously, its just a lot of fun. I think you'll enjoy it.
