Here we have yet another movie directed by someone who has absolutely no business behind a camera. His last name is Olmos. Edward James Olmos is in the movie. Gee, I wonder who he's related to? Someone needs to educated these awful wannabe directors that a bunch of jump cuts in every scene doesn't look cool, it looks like the editor and/or director didn't have a clue what they were doing. Of course, there's a lot of hand held camera work here, which is terrible.<br /><br />There is bad acting by everyone involved (of course all the women are hot) and if you can't figure out who the killer is in the first ten minutes, you've never watched a movie before. I couldn't even finish this awful movie (I got about 40 minutes into before I just couldn't take it anymore) but there was no doubt who the killer was.<br /><br />There are so many of these types of movies coming out now where the director has lots of quick edits, hand held cameras and jump cuts throughout the film, please please tell me this isn't how all movies are going to be done from now on.<br /><br />Remember the days when directors actually directed films?
