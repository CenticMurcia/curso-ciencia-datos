STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /><br />There were some things I was aware of before I even sat down to see Sci-Fighter. I knew the plot regarding a video game that sucks users into it whereby they must fight to come out alive was laughably ridiculous. I knew Don 'the Dragon' Wilson couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. And I knew it was a low budget sci-fi actioner, so I didn't get my hopes up too much. I just sat back, switched off my brain and tried to enjoy a guilty piece of fun. That I still came away very disappointed should speak volumes of the lowly piece of trash I was treated to.<br /><br />The cast and director of Wilson's previous dud Redemption are re-teamed here. Though the film styles are different, they are as big a let-down as one another.<br /><br />The film has a really cheap looking feel. I know it's made for DVD, but these are almost of home video standard. And the fights are really tepid. This is especially bad since the film proudly boasts a host of martial arts stars and their accomplishments in the lead roles.<br /><br />Story-wise, the plot is incoherent and really badly paced, meaning one scene doesn't relate well to the next and there's the clich√©d, stereo-typical angle of the dead mother and father and son struggling to bond sub-plot.<br /><br />I knew this wasn't going to be a work of high-art. I only had minimalist expectations for a cheap, harmless bit of fun. It speaks volumes that this couldn't even accomplish this. *
