this is a great piece of the late 60's early 70's festival scene. It is a real moving tribute to a more free wheelin' lifestyle, being that it is one of the last major festivals.<br /><br />Although, a lot of the festival turned out badly (cops being uptight about drugs, violence in the audience, performers threatening not to play because of money, on-stage fires, etc.), an underlying message of hope and peace prevails. <br /><br />The film shows the dying nature of the ideal "hippy" spirit and marks a change in time from the revolutionary late 60's to the more straight laced 70's. <br /><br />Performances by Joni Mitchel, The Who, The Doors, Joan Baez, etc. make it a great concert to watch.
