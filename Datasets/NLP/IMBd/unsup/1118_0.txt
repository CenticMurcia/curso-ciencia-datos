I found the documentary to be a very refreshing look at what the artists are thinking with regards to a changing culture. While yes, I do question the artists that are complaining about the $$ they are losing because of downloading, etc. I still feel like Rosanna truly made a good effort at getting everyone's point of view, opinion (whether it be selfish/shallow/stupid/excellent/wise), and their passion for their art. More than anything it gave me hope that some artists of the past/present are still trying to make contact and teach those of the present into the future because they care about where the quality of music goes. It's TRUE!! Image is starting to be everything when it comes to the music! What happened to the art of expressing it regardless of whether your nose is crooked, teeth crooked, whatever! Lyrics and music should touch your soul, voice helps, looks should be way down on the list! Great documentary...I very much doubt these voices and artists of the past are bitter -- they are concerned for the future of true music and artisans!
