There are many shows this season that have had a great premise only to drag and loose my interest after just a few episodes.<br /><br />Reaper is one I am glade to say is the exception.<br /><br />There is a dark humor to this show; like in Angel and Buffy tat makes each episode entertaining, it doesn't bore you the way Charmed did.<br /><br />This show is great, the characters and stories have been great even if they are a little predictable. This show has been getting better with each show and it has a sub story that keep's you guessing, like why is his dad keeping him from seeing the contract and what is the Devil not telling him.<br /><br />I look forward to this show every week and will miss it when it goes off for the holidays. I hope the writer's strike doesn't kill it.
