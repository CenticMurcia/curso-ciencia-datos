This is an above average Norris film, with a decent plot, and some good fight scenes.Chuck gives a pretty good performance here, and all the fight scenes were great, plus, the finale was awesome!. The setting was cool, and i really liked the aggressiveness Chuck had in this one plus, the 2 main villains were great!. it did drag a bit in the middle, and it is a bit long in the tooth, however i enjoyed this film, as it has lots of great fights, a decent plot and, some good eye candy. The character development is actually quite decent, and i liked most of the characters, plus Chuck was at his best here!. This is above average Norris flick,that i enjoyed quite a bit, as it had a decent plot, above average performances, and great fight scenes!. The Direction is good. James Fargo does a good job here, with good camera work, good shots during the fight scenes, and keeping the film at a good pace!. There is a little bit of blood and violence. We get a few bloody gunshot wounds, harsh beatings,decapitation and a face is bashed in on a boat (Nasty). The Acting is pretty good. Chuck Norris is fantastic as always, and gives a very good acting performance here, he is very likable, kicked that ass, had good charisma, only problem i had is, he didn't show enough emotion, he was great though! (Norris rules). Frank Michael Liu and David Opatoshu both do well as the main villains. Overall well worth a watch!. *** out of 5
