The lighting was bad, the dialog was stiff, unnatural and awkward, the camera work was jumpy and distracting, the sound was in and out, and the acting was terrible.<br /><br />There was nothing redeeming about this movie. Given the cheesy blue screen work (a montage P-Town scenes behind an actor as he marches/struts in place instead of actual film of the actor walking down a street), I should not have expected much, but this disappointed even my limited hope.<br /><br />Low budget films have been done in the past - and done well (Clerks), but this one feels and looks schlocky. After watching it, you feel that your 8 year old niece or nephew could have done better with the family camcorder. What amazes me is that Miramax picked it up and released it.
