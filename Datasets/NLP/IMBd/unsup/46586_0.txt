My impressions of the first half: Too many characters. Too much chaos. Not enough soul. Too many deus ex machina rescues. Lower production values (a large percentage of the movie obviously took place in one, large, circular room that was redressed for different scenes) For me, Farscape is about tight plotting: building tension, keeping focus on the characters and the situation, and tightening the screws as one thing after another gets frelled. This was "much ado about nothing".<br /><br />Chiana now has Matrix-style moves and magic eyes. D'Argo is pretty much scenery. The interrupted wedding gag was stale the first time. Sikozou was so unrecognizable that we thought it was a new actress. The central gag involving Rygel strained disbelief and was itself a distraction. Basically, major characters had no reason to be on screen, and should have been given a purpose; secondary characters should have been denied their cameos. The creators (could it even be the same team that made the series in its prime?) have focused so much on making this "the last hurrah" that they lost site of making it good!<br /><br />My wife kept chanting "Star Wars Christmas Special" the whole time; gratuitous reunions with characters we don't have time to see. Big explosions. Ridiculous revelations.<br /><br />The rumors are that they compressed the major arc of season five into the equivalent of four episodes; this seems to be true, and they've jettisoned everything that made Farscape special in the process. I will be watching the second half tonight, but my expectations are low.
