I've noticed a lot of people here made negative comments about this movie, but I don't see why. I really liked it. I always enjoyed reading Dennis the Menace comics and watching the cartoon in the 80s. I really thought the plot was interesting. I also liked how Dennis kept outsmarting that robber. It's really a good family movie with swear words or anything in this movie, (except for when Mr. Wilson says the abbreviation for 'gosh darn.'). I recommend for the people who disliked this movie to watch it again and give it another try.
