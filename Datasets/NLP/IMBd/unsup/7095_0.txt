Just saw this, on a VHS collection titled Hollywood Comedy Classics. It was fun, to spot all the famous stars, and with it being just past the end of the silent era, lots of well known silent stars were there. Buster Keaton, Stan Luarel, Oliver Hardy and Harold Lloyd were easy to spot. Also saw Wallace Beery, Barbara Stanwyck, and Joan Crawford. Also noticed Joe E. Brown, not because I knew him by sight, but his voice I knew from the movie "Some Like It Hot". He played the character of Osgood Fielding III, the older wealthy gentleman that was pursuing Jack Lemmon when he was in drag! The plot device is just something to hand the movie on, but it is well worth your time. If you are good at spotting Hollywood stars, keep your eyes open for this one!
