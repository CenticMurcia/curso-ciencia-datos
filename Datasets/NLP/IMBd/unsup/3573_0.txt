I absolutely love this movie. I watch it several times a year during the Christmas season. It is such fun. If it were on DVD I would buy it in a heartbeat. It has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it on ABC Family Channel when it first come out. I would love to have it on DVD. I have it on tape from the airing on TV but it is getting so worn that its not very clear anymore. I would love to have it without the cuts for commercials. I would recommend this movie for anyone who is sentimental about Christmas and loves a good comedy and a little romance also. Of course it has a happy ending too! Mimi Rodgers and Rob Stewart have a charisma in the movie and Marla Maples plays just villain enough to keep you hoping that she gets the boot. Danny is really the perfect offset to all the adult issues going on and His friendship with Melanie is really a touching part to the movie. I also enjoy the ambitious manipulating that April does to get Melanies promotion and how that her boss sees the outward appearance and not the talent underneath.
