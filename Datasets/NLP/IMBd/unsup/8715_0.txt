This is not a light-weight, commercial or formula, film. It is a brave journey into the human soul. The "damsel in distress" is an inanimate object, the Red Violin. It evokes varied, sometimes profound, emotional reactions from all who see it for what it is. <br /><br />There are many fine performances, especially by Samuel L. Jackson. Excellent direction.<br /><br />
