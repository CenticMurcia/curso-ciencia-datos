The movie does a nice job of contrasting Pacino as an insightful, sensitive, and articulate dude when sober, against someone who inevitably says and does really stupid things when he's blotto. I like the fact that the movie doesn't beat you over the head with this message.<br /><br />Pacino gives another outstanding performance, and he is beginning to look like the ultimate winner of the Pacino/DeNiro sweepstakes, based on lifetime achievement (although neither career is far from over).<br /><br />This makes a good double-bill with "The Big Easy." They both feature Ellen Barkin at a time in her career when sizzling sex scenes seemed to be written into her contract.
