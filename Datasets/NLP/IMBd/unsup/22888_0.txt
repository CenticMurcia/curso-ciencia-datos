I thought this movie was excellent.I have been looking for it for a long time, since it has not been on TV. It took place in a time that was a very much a part of my lifestyle in the 60's and 70's. The music and whole hippie atmosphere is very dear to my heart. I wish they would have made a sequel to sunshine Christmas which was done after sunshine and told the story about SAM and Jill. I was always curious as to what happened to both of them since this was a true story. It was a real love story and definitely a tearjerker but it also showed a mother's true love for her daughter. She knew she would die and wanted to leave her something. The journals were a brilliant idea and I think she showed a lot of courage to not do drugs or chemotheraphy so she could keep her head clear. She loved that little girl so much that she died earlier than she had to.
