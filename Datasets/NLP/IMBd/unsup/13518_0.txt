The premise is too good not to be told in a movie - a couple of siamese twins, who are society outcasts, bump into a girl which falls in love with one of the twins. Just read like this, it could be a comedy, but here the drama takes over. Heavy-written, and heavy in tone, this is no walk on the park. The Polish brothers achieve the illusion of making us believe that they are real siamese twins, and the real triumph of this movie is making us feel the crisis they experience. But it is a strange movie, probably they made it on purpose, and one of its assets is not having a known face (making the story so much believable). Don't expect to come out with a smile after this one, even though it is an interesting experience.
