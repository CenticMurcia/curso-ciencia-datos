This movie is extremely unrealistic and to say the least predictable. Santi seems to make every shot into a goal. And they are not just ordinary or good goals, they are amazing goals. I'm talking about volleys and bicycles, how often does that happen in the champions? And to the same guy? Sure, Zizou might pull it off, but to do it consistently? I think that if a movie is to be made about football, realism is quite important. <br /><br />I do like how they integrate the many stars that real has. It seems that at times santi and gavin are really playing alongside henry, David, zizou, robbie, etc. But I do have to say... what the hell is Nick Cannon doing here? What? It's fine that they put him in a breakdance or basketball or detective movie. But football? I could not stop laughing when i saw him in the finals. Maybe he's got an important part in the third movie... I hope he does... because he seems extremely out of place in goal II. <br /><br />I don't' know if there is a rule about the finals of the champions being played at home, but even if it's allowed, what a coincidence that the finals for that year was played in the Bernabeu. then there is the whole is - she - my - mother - and - why - did - you - not - tell - me - i -am - so - sad - and - confused issue paired with the i - kissed - another - girl - and - my - gf - is - mad - now - i - need - to - make - it - up - to - her issue... and he still manages to score game winning an game defining goals.<br /><br />Now the plot was too foreseeable. as soon as that jordana girl shows up, it was pretty much spelled out that he was gonna have to apologize to his gf. and then the whole mother thing was also very predictable. it was expected that santi was going to get into trouble because of his mom. and last but not least, we all expected santi to be the best player in madrid. He makes all these improbable goals and who could actually be shocked with madrid coming back from 2-0 and beating the gunners all in a span of 6 minutes?<br /><br />Oh... and why is santi and his mom speaking in Englsih? They start in Spanish.. but end in English? They might as well speak in Spanish since they already introduced Spanish throughout the whole film.
