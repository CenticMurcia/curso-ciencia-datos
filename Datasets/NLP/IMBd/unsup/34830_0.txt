God help us with "Indie films" like these. It is almost embarrassing and disgraceful to even consider such designation for this underachievement.<br /><br />The only rational and redeeming explanation for 100% compromise of this movie... if Amy Redford was completely enslaved to financial side of this movie. Because this $ide was writing and directing movie with all the usual and predictable demographic/sexual triviality hooks. So familiar with our society today. Such simple and honest premise is corrupted from the moment Saffron leaves the hospital.<br /><br />It is pointless to comment all trivialities and the length this movie voyages without a hint of single intelligent solution : She is a vegetarian but she decides since she has nothing to loose, she can "stop the torture" and enjoy the flesh again.<br /><br />Your common pizza delivery girl with hundreds of weekly visits has time to develop such profound relationship with Melody. In fact, the second visit would even grant her a touch of lesbian romance.<br /><br />Your average delivery guy with hundreds of weekly visits develops a grand sensibility after couple of visits and dedicates his body even more for that extra pleasure to our lonely melody. But wait, since we have a very clear targeted demographic with such prosaic hooks; lets, lets even offer threesome pleasure to be even safer with the audience.<br /><br />What do we learn from her state? The real question is : What Does Melody Learns From Here? Nothing! Almost as emphatic as our society, same void would strike her own values : Eat, Sleep, copulate and amply consume at that. Consume as much as you can! Let material possessions supplement all of your problems. At least one thing is clear, Amy Redford movie making is immature and even that is a compliment. I haven't seen any of her previous or later attempts, but if this is best she can do, then she is in the wrong field of profession.<br /><br />The only pleasant thing to watch is Melody's loft. The most creative thing you will find about this movie is the nice PS picture from the official poster.
