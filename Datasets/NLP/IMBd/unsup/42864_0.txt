People shouldn't judge independent films like they would the special Olympics, all movies must be held to the same standards. I watched about a half hour of this crap before becoming so angry that i couldn't continue.<br /><br />The actors were ugly and talentless and i couldn't identify or empathize with them at all. I don't care if you have a zero dollar budget, you find people who are believable and have some charisma and presence.<br /><br />The CG was on par with a PC game from 1996, so i don't know why everyone was raving about it.<br /><br />The direction was the second worst part of the movie (the first being the actors), i guess some people have no artistic vision. That in combination with the shi**y editing made it look like a horrible commercial of sorts.<br /><br />set design, costumes, and everything else just failed to resemble anything star wars.<br /><br />Fighting...what fighting? the actors seemed confused here. why are there so many ugly women pretending that they know how to even begin to fight.<br /><br />I am filled with much anger and disgust, and also filled with thoughts of genocide.
