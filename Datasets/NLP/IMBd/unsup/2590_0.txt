The writers of this film did their research and knew their Lewis & Clark history.<br /><br />While much of the film is, in all honesty, an extended Saturday Night Live skit, at times it is clever and witty. But what made it stand out for me was the accuracy to the time period.<br /><br />The clothing is very accurate, the modes of speech are very accurate, the philosophy of the time period is correctly portrayed. Also, the Spanish DID send out an expedition from Mexico to try and cut off Lewis and Clark. In this film, that expedition makes contact with the characters and mayhem results.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film, though it was tedious in a couple of places, but the attention to historic detail and accuracy is what encapsulated me...I'm a historian after all...and this was something welcome in a low-budget, B-grade comedy.
