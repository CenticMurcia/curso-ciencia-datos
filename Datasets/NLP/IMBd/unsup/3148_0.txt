I must admit that I rather enjoyed this Sherlock Holmes fantasy story. Nicholas Rowe is, in my mind, the perfect Holmes physically. His acting was also spot on, perfectly capturing Holmes' enormous ego. The only negative about this story is that it falls back on some of the Holmes film clichés. For example, the bumbling Dr. Watson, which I think is an insult to the well-written, intelligent character of the novels. I'd like to see Watson used as something more than just comic relief. Another bad cliché is the action-hero side of Holmes. It doesn't work for his character, I find. Although it sometimes relies on the fact that the viewer hasn't read the novels and thus doesn't understand the real characters, I loved this story. While a bit violent, it perfectly captures the brilliant feel of the novels.
