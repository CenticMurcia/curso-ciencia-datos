It was last night that I got around to seeing this film. I expected something of a martial arts fest and I was right. But what was utterly disappointing was that it was topped off with so much useless garbage that I barely could keep watching. Michael Qissi, though he does and OK job with the stunt choreography, should not direct. He lacks the capability to direct others and the cinematography was totally sick. It is clearly evident that the guy had no proper experience directing a good movie. One thing props up in my mind every time I think about the film, the betrayal. The leads character is betrayed at the beginning of the story, a shot to the heart. However, instead of treating it with certain horror to it, the guy openly touches his wound and rather than show himself the blood, he holds it out for others to see, that too at full arms length. The martial arts are not too shabby but I was disappointed to find out that most of Qissi's martial arts focused on the sheer strength of the fighter. It is a well known fact, since the late Bruce Lee's time, that it does not matter how strong the opponent is, It matters how you quick you react and how fast you can move. Overall, I see that the movie is not for me nor for any fan of the true spirit of martial arts. However, if you want a story that can show you all the violence you want coupled with some extremely bad acting and direction, this should be at the top of your pick.
