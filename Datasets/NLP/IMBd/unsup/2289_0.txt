This 3-part production is the most perfect thing I've ever seen on television - the writing, acting, direction, locations, costumes, etc are faultless. Episode two, where Lady Slane learns that Mr Fitzgeorge fell in love with her when they were young, but never revealed his love, is a triumph, and reduces me to tears every time I watch it. Why this series isn't available on commercial release is a mystery, because they just don't get any better than this.
