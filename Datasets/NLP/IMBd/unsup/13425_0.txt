Being a sucker for anything 80's I rate this film probably higher than it deserves. It is still alotta fun though. The performances are OK -expectedly so by a young Hanks and Daryl Hannah. Eugene Levy actually is pretty funny as the Mad disregarded scientist. Enjoyed people's constant berating and disregard for him The running humor with him spraying women with water and getting punched out with bad sound effects is classically great and cheesy. Splash is a modern fairy tale type movie with all the music and atmosphere of mid-80s New York. The movie runs a briskly from start to finish. It is by no means an important movie, but rather one that you can watch on a rainy afternoon or enjoy again if you haven't seen it for awhile. Worth buying if cheap.
