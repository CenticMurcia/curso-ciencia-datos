this is one bizarre movie.it's sick and twisted and perverse.and it has to be dun tongue in cheek.there's just no way this was s opposed to be a serious movie.i guess you could call it a black comedy/horror-if you really wanted to.most of the movie is atrocious,including the very hammy overacting,the even worse dialogue and the even worse than that script.yet it is oddly(very oddly,)entertaining at points,and very boring at others.it's between 95 and 97 minutes,depending on whether you watch the rated or unrated edition,not including credits.the one positive thing about this movie is that the makeup effects weren't half bad.still,i'm glad it ended when it did.i don't think i could've taken anymore inane dialogue.the most i ca give this thing is a 4/10,for it's entertaining moments.
