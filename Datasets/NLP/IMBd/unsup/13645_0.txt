While not a big film, director Henry Koster again crafts a small gem of a person who shapes the lives of generations of students in her small town. Along with "Goodbye Mr. Chips" and Mr. Hollands Opus" this film is one of a handful of films that comes along once in a generation that leaves you feeling good and yet touched by the affection in the film. Under a stern and crusty exterior Miss Dove reflects on the course of her life as a teacher, when she is rushed to the hospital. Students come from everywhere to celebrate her and out of concern for her. It is the happy ending, like that in "Mr. Holland's Opus" and the mixture of humor and gentle drama of "Goodbye Mr. Chips" revisited and done well. I hope that it will eventually be available on DVD. I give it two thumbs up.
