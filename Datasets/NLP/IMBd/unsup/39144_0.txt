This movie was quite possibly the stupidest movie I have ever seen. Some how, the soviets have managed to evade Europe, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, nuclear weapons, the combined armed forces of the US, NATO, and managed to invade the US, with the - sit down for this - help of Cuba. I don't know if coke made its debut in Hollywood around this time,or if John Milius had mental complications, but there is just no plausible excuse for this movie- it is absolutely dreadful. A group of teens are ruggedly morphed into righteous insurgent fighters, fighting to save America from some amalgam of Latinos and a soviet army somehow gifted with obvious teleportation abilities. American teens prevail in the end against the entire soviet army, who have popped into existence in the heart of middle America, by means known only to John Milius. I know we all have to start somewhere, and Milius was probably a little hormone crazed from eating raw dead animals in the tradition of any good American conservative, but, come on now! The only person I can think of that would have loved this movie is Ted Nugent who's grasp on reality has always been tenuous at best. The people who seem to have loved this movie, most of whom are now right wing Republicans, probably saw this movie as a boys wet dream of being an action hero and saving his country. And yet Milius went on to be a screen writer for the movie apocalypse now. Go figure. Reading other user comments this movie seemed to appeal to people imbued with a sense of unreality,people decrying the intrinsic Communism of Hollywood while most of the reviews coming from outside the US almost universally condemn this movie as being idiotic at best. Watch this movie again if you can sit through it, it will give you an idea of the mindset,( and I use the term loosely) of the right wing in the US.
