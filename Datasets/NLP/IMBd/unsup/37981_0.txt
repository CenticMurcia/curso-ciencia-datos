I first saw this movie visiting my uncle in Florida for the summer when I was 10 years old. I'm sure I watched a fair number of TV shows and movies that summer. I remember none of the shows or movies - save this one. Unfortunately, I saw this and have remembered it these nearly 30 years - but only because it was so God awful.<br /><br />It started out weird enough and got my attention. A lady develops a tumor like bulge on her neck, a shrink's patients start freaking out, surgeons and doctors can't treat the woman but it just got weirder and weirder while the actors tried to keep a straight face. Over the top acting, bad special affects and a bizarre plot that just not translate to the screen make this watchable only if you also enjoy seeing car wrecks.<br /><br />The finale was pure 1970's cheesy special effects that make the old Star Trek sets look high brow in comparison. I have been haunted by this horrible piece of film making for most of my life and fear that the memories will remain with me forever. If you have not yet experienced the crappiness that is the Manitou - save yourself - and rent anything else.
