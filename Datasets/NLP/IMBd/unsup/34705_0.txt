After watching this (and I use the term loosely) film, I find myself wishing that the Grim Reaper had killed me before I chose to press that accursed play button. Terrible story, Horrible acting, the only redeeming feature of this monstrosity is they all die in the end.<br /><br />I've never seen any Michael Feifer films before this and if the rest are of a similar quality I won't be seeing any in the foreseeable future.<br /><br />I'm glad that I chose to download it instead of wasting money buying it. I'm happy in the knowledge that a simple press of the delete key has removed this piece of s#!t from my collection forever. Now if only I could delete it from my memory.
