I had always kind of dismissed this movie as sensationalist 60's hipness. But seeing it today in the 21st century and knowing that there is as far as I know NO Movies today that even come close to approaching the examination of marriage/love/friendship that Bob Carol Ted and Alice does I feel like I've accidentally stumbled on a forgotten gem. From the opening frames of the commune/retreat there is not a dull moment in the film. It seems quaint to think of people discussing things like what they honestly think and feel about one another since we are much more socially advanced today (ha ha). I think every married couple should see this movie if for nothing else than the conversation that is sure to ensue afterwards. Great performances by the four main players. In fact revelatory acting especially by Natalie Wood since she probably had the most to lose by appearing in the film a la Brando in Last Tango. Not that this is a heavy movie it isn't but that doesn't mean it is not thought provoking. The actors here seem to hit no false notes. Plus the cinematography of Charles Lang is like being transported right back to 1969.
