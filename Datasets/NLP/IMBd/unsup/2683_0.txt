even though it was made many years ago, it stands up as a great film, wonderfully acted and directed. The previous reviewer says everything so I will just add that if you can find the uncut version, there is a scene with Conchita (Angela Molina) dancing flamenco in the nude that lasts a good few minutes and is not cut like in the Criterion DVD... this full scene adds weight and more strength to the film and brings home the main character's jealousy more. It is the turning point of the film and it is a shame that it was cut, not even keeping the uncut version for adults to see. <br /><br />This is the only scene that was cut from the film and when you consider what is in other films it is difficult to understand why, I think the main reason was to obtain a younger certificate for the film. If you are a fan of Angela Molina then check out 'The Eyes The Mouth' to see more of her. It was also good to see Carole Bouquet in 'That Obscure..' in her pre James Bond days. All three main characters are superb actors. Oh how I wish I could find the uncut version!..lol If you know where I can obtain a copy of the uncut (107 min duration) please email me at paul22@paul22.freeserve.co.uk ..enjoy!
