I'm not sure why this film has been rated so low, but I'm going to guess it's because most people go into every movie they watch expecting it to be Citizen Kane, and then rate the movie with a 1 because it wasn't a Hollywood blockbuster with 10 million dollar explosions.I'm assuming if you're checking this movie out, you are either a Troma fan or a Zombie fan. While they might not be Zombies as you would normally imagine them, this film does feature plenty of undead characters.<br /><br />If you love gore, then you will enjoy this film, as the blood and guts are pretty evenly distributed throughout the film and pretty well done for a low budget film. There were a few instances that were so great that I rewound them and watched them again. If you enjoy the atmosphere that 90's cheesiness is able to offer, then again, this is the film for you.<br /><br />I am rating this film 10 because I believe other people have severely underestimated the film, and I feel its poor rating might deter viewers. But then again, this is a Troma release, so maybe not.<br /><br />8/10
