" Irina Palm " is a curious combination of the British village comedy and raunchy HBO special. The story of a grandmother who resorts to desperate measures to make money for her sick grandson's operation could've easily been a tearjerker for simpletons. Fortunately that didn't happen. Maggie is a sad ,lonely, middle-aged frump who spent her life just plodding along. Her life's greatest humiliation somehow turned into a hope for better future all around. It would be impossible to tell this highly unusual story without creative actors. Marianne Faithful may not be the greatest actress in the world, but in this part she fits the bill perfectly. Her sultry deep voice and her tired, natural face speak for themselves. Serbian actor Miki Manojlovic plays his role with great flair and charm. This is a small, independent flick that makes us believe in power of brave ideas.
