I completely understand this movie has a low rating here, but still I give it a 10 out of 10! Why? Because it's a must-see for horror marathon lovers! It really has all the clich√©'s! Ranging from talking zombies to drug addicts who get slayed. From a whole variety of f- and s-words you never knew existed to a big breasted girl who runs trough the forest! It has it all! The soundtrack from Scorpions Ralph Rieckermann (how they got him to perform an entire soundtrack for them is beyond me, he must also be a b-movie horror-fan!) really rocks out and makes the movie even more enjoyable to watch. People I particularly liked in this movie where the drug addict gangster and the lead girl, they all act surprisingly good for this production and I loved it. I loved how the lead girl bit her lip trough tension moments, she was dead-sexy.<br /><br />This movie is for real metal heads and horror-fans who like to have a good laugh all alike to top things all up they even have a semi-death-counter in this movie so you can see how many people bloody bill has slaughtered. I don't want to spoil any surprises any further, if you like gore, if you are a deep down sadist maniac and you like dark humor this movie is a must see. I suggest you go see it with your friends and have a spliff or some beers with it. It's a lot of fun and you won't be disappointed! If you happen to own a small cinema and are looking for a movie to put in that nights play-list, I highly suggest Bloody Bill.<br /><br />Oh, I also hope to see more of this production team and also the stars of this movie, they really gave it their best. What I also liked was the way this movie used special ambient lighting techniques that made the gore all the better to watch!
