After just watching this film for the first time, I have decided that not only do I want my money back, but I want the one hour and forty five minutes of my life back. Lets start with the plot. This is confusing at best, with two men transported in time from 1943 to 1984, one of whom gets returned, the other not and the one that does not has to save the world from the vortex created by a military experiment. This isn't in itself too bad, but it fails to explain why the man didn't simply return to their base and speak to someone who knew about the experiment, but instead goes on the run across the country, getting involved with a really annoying woman and killing a few people along the way. As for the acting, if people pelted the actors with eggs at a screening, it's probably to go with the ham they served up here. The special effects were disappointing. Any film post "Star Wars" should be able to do better than this. And don't even start me on the eighties hair !!!
