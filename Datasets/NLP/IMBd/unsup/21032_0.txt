Pros: Good visuals; decent soundtrack; good general idea for a movie.<br /><br />Cons: Utter cr*p for a script; very bad acting overall with only few exceptions; laughable, pathetic characters; illogical, predictable, stupid.<br /><br />I can't believe action movies can get THIS bad these days. The idiotic excuse-for-a-script serves only two purposes: some excuse for on-screen violence and the use of the f-word as pretty much the only verb the "characters" use in their communication. Is this supposed to be funny or have some "deeper meaning" or something? Compared to the others in the genre -- "Pulp Fiction", "Reservoir Dogs", "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels", "Natural Born Killers", "Dobermann", "Dogma" -- this one is an unbelievable pile of garbage and a real PAIN to sit through. Do not even bother to rent.<br /><br />p.s. A Russian mafia boss with a surname of Pavlova? Heck, why didn't they just name him Mary-Ann?
