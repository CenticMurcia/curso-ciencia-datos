Mississippi Burning is set in 1964 when three civil rights activists are murdered in a small town by the Ku Klux Klan Two of them were white and one of them black<br /><br />Based on actual events in Philadelphia, the screenplay centers chiefly on the hostility relationship between the two FBI agents (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) sent down to the small Mississippi town to seek information about the vanishing of the three victims Immediately upon their arrival, they are greeted with hostility by the local law enforcement and the town in general <br /><br />Dafoe's Ward in charge of the casecomes off as the embodiment of everything those men in the south dislike about the "Yankees" who are coming down there commanding them how to act <br /><br />Anderson(Hackman), who was once a Mississippi officer himself, has a special feel for how to settle things with Southerners He uses his charm to win the confidence of the friendly wife of a Klansman deputy, whom he suspects holds the key to unravel the details of the case<br /><br />The scenes between McDormand and Hackman are the best of the film They dramatize how quickly two lonely people can match... <br /><br />The film succeeds by being gripping, emotional, and disturbing Alan parker graphically explores the hatred, motivations and mentality that were once flaming through the American society in the 60's.
