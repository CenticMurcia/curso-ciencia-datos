A spin-off of Donald P. Bellisario's military show 'JAG', 'NCIS' is a favourite of mine at the moment. The show revolves around the Naval Criminal Intelligence Service, an organisation which investigates crimes involving the Navy and Marines, and is very much like a police drama in comparison to 'JAG'.<br /><br />Not only are most of the story lines interesting and compelling but the characters are engaging. American law enforcement shows have always been superior to British shows in depicting the close camaraderie of a team who work side-by-side in a tough job and 'NCIS' is a great example of this. From the no-nonsense boss Gibbs to the devil-may-care DiNozzo to the goth Abby, you truly feel this is a group of people who care for each other and would do anything to protect their team mates. Credit is definitely due to the cast for being so faultless in their performances.<br /><br />There are times when the show is a bit too light-hearted and quirky for my liking but this is easily forgotten when watching some of the more darker episodes. It will be interesting to see how 'NCIS' continues to develop, especially with the recent introduction of a new main character, although I sincerely hope it avoids the pitfalls of 'JAG' by focusing on being about the NCIS rather than delving too much in the love lives of the characters.<br /><br />It is a shame that this show is so under-rated in the UK, where it's been shoved on some obscure Sky channel, because it does have the potential to be great and I think there are many out there who would enjoy it.
