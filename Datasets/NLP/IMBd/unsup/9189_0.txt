When you watch this movie, you have a sense of magic and a sense of sadness at the same time, because the Beatles were about to break up, and yet creating great new music at the same time. Indeed, the chemistry was wearing thin, as many behind-the-scenes reports will tell you. BUT this movie is a good document of the chemistry that was left, with Paul acting somewhat in a leader's position.<br /><br />It appears that John really isn't serious about the Beatles in this one, and that is the only real evidence of the near breakup, but it can be taken two ways. He seems to really enjoy jamming with some old friends rather than offer any directorial suggestions. This makes the sessions seem a little more loose though.<br /><br />Rather than a formal documentary style, it seems indeed that the more looser, almost experimental, style of production was en vogue at the time. This can also be seen in movies like Cream's "Farewell Concert." Overall, anybody who is interested in the Beatles, let alone rock and roll, should definitely see this movie. It serves as a brutally important document on what many consider to be the greatest band that ever was. SO, search it out! Even if it requires you to get a Betamax player! Someone should post on the boards if any current releases of it are spotted.
