This is one of the worst of the "Ernest films," starring the likeble Jim Varney. Good 'ole "Ernest B. Worrell" might be a good guy - and Varney was a wonderful comedian almost all of us loved, even if just for his famous television commercials - but I didn't really care for this movie.<br /><br />It was mostly the obnoxious kids in here that ruined things for me. They weren't in the "Midstate Boys Detention Camp" for no reason: they were nasty. Oh, all that is but one: the black kid, of course. The white kids are all bad. Can you say "political correctness?" Can you save "reverse racism?" Sorry to see that racial nonsense in an Ernest, but there's more Liberal baloney in here, too.<br /><br />Football player (and no actor) Lyle Azado plays one of the bad guys. That also tells you something about the quality of this lamebrain effort.<br /><br />"Ernest" has a mission in this movie: "Shaping and molding youthful minds into a focused world view." Yeah, right.<br /><br />Still, I miss Jim Varney.
