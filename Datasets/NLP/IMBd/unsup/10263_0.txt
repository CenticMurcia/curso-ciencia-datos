I live in Phoenix and every time I go east on U.S. 60 out past Apache Junction, near Gold Canyon Ranch, I see a spot where an episode was filmed ( or at least a scene was filmed). Today, 40 years later I still think about it and check to see if the spot is still there. Went by today----yes it is. Too bad the show only lasted that one season---one of the true greats ! The scene I remember was where he stopped to get a drink out of a spigot at a service station, and as I recall someone took issue with it. Anyway someone learned a valuable lesson from it, I'm sure. Does anyone know if these 27 episodes are available ? Never was a motorcycle guy, although I did own a Navajo for a year or so. I just identified with the wanderlust of the open road.
