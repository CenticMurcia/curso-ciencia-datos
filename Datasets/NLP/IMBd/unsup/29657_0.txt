I really recommend this movie to anyone. I think that Theresa and Simon have a very realistic relationship that I could truly see one of my friends in a relationship like theirs. Like real love, they have their ups and downs, their awkward moments, and their little fights and all those little things that make it a real and believable love and not just a movie love. It's not your typical fantasy life is not really like a chick flick movie. It is a good mix between comedy and the tough stuff. Simon seems to really love Theresa and you can really tell that they are good for each other and compliment each other. I'm kinda a romantic and like the fantasy chick flicks, but this one is probably one of my favorites because the relationships and situations are what love is really about and how it is to want to make that good first impression on your future in-laws. Bernie Mac plays a great dad and reacts like a real father would when meeting his daughter's boyfriend for the first time. One of my favorite lines of his was when Ashton says, "You knew you were going to kick me out a week ago?" and Bernie replies, "Boy, I knew I was going to kick you out 24 years ago when the doctor announced it was a girl." That just seems like something a real father would say. So overall, I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. Don't let the chick flick part turn you away, it's more realistic than most. To me, this movie is not mainly about the race issue, or any other issue other than love and the love of two people wanting to spend the rest of their lives together and trying to work their two worlds into one.
