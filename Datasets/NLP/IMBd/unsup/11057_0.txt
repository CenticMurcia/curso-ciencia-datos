Here are some things that are a better use of your time than watching this film:<br /><br />Cleaning the toilet with a toothbrush.... Reciting Neil Diamond lyrics.... Vaccuuming your entire home twice.... Watching dust collect on your coffee table.... Sitting at your doctor's waiting room just for practice.... Calling an elderly female relative.... Listening to static on your radio.... Watching flies mate.... Doing any paper mache project.... Blowing bubbles.<br /><br />I admit that I could not watch this one to the end, and I've made it all the way through some really bad Sci Fi Originals. This one lacks substance at every turn, with characters having about as much personality as a doorknob. It made little sense to me, not because of a complicated storyline, but because I could not bear to pay much attention to it. This film is brutal in its boredom, and you would be wise to stay away!
