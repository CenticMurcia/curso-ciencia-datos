Very uninteresting and boring on a very unbelievable level. From beginning to end it makes all of the classic film mistakes that most directors try to avoid. A great cast doesn't always mean the movie will be great itself. I watched this in my American History 2 class and I fell asleep after the first ten minutes. Please note that my history class is my second favorite class and the most enjoyable of the 11th grade. Now, while this movie tends to over-exaggerate and wander off the beaten path, I can't take anything away from Sam Elliot. He was the only actor worthy of appraise in this film but as it is I don't think I have ever disliked him in any film before. The ending of this movie has a terribly clich√© moment in it when one of The Rough Riders die, and his friend holds him and does the same dreadful thing they do in all movies when a character dies.<br /><br />3/10
