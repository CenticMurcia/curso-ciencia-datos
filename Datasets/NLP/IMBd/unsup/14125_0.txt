I'm not sure if talking about the ending is really going to spoil this for anyone, but I checked the spoiler box just in case. Considering the age of this movie AND the fact that I saw it when it first aired (okay, so I'm dating myself), it remains one of the most compelling computer-related films I've ever seen. Although I'm sure it really shows its age nowadays, it's the story that will hook you. Picture yourself the inventor of a computer that monitors everything, keeps track of everything, so you save time and effort. However, it monitors YOU, too, and as it gets more powerful, you have less and less freedom. So you try to turn it off. Of course, you can't. You've seen 2001, War Games and Star Trek, and THEY all managed to find a way to disconnect or blow out their computer nemeses. But Colossus is different. And you are stuck. The thing is, if this movie wasn't written as a pilot for a TV series, it should have been. It is the perfect set up and will leave you wanting more.
