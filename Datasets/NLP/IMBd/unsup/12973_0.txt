A lot of people have made terrible reviews on this movie, but I think people have just watched the movie with their expectations low and have just watched it to criticise it and to pick out all the bad bits, but the things they missed were the good bits. <br /><br />This movie is entertainment through and through, its quick paced, its got good actors and its got a good story. The only thing that let it down was the script, (which luckily enough was pepped up by the actors) and the other thing that let it down also was the over use of half naked women. I'm not saying there shouldn't have been any, I understood there was going to be quite a lot, it being a bachelor party and all, but you know it's gone too far when you begin to feel uncomfortable watching it by yourself. There seemed to be a hot girl round every corner and they kept popping up in the most bizarre places... but that's my only criticism<br /><br />It's a fun movie, which takes you on an entertaining adventure with these five guys, all of whom have very good characters. Some jokes made by them did just pass by me, but I did smile and laugh at some others, which I think is a huge accomplishment for a movie, because I know there are some big Hollywood comedies out there, which people don't laugh at, yet they're big movies. <br /><br />Also, the reason some of the jokes aren't so funny is not because they're bad jokes, it's because they just glaze over you. But when watching this movie look out for the character Eli, played by the talented actor Aaron Himelstein, he's the one that makes you laugh and the majority of the funny jokes come from him and his awesome nervous character. <br /><br />I liked the ending, simply because as the movie was getting closer to the end they gave you enough clues to guess what was going to happen, so therefore it was less disappointing than it could have been. The ending was also well explained, rather than it being a simple, unexplained twist, it actually had a nice story behind it and it made you smile. <br /><br />This is a movie that I would have probably enjoyed a lot more if I hadn't of read all of the terrible reviews, simple because no movie can be enjoyed when you know the bad bits that people have found. I'd say the only down fall was the over use of sex and gross out humour, which I don't particularly mind in a movie, but in this movie it just lasted a bit too long. Over all, I was entertained, I enjoyed it, which in the end, is all you want from a movie. <br /><br />So ignore the bad reviews, and try and forget about them when you watch this movie, because it really isn't that bad, it makes you laugh and smile and has a good story and good actors, which is all I wanted from it.
