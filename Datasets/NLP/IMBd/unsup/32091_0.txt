I must say I was surprised at how many people seemed to really dislike this film. Albeit it wasn't terribly original nor unpredictable and certain elements (chiefly the love subplot) felt unnecessary, overall the movie kept me laughing from start to finish.<br /><br />Even now, recalling the mobsters 'flying' through the air when being shot in the beginning brings a smile to my lips. The friend with whom I watched the movie enjoyed it and neither of us felt we had wasted three dollars on the rental fee. I would have liked to have seen some deleted scenes or outtakes on the DVD but it was enjoyable nonetheless.
