I was a little bit afraid, I can't really take yet another sugar-filled love story on the airplane, but this movie was really different. What I liked best was that unhollywoodish feeling when the movie don't try to tell me "they love one another very much" for 10 heavy minutes, or "it's really sweet that they meet again" for another 10 minutes, they just flash 10-20 seconds of nicely shot moments which is just enough for a moviegoer with above minimal intelligence to get the point. I don't like things over-explained.<br /><br />I liked the acting as well, I almost smell the lack of comfort when Felix meet the girl from time to time, and lots of closeups made me always feel that these persons are in fact real, and not acting on an average story thread. There were funny moments (flushing the phone made everyone 'AWWW!') but overall the film was rather serious.<br /><br />It was very interesting to see the "low-budgetness" of the movie: there wasn't really anything more than acting, dialogs; if that's good, it makes a really good movie. And the acting is good.<br /><br />After the last horrible piece of this genre I've seen - Bounce(2000) - this was a relieving experience.
