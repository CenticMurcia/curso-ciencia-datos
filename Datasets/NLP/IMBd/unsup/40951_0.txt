The entire time I was watching I kept wondering why this movie looked so different than the one I saw on DVD-United 93. Well, it wasn't the brilliant movie but a terrible remake from A&E who should have just let things be. <br /><br />This is why a good director is a good director...it's not until you see a mediocre effort and talent try to play with the big boys. <br /><br />This TV movie is a sham of the movie United 93. It contains non of the drama, storytelling and detail of the movie. Why make a move that links itself to such a pivotal piece of American history when you can't improve on the Hollywood version of United 93? Why?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor--rent or Netflix United 93. One of the best movie made that covers a historical event. That movie took risks and they paid off. The DVD also has amazing extras with interviews from the actual families. The whole project was class all the way.
