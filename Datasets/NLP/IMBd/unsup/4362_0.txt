Something many people don't know is that the theatrical version of the film ended differently than the current prints. <br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS:<br /><br />When they say "This plane is going to Havana" at the end, all current prints end with Sandy Dennis saying "Oh my God!". But in the real version of the film at the theaters, she said "Oh my God...we're being hijacked (or "skyjacked"). <br /><br />Hijacking planes (or "skyjacking" as it was called) was in the news a lot at the time as there seemed to be a rash of them going on. When some people complained that this film "glorified" or "made light" of this serious issue, this final line of the film was cut when the film first was shown on television. So now she just says "oh my God...." Unfortunately, it seems like all prints of the film which remain are now altered like this. Would love to know if the original theatrical version still exists somewhere.<br /><br />Things were much more uptight in 1970 I suppose....
