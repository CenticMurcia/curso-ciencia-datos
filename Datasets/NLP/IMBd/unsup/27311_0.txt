Crummy horror sequel that is barely connected to the original but manages to be just as bad. Anthropologist Michael Moriarty moves with his delinquent teenage son to his recently inherited house, only to discover that the town is overrun with vampires. Yikes! The only compensation here is that there are a few laughs scattered about, thanks in no small part to Samuel Fuller as an old Nazi killer. There's a bit of life to be found towards the end, but make no mistake, this is dire stuff. The script is almost as junky as Larry Cohen's direction, while the actors are so wooden they could be used as stakes with just a quick sharpening of the head. No good at all.
