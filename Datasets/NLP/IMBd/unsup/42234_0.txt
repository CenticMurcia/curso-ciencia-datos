So Randal is baiting Dante, till he finally gets Dante to say what he wants, then Randal does a U-turn and lambastes poor old Dante. Sound familiar? Yes this is a lot longer more drawn out version of the car scene from clerks, what makes that said scene a lot better is the fact that Randal never conveyed the fact that he had tried to suck his own dick, here he is constantly banging on at Dante, and the punchline is sort of a contradiction. very disappointing. OK so now I've got to fill out my comment on this short with a few more lines so it will pass for the good folks at the internet movie database, so ill say the other short on the clerks DVD "clerks lost scene" was a lot funnier and deserves lots of praise.... will that do?
