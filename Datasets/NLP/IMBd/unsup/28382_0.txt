after watching this movie,one thing really struck me:how talented Carole Lombard was as an actress.she has a real gift for comedy,of which there is a fair amount in this film.i found i very funny,but beyond that,i just thought it was well written,and even more relevant today than back then.it basically skewers every imaginable target,including the price of fame,and paints pretty much everybody as phonies,when you you get right down to it.even your average every day person is painted with that brush.but this is also a romance and drama,and it also works on those levels.Fredric March is the male lead,and he does pretty well in the role.the supporting players are also good,but,like i said,it is Carole Lombard who steals the show.i had a great time watching this film,and highly recommend it.my vote for Nothing Sacred:8.5/10
