This is beyond a doubt the worst detective show to appear on television. Don Johnson must have had an ironclad no - cancellation clause in his contract because the show was mired in the bottom of the Nielsens. The show was muddled, to say the least. The sets were confusing. Cool-guy Don naturally lived in a penthouse/loft hybrid of a place with bricks appearing here and there in the decor. His ex-wife and daughters kept cropping up to add deadweight to a dead show. By the way, did you know that Don was shagging the 17-year old girl who played his daughter (Jody O'Keefe)? I read it in the Enquirer, and most of that stuff, believe it or not, is true. The supporting cast was composed of boring character actors, not the least being Cheech Marin. The balding, pudgy actor was a mere shadow of the funnyman of the 70's and 80's. He was a humorless, bland, chubby, depressed-looking guy. So when this 5'1" dynamo married a sexy Swedish bombshell on the show, credibility took another hit. And what about the police station or city hall or whatever it was? It was always under construction, it seemed. Another annoying detail. Don Johnson was cool in Miami Vice. Here, he just wore a sweater-vest and sportcoat and acted bored. That 1971 Challenger he rode around in was yellow with a white interior(yuck!). It, too, seemed bored.
