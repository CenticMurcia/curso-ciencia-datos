For the average viewer, this movie will no doubt be very confusing and a bit silly. However, for those who adore Bergman films, it will be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Although I have seen quite a few Bergman films, I am not a huge fan. While I can appreciate many of his films, sometimes I feel he is just too depressing or angst-ridden to watch. This film, in fact, might just be my least favorite film he did--it's a close call between this film and Persona.<br /><br />Hour of the wolf is a very surreal film and I think it was deliberately made to be very confusing as to exactly what was occurring--was Max Von Sydow's character a schizophrenic or were there demons or monsters on this island==it's very hard to tell. Frankly, I found myself not really caring.<br /><br />In addition to MANY confusing story elements, you do get to see an old lady pull off her face and put an eye into a glass of water. This isn't really as gross as it sounds. Also, a man walking up a wall and standing on the ceiling and another guy sprout gigantic wings. All this is reminiscent of a painting by Bosch or Dali.
