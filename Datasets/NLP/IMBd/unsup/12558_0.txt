Cats and Dogs is one of those films that are to silly for words, if I had a dog with doghouse I would check for a secret button. Makes you wonder what are dogs barking at each other when they meet in the park or is that to much spotted dogs? Though the whole underground transport system to dog HQ went a bit far to believe. It reminded me of Bond. Hightech dog house, how did they think of it. Hilarious.<br /><br />Saw it again on TV this week it wasn't as funny as the first time and probably would be even less funnier the third time. Favorite part: the house maid pampering Mr. Wiskers the I want to rule the world cat boss. <br /><br />I've to agree that some of CGI effects where unrealistic and that's why I skipped on Garfield this year. Jurrasic Park Jeff Goldblum didn't have much of a role other then being inventor of the cure. I think that can be said of the whole Brody family though I enjoyed the scenes in the garden with the kid playing with the dog. The voice cast went pass me, didn't recognize one of the 'famous' actors. <br /><br />See it, laugh and have a good time!
