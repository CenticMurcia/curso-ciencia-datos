Even if Gregg Araki didn't try so hard to be profound, his movie would still be horrible. After hearing "666" for the fourth time, it's tempting to scream, "I get it! I'll acknowledge your irony if it will mean you'll stop beating me over the head with it!" Araki's 5th rate script could have possibly been saved if he had at least hired 5th rate actors. Rose McGowan has about as much animation as a paper doll. It's almost painful to watch her act; as if you want to finish her sentences for her to save her the trouble. I'm still not convinced that James Duval is an actor. I think he's some kind of mannequin brought to life by amateur puppeteers. Johnathan Schaech is the only saving grace in this festering pile of garbage. His talent was completely wasted. Whomever gave Gregg Araki any kind of budget deserves to be shot. Hard-core criminals should be forced to read his writing as punishment.
