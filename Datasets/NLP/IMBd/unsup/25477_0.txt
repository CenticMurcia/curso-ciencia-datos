Danny Dengzopa's directorial debut featuring the superstar Rajesh Khanna and Kim (whom he later married). This film is one of the best Hindi horror films. Apparently it has no haunted faces and fictitious haunted stuff but it provides an edge-of-the-seat entertainment to its viewers. <br /><br />The protagonist has been haunted by her aunt who killed her mother and was sent to mental asylum. Rajesh Khanna is a psychologist who treats her and eventually falls in love with her. I will not speak a word after this about its story. It is a must see for people whose favorite genre in movies is horror. It has an enthralling suspense and will make you more and more engrossed as the story will progress.<br /><br />Commenting on the technical points of the movie, it has no flaws. The director, cinematographer and art director has done complete justice to their work. Music by R.D. Burman is enchanting. Lata Mangeshkar's haunting melodies have made the songs memorable. Majrooh Sultanpuri's lyrics were fine.<br /><br />I would rate it as 9.8/10 because it has the ability to entertain young as well as middle-aged viewers in terms of horror story.
