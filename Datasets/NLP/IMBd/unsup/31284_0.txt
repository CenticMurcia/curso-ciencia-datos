I found Sally Prager's portrayal of Claudia delightful. The character is intelligent, curious, full of wonder, and caring toward her younger brother. Her independence and courage are admirable. I sympathized completely with "Mrs. Frankweiler's" attraction to this spunky young girl. Ingrid Bergman's appearance toward the end of this movie elevates the film to a new level; as ever, her acting is superb.
