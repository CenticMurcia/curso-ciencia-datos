This anime was visually astounding, to say the least. It is quite amazing how much they did with CG and how well they did it, also compared to other current anime projects. However there are still some drawbacks to this as in several scenes one can literally count the different parallax and compositing layers. Sometimes the difference in crispness between characters and background can be irritating, as if a simulated depth of field went haywire; this results in a kind of 'patchy' look. And yes, you can still identify CG even though the shaders are extremely good and I do not want to know how much post-processing they put over it.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is also impressive how hollow and lifeless the plot and characters of this anime seem. It completely failed to draw me in or even create a tiny spark of interest for any part of the story, so it was just a bunch of pretty pictures flowing by, connected by conventional out-of-the-box plot elements. It was like watching anonymous people from about one kilometer away. Not to mention that with the progression of the movie the banalities increase so much that simple disappointment is replaced by annoyance. I could barely stand the last third.<br /><br />Bottom line: technically amazing, visually good, but I can only recommend to stay clear of it because the plot is so depressingly disappointing.
