I first saw this show live with the same cast as in the movie (With the exception of the Soprano who played Mabel) in Adelaide, South Australia, for my 16th birthday. I loved it then and I love it now. Poor Frederic is the slave of duty and although he has lived 21 years is in fact a little boy of 5. Knowing this, he must return to the pirate band until 1940 and his Mabel promises to wait for him.<br /><br />The show is very camp and the gags are hilarious, although some of them are very topical. Jon English plays to the audience as much as he does on the stage to great effect and the audience participation is well worth the fun.<br /><br />I have only just managed to get a new copy of this production after having worn the old video out.....lol. It is my all-time favourite feel good movie, just perfect for cheering you up when you are feeling down.
