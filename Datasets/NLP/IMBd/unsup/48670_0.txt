I won't say it was the worst movie ever, but this was written for the REAL, REAL simple to enjoy. If you've not watched TV sitcoms or any other movie in the past 30 years, you'll find this movie refreshing and original (has anyone seen National Lampoon's Vacation?). The theme (middle aged dad loses touch with his family and sets out on a trip to unite them, with calamity at every turn), has been done almost annually in Hollywood in one form or another. I won't criticize the movie for it's potty jokes or lack of insightful humor, or groan-inducing one-liners, but I will pan it for it's 100% lack of any originality. Especially the self-serving last 15 minutes which were a cookie-cutter version of any "life-realization" moment, with our hero delivering his big speech to his business colleagues (and, of course, his money-only-minded boss) where he chastises them for being all about business and not LOVE and family.....puke-inducing, patronizing, and done-before to exhaustion. Complete with family grouped together in the corner in a perfect photo-op portrait pose, this speech can be seen coming for miles. Guess what? He ends up quitting his job, BUT the other guys (Ben and Jerry-type hippie jillionaires)in attendance from the other company want to hire him on the spot for sharing their vision of a world where business doesn't do business....it makes LOVE grow. I have to go toss my cookies now.
