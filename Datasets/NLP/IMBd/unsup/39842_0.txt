Silent Night, Deadly Night 2 continues the story of Ricky, brother of killer in a Santa suit Billy from the first SNDN film. The film opens with Ricky in an institution for what we later find out is a result of a killing spree he went on. The movie is based around Ricky basically telling his life story Dr. Bloom, which consists mainly of flashbacks to the first film. In fact, the first 35 minutes of this "sequel" is footage from the first, minus the gore. So, as you could imagine, it is pretty boring and even after that, when Ricky explains what happened to him after the ordeal at the end of the first one (in which his brother is shot dead in front of him), it does not get much better.<br /><br />To be honest, and this should not be surprising to most, this is a pretty bad movie. The acting, script, story, score, effects and direction are all unanimously shoddy and reek of low-budget. Eric Freeman is a revelation as Ricky, truly the best worst actor to grace our screens. Who will forget his ever-twitching eyebrows, his clownish laugh or his crowing glory...GARBAGE DAY! The script mainly consists of Ricky muttering 'naughty' or 'punish' under his breath as he goes around killing people who he thinks are misbehaving. For a slasher the deaths are uninspired, most of them are shootings, with a couple being hilariously bad (death by umbrella and a death by electricity are honourable mentions). Logic flies out of the door in this movie, with bullets flipping cars and Ricky escaping a hospital by merely walking out, so just sit back, relax and enjoy a campy late 80's semi-sequel to the controversial slasher Silent Night, Deadly Night.<br /><br />1Â½/5
