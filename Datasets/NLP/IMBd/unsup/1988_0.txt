One of the best films I have ever seen. The plot is quite appealing (based on a true story, which helps building the film "credibility"), the director excels on creating a tense mood along the film and the actors masterfully build the carachters psichological profiles. It is a movie about people, friendship, ambition and love. Five stars for the music, the actors and no words for the "finale".<br /><br />If you liked To Live and Die in L.A. you can't miss this one.
