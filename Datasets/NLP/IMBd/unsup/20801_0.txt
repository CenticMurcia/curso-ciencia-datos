Porky Pig and Sylvester the Cat find themselves in a spooky house where Sylvester sees dastardly mice planning an execution, needless to say Porky doesn't believe him for much of the short.I liked this cartoon, as Slvester is a favorite character of mine and tweety isn't in this at all, I could never really stand that bird so that's another reason I liked this one. Also call me a tad morbid, but when Sylvester nonviolently tried to commit suicide I found myself laughing. This funny cartoon is on Disk 2 of the "Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1"<br /><br />My Grade: B+
