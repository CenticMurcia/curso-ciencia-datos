I waited along time to see this film, and it was certainly not worth the wait. The story was too boring and slow, 80% of the movie was flash back and you don't really get a chance to relate to the characters, except for Wah Yin Hung. Plus could they please change the cast, this was the exact cast from Stormriders and the Young and Dangerous movies, can't they find some other actors? I think the audience is tired of seeing the same actors all the time. And Ekin cheng's performance in Stormriders was only average, Aron Kok did a much better job. Over all the film was a disappointment especially coming from the Stormriders team.
