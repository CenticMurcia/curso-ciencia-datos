Deep Space Nine was the most complex, broad and innovative offering to come out of the Star Trek Franchise. Based on a space station near a stable wormhole leading through an inhabited inter-dimensional gateway into a different quadrant of the galaxy millions of light years away, DS9's aliens were REALLY alien, it's stories ranged from near-universal to personal in scope, and its characters and their relationships to one another were more intimately explored than before or since. Sci Fi TV has rarely, if ever dived so deep into the wellsprings of intellect and drama (moreso than the new BSG, TNG and Firefly - which is saying a lot) Central to the show's grand (7 year) story arc is Benjamin Sisko, the space station's brilliant but somewhat reluctant and disgruntled new commander. Sisko is also - possibly - a prophesied messiah of the people of Bejor: The Emissary. This story begins in the hour and a half long opening episode. Almost all of the main characters are also introduced, and at least hints to the most important relationships (Sisko-Kira; Sisko-Odo; Sisko-Kira; Sisko-Quark; Sisko-Jake; Kira-Odo; Odo-Quark and Sisko-Dax) are dropped.<br /><br />Among the many plots and subplots established and developed in the Emissary, the most important are Sisko's back-story. Our commander is a widower who to an extent blames the federation for the loss of his beloved wife, dedicated single father, and an ingenious officer. Unlike all of his predecessors, Sisko also has a goofy and even downright awkward side, which is very refreshing after years of the stodgily military Picard and the space cowboy man-ho Kirk.<br /><br />Sisko arrives at his newly transferred Cardassian space station and finds it in a state of chaos and disrepair. The "Cardies" apparently wrecked the place as they departed the station and the formerly occupied planet of Bejor, and all of the merchants are preparing their departure . Battling his own career demons, Sisko must find a way to put the place and its people back together while dealing with more than one race which distrusts Star Fleet's intentions, and - perhaps - along the way he will find some inspiration for staying with Star Fleet despite his numerous and profound misgivings.<br /><br />And I am leaving about 80% of Emissary's storyline out of this review intentionally.<br /><br />The special effects, script and directing of Emissary established the very high standard that DS9 would maintain almost perfectly in its seven year run. Although the acting in this first episode was occasionally a little stiff, given the scope and convoluted plot, and the newness of the complex characters which would evolve later in the series, I think this is understandable. The major exception regarding acting is Kira (Nana Visitor) - for whom this is one among many show-stealing performances ranging through the entire series. <br /><br />Recommended for alert and attentive TV watching.
