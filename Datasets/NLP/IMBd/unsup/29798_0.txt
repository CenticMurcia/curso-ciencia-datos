John Ford made this another great film classic for future generations and a great learning film. Henry Fonda(Priest/and Fugitive) gave a wonderful performance along with Dolores del Rio (An Indian Woman). This black and white film made the horrors of prison life very real and uncomfortable. J.Carrol Naish(Police Informer) ran after Fonda throughout the entire picture. Leo Carrillo(Chief of Police)(famous for his acting in the Cisco Kid Movies) ruled his corrupt jail with an iron fist. Ward Bond had to make an appearance as (El Gringo) and if you look real fast, you will see Mel Ferrer as Father Serra) All of John Ford's films were great in the 30's and 40's and will always remain so.
