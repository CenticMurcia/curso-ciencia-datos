**very mild spoilers**<br /><br />I rented "Amelie" reluctantly. I had the impression that it would be a "girlie" film with meandering narrative and boring angst-ridden characters.<br /><br />I am so glad I was wrong! What I did get was a "magical realism" tale of an introverted woman trying to improve the lives of the people around her. Amelie, through clever scheming and gentle intervention, facilitates delightful life experiences for her fellow characters.<br /><br />The film does move at a slower pace, but the plot points are endearing, and it never drags. Every scene has a subtextual significance, where every shot adds a tiny sense of guilty voyeurism as we peek gentle into these people's lives.<br /><br />The plot devices are purposely stretched to fantastical lengths at times. Laurant and Jeunet use this "magical" aspect of the realism to cultivate an optimism and effervescence that you won't find in any Hollywood movie today. The mood is always dreamy in this film, yet is never childish.<br /><br />The characters will warm your heart. Audrey Tatou is perfect as the shy-yet-smouldering Amelie, and Jamel Debbouze is perfect as the impish Lucien.<br /><br />You will love the sub plots of Amelie convincing her father to travel, and how she seeks gentle vengeance on the wicked grocer. The scheme to introduce herself to Nino, and the plot to do matchmaking at the cafe. All of these little stories are bound to tweak your heartstrings!<br /><br />In the end: Amelie will leave you with feeling that "Pay it Forward" should have left you with... a buoyant and optimistic affection for humanity and life!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you are an action fan, an intellectual, or a feel-good Hollywood movie buff. There are clever plot elements and characterization that are good for all movie fans!<br /><br />9 kernels of popcorn out of 10.<br /><br />
