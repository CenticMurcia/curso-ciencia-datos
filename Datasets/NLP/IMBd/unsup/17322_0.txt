This movie Chainsaw Massacres the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it really messes up the backstory.<br /><br />I never did like the way "leatherface"s name changed from Francis to Tommy in the 2003 remake.<br /><br />In the remake what is up with all the old cars if this bunch only killed 33 people in 4 years? <br /><br />Why did they make leatherface to where he came from another family, he is just as psycho as the rest, now there is the thought that maybe they raised him to be psycho and he may have been OK if they hadn't? <br /><br />I always found it more sinister that the Sheriff was actually the real Sheriff that had been elected by the community and he was that crazy.<br /><br />Where did the kid go from the remake? <br /><br />Prequels are always anti-climatic since you know what happens to the main characters later.
