This movie is defintley for tv, but it was acted superbly. The mom makes it easy for you to hate her. Nicholle who plays Ruth, i was surprised she took this role. I guess she wants to take on bigger movies and bigger roles, and producers can see her acting abilities. i remember seeing her only on "the nanny" and "beethoven". Well, its worth watching this movie...but i should warn u... can u say depressing. but something about it makes u stay watching. just like about every other tv movie iv'e watched. ok theyre telling me i need more then 10 lines so ill go on. Her husband is soo ugly and wierd why would she marry that hyena. her deluded mom makes her feel so worthless that she would even consider it. man he was crazy. and then the end just when u think things couldint get any worse they do. and its so true but sad how even though her mom treated her soo bad she still loved her and felt bad for --what happened-. although lol its probably obvious. Her kid is the only thing that keeps her going i think. i hate when guys take advantage of innocent girls its soo cliche. shiz at least if ur gonna be a man whore at least make it original so we wont die of boredom.
