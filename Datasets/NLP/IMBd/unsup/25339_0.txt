Yes, looking @ release date and others' comments, you'd pass this one by...But take another look :<br /><br />It's a road movie, which is a great and under-utilised genre; It's got grim humour coupled with a ghost-line (not bad); It's got good character actors; Its script is tight; And I come from the place where they filmed Mad Max (before the US dubbed it : cringe), so give me some credit for knowing films that use deserted environments !<br /><br />Someone had an idea with this one and got 3/4 of the way there. It isn't Duel but it's not a waste of a Coke & popcorn for 90 minutes either.<br /><br />
