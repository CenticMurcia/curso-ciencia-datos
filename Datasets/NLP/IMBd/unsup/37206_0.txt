So bad it frankly defies description. Nothing seems to ignite in this hacker flick which is not quite trashy enough to be good old-fashioned vulgar fun. The plot is unsexy, to say the least, direction seems lacking in all crucial places and performances are woody and devoid of chemistry. A true disaster.
