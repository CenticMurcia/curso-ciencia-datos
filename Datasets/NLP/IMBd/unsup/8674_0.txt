This game is excellent, especially when dealing with two dimensional Super Nintendo gaming.<br /><br />You control Samus Aran, who has been on two previous missions. She encountered Metroids in both, and now the last Metroid has been captured by Ridley. You must fight your way through incredible caverns.<br /><br />The graphics are stunning for Super Nintendo, possibly some of the best. The music is also excellent (who can forget the chilling voices in the second, final section of Norfair?). The battles are intense. The gameplay is extremely easy to control. The storyline and plot are both deep and interesting. Not only does this game mix great gaming with great music, it also adds in puzzles, freaky enemies, and unique sound effects that all add to the gameplay, allowing you to immerse yourself in the world of planet Zebes.<br /><br />Also, for a Super Nintendo game, this one is huge. There's Brinstar, Norfair, Maridia, the Wrecked Ship, even Tourian. You even see the previous location of the Mother Brain in Brinstar as you make your way through the caverns, which helps the consistency of the games alive. Nothing is altered to make the storyline contradict itself.<br /><br />The previous games were pretty good, but this one is obviously the best. It is an excellent thriller, action/adventure, puzzle game that will interest anyone.
