This movie was on Channel 4 one day this summer. With nothing on, I tuned in and watched it. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />In the movie of the popular ITV Sitcom Please Sir, teacher Bernard Hedges is angry that his class, 5C, the worst in the school, can't go on a school trip. He manages to get them on a trip, to the country. Trouble on the coach is just the start. Naturally there is trouble there. Problems include the fact that Dunstable's parents didn't sign, he got the signature forged, 5C being found in the pub and 5C's room vandalised, surprisingly not by 5C. But on the good side, Bernard Hedges gets a date with an attractive blonde.<br /><br />Sitcom movies are never brilliant, but this was one of the better ones. I brought series 1 and 2 of Please Sir yesterday, so when I have finished watching them, I will review the TV series
