I got this movie, looking for what it was advertised as - a dark comedy. It had its dark moments, but it got more winces than chuckles, and no laughs at all. This is much more a drama, if a drama of the absurd. The sidebar text bits actually worked pretty well, and provided almost all of the humor that the script offered.<br /><br />The acting was, indeed, well-done - which leads me to assume that there was some good direction happening as well. The primary failing here was the story.<br /><br />Plot synopsis: People do silly, destructive things to each other. People make bad choices. People hurt each other. Abortion is hurtful, and giving a child up for adoption can be pretty crazy-making, too. Ain't life funny? All in all, not a painful movie, but certainly not the comedy I'd expected. It does have the feel of a sitcom or soap opera - if you like watching those, you may well like this more than I did.
