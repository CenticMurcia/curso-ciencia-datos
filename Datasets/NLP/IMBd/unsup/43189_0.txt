Average cast. Predictable plot. And a happy ending... Uhh.. What kinda movie is this supposed to be anyways? Too lame to be a thriller, so let's say it's one of those semi-suspense flicks. Pretty standard film all in all that really has not much new to offer... If you don't have anything better to do, you might as well watch this.
