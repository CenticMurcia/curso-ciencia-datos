In "The Prisoner of Zenda", a British major impersonates a foreign king to save his station. The film starts as more of a drama film and makes a transition to action film near the end. It also features nice sets in the old Hollywood style and an appropriate score.<br /><br />The film's cast delivers great performances. Ronald Colman is charming as Major Rudolf Rassendyll. Madeleine Carroll plays Princess Flavia, who is slated to marry the king. Colman and Carroll have chemistry together and nicely develop a relationship. C. Aubrey Smith is well-cast to play the part of Colonel Zapt, the king's loyal helper, and David Niven has a small role, also on the king's support staff. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. creates a memorable villain as the brazen and obnoxious but somewhat clever Rupert of Hentzau. Raymond Massey is decent as the other main villain, Michael, but not on par with Fairbanks.<br /><br />The start of the movie develops the film's premise and then the characters. The film mostly has an interesting story and clever dialogue,but it does have some slower spots in the middle. However, the film makes a transition to an action-oriented approach near the end. This was appropriate and in particular there was one duel with some amusing banter that was a highlight of the action. The film culminates in a satisfactory conclusion and is overall worth seeing for its premise, characters, dialogue and action toward the end.
