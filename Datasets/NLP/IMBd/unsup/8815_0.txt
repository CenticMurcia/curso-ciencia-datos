Razzle Dazzle makes us laugh at ourselves. No really! Darren Ashton (director) chooses his feel-good mockumentary on competitive dance in Australia to show realistic characters. And the audience can't help but laugh at our immature look on life - our competitive nature! Kerry Armstrong and Ben Miller are wonderfully cast as pushy stage mum Justine and dance visionary Mr Jonathon. Quirky yet significant lines show what's really happening in the arts (both adult and child perspective). The film even makes a crack on the plight of Afghani women. This has to be one of the first films that has been able to make me laugh uncontrollably at some parts of the film and think and question the character of humanity in others. It revolves around family so basically is good for any age. It really is a journey on dance - from the beginning, we're all connected to the characters and we want Mr Jonathon's dance school to win. We watch their journey progress and fold. Loved every minute of it! Denise Roberts as Barbara was funny too. She was my fav. character!<br /><br />Highly recommended! * * * * *
