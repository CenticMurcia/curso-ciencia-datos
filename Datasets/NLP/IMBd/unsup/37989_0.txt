Dreadful! I remember seeing this film like it was yesterday, not 20 years ago. It was 1978, John Carpenter's "Halloween" had just come out and my friends and I were feeling that horror films were entering a new, fresh beginning, a renaissance. We were awaiting each new horror film with giddy anticipation. Then "The Manitou" came out!<br /><br />This has got to be Tony Curtis's worst performance ever. I remember the whole audience laughing at certain scenes. Not that it is all Tony's fault, the writing induces most of the laughs all on its own. There is a scene late in the movie where Curtis talks about the "Manitou" or Indian spirit in a typewriter(!!!) that sent the theater into hysterics.<br /><br />If you want to know just how bad a horror film can be, rent "The Manitou" and you'll find out!
