I am totally enthralled with this film. Not only is the script, acting (for the most part), and the directing superb-- it has a plot that is not seen in ever other love film known to man! I would have given the movie a 10 out of 10, but I have an issue with a handful of aspects about it. I didn't like a lot of the soundtrack; the songs just did not seem to fit the mood of the film in the beginning. Also, there is a cheese factor towards the end. However, if that is all that can be wrong with a film, then it is near perfection in my book. This film deals with real life issues, underneath the humor, and is so well written from both the male and female aspects of things that I kept wondering if two people had written it. (Imagine my surprise when a man had done it. He's got us down pat, ladies!) Plus, it isn't afraid to show a sexual side to humanity beyond 35-- a triumph for this day and age. Currently, this movie is my favorite of all time, and in my opinion, is a masterpiece that everyone should take the time to watch.
