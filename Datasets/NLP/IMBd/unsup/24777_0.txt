I'm a pain in the arse. I liked the scene in this film where Dad Delpy is "keying" the cars that are parked on the sidewalk. Adam Goldberg tells him to run for politics but I like the directness of keying the cars. It puts the power into the peoples hands and out of politician's hands and it saves time.<br /><br />The baffling thing about this film is that Julie Delpy is writing about two neurotics where the girl is a self-centered liar. How odd.<br /><br />In the scene where they are kicked out of the restaurant, her character IS being unreasonable and SHOULD be kicked out.<br /><br />Goldberg says more than once that he knows she's had sex with other men, but why does she have to lie about it? She has a personal voice-over where she acknowledges that it's OK to lie about things if you probably won't be discovered.<br /><br />In the end, the couple seems to stay together because they are too tired to move on to the next drama. In fact, if she'd stop lying, they'd have a pretty good relationship.<br /><br />This is a cute movie for it's nice grasp of family life, past sexual history (where Mom once did Jim Morrison) and idiot cabdrivers. All of the actors were funny and- there was a shot of the mini (?) "Statue Of Liberty" in Paris and I thought they were back in New York and I was disappointed.<br /><br />This is a good movie but one where Delpy casts a woman (herself) as the "bad guy" in the relationship. Is she a saint or something?
