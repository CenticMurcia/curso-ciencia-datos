The Prisoner of Zenda, based somewhat obviously on Shakespeare's The Tempest, is a film that has something for everyone. There's action, adventure, romance, suspense, and swashbuckling. It's a historical film, and over the years hasn't really aged, so it remains fantastic 62 years later. The cast is first rate, especially because the male leads-Ronald Colman, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and David Niven-are so handsome and talented, mainly Doug. In the best role of his career, he wields swords, cigarettes, and sticks with an airy sensuality and was deprived of a much-deserved Oscar nomination. The sets and costumes are so magnificently detailed, that you'll wish it was in color. And the script is perfect, with some very witty lines. And the musical score is excellent. Anyone who wants to see a movie with all the basic ingredients for 110 minutes of sheer entertainment should seek this one out.
