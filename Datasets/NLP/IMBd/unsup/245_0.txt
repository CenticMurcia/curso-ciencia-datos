One wishes for more for more talent in such a film! The actors looked like they're fresh from acting class! Amateurish! Come on, the filmmaker could have done better. Apart from some rare funny seconds, I thought this film was a bore. I didn't find it refreshing but rather stiff and stale like old bread. When a user said ' the filmmaker is brilliant"? Come on, this is a bit much! I find it rather ironic that someone would call this film brilliant. Is this a joke? or people have lost their minds? I saw a lot of good films at the festival but this one didn't do much for me. The title intrigued me at first but it should be really named: " last call for no much to see" !
