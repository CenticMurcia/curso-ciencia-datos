What the hell was THAT all about? That HAD to be the most DISJOINTED, UNEXCITING, SORRY excuse for a movie that I've seen in a long time. I understand the concept, and I actually believe in another plane of existence. But this movie did nothing to bolster those beliefs. Actually, I'm not REALLY sure WHAT the movie was trying to tell us, except that sometimes you just have to let GO! JEEZ! I thought George Clooney was acceptably attractive, and LOVED the character of Snow. Very quirky, ala Dennis Hopper in Apocolypse Now. But WOW! Enough's enough already. Bottom line . . . BORING!
