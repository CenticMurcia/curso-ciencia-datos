This mini series was awesome! Kudos to the writer/writers! I really liked it, but I only saw the first & second nights. I desperately need to see the final episode. Please air it again! Is there any plans to sell it on DVD or is it available online? If it was on Pay-per-view, I would order it!<br /><br />Does he find all the objects? Does bad follow the people the items come in contact with?<br /><br />Are there any similar series/shows coming up in the future? I miss the series like Sliders, Twilight Zone...There can never be enough Sci-Fi shows! I want more!
