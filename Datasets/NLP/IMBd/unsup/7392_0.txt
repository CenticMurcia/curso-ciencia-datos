What an absolutely wonderful entertaining movie. Thisis a great movie for the whole family and very wonderful characters in it. What is wrong with the Hollywood people whom were not interested in this movie. I guess they are after all the digitally mastered movies that capture the awe of people. You can't get much better than this movie with all stunts and no digital generation. I rather enjoy all live stunts and no animation. The characters in this were down to earth and you could just absorb the boys as if they were your own.I saw it at the Atlanta Film Festival and hope that it gets a nationwide release eventually. What a great director. My hat's off to you.
