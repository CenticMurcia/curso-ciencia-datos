This must be the last of the quality BBC dramas yet to be released on DVD. I wonder what the problem is? Maybe the BBC has lost the original tapes - I hope not. Assuming that the tapes do exist still, I would expect the demand is enough now to justify its release on DVD. I would certainly be prepared to pay a premium to obtain it. It's one of those productions that do not date, but evokes the atmosphere of the 1950's to the 1970's as I remember living through it. Considering the number of excellent actors in the series you would think there would be a demand just to be able to see them as they were at the beginning of their careers. So come on BBC - at least let us know if we may hope!!!
