A very natural and enjoyable film which I happened to fine just by chance. The atmosphere and slightly unconventional plot coupled with superb acting, directing, and script "writing" has allowed me to watch the movie more then twice with no disappointment Mr. Duvall is at his finest and I wait to see his beautiful co-star in another production. I am sure there might be detractors out there, but that would be because they lack good judgment. I especially enjoyed the impromptu scenes between Mr. Duvall and Miss Pedraza, to me, were worth seeing over and over, of course this might also be due to her great beauty. I have recommended this movie to all of my friends.
