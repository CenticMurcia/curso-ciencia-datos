I am a great fan of Nicholas Cage's work but I must honestly say that this movie will remain a scar on his acting portfolio.<br /><br />The film started off very suspenseful and mysterious. The idea was creepy, the evidence more so, the acting not too bad I guess (although it does deteriorate) and the story line was original and creative. However, as soon as the movie turned sci-fi I lost the plot... it should have remained a thriller or an action. I would have given it an 8 or so if the final disaster was a nuclear war, if Cage prevented a large terrorist attack or something along those lines. However, the introduction of 'aliens' and 'angels' completely ruined the entire movie.<br /><br />Knowing was filled with pointless scenes, poor acting and unnecessary symbolism (seriously, wtf was with the stones. I know they are biblically relevant, but you can not expect the greater audience to understand this). I think the director was a bit confused whether he should make the movie a thriller/horror, action, drama or sci-fi; so he decided on all of the above!<br /><br />The only thing that redeems it is the CGI and the few moments of great suspense early in the movie.
