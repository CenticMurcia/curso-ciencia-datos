The two leading actors here just own the film. There are so many memorable scenes, its full of drama yet is a great comedy.<br /><br />Lets face it Jack Nicholson was made for the part, and he says things that I would love to do but never have the balls, yet he is incredibly dry.<br /><br />The scene where one of his fans, a stereotypical dumb blonde (he's a writer) asks him how he writes women so well, 'I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.' LOL!
