Interesting film about a real tragedy, which took place in Mississippi in 1964. Three young guys, including a black man, were killed by KKK. Two FBI came to the village, where this happened and investigated the case It was just an example of what was going on there. The best of the film is the acting of the whole group of actors and actresses led by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, the latter as a generous FBI detective instead of being a villain as usual. The film left no doubt that KKK is (or was) a terrorist organization with a complete lack of human feelings, only with the obsession to kill black people, to reduce its population and denigrate it any way. I heard someone in Italian TV saying that Alan Parker directs wrong films, but this one is not the case.
