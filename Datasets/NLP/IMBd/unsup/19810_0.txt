So many negative comments, very surprising. Can't get past the enema's and promiscuity of the old days? Was worse in the earlier centuries in America. Health, religion, sex and science got very entangled in isolated and protestant America, this movie deals with it honestly. Take it like you are visiting a foreign land and just touring a different culture.<br /><br />Meanwhile, plenty of plot thread, personality, and expose of vastly different attitudes in a time when life was cheap. Well acted, well conceived, and very excellent re-creation of the era. Hopkins and Carvey put together together some of the most unusual persona's on film ever. Broderick and Fonda charming as always, and Boyle's character broke your heart.<br /><br />The old attitudes about life, death, sex and health are well parodied, not to mention the intensity of an age where being gentile, rigid, wrong and righteous all strangely blended together, were all well portrayed in a way the audience could understand and laugh at (at least for those better conditioned for puke and excrement, like those of us who grew up on "Alien" and "Predator").<br /><br />Far and away the greatest moments of the film are the three scenes where the battle of wills plays out between a younger Dr. John Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) and the little George Kellogg (Jacob Reynolds). These clips are as classic and memorable as they come, on par with the Barf-o-rama scene in "Stand by Me".<br /><br />Fooey to those who don't have the depth to get this film. It is such a hoot, eminently watchable and one you will not soon forget. Oh, and its hilarious.
