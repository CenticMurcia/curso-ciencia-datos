We all want to give good reviews to desi films- but hey... let's be objective rather than just loyal!<br /><br />This movie was a complete waste of time for the following list of reasons (these are only SOME of them):<br /><br />1- Character development: cardboard cut-out, one-dimensional cliches<br /><br />2- Credibility Muslim girl parties, dances, wears mini-skirts and then dresses like a North African Bedouin at the mosque w/ a veil.... some BALANCE please....<br /><br />3- Lack of research Hello!!! When you have a character playing a Muslim- get some advice from a REAL Muslim, instead of showing your own ill-informed fantasies. *****NO ONE STOPS PRAYING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. *****YOU CANNOT BOW DOWN IN PRAYER IF SOMEONE IS SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU. (when saleem is praying, the sikh friend is talking to him while sitting in front of him- IMPOSSIBLE!)<br /><br />4- Story Third-rate, B-movie high school flick with a completely unbelievable character development (chauvinistic Muslim guy changes his entire mind-set after wearing a Burqa (hello?) and ridiculous soppy ending<br /><br />5- Humour (or lack therof) various gags lifted from other high-school/ college flicks<br /><br />This movie was almost as bad as "Wings of Hope" and "ABCD". The only half decent desi films out there are"Hollywood Bollywood", "East is East", and "Bend it like Beckham". (And the best of course is "Earth")
