Malcolm Anderson (Kurt Russell) is a star reporter for a Miami newspaper who becomes the sole contact for a murderer (Richard Jordan) who is craving headlines. However, the murderer gets angry because, as his killings continue, Malcolm becomes the focal point of the stories; Malcolm's girlfriend (Mariel Hemingway), in fact, suggests that the two are practically collaborating.<br /><br />This is a satisfying, entertaining thriller that seems to have something to say about the way that the media sometimes conduct themselves. It doesn't call attention to itself with any flashy gimmicks; it just tells an interesting story in a simple, straightforward manner. Russell delivers a solid performance and is assisted well by a good supporting cast. All in all, I have to say that I liked this movie.<br /><br />Based on the novel "In the Heat of the Summer" by John Katzenbach (who also wrote "Just Cause").<br /><br />8/10
