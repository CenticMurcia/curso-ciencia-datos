I found this movie the same way I find foreign films that I want to buy on DVD, by being bored late at night and turning to the foreign channel. This is the third German offering that I've found to be quite enjoyable.<br /><br />The storyline is surreal-- 7 dwarfs who aren't dwarfs. Though thankfully Snow White is still Snow White. The blonde, sorry 'brunette' jokes are a tasteful addition to Nina Hagen's evil queen character.<br /><br />I was surprised there was a storyline in it, because its supposed to just be a spoof of the Snow White story, but the story is pretty good-- I especially like the Tupperware container-- whoever thought of that was a genius.<br /><br />The dwarfs are funny and all contribute to the humour of things, by the end of it, you will be wanting to grab someone and play 'CHECK!' Might warn the kids not to try that at home.<br /><br />It's been over two months since I've seen it, and I still laugh when I think of certain scenes.
