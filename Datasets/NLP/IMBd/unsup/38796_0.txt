In case it sounds familiar, the title of this user comment is a lovely quote stolen from the legendary "The Simpsons" character Ralph Wiggum. I thought it was more or less appropriate and it doesn't immediately reveal just how terrible "The Corpse Grinders" actually is. As a fan of the horror genre, I should have known that all films directed by Ted V. Mikels are better left untouched, but the synopsis of this movie simply sounded so damn funny! And the first twenty minutes actually aren't that bad, neither! After we witnessed how multiple people are attacked and killed by their own pet cats, we learn that the Lotus cat-food company makes its product from mauled human corpses. You know how it goes, right? At first, you're just searching for an untraceable method to get rid of one corpse you accidentally got stuck with, yet before you know it, you're mangling people especially to generate more tasty cat food. The canned food only increases the cats' appetites for human flesh, and they quickly turn to their loving owners for more. "The Corpse Grinders" could have been a halfway decent 70's B-movie trash production, if only the script wasn't so full of stupidities. Two loonies supposedly operate the factory, yet they provide a nation-wide stock of cat food supplies? And even though neither of them is capable of producing full sentences, we're supposed to believe that they're intelligent enough to trick health inspections and a pair of private investigators? The film relied on a shoestring budget and the only type of special effect is a repeated shot of this huge machine spurting out a gooey pile of hodgepodge that is supposed to look like human leftovers. It's only 72 minutes long, yet Mikels succeeded in making his film quite boring and overlong. Overall, an abominable film, but not entirely without merit in case you're an avid cult-movie purchaser.
