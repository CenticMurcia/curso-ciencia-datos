Jack Scalia gets better with age..his acting skills always complement Jackie Collins ..Farrah and Melissa Gilbert were perfect casting ..the actors and friendship among the cast added to the story...My main interest in the movie was Jack Scalia, this movie proves that if given the right script his acting talents are enduring..More Jack Scalia in the future . PLEASE! Too many producers look to other countries for actors. Thank You Jackie Collins for giving us a chance to see more projects and actors otherwise not considered for romantic roles..JACK Scalia will still be sexy in his 80s..<br /><br />Again, this movie was a wonderful escape and ended way to soon! Fondly! jsn
