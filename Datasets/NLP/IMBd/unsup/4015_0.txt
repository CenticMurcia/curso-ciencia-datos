The famed lady spy is on the move.... and the make.<br /><br />It's beautiful Sylvia Kristel's turn to take a shot at playing the most famous female double-agent in World War I history. The twist here is that she also beds every other guy she sees in an art museum or on the train to her next 'performance'.... as it were. Primary focus is on Sylvia and her shapely boobs with little attention to spy stuff. Rather mundane, unless Sylvia is topless; not much happens and the film never seems to have anywhere to go, except to the predictable ending - after all, the film is based on a true story. That's OK, but did it have to be so boring?<br /><br />Gaye Brown is sexy as a lesbian German political officer.
