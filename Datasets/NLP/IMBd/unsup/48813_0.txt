If you don't know anything about Algeria, you might enjoy this movie. Anyone who knows the country of Algeria, its history or its geographic location will know that there is something wrong with this movie. The biggest question is the use of French as the language of the characters. while French is widely spoken in Algeria especially in academic institutions, Arabic is the official language and is the language of the street. Through out the entire movie, i haven't heard a single Arabic word of dialog (excepy for the song in the caf√©)which is absurd. The other puzzling question is the death of the prostitute. In a country that is awash with guns and violence, its hard to believe that a state security officer will go to great lengths to murder a prostitute who he thinks stole his gun. I just find this very stupid. it doesn't make any sense. the setting for this story should have been in Europe or Latin America not Algeria. this movie was a total waste of time.
