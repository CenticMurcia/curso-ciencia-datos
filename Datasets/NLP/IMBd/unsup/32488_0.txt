If you're an enormous fan of Willis O'Brien and his work, then do watch this film as it contains some of the best integration of stop-motion animation and live action you'll see in any film. Alas, even that plus is spoilt for me by the model of Mighty Joe Young, who's made to look more like a bemused teddy bear than a ferocious gorilla (his ancestor, Kong, has bags more character in that respect). If you're hoping for a decent story with some sympathetic characters, don't expect any of that from the human actors. This is a big slice of schmaltz, woodenly scripted and very poorly paced dramatically, guaranteed to send you back with all the more admiration and gratitude for what the 1933 version of King Kong achieved.
