Beauty and the Beast it's a classic of literature, but, there's no adaptation of any tale that has surpassed the original one as this. The visual style blends perfectly the paintings of Europeans like Goya and Rembrandt on the fascinating land of Provence in France, and the Gothic-terrific architecture with beasts, devils and dragons with the fascinating Romanesque-Renaissance grand flavor of color, spaces, and themes. The haunting music in the beginning mixed with the glasses telling the story of a feudatory prince that was transformed into a beast by a beautiful enchantress. That glasses blending medieval style and moons and heraldic blossom's and dazzling blonde enchantresses are a perfect introduction to what we are going to see. The characters, there's no one of them useless, all of them loving. The music, the score, the story itself. The perfect movie for those who love perfection.
