After a Halloween on a Friday, Laura Kove (Jillian Byrnes) becomes agoraphobic. One year later she finds that her apartment is haunted. She searches in Internet and finds Elizabeth Dean (Jennifer Servary), a con ghost hunter, actually a stripper with a peepshow on line, offering her services and Laura and her best friend Nikki Brandt (Marianne Hayden) hire her to get rid off the fiend. Elizabeth investigates the past of Laura and discloses the truth of the mystery.<br /><br />"Ghost Watcher" is so amateurish and flawed that becomes funny. It is the typical movie that you join your friends to make fun and laugh so ridiculous it is. I do not know how producers invested in this film with such terrible screenplay and cast. The story is horrible, the three lead characters are awful and their actions make no sense. Elizabeth, for example, is a slut that risks her life to help Laura, inclusive dying in the end, solves the murders of a serial killer in a couple of hours, in a absolute lack of coherence. Nikki killed and buried Malculm Dixon, but she accepts to go to the abandoned house in the night to show the corpse to Elizabeth after seeing the weird events in Laura's kitchen. And Laura is pure contradiction, hiring a stripper to hunt ghosts. If any actress of this flick reads my review, do not be upset with me, but the acting are simply awful in this movie. I do not intend to see "Ghost Watcher 2", therefore I hope to have the chance to see any of you in the future with better performances in another movie. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Ap√≥s a Morte" ("After the Death")
