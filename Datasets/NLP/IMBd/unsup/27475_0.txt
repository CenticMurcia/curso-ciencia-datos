Ileana, nice to hear there's another person who liked the show. In Finland we had 15 or 16 episodes I think, and I recorded all of those. I still do have them on VHS.<br /><br />Since Hardball's not on DVD, or even original VHS, I've been thinking of getting my recorded episodes to digital format at some point. I do have the pilot also, but due to some sad coincidences, it has a bit worse quality than the other episodes.<br /><br />Great series, John Ashton and Richard Tyson had a nice chemistry and fitted their roles perfectly. The best thing in the series was the humour, which often came from these two guys competing each other. That lead to a lot of juicy loud-mouthing and amusing happenings.<br /><br />Why it was canceled after one season, is a mystery to me, but I definitely miss the characters. It's not realistic to wait for it's second airing I guess. :(
