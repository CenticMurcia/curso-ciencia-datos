You've seen every single element of this movie before. Perhaps not in exactly the same order as presented here, but from the opening shot the plot is as predictable as the taste of a Big Mac. The only surprise is John C. McGinley (Scrubs) and Dabney Coleman as the inevitably corrupt Senator. There is even the little girl and her rag doll, the police captain, the main protagonist who is seen as a joke on the force, etc etc.<br /><br />The script reads like a term paper. (First term).<br /><br />Yet if you're willing to laugh at it (there's no opportunity to laugh with it), it comes across as a classic in its B-movie genre, instantly forgettable but watchable after 1am.
