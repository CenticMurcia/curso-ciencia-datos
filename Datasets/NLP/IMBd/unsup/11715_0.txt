Laughs galore and a disarming modernity punctuate this sophisticated screwball comedy. Grant is at his pinnacle. And Dunne tops him blow for blow. Surprisingly "liberated" for its day in many ways. D'Arcy, Cunningham, and Compton take turns nearly stealing the show, and Ralph Bellamy started patenting his career with this role. Marvellous fun.
