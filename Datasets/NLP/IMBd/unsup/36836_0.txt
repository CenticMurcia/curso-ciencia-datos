i've been watching a lot of western-type indian movies recently, and ABCD has got to be the worst of them all. Although Bombay Boys was pretty stupid, and American Desi was just silly, they are much more polished than this movie. the number of inconsistencies in the movie are astounding. as the name name of the movie suggests, one would assume the characters are born in america. they're not. it is unclear at which point the children came to america, and it's even hard to tell from their accents. the choices of the main characters do not seem realistic, and their actions leave the audience with a bad taste in their mouths. if you choose to watch this film, take a pad and pen with you, so you can log all of the inconsistencies. it'll be fun.
