Gloriously stupid cheap rural slasher about a nasty killer who realizes that the title tool makes for an effective murder weapon. The film opens with a girl being gang raped by construction workers, and the murder spree starts pretty much right away. The two events would seem to be connected, but it takes our heroes, a big bear of a sheriff (Ron Queen) and the town doc (Rocky Patterson), a long time to put one and one together, much less two and two.<br /><br />Well, give the film-makers credit, principally Terry Lofton, who wore a number of hats on this show: co-director, producer, writer, actor (he plays a truck driver), casting director, stuntman, and provider of special effects! This is agreeably sleazy and trashy stuff, with generous doses of sex and nudity. (The sex scenes, including a vertical one against a tree, go on for quite some time.) It gets down to business right away with its rape scene, then moves right along to dispensing gnarly violence. (The gore is actually quite good, and will hit us guys right where we live by seeing a dude get his comeuppance in the worst possible place.)<br /><br />What makes this work, in my opinion, is that the despite the sleaziness and trashiness, it's done in a real tongue in cheek style. It's a case of one big joke that everyone's in on except for the majority of the characters. (And, of course, the actors perform it all with straight faces.) Our killer is wont to cracking hilariously awful one-liners, which are bad enough, but the capper on this persons' dialog is the kind of maniacal laughter one would expect from mad scientists and I-want-to-take-over-the-world type villains. All of it is just incredibly silly, and downright priceless.<br /><br />None of the acting is particularly good, but it's simply just another piece of this amusingly, agreeably cruddy hoot of a horror film.<br /><br />8/10
