This movie was a pretty good movie for what it was but it isn't my favorite movies but it is one of my favorite movies of the year 2003. This is a great family film but I wouldn't recommend it that smaller children(10 and under) see it because like the ride there are some scenes that would scare them. This movie is more for younger kids than Pirates was but adults would like it too. Eddie Murphy was great in his role, I would not have picked a better actor for that role. The special effects were amazing and I wouldn't be surprised if this movie at least got nominated for an academy award for visual effects. Terrance Stamp was excelent and so was the rest of the cast.
