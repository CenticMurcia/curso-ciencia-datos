Being a fan of Jensen Ackles, I was willing to make a lot of concessions for this movie. I thought that with a decent script, acting and some good moments I would be more than happy. I'm used to see comedy and romantic movies and if they are not that stupid I actually will love them, but this one was a complete disappointment. The script was completely predictable and full of holes. At some points I was wishing for the damn thing to be over so I could go and watch something actually interesting.<br /><br />Though the acting was very decent, the script didn't work on favor of any of the actors, especially on the completely unnecessary nudity scenes of Danneel Harris. I think a good sex scene or nudity scene can be used for the benefit of the film but in this case you can note the intention of the director, writer and producers to add something to sell the film, at the inability of the script to do it by itself.<br /><br />I think the whole idea of the movie was good, and Jensen Ackles' role has some good moments and all the actors seem committed to achieve a good result but the script and the filming weren't up to the level, with errors like the apparition of microphones on the scenes, making it seem like this movie was filmed by amateurs. I'm not trying to be hard here, I'm just being honest. The movie has it's moments but all and all, after I watched it I could understand why it was only released in DVD. To watch under your own risk.
