30 minutes of talking. No flashbacks, memories dreams at all just a doctor talking to a patient who cant decide whether he's from Ireland or USA. (Gabriel Byrnes accent is awful) In this 30 minute first ep nothing happens but talking about a womens problems with her love life, no cracks, witty dialogue wise ass remarks jokes or anything that makes this watchable in the slightest.<br /><br />The doctor hardly talks accept the usual clich√© psychotherapist babble - how does that make you feel, do you want to talk more about that, this show is like real life in a doctors room, boring repetitive slow, the dialogue is immense however nonsensical in every way, nothing sticks in my head after all the talking is done it's plainly a snooze fest.<br /><br />I'd watch almost anything instead, worst TV show I've watched 2008-09.
