This is not a good film. It's neither entertaining nor making the viewer think of poverty and homelessness. The development of the main Character "Tristan" (laddie: Moritz Bleibtreu) is so ridiculous: He changes from a tough guy only affected by money and sex to a good boy who falls in love with an inhibited soldier of god. All he was seeking for was her virginity and after he got what he wanted he became a better person.<br /><br />The film fails because of two things: The plot gives the impression that the script only existed of a few key scenes which were strung together inaccurately. This makes the development of the story and of the two main characters Tristan and Josefine appear illogical. Moritz Bleibtreu plays on the level of a daily-soap actor. His bad guy behaviour is implausible. The new male german stars like Bleibtreu, Wink and Bauer shouldn't spend their time on fame but on learning to act (Bauer) and reading good scripts. And that's meant for Detlev Buck, too.
