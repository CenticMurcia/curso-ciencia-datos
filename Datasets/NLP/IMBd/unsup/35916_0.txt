This film.. was made for people in the sticks with webbed feet and 6 toes.... not great, bad acting... and an even worse story line. Its like Dawn of the dead meets babe? U get bit by a sheep.. u slowly turn into one? It does not make sense and wont work in any way at all. I would rather watch an old man watching paint dry? A sheep humping a man wearing a sheep skin car cover? Whatever next? Sharing a toothbrush with a horse? No thanks don't like it, its not clever or funny. I wanna know whos lightbulb lit up with "i have an idea, lets make sheep aggressive?? it tickles me to think people spent time and effort on this, and its amuses me more to imagine this film winning an award. That would be funny. Please people in New Zealand... take up a hobby or 2... leave the film making to the masters!
