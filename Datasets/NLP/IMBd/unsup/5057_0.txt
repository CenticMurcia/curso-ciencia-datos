Almodovar is the best women director of the actual movie scene. Why? Look at the characters: Helena, Carmen...they are really women in a screen. And the movie talks about society. How things can be misunderstood, how love modifies people. How insane the mankind is sometimes. It is a great movie to see with your mate.
