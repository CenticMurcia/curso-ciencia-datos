Secret of The Sword with He-Man and She-ra is one of my favorite children's movies when I was a kid! In fact I still remember when I saw it and where I saw it! This movie is one of my many prime posessions, as well as the other original episodes I have. Even though the animation wasn't the greatest, well it was in '85! Still amazes me how they did He-Man and She-Ra's transformation scenes. I would jump at the chance to re-do this movie over again, I did find some bloopers and they used a lot of stock footage and yes they had new footage too but the story lacked some emotion. I wish HallMark Entertainment would re-consider re-releasing the series on TV because I believe it will be great again! If not all the He-Man and She-Ra fans around the world will fight to keep them alive!
