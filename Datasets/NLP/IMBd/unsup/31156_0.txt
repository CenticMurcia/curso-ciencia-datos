Feast is the brain child of Project Greenlight--a horror film which attempts to capture the essence of classic horror films while at the same time putting a contemporary and gory spin on things. I am a fan of B-movies, whether they be over-the-top gorefests, in which the hero or heroin must overcome impossible odds, or the slapstick humor that sometimes accompanies such horror flicks.<br /><br />The reason Feast fails is because it did neither for me while watching. I never found myself intrigued by the monsters save the very beginning, never found myself laughing, and never once said "Wow i have never seen that kind of death before!" While there are various hints of humor through out the film, none are intelligent to illicit even a slight smile. The plot and mysteriousness of the monsters is abruptly ruined, and the viewer is left with horrible special effects--which is okay--but absolutely no lead up to an action filled moment, IE: It is not scary.<br /><br />The director's attempts at surprise fall painfully short, as the ending is just as predictable as any other B-movie out there. The only redeeming quality in this film is the highly stylistic approach from the director as far as characterization goes, as well as a Scanner esquire head explosion. It is as if the director tried to capture the B-movie demographic, but went so over the top the movie failed miserably.<br /><br />This review is from a true horror fan, and I am giving it a 3/10.
