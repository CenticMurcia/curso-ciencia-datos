It revolves around three convicts who are facing a death sentence, and a woman making a documentary on them.<br /><br />Its a slow paced movie, but its unconventional story and some really nice devices used (like simultaneous scenes & incremental flashbacks) make it a very gripping movie.<br /><br />Its a treat to watch and speculation persists throughout the movie - and the movie does have a few predictable and stereotyped aspects, but the way they all fit in makes you pardon them.<br /><br />Though the plot has been very well woven, the characters somehow haven't been polished enough. Jackie is good, as a lawyer who is now a convict. He is an intellectual & sophisticated person. But his reasons for being the way he is aren't really highlighted well. Maybe some scenes were lost in editing. Naseeruddin is a take-life-as-it-comes carefree small-timer who finds himself behind bars quite too often. He has played his character very well, handled all the subtleties effectively. Juhi as the Movie Maker, comes out as a simple straight-forward unhappily married woman. Her character though has some quirky characteristics, which don't seem to blend in well. Her character could have been more atomic. Nagesh himself shines through as a very natural Unsophisticated Hyderabadi Accountant. His realistic dialogue delivery is a fresh break from the dramatic delivery one generally finds in Bollywood. His is an endearing character. Gulshan Grover is the capable jailor and has sunk into his role. But his role wasn't very demanding, so he hasn't really got a chance to showcase himself here. Overall, the interaction between the varied characters,the setting of a Andhra Pradesh Jail, and the beatifully narrated story, make it a must see.
