Short Version: Japanese culture and American Wild West collide. The two concepts flow together very well. Plot is solid if a bit thin, but contains a few twists. Tone is laid back with some dramatic moments that'll keep you grounded. Characters are amazing and unforgettable.<br /><br />Setting: The movie mostly takes place in a Wild West style settlement, the kind with one street and houses on either side. However, the architecture, the inhabitants, and the atmosphere of the town are all Japanese. Two warring clans, the Reds and the Whites, have taken over, but remain on their own sides of the town for the most part. A lone gunslinger wanders into the town, offering his services to the highest bidder. He soon realizes, however, that both clans are evil and need to be extinguished, and so the plot goes on.<br /><br />Honestly, when you cut away all the fluff, the story boils down to a three-way war between the two clans and a couple of expert gunslingers. Fast-paced action and broken English can make the story hard to follow, but if you pay attention, there are a few twists and turns that'll keep you engaged.<br /><br />Tone: The movie is moderately light-hearted. A couple of characters give some comic relief, and a good chunk of the movie is not rooted in reality. On the other hand, the motivation behind the characters is real enough. There are a few scenes and a large piece of the story that really comes into play later during the movie that grounds you. I'm not saying it's the perfect blend of mindless action with superb storytelling, but it does a pretty good job.<br /><br />Characters: Personally, the characters went a long way towards selling the movie. There are a ton of them, and each one is unique and unforgettable. Both clan leaders are rotten in their own right, combine that with a Japanese Clint Eastwood, a sheriff with a very Gollum-esquire split personality disorder, a gun-toting granny, and Quentin Tarantino. You can't go wrong.
