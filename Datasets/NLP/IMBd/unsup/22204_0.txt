First-rate, outstanding, amazing storytelling & dialogs. What i dislike. 1.There were some plot inconsistencies as for me, mostly about languages they speak between races. (Well it's forgivable in the world of magic. And what a wonderful world!) 2.April is sometimes stupid and i didn't really like her as much as Zoe from sequel. 3.Resolution is obsolete (640x480?) even for 2000. 4.People you talk to are usually too forgetful. One example. Just half-a-minute ago the receptionist said i should disappear 'cause i'm not allowed in here, now he really believes April's a pizza-girl and lets me in... Strange. Then what i like. Well i like everything else. This is really a different story. No stupid narnias. I've found some references to World War II here. Dialogs are superb. Voices are perfect. Design is all well done. Sound is involving. Gameplay is non-active, but thanks to the story very interesting. I could run Journey all day long. We have the great ability of "skipping time" here. If you don't want to waste your precious time or fall asleep upon watching your April getting from one side of screen to another you just press escape several times and she gets where she's going in a few (real-time) seconds. This is one of my favorite fantasy worlds & stories: Ragnar Tornquist's world is inferior only to J.R.R. Tolkien's. And surely one of my favorite adventure games behind Grim Fandango (of course) and (i really love TLJ's sequel) Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.
