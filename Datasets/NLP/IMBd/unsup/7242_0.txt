This is available on RCA CED Videodisc, RCA's videodisc format from 1981-1986. I am watching it right now with my son on CED. You can find the discs and machines at on the web at CED Central. Was originally made for TV, so it has a lot of actors that appeared mainly in television productions. The 70's standard of special effects may seem dated, but it has it's own charm for younger generations and nostalgia for those from the time period. Actually, I find the low tech special effects easier on the eyes than the computer wizardry of today. I look at the digital effects of today and the imagery seems thin and repulsive. Live action blue screen and low tech crawling up the side of the building when its on the flat simpler, but the imagery is richer and more full. I find that more appealing to suspending my sense of disbelief.
