This is a film that could have been so much more but unfortunately the script lacks any real drive or ambition to be memorable and the blame goes entirely to the director who wrote this. Story is about a bunch of friends who are having a party when one of them goes berserk and has his hair fall out and then proceeds to murder three women. Jerry Zipkin (Zalman King) is blamed for the murders and runs off to elude the police so he can investigate what has happened. With the help of his faithful girlfriend Alicia Sweeney (Deborah Winters) the trail leads to a politician named Edward Flemming (Mark Goddard) who attended Stanford University ten years before.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Flemming use to sell LSD while at school but this drug is called Blue Sunshine and everyone who took it then is now ten years later feeling the effects by having their hair fall out and becoming a homicidal maniac that kills anyone in their path. <br /><br />This film is written and directed by Jeff Lieberman who also made "Squirm" and if you view this expecting to see something outrageous and wild than forget it! Aside from the beginning when a woman is shoved into a fireplace there is really no moment that make an impact. The film has no real ending to speak of and when things are winding down a message pops up stating that a special task force was formed and that there are several more unaccounted people that have taken Blue Sunshine. I guess the film wanted to make a statement against taking drugs but this has the same effect as Nancy Reagan saying "Just say no". I kept thinking of what a director like Roger Corman could have done with a premise like this and Lieberman deserves all the blame for making this totally "Blah". The script makes no effort to describe what makes Blue Sunshine different or how Goddard got a hold of it ten years earlier. Corman would have made an exploitation film that viewers would still be talking about today and it would have been full of nudity and graphic events but alas, Lieberman instead directed a film that is completely forgettable. You know a film is in trouble when the main highlight is spotting a young Brion James in an early role. Excuse me Jeff...do yourself a favor and rent "Big Bad Mama" with Angie Dickinson and find out what you can actually do with a low budget film!
