The Iron Crown is a wonderful fantasy film that carries on the great traditions of Italian pepla such as Cabiria. There are hints that the filmmakers had seen Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but The Iron Crown also anticipates---and establishes the blueprint for---films as disparate as Shrek, The Princess Bride, and many of the renewed pepla cycle of the 60s. The film is also echoed by Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, though it is certainly a lighter hearted affair. Wrestler Primo Carnera is on hand as a loyal strong man, adding interest for fans of the squared circle. Skillfully blending comedy, romance, and action, this is not to be missed.
