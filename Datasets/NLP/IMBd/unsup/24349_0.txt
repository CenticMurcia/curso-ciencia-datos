this is the sweetest little movie...the dialogue is a little cheesy, but you have to understand it was made in the 80s and geared for little kids. the bears are so cute, and there are some parts that will make you laugh, and if your especially sensitive, you might even tear up at some parts. the second movie is good too, but theres a little too much darkness in it, with the evil boy at camp and everything. the first movie is all fun, and very little scary-ness. its also when you first meet the care bear cousins, which are a bunch of jungle animals and at the end they all get their little tummy-pictures. its a really great movie to rent when your in a happy mood. :-)
