I had read only bad reviews about this movie, but I decided to try to find it anyway. When I did, I wished that I had saved my money. I love the title of this movie, and I love cheap, gory movies like Redneck Zombies and Blood Feast, but this movie wasn't funny or gory. It took over an hour for the grannies to open the present that turns them rabid. In that hour the actors talk and talk and talk about things that are truly useless and extremely boring. When the grannies turned rabid I was hoping the movie could redeem itself by having some cool gore or humor, or anything besides talk, instead we are supposed to be scared that the grannies are chasing the people around the big castle house thing. After listening to the stupid people talk for over an hour I just wanted to see them die quickly, I didn't care that they tried to escape. What a terrible movie...Don't be fooled by the title.
