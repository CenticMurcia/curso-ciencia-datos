Where to begin? When I first heard of Narnia I thought that it was an old movie that in a few weeks was going to be released on TV. That was probably on July, and some months later I thought that my theory was right, I mean, even I went to a store and saw like a DVD of Narnia (probably the novels or how they made the movie). When I went to see "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" I saw a poster of the Chronicles of Narnia, that it was going to be released on December 9.<br /><br />I like movies of witches, legends, imagination, adapted on novels, or like that. I expected much of this movie, I mean, the special effects of the commercials seemed great, it was like a war between the good guys vs. the bad guys, and after all I was right.<br /><br />Soon I saw the movie (don't ask how), and for my surprise I loved it, the characters had great acting skills, the story was freakin' great, I couldn't move from my seat, I had to see all the movie, the characters are amazing, man, you gotta see the movie if you want to understand me... GREAT MOVIE.
