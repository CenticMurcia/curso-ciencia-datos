It really is too bad. The sets looked great, the special effects on the moon were well done, it's just that the film has no soul at all. Nothing. The script was brutal to put it kindly. It is kind of like what Beverly Hills Cop 7 would have been after they had started to go downhill after the first one. Murphy tries to make it humorous, but there was no humour in any of the lines. They were just frustratingly moronic. It was 3's Company type action, with many bug-eyed looks at other characters, pratfalls, ludicrous plot holes, and juvenile humour. There are no redeeming qualities at all in this movie apart from the set design. It is really sad that a studio would waste that kind of money (100 mil) on garbage like this when the set could have been put to much better use.<br /><br />There are very few highlights, one in particular involving John Cleese as an automated chauffeur. But that is about it. All of the cast members are wasted in this lackluster effort, including Eddie Murphy himself. He has proved he can carry a film (Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, Trading Places), but it has been a long time since he has appeared in anything decent. This could have been it, however the director went for a 3 Stooges approach instead of a much grittier and darker 48 Hours. If this movie had any of 48 Hours grit, or BHC's humour, it might have been halfway decent. Instead it is nothing more than smarmy, predictable, dull, and annoying. The fight between the Murphys at the end was very well done graphically, it wasn't possible to determine exactly how they did it (Murphy fights himself), except of course it was the type of fight that would have been more at home in an Ernest movie. All the special effects are therefore completely wasted, along with the 100 mil some studio sunk into this dog. What were they thinking? 2/10 (I gave an additional point for the sets, NOT for the movie)
