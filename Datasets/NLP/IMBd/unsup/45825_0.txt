This one was so exciting that I fell asleep about half way through, and it only runs for 30 minutes. Viewed the remainder later. What a crock of s.... The film danced around so much as to be unable to see anything. Like its trying to say, I want to show you this but you can't look at it. The melodrama of the talking heads is pathetic at best. I rated it awful just because there was nothing lower. Be glad you missed it. Its not a documentary, but a contrived piece to make you believe it is. A movie you definitely will want to miss.
