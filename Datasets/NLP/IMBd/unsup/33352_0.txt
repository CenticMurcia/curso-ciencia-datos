Son of a "B" (Sorry for the offensive letters)! This show sucks and blows at the same time, denying the laws of physics! All the characters are retards, except they're not retards, so they have no excuse! Otto, the "leader of the gang" smarts of to everyone in authority and almost never gets punished. And when he does he always gets out of it, except in one instance. His dad is an idiot because I said so. OK, that's not why. His dad is a tolerable character.<br /><br />Reggie, his sister, has a penis, definitely. She hangs out with the boys and is not attracted to any of them. She likes "Squid" (Another character) and pities him because Otto decides to be a scum bag and make fun of him, but she almost never does anything about it. She also has some stupid magazine called "The Zine". And no one reads it. It's like, WTH?!?! She puts the stupidest stuff in there, like, "California sweet spots" and other pansexual shenanigans.<br /><br />Squid and Twister would take way too long to go into detail with. So Squid: Nerd who is pretty annoying. Twister: A pushover retard ****head.<br /><br />The show also had minimal morality. It was like, "If you're smart you fail at life," and "If you suck up to your parents you can get away with anything." As opposed to Twister's brother, who didn't get away with anything.<br /><br />The show is entertaining, but you don't want it to be, and you feel guilty when you like it. So, don't get guilty. Screw this crap. If you see it on, burn your TV (Unless it has TiVo).<br /><br />Overall: It sucks. 2/10. And Otto has a very small or nonexistent man part.
