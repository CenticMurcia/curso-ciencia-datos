As a member of the BDSM community, I have to say that this movie was complete trash. D Stevens had supposedly worked with people in this lifestyle and alleges that this movie would show the lifestyle in a positive light.<br /><br />I am sorry, but equating a consensual slave who has agreed to be in a Dominant submissive lifestyle with someone who is killed so their organs can be sold is NOT sending a positive message. This movie is a plot mess, and the acting is wooden (I am being kind as most wooden statues have better acting range than the cast of this film) with the exception of the ladies who played the pets. (They seemed to be much better at playing the pet roles than they were when playing the non pet portion of their characters.) Sadly, Mr Stevens stated goal of exposing the international human trafficking could be much better addressed by leaving the consensual slavery of the BDSM lifestyle out of it and focus solely on the non consensual slavery he was supposed to be exposing.
