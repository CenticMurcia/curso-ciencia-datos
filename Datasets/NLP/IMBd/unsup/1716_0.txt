This film was extremely well acted and cast, but the story is what I really enjoyed. Many people are commenting on the "reincarnation" aspect of the film - they've totally missed the point. The film isn't about reincarnation, it's about how credulousness and emotional fragility leads one woman into a dark, disturbing relationship with a lonely prankster, and ultimately about how one woman gets her revenge for a long-ago wrong.<br /><br />The film is beautifully made, with a soundtrack that sets the mood instead of "cu-ing" you on how you are supposed to react to a scene (like so many soundtracks try to do these days).<br /><br />If you like movies that explore the darker side of humanity, then you will really enjoy "Birth."
