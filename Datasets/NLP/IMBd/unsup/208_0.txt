I really liked this movie!! It shows you more in depth on "the enemy" & "the villain". I actually felt sorry for Sadako. & the actress is really really pretty.<br /><br />I believe compared to the other two movies of this Japanese trilogy, Ring 0 is by far the best. It shows you how Sadako came to be, the girl in the well, & the girl on TV.<br /><br />Sadako is a teenager {How!? When she kills as a little girl!? Doesn't make sense? It will if you watch it.} & she is in an acting troupe to get away from her problems, & she witnesses love & fear.<br /><br />You get to see the REAL side of her, & see how unfair Sadako really was treated.<br /><br />Please watch this movie. It will do you good & a good change compared to all that other craptacular American horror flicks that are really comedies.<br /><br />This movie will make you think & touch your heart.
