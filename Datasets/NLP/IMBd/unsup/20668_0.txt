I'm no snob when it comes to low-budget action films: just a few days ago, I watched "Blast!" (2004), a straight-to-video Die-Hard-On-An-Oil-Rig, and I liked it more than "Die Hard 4". But "The Vault" is just awful by any standards. Lousy, disorienting editing, pathetic "special effects", sloppy, illogical script, bloodless gunshots, and obscenely bad acting (Laci Szabo makes Jean Claude Van Damme look like Laurence Olivier) all contribute to making this possibly the worst action movie "inspired" by "Die Hard" ever - if there is a worse one out there, I don't want to see it. There is a half-decent fight between Szabo and Rutten at the end - if you have stuck with the movie for that long. Diana Lee Inosanto shows brief glimpses of fighting talent; Brynn Lucas (as the hero's daughter) is hot; I wouldn't mind seeing either of them again, in something better - which essentially means, in anything else.
