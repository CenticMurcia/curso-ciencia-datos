Ugh. What a disappointment. A great line-up: Dannie Hedaya, Big Burt Reynolds, Seymour Cassel, Richard Dreyfuss and even Lainie Kazan; an excellent premise for hilarity: a bunch of retired wise-guys...and no story. It just falls apart like one of those cartoon characters that's been hit in the head with a falling anvil: first, the head, then an arm, then..., well, you know. Dang! it's too stinking bad as I wanted, really wanted to see some funny business out of this array of talent-- but, even the best acting "Crew" can't pull it off with no story. The first reviewer here remarked on the retiree stereotypes and the gags wear thin, thin after the first run through. The plot (?) doesn't hold and it goes down, down. Bummer. I don't like to dis a film, especially with a "Crew" of guys that I've enjoyed in other films, but this one is a stinker and we will just have to let it go. Bummer again. I was up for some good comedy.
