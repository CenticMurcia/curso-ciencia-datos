This little film (actually 3 separate films) looks as if it was shot as a college film school thesis. The characters all seem to be students, academics, and artists, exactly the kind of people who populate such films! The characters don't seem to be experiencing any romantic epiphanies, either, but rather the filmmaker seems to be exploring the kind of questions of how-do-you-fall-in-love-and-who-with that are so ... collegiate.<br /><br />I found it mildly diverting; my wife found it a good cure for her insomnia.<br /><br />As a travelogue, it provides a great tour of the parks of Paris, and glimpses of the Metro and city streets.
