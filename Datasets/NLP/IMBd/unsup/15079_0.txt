Maybe "Lifeboat" wasn't Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movie, but it was still interesting. It tells of several people who survive a torpedoed ship and have to live together on a boat. On the boat, they've got more than a few surprises awaiting them, namely because of the men who torpedoed the ship is on board with them. The main character is vain heiress Connie Porter (Tallulah Bankhead), who can never seem to apply enough makeup. The other characters (William Bendix, Walter Slezak, Mary Anderson, John Hodiak, Henry Hull, Heather Angel, Hume Cronyn, Canada Lee) also have their quirks - and secrets. All in all, this is a perplexing, and delicious, movie.
