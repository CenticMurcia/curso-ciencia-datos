I wish I could give this film a higher score because of the lovely portrayals given by Ethel Waters & Brandon de Wilde. However, Julie Harris ruined this film for me. I've seen this movie before, a long time ago, and thought is was really good. However, I watched it again last night and had forgotten how truly over the top Harris' performance was. I've been 12 years old and I can't imagine that any 12 year old would get away with behaving like that in any circumstance. She was just a little too smart and a little too angry for my taste. Like someone else stated, it was the intensity that got to me (I don't really like Brando either--thank you Michael Bo.) The thing that saves the movie for me is Waters performance--probably the best she ever had in the movies. Too bad it was overshadowed by Harris' histrionics. I just don't think that most 12 year old girls would be that outwardly angry. Plus, it was a little creepy to me the obsession she had with her brother & sister in law. Was she in love with both of them or just in love with love, even though she commented, continuously, about not believing in love. Gah!!! It just bugged me to no end. However, I do give credit to the makers of the film for capturing a little bit of what the South was like in the 1950's.
