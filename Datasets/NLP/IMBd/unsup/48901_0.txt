What a pathetic embarrassment this is to Fred Ward, Andy Dick, Dean Cain, and Sean Patrick Flahery. The situations were completely improbably, and the melodrama ridiculous, and none of the characters were even remotely believable. Too grim to be a comedy, too idiotic to be black humor, this movie has nothing going for it.
