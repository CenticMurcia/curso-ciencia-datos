Atrocious college comedy follows a group of campus goof-offs who do little but chase after girls. One of the most idiotic scenes in movie musicals has to be Pat Boone, in the boys locker room, instructing Richard (Dick) Sargent on the art of picking up chicks, crooning "Technique" a la Harry Belafonte. Boone, actually playing the coolest of the kids (!), is repugnant enough in his striped shirts and sweater vests, but if cinematic justice were at all serving, this picture would've put the kibosh on squeaky-voiced Sargent's career ("Ohh, gee!!"). Terry Moore plays the telephone operator the guys get hung up on, and her placid demeanor and condescending smile suggest she's no brainier than the boys. * from ****
