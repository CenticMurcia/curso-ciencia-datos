A great cast <br /><br />Beautiful setting <br /><br />Lively script (based on a fab novel (i've had so many recommendations to read it) <br /><br />It's a touching film, possibly even a tear jerker that most women are likely to fall in love with. The lead part of Cassandra is played with commitment and I believed 100% in her character because she did. Other characters, her father, played by Bill Nighy added a sense of humour to the film.<br /><br />Basically its a great film. Watch it.
