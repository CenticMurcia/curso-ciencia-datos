I'm having difficulty assimilating the message of this episode, it doesn't come across as all that positive to me. You have young Henry who thinks the world of Bolie Jackson - "You're my friend Bolie, you're my good and close friend". I have to tell you, that kind of friendship is worth more than anything else in the world. With not enough people in the world to believe in magic and wishes, I found it almost cruel that Bolie would take away Henry's big, tall wish to do something wonderful for his friend. Yes, I know, Bolie was trying to help Henry realize that the 'real' world doesn't work on hopes and wishes, but would it have been so bad to help Henry believe in miracles? You know, the kind of miracles that resemble 'Yes, Virginia', the kind that turns a loser into a winner with a prayer and a just make it so. I thought it just a little sad that Henry 'grew up' at the end of the story by realizing that he might be too old for magic and wishes. I'm trying hard to come up with an alternate ending for the story, but I'm coming up empty. It seems like this time, Rod Serling painted himself into a corner and couldn't come up with a clever way out. A better take away might have been for Henry to learn that trying and failing is better than not trying at all, and would have made Bolie a better friend for being that teacher.
