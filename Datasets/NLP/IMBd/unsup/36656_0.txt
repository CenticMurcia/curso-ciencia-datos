Well, Peter sellers has died, yet this movie posthumously "stars" Peter Sellers. There are deleted scenes from the older works of this franchise, and they have brought back Sir. Charles Litton (David Niven) from the original, and the actual Pink Panther makes a return. It's really too bad they didn't do this in the Revenge. Maybe that would not have equated the proverbial, "Too Little, Too Late," adage.<br /><br />I've always been puzzled as to why they would do this. I mean...okay, he's dead, so what can you do? You can end the franchise on a low note, you can hold a world-wide search for the next Clouseau, you can quietly seek someone to take his place, or you can make a regurgitated piece of crap from the old footage lying on the cutting room floors, slap a new title on it, bring back a few favorites, and call it a day. Obviously, they chose the last one. Bad choice, in my opinion. Actually, even if you're a collector, you can completely dispense with this installment, forget about the deleted scenes, and feel confident that you aren't missing a THING.<br /><br />Although Harvey Korman's performance was hilarious and inspired, it is painfully obvious that NO ONE else cared about this film, including Blake Edwards. It is also painfully obvious this was a clear milking of the franchise fans.<br /><br />It rates a 3.3/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
