One of John Candy's better films, playing disguise-laden private eye investigating the kidnapping of a young heiress. Ostensibly conceptualized as a live-action cartoon, the movie, unevenly directed by Paul Flaherty, is curiously mean-spirited at times, with ugly humor and situations nearly taking the steam out of Candy's good-natured lead. Candy, performing in a joshing low-key, is aided very nimbly by teen cohort Shawnee Smith, and theirs is a dryly appealing rapport. Annie Potts, as one of the villains, is stuck in a one-note role, but she gets her share of wild lines and her energy is commendable. The picture is sort of an underachiever, with a tired wrap-up and final tag, but parts of it are winning and Candy shows a lot of heart. ** from ****
