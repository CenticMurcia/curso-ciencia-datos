So, imagine you are handed a terrific story idea--a 14th century Middle English masterpiece which has stimulated numerous translations into modern English. What would you do next? In this case, the decision was made to completely ignore the original story, to completely ignore the original's aesthetic coherence that continues to invite translation and literary adaptation, and, for that matter, to completely ignore the idea that movie goers generally like to see something movie-like. A thousand chimpanzees with typewriters could have done better in two weeks time than Weeks and crew have done here. <br /><br />This film is a crime against cinema. Absolutely unwatchable. Perhaps actionable.<br /><br />Questions: (1) why is there no Mystery Science Theatre episode based on this film? Too easy? (2) Why, apart from another film by Weeks in the 1970s, have there been no other cinematic adaptations of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight? Or have there been such films?
