OK, where to begin? I love rare zombie flicks, and I love homemade horror films like this one. But I don't particularly like it when movies fail to entertain me, as "Bloodeaters" did. First off, the title. How does one "eat" blood? It's a liquid. You drink it. But "Bloodeaters" is a more accurate title than the retrofitted "Toxic Zombies", which seems intended to make the film seem as if it's a Troma flick. It's not, although it's definitely the kind of movie that Troma spoofs constantly.<br /><br />I do not have a problem with the film's low budget, because so much creativity can happen in a low budget movie. But there's a strange alchemy in creating an enjoyably cheap flick, and "Bloodeaters" never quite gels. It's not the bad acting, or the rock bottom production values, or the unconvincing effects, or the awful script. It's a combination of all of it. You can tell the director is inexperienced, and it shows.<br /><br />The "ghouls" here are not even zombies, they're just ordinary people who are very sick and extra homicidal. But there are some great WTF moments, like an opening nude scene that shows a woman bathing herself in the woods with a sponge and a dirty bucket. There's also a memorable "love scene" that begins as a love scene, turns into an argument during which the lovers tear each others clothes in anger. Then they start having sex.<br /><br />The plot itself is even strange: a group of marijuana farmers hiding out in a rural area, growing their crop, are found out somehow. Two feds (in flannel shirts and jeans, and without backup) approach a covert weed-growing operation in the wilderness. When they wind up dead, headquarters (?) decides that since they haven't reported back, then that MUST mean they've been killed by the weed farmers, who are only suspected to be in the general area. As a solution, they recruit a local crop duster to spread an experimental defoliating agent, which raises a number of questions. Without visiting the area themselves, how did they know what to tell the crop duster to look for? Why risk poisoning an entire area of wildnerness just because two agents haven't reported back? These guys are not too bright. In any case, it's lights out for the weed farmers, who get violently ill and then get the urge to shamble around and start biting people in order to drink...er, EAT their blood.<br /><br />Although it's not great cinema, there is one compelling moment where a wife and mother sees her husband murdered by the shambling sickies, and the actresses musters some convincing hysterics and terror. Unfortunately, the director follows it up with a typically ridiculous sequence where someone chooses to ignore all obvious signs of danger and gets chomped for no good reason.<br /><br />Devout zombie fans may get a charge out of "Bloodeaters", just so you can say you've seen everything. But no matter how your crop is dusted, this one will probably just bore you to death.
