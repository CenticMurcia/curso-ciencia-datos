The movie itself is a failure, big time. Scare elements left me yawning (literally). The story has no real ending, and makes little sense. However, I do like the premise where the movie is based on, and the directing made the movie looks very much like a reality show. I find myself asking the same questions as I would while watching a reality show. The sound is nothing to shout about, but the sight is quite awesome. Set design was incredibly detailed and realistic. Lighting was especially good. However, costume design and make-up leaves a lot to be desired. Acting was incredibly lame. A good watch to waste your time, but I have better things to do and scarier movies to watch. Try Shutter if you can get your hands on it. One of the best Thai scary movie ever. In fact, with Shutter and Dorm, I'll say that Thai movies are beginning to play better than most Hollywood cash cows, but then Ghost Game came along and destroyed my conviction.
