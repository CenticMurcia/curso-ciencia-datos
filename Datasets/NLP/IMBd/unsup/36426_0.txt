By directing this film, Luc Besson proved that he's made a big mistake by involving himself in Hollywood system. He's more successful in directing movies like Leon, The Big Blue, La Femme Nikita. He can not be a good director in sci-fi movies and epics like Messenger: the story of JF. Please somebody tell him.
