All I can say about this game is wow. Sega does it again (very hard for them to keep it up though). I loved the gameplay, soundtrack, and story line. I still play it since there's so much to do (get every emblem, get perfect scores, etc). I also thought it was very well-planned and made. Good job Sega. Hopefully they'll keep it up, even as a second party.
