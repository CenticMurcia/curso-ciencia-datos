A little slow at first, but once I got into this movie I really enjoyed it. This was my first Woody Allen movie, and I thought he was funny for the most part. I laughed out loud on more than one occasion (especially in a scene in which he attempts to make a pass at a depressed girl in a museum). Diane Keaton did a very good job as the lead female character. I especially enjoyed Jerry Lacy's performance as "Humphrey Bogart". Woody's fantasy conversations with "Bogart" were especially enjoyable, and lead to some of the funnier lines/scenes in the movie. A good comedy, one which I would imagine especially Woody Allen fans would enjoy. I think it also helps if you are a Bogart fan, such as myself.<br /><br />8/10
