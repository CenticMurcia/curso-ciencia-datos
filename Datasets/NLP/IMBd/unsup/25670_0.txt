This one is such a classic. I don't know why so many people hate it. I found it very funny all the way through.<br /><br />What surprised me when viewing it after haven't seeing it for over 10 years is that most of the SNL cast is in this movie. I found them to be pretty funny.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert* <br /><br />The movie revolves around a couple of aliens who get left on Earth and they can't leave Earth for a long period of time so the alien couple try to adapt on Earth by starting a family and living among the people of Earth. The movie is called Coneheads because of the top of their head is shaped like a cone.<br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />The movie is very funny. I would recommend everybody see this. I was pleasantly surprised to find it just as funny as I did 10 years ago. Don't worry, Dan Aykroyd and the rest of the SNL cast won't disappoint you. Pick it up for some good laughs.
