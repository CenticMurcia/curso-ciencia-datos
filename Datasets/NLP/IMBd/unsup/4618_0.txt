This movie reminds me of the themes in "One Hundred Years of Solitude." It deals with being isolated even though you have family. The movie has very touching themes and is focused on relationships between people. The ending is especially touching and poetic, as it shows how the ones we think of as lonely may be the only ones who can teach us to connect with others and have faith in humanity.<br /><br />The acting was wonderful. The mother's eyes exuded such a deep sadness and yet so much love and patience. The old man was instantaneously lovable. Even the dog did a wonderful job. The woman's fiery personality was completely believable, and her lover was realistically a jerk. This movie has so much going for it, and it's refreshing to see a movie that touches on the distinctly human qualities, both good and bad, and carry them across so realistically. The movie never gets tiring, and I always felt I was personally invested in the lives of all the characters. Highly recommended.
