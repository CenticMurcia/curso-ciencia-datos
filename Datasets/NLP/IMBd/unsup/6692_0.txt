First of all, let me say that I am ASTONISHED that in 2008 anyone is still aware of this movie and further taking the time to comment on it on IMDb! Now let me tell you why this is an important, groundbreaking and momentous moment in film history: pivotal scenes were filmed at CAZENOVIA COLLEGE in lovely, tiny little Cazenovia NY in the snowy winter of 1978 when I and my classmates were tapped to be extras in the "college scenes"! Little did we know that those fun couple of days would turn into one of the most forgettable movies in cinematic history! But hey, for those days we were STARS - taking direction, re-shooting scenes, learning not to look at the camera and each deciding that it was perfectly reasonable to expect that a Hollywood Director would see one of us in the background crowd, jump to his feet and yell FIND ME THAT GIRL!! It could happen, we'd seen it in the movies, after all.<br /><br />OK, so the movie was a little on the sappy side, the song was on the radio sung by the incomparable Roberta Flack and we got to attend a Premier Screening in Syracuse when it opened. Now, as we look to our 30th Reunion Year in 2008 (yikes!) we will be treated to a special screening of the film again as part of our Reunion Weekend festivities.<br /><br />So here's to Joe Brooks and the rest of the cast and crew who ended a long day of shooting in the Central New York snowbanks by sharing drinks and laughs at the Caz Bar - i still have my "autographed" napkin and swizzle sticks taped into my scrapbook along with review clippings and snapshots of our Hollywood Moment together! CHEERS!
