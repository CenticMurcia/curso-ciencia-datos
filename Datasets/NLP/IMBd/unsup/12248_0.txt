Awesome. This is one of the best (real) independent films I have ever seen. The film opens with a smoothly visualized, crisply edited burst of action that neatly outlines the major elements of the thriller to follow. Writer-Director Kenneth Guertin keeps the action moving and handles his non-star cast competently. For a first time writer he tells his story economically and clearly. Guertin takes us on a journey of an every day man caught up in a bad situation. This is the film `Chain Reaction' was hoping to be. Great looking cinematography and Marco Beltarmi's music is excellent. I can see why he went on to do the `SCREAM' trilogy and much more.<br /><br />I had a great time watching his film and I think this filmmaker will be some one to watch out for.
