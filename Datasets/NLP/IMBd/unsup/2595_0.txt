I don't know what movie these other voters saw, but it clearly wasn't the same one I did. This movie was in no way a blockbuster, but deserves a better rating than a four something. This movie was straight comedy all the way through and Showed us the Farley that we all know and love. Being a big dumb idiot is what made him famous and kept him famous up untill his untimely death. If he would have actually tried acting he would have bombed like Sandler has recently. Matthew Perry was also funny in this movie, as well as all the other big or slightly big names in the movie. Best Line of the Movie: "Pittsburgh Nelly. The wh*re who can do things with her one good arm that would make you forget about that thing on her neck"
