Its fair to say that in cinematic terms, British cinema will sadly always lack behind Hollywood, they have more money and more exposure and if you went out onto the street and asked people about this movie, the majority would not know what you meant. but in terms of quality, i will state categorically this is easily as good as ANYTHING Hollywood has produced. made on a shoestring, we dive headfirst into the seedy sleazy underworld of London life, the pimps, hookers and general lowlifes that crawl through the gutters of this world... we meet a downtrodden prostitute and an 11 year old girl (a fabulous performance by Georgia Broome) on the run, which is not obviously clear why at first. I've personally never seen a film that is so raw, down at heel and realistic, almost like the cameraman followed these people around and simply filmed the horrors they go through... no cheese, no pretensions simply raw and unflinching in its portrayal. i have no other choice to give this bleak, dark sad and enthralling movie 10/10... hoping its stock will rise in years to come. definitely not for kids, and anybody else easily offended, but marvellous entertainment.
