Is it just me or is Chuckie's ax always slightly out of tune? I really enjoyed this film and learned a lot about Berry, his past, the career, and a sometimes tyrannical attitude. Not to much on his arrest or marital life; Chuck nipped that in the bud before it got off the ground. A lot of good footage is offered of the band rehearsing and then giving a sensational concert featuring several other artists. Also the viewer is treated to several interviews by various recording artists. Clearly, Berry is an out of the ordinary man, likeable in many ways, but a bit hard to swallow at times. I felt his attempt to change keys in the middle of a song during the performance was an amateur stunt at best. He is anything but a great guitarist, but none the less a complete showman.
