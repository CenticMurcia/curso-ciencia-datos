This is a serious piece of film. Ving Rhames is one of the really under-rated actors out there right now....and Jim Brown is rock solid as the man who finally forces Animal to take a look at himself. The thing is: Brown's character makes Animal realize that while he's the way he is as a result of the Black Experience in America, he doesn't have to stay that way. There is a way out, you just have take the responsibility for finding it for yourself. I love the historical references in the movie, and the hard look it takes at how we are sometimes our own worst enemies, based on a silly concepts like skin tone. Beautiful, powerful film.
