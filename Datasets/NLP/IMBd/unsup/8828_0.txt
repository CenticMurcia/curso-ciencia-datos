I watched this show hoping that it would be fun, edgy, and smart. If you consider poor acting, shrillness, and a "been there, done that" feel any of those things. Well, good for you! I have seen better chemistry and friendship is a Vagisil commerical. Brooke looks like she wants uncomfortable with everyone but the cat. Kim looks like she trying to go her best Cynthia Nixon impression and is failing miserable. Lindsay Price seems like she screaming, " Why couldn't I be on Cashmere Mafia?" The worst part is the humor! There is none! If I wanted to see a bunch of hags complain about there existence, I would turn on Lifetime. This show is so melodramatic! The viewers aren't stupid, we understand it's not easy to have it all. But, do you have to be so upset all the time. I would love to see these harpies have to work in a field picking berries for three dollars an hour. Then they would have something to cry about! Save yourself the time. Either rent some Sex and the City or watch Cashmere Mafia!
