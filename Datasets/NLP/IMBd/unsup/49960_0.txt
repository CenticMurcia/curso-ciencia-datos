I was really looking forward to this show. There have been several people in my community that made the show. But after sitting down and watching it, I don't know if I can actually sit through another episode in order to see them. This show was more like the Gong Show from the 70's. Except you have to have 3 gongs instead of one. I was really hoping that people could get a big break with this show. There was too much of really bad talent or useless talent to have to sit through to get to the very sporadic good talent that was shown. This is not a show that I will sit through again. There are too many other quality shows that are worth my time. I'm not a big reader, but about 3/4 way through the show, I decided to start reading a book. I feel sorry for the people who got chosen to be on this show that have great talent, I hope they are not disappointed.
