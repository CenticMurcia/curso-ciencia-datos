This series truly is awful. The scripts are tedious and repetitive. After hearing the phrase "the child-like princess" over and over and over again you feel a desperate need to start throwing things at the TV. You would applaud this level of performance in a school play but in anything else it's pretty unacceptable. The special effects are not too hot either, but if the scripts were better, the plots less predictable, the acting less bad and direction less clunky you would forgive any shortcomings in the level of production. It's sad to see all this effort wasted. And it's very sad to see a production cashing in on the "Neverending Story" name to scam a few bucks off a duped audience. With any luck I might get my money back by selling this pack of dogs on eBay.
