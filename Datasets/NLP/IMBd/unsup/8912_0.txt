I think this documentary is very good at showing how destructive the porn industry really can be, Annabel chong is show at times as intelligent as well as naive but the barons of the industry have no condolences to give to any of the young women like chong who lives they destroy whilst making huge sums of money. All I can say is, i'd like five minutes alone in a sound proof room with some of the men who manipulate and ruin the lives of obviously, innocent and vulnerable girls like Annabel. A good documentary, not award winningly shot but the message is clear to see from the makers 'Don't get scorn by porn' Not for the faint hearted, I saw this when it came out and every time i see it i still feel really bad for her and that i should do something about it, mainly to those directly responsible for corrupting her.
