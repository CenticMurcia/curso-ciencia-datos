After hearing for more then 2 hours of Quran suras, because one of my neighbors had to play it very loud, i looked forward to this BUCK movie. No wonder this religion produces terrorists, because hearing this voice screaming suras is the living hell. Having survived this torture i was so excited when the movie begun. BUCK known for many nice movies before, that all are very nice and comical, was more than a promise. I expected everything, but not such a disaster!! I couldn't stand more than 30 minutes. The storyline is unbelievable. There was no situation in this movie and no minute that i could take as realistic. No joke worked. The good actors act horrible..... I could give it 1 point, because as a BUCK fan i am disappointed, but i don't have to. It is simply gruesome, and i haven't seen anything so bad as this 30 minutes of this movie for a long time. The fact that so many celebrities worked in this thing, makes it incomprehensible. See for yourself, when you don't believe! But beware!!! Mixing it with Quran suras is dangerous....One more bad experience tonight and i am ready to kill.......... :-)
