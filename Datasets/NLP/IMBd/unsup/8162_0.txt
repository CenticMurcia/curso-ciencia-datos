it was a film that was absolutely perfect with not a mistake in sight!Oh so scary and frightening and hilarious rolled into one!But that goes for the experience at the movies1On DVD it lost that sense of scariness as the film is not knowing who is doing what and not knowing really what is going on.in the movies,you sit in darkness for 2 hours with up to 200 strangers.this added a sense of scariness to the film.that sense was lost on DVD.it still has the odd scare on DVDand is still hilarious but through out the film i felt a sense of loss.but i would still watch it over and over for entertainment value purely but to do with scare i don't think so.it might be different for people who ONLY saw it on DVD but for those in the UK and Ireland where it is still on release,see it in the cinema first.still highly recommended outside of movies though
