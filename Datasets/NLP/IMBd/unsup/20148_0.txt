I saw this as a special showing in Memphis, TN. I know the owner of the publishing company and therefore have read this book many times and have recommended it to countless people. This movie was exceptional.<br /><br />Abigail Breslin was just as charming and entertaining as "Little Miss Sunshine" and Drew Fuller did an an amazing job making you believe he truly went through this inspiring story. I left the theatre choked up and feeling warm and relishing in the emotions the movie took me through.<br /><br />I plan on taking everyone I know to see this when it comes out in March.
