Wow, this was really terrible.<br /><br />I don't care if they say it was based on a true story, this honestly, and I'm serious, honestly, was the worst movie I have ever seen. The actors were OK, but the story line was just plain stupid. It's about a stripper/escort who honestly looks 10 years older than the main character and his obsession with her, amongst the other 2 or 3 nutballs involved in her life. She out weighs him by at least 20 pounds and he thinks he can go busting into homes/apts in New York like he's freakin spiderman or something. At least in the end he gets a grip...oh my I seriously would never recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time.
