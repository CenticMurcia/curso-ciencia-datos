I Bought this because of the absolute love for the genres themselves and the way in which they were marketed. My wife can't believe I bought a DVD of just trailers.<br /><br />What you get is about two hours of a cross section of the blood horror, sexploitation, blacksploitation, mondo, roadshow, and Euro sleaze trailers that used to run before and between grindhouse double features in the 70's. It may be little boring to most to own(I personally loved it the first time around, but only re-watch it when I show it to others)but it is definitely worth watching at least once.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the genre, I recommend checking out this, it's volume 2, anything with a Something Weird Video imprint, and the book Sleazoid Express by Bill Landis and Michelle Clifford.
