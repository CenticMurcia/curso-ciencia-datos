This is a very bleak film...if you're looking to unwind from work, this is exactly the wrong movie to watch. The characters are dull, the plot is dull, the temps are so helpless and constantly humiliated that it becomes painful to watch. Toni Collette's narration is annoying, precisely because it is obvious this is her coming of age story. Her big revelation at the end of the film is to dupe a superior into signing a recommendation letter as a favor to a friend. That's her big breakthrough after an hour and a half of being very mousey and shy. The four temps who look so playful and happy on the box cover are miserable in the movie, partly because they're temps and partly because they don't possess the ambition or skills to be much more than that. I was expecting a comedy, at least a black comedy, but this was a very bleak story of hopelessness and despair with the friendships evaporating due to mistrust of one another.
