I didn't have high expectations to begin with, but this movie was simply below all standards.. Call me old fashioned if you will, but I think part of the beauty in animated children's films is the innocence they portray, and in Thumbelina the constant battle for the girl was not after her heart, rather after her body! Huh, could you believe that!? The prince can't get his hands off her from 20 seconds into their first meeting, the dress which is supposed to be at her ankles shows as high as her panties, all the other male character are constantly smooching her and touching her against her will, while they discuss which of them will get to keep her to satisfy his needs. Not to mention the promiscuous toad-mom who flaunts her boobs and legs! Gosh, I never thought I'd be so appalled by a ****ing cartoon! Originally, I got this film to show it to my 5 year old niece, but who in their right minds would let toddlers see this camouflaged soft-porn with the pretense of being intended for children? My vote is to stay away.
