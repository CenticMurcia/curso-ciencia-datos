This is one of the worst movies I have *ever* seen.<br /><br />Saw this years ago in the days when I would watch any film or TV science fiction flick, no matter how smelly.<br /><br />Boy, did this smell something Rotten!! - WARNING - SPOILER!<br /><br />The entire thing involved 2x humans and 1x robot running around after a dizzy blonde, each trying to get her into the sack. (including the robot!) The cast was poor, the story sucked and the so-called special effects were vapid.<br /><br />Some scenes, set up to supposedly shock the audience, were a complete fizzer. We have an opening scene lifted directly out of Star Wars, and interiors reminiscent of Alien. Hardware could have been borrowed from the set of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.<br /><br />The robot looked stupid with its rediculous video camera head and spindly vidcam tripod neck. You can almost identify which bits of a television set was cannibalized to put the costume together. It's fairly obvious there's a man inside one of the dumbest monster costumes to come out of the early 80's! I expect to see something like this in reruns of Dr Who, but not a major movie (which went straight to video).<br /><br />The ending was stoopid to the first degree.....<br /><br />CONCLUSION? Watch only if you're completely wasted. Other than that, don't say I didn't warn you!
