I like it. It's not the best, it could certainly use some work, especially with the special effects - It's not all that easy to make a low-budget action-comedy series these days, that's enjoyable or at least doesn't make you want to kill yourself. But the Devil is what will take the series to a successful and better second season. Don't get me wrong - the show is great. Main character, Sam Oliver, The Devil and Sock are portrayed brilliantly, and the other actors seem to match with their characters. Story starts of well, get's a bit slow for a couple of episodes, then it picks up again, gives us some unexpected twists, and just for the story(it got interesting) and the Devil(do I even need to explain why I like him?) I will watch the second season. And if the effects get better, Reaper might just hit my personal top 5 ranking...
