This is an absolute gem of a series. Everything is spot-on with the acting, sets, stories. If you watch one comedy show this year then this is the one. I remember watching really bad horror series and films in the 80's and this recreates it perfectly.<br /><br />The characters are perfect, Dr Lucien Sanchez has got to be the best character on the small comedy screen for a while.<br /><br />Get the DVD as it's got all 6 episodes plus some really sketchy and random extra scenes.<br /><br />All I can say is get this now if you like your comedy a little weirder than normal. You won't regret it traveller.
