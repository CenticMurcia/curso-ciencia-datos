Saw this with the wife. Interestingly, she was grossed out, but enjoyed it. ****Possible spoilers ahead***<br /><br />Think of this as "Creepshow", but more disturbing on a mental level. "Dumplings"--the HK extreme-- will definitely gross out the average viewer, but can be seen as an allegory to the trends of beauty today. "Cut"--the Korean extreme--brings some of Park Chanwook's themes of the "Vengeance" trilogy into a 40 minute segment. Very nerve-racking. "Box"--the Japanese experience--pretty standard Miike a la Gozu. But extremely entertaining.<br /><br />While nowhere as disturbing as "Audition", these three would pack a wallop in any American theatre. Savor it...
