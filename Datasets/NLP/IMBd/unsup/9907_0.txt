First there was Michael Myers. Then came Jason. Followed by Freddy Krueger.<br /><br />And now we meet Leo Rook, a psychotic killer who likes white shoes and to collect heads. On his way to prison he escapes from a boat which later crushes into a rock and sinks. A few survivors swim ashore on an island with a Lighthouse, unknowing that someone is already waiting for them.<br /><br />Though an unknown cast and director, this is a very scary and most of all good movie.<br /><br />
