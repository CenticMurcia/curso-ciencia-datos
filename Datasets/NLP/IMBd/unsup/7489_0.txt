The title characters in this film are writer Henry Miller and his wife June. Two friends of Anais Nin. And more. The fact is she is frankly obsessed with both of them. A writer of erotica, she wants to experience sensuality in bold and daring ways. She gets the chance when her husband Hugo brings Henry to stay with them while he works on his novel. After June arrives Anais finds herself secretly thrilled at the hidden lascivious feelings the couple seem to bring out in her. Before long she is acting them out in abandon. This takes place in 1930s Paris and scenes of sex are are everywhere. They are as casually shown as if walking through different rooms. There is a richness and matter-of- fact manner about this film. Even though it is NC-17 I don't see it as "dirty" just boldly erotic. There are terrific performances by all involved. Actress Maria de Medeiros looks like a beautiful wide-eyed waif and is emotionally perfect as Anais. Fred Ward gives an unforgettable portrait of gruff and down to earth Henry Miller. Uma Thurman in an early role as June is beautiful and tragic.
