GUESS WHO, in my opinion, is a good comedy that will make you laugh, smile, and feel good from start to finish. If you ask me, it was absolutely romantic that Simon (Ashton Kutcher) and Theresa (Zoë Saldaña) were engaged. Also, to me, Percy (Bernie Mac) was an absolute a******! The reason I said that is because she couldn't handle Kevin being engaged to Charlie. However, when Charlie slapped her, I was amazed. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good to anyone who's seen GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, although I haven't seen that one. You're in for lots of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.
