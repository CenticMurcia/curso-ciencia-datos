Vitus is the story of the "wunderkind" Vitus, a very talented boy who defends himself against the pressure of his parents to become a famous piano player. The movie is very moving and highly entertaining. Bruno Ganz finally manages to let you forget his turn as Hitler in his role here as the understanding grandfather of Vitus. The weakness of the movie are some of the child actors, who can not convince all the time. Theo Gheorghiu is excellent, though, and it is fun to support his character Vitus, once you have found out that he is fooling everyone. You will see things in this movie that you might have dreamed about as a child - such as showing the grown ups that you are smarter than they are and flying an airplane.
