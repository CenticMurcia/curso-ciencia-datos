I'm not a fan of rom-coms but the idea of a Lothario who meets his match in a Dickensian scenario sounded intriguing. Sadly, that was a mistake.<br /><br />It took all of ten minutes to reach the point where viewing further would seem like a waste of one's life. The Connor Mead character is unbelievably trite and unlovable and the fact that pretty girls want to swoon all over him is an insult to women everywhere.<br /><br />Far from being amusing or in the slightest way realistic, we have a film based on a totally self-centred character buoyed-up by brain dead bimbos. I appreciate that Americans have a different take on romance, relationships and humour to us Brits but, really, no-one can honestly say this isn't a car crash of a film.<br /><br />It makes the 1960s and 1970s British 'Carry On' films, full of seaside postcard humour and wonderfully non-PC views on everything, seem like models of sophistication.<br /><br />Avoid!
