I have mixed feelings for this movie. I truly liked the original "Goal" mainly because I'm a huge soccer fan. Not that the sequel is a bad movie but in my opinion, it lacked of reality moments. Let me explain myself...<br /><br />Sure, the movie is very well done because it has good acting, an interesting romantic plot, and tries to display the ups and downs of being a famous soccer player. The transfer negotiations and trainings were also a nice addition to help understand how it works. Also, it was great to see Real Madrid's starts in small cameos. So, "Goal 2" succeeds because it's a blockbuster movie and probably a favorite among young audiences. The events of the movie are truly over the top but it works. I really hope that Santiago's half brother plot will be important in the next "Goal"! <br /><br />On the other side, I expected more interaction with Real player's. Also I expected more seriousness on the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE sub-plot. I mean, it's the most important soccer event in the world after the FIFA WORLD CUP. The director and producer made it look like just another tournament. But on the bright side, I liked that some real matches were displayed with the occasional CGI help. Also, it isn't that easy to score in these kind of games! But oh well, I understand it's only a movie :)and a good one.<br /><br />Watching Zidane (the last soccer genius) and Ronald wearing the Real Madrid outfit was great and powerful. <br /><br />The direction and visuals are spectacular. The soccer matches looked great with the aid of CGI and brilliant cinematography. I expected more soccer related scenes though. Kuno Becker delivers a good performance again. I'm glad for him. Alessandro Nivola steals the show as Gavin Harris, overrated soccer superstar. Anna Friel looked mature but sexy as hell and delivered a good performance (love her accent). Stephen Dillane also delivers a fine performance as Santiago's former assistant. Rutger Hauer also delivers a good performance; he's always the man.<br /><br />So give it a chance for "Goal 2" if you are a huge soccer fan. Otherwise, you might enjoy it for it's dramatic plot and romantic situations.<br /><br />Hopefully, in "Goal 3" we will get to see Santiago leading MÃ¨xico to win the FIFA WORLD CUP. That could only happen in a movie :(
