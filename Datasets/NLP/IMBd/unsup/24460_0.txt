Dhamaal is an entertaining movie. However, one can't shake off the fact that the movies LIFTS scenes and story lines from AROUND 5-6 Hollywood MOVIES, right from the first scene.<br /><br />First scene is a rip-off of Johnny English, the third scene is copied from one of Mr.Bean's episodes. The whole damn storyline is EXACTLY IDENTICAL to 'Its a Mad Mad World' and 'Rat Race'. Later one, the movie lifts the bridge scene from 'Road Trip', the tiger roar scene is from a movie called Without A Paddle, and the whole soap gun scene is from 'Small Time Crooks'. On many occasions, it is also inspired by Starsky and Hutch.<br /><br />UPDATE - Just watched 'Dude, Wheres my car?' and the pizza scene is copied directly from there.<br /><br />However, the second half is where we see some originality, and ironically, the most original scenes are the most entertaining. The movie goes for a clich√©d ending, however, which is a downer.<br /><br />THE GOOD <br /><br />- Great performances from the cast, especially Arshad Warsi, Ritesh, and Jaffrey. <br /><br />- Some very entertaining original parts, especially in the second half.<br /><br />THE BAD <br /><br />- You won't have much fun if you have watched the above-mentioned movies. <br /><br />- Some jokes, like the airplane one and the cliffhanging one, are stretched to a point where they are not funny anymore. <br /><br />- Not so great music. <br /><br />- Disappointing ending.<br /><br />Overall, Dhamaal is a decent entertainer, but stumbles badly on originality, as the copied jokes have been done much better in the original movies.
