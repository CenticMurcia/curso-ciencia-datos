I haven't even seen it, and it's bad. I have read the comments and the summary though. For those people who believe that I can't comment on this because I haven't seen it or that it is actually a good movie, or that I've been brainwashed by action movies, think about the author who originally wrote the story. From what I have read from comments and summaries, and from the novel From the Earth to the Moon, it has terrible graphics, a bad story-line, bad acting, and poor special effects. I wanted to cry when I read the summary, as it had absolutely nothing to do with the book. I wonder if the producer had even read a summary of the book. They should be ashamed to say they based the movie off of his book, and ashamed to even name the movie after it. For those of you who liked the movie, or those that didn't read the book, read it, as it is a lot better way to spend your time.
