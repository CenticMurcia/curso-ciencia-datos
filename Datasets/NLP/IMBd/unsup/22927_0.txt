I bought the DVD of Queen on fire a few weeks ago, i may need to buy more copies, as i have just about worn this one out. It is THE best concert i have every seen, helps that i think Freddie Murcury is very hot! Its very entertaining and keeps you stuck to your chair, even after watching it about 50 times, i cant get enough Freddie. Such a shame that such an attractive,talented,smart man like Freddie isn't around today. But his music lives on, i don't think a day goes by that you don't hear a Queen song on the radio or TV. I think this DVD is priceless, knowing that Freddie didn't give may interview, i feel lucky to have a copy of it. Freddie still lives in my heart!
