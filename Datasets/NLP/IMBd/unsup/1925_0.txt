I gave this movie a 2 rating and that is only because of the abortion that followed it deserves a lower mark. The shark looked fake, the actors looked embalmed...even Sea World looked stupid. I remember when this movie came out and my parents took me to Sea World because they had all the props out used in the movie...I was embarrassed to even be in a picture with that stupid looking shark. I saw it in the theater with my sister when it came out and the only thing that was worth the money was the 3-D effects...this crap was on TV and I feel the need to vent because it's 2 hours of my life that are gone forever. I'm waiting for Crow and the MST 3000 gang to light into this...
