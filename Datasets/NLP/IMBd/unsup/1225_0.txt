******SPOILERS****** Solid "Film Noir" about murder guilt and justice and how events can't be changed even if the one who's effected is told about them in advance. <br /><br />The movie "Inner Sanctum" begins and ends on a train that pulls in one night in the little town of Clayburn. Harold Dunlap tries to get away from his overbearing and demanding fianc√© Marie who sees him trying to leave her and runs out of the train and has a confrontation with him. <br /><br />Pulling a nail file from her purse Marie tries to stab Harold who in turn takes it away and kills her with it. With the train about to pull out of the station Harold picks up Marie's body and dumps it on the train and with no one around thinks that he's gotten away with what he did, Harold thought wrong. <br /><br />Looking to get lost Harold tries to hitch a ride out of town and lose himself in the darkness of the night. Like he thinks that his connection to the murder will get lost along with him. Fate and destiny, like a magnet, has other ideas about what's in store for Harold and pulls him back to face justice for what he did. <br /><br />Tense creepy and well written and acted movie that shows what Harold should have known right from the start: crime doesn't pay and the only one who does pay is the one who commits it. <br /><br />Tightly edited and suspenseful film that doesn't try to fool the audience about who's guilty of the crime, you see Harold kill Marie at the start of the movie, but does have a twist to it that's as good as any whodunit. <br /><br />The movies somewhat uneventful beginning with a sharp turn on the rail and a man who can tell what time it is without a watch with the mysterious Dr. Valonius seems a bit slow but it ties all the loose ends together at the end of the film. "Inner Santcum" is a movie, that by the time that it's over, you know will never end.
