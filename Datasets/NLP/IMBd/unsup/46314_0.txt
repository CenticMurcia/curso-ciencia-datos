This review is just about 1 episode in general. I saw some eps of earth 2 a long time ago (i don't recall them as being anywhere above a 5 star rating), but when i saw this episode today i felt animated to write a review. The first 30 minutes weren't really interesting, just some:"oh there's a time rift, black-hole whatever thing in this cave". The fun actually started when they "got a theory" about how this time-rift whatever works. There were spiders at each side of the rift and after a spider bit one of the actors and he suddenly started to be in love with one of the other actors they got to set up a theory. Some time ago in this ep a spider bit one of those Grendel's(at least they are called so in the German translation) and it got angry as hell. So... 2 different types of spiders. One makes you feel positive and the other negative. Think logical and you might think of a positive and a negative magnetic pole. a positive on the one side of the rift and the negative on the other side of the rift. Sure... 2 magnetic spider webs equals 2 poles = magic rift of instant teleportation. When the rift broke down they came to the conclusion that they might have brought a spider from one side to the other and by removing the "wrong" spider by placing it in a plastic tube, TAdaaaah the magic rift appears again.<br /><br />Someone talked about brain in this series.... i think this is the hardest anti-brain ep i ever saw in sci-fi for a long time..(OK except for Andromeda maybe).<br /><br />My final words: go watch battle-star galactica or the "new" enterprise for some serious sci-fi. earth 2 has some serious problems explaining things(and sci-fi is mostly about stuff you can somehow explain... as its called SCIENCE-fiction) and the story wont keep you longing for the next ep. This last paragraph is my personal thought only so pls don't flame me about that.<br /><br />Best regards Dobs
