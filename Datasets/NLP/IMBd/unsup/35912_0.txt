Oh my! What a wonderfully awful film this turned out to be. It even had Troy..er I mean Marc McClure in it. "You may remember him from..." No! No. I'll stop now.<br /><br />Anyway, Epoch is a film with a simple enough plot. Think 2001 A Space Odyssey, but without any space bits. Basically, an alien artifact appears in Bhutan and a team is sent to investigate. A team which includes the likes of David Keith, Craig Wasson and Ryan O'Neal. Poor old Ryan was looking a little the worse for wear in this one. It's been a long time since Love Story, for sure.<br /><br />Anyway, the action is pretty lame and I got a good laugh out of the scissor-lift HQ truck (watch and you'll see what I mean). The plot is pretty hokey and has more holes than a swiss cheese. I'd like to give you a spoiler alert, but honestly, I'm not ruining anything by telling you this. The artifact was put here by aliens eons ago. Every now and again, it pops up and, if whatever civilisation is not advanced enough to deactivate it, it wipes that civilisation out completely and disappears for another few millions of years. I can't honestly recall if they said so or not in the film, but the implication was that it wiped out the dinosaurs.<br /><br />Now, call me picky, but I have trouble understanding just why an alien race would create such a device. Given the timescales involved in life forming and evolving to a civilised state, what do they get out of it? And since the device could wipe out a civilisation just a few years before it was able to deactivate the artifact, surely that would be counter-productive (to whatever motive the aliens had in the first place). Far better to create the device to wipe out any advanced species before it became a threat to the creators. Yet this is clearly not the aim of the artifact.<br /><br />And what wonderful test of civilisation do our humble human heroes perform to deactivate the device? Perhaps solving some complex alien language and pressing the "off" button? Or simply providing the missing part to some quantum mechanics equation? No, all our heroes do in the end is nuke the artifact. A triumph of brute force over ingenuity. No thought required, just fry it.<br /><br />The only small ray of sunshine in this otherwise overcast film was Brian Thompson. He regularly plays bit parts in films and TV and usually ends up the villain or goon. Here he plays a Special Forces Captain. But despite his square jawed glaring, even his dialogue and part are dismal and forgettable.<br /><br />SUMMARY: One to miss.
