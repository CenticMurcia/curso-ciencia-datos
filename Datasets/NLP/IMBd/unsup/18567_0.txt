reading some of the reviews this movie received upset me. a great deal.<br /><br />a lot of work went into this film and it DOES have a very very good plot<br /><br />the acting is above average and the effects are amazing i think the creatures were very well presented too. the only flaw was indeed the sound, but ive seen a lot worse<br /><br />i indeed watched this movie twice in the same day after buying it, it was very enthralling. i think they should expand on the mythology of these beasts, perhaps in a sequel/prequel?<br /><br />this movie is now one of my favourites, up there with the Hellraiser series, Mothman Prophecies, Wishmaster, Carrie, Event Horizon and Jurassic Park<br /><br />again, it is such a hell of a shame that people are ready to spit on this film, when it does deserve a helluva chance<br /><br />it is just aces<br /><br />
