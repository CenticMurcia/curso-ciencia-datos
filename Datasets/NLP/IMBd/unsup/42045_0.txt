Although I gave this movie a 1 because the director put in the horror Genre I couldn't help but laugh at the awful acting the saddest most hilarious part about this movie is that the best actors were the crazy Hillbillies that beat the hell out of Harding speaking harding the other characters had some sort of hatred for this man because if you pay attention the three phrases you hear most in the movie are "Harding your an a**hole" "Hey Harding F*ck you" "Harding acts like a 5 year old" The movie also has randomly disappearing characters,Name Changes,obvious picture cropping,misleading plot,awful sounds,windows that break but actually are just copy and pasted triangles flying through the air well anyway if you watch this you will be sure to laugh its a riot trust me!
