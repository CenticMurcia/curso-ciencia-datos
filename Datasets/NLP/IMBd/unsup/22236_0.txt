Anyone who wonders how Scorcese and Keitel got their start needs to watch this wonderful odd little film. All the classic Scorcese themes are there- whores and tough guys, double edged morality and brutality between men and women. Keitel is just stunning in his first film, clearly this is the work of a great talent. I'm surprised more people haven't seen this film, they always start with Mean Streets, which is obviously a much better film but this is the one that started it all. Well worth your time.
