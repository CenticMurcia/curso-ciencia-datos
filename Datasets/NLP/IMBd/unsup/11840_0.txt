Malcolm Shanks (as played by Marcel Marceau) is a deaf-mute puppeteer, who scrapes by on odd jobs and lives with his money-grubbing sister and her drunken husband. When Malcom gets a job with a local mad scientist, he finds the doctor is experimenting with reanimating the dead (so far, only frogs) and when the doctor dies, Malcolm tries his hand at reanimating the good doctor, with interesting results. Now, Malcolm's sister and brother-in-law also bite the dust, and so Malcolm is given the opportunity to re-animate them as well, with very interesting results, and fairly humorous, too. Malcolm's one true friend is a teenage girl who he then proceeds to have a party for at the deceased doctor's home, and unfortunately things go awry when a crazed motorcycle gang crashes the party. This is most likely the oddest film Willam Castle ever did, and certainly unlike his 60's efforts, at least, those I've seen. The mix of horrific and whimsical in this, unfortunately, doesn't always work & it could have used a bit of a darker touch, but apparently Castle was somewhat of a big softie. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, this is not commercially available anywhere, so you'll have to poke around for it if you're interested. 7 out of 10.
