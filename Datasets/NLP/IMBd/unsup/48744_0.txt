I'm a big fan of Garry Shandling, both his old TV show and the more recent "Larry Sanders Show". Granted, the information on this movie was not promising, but with Shandling writing and acting, I thought it would have to be at least somewhat funny. Well, wrong-o! The laughs and clever moments in this movie could have been condensed into a 3-minute sketch.
