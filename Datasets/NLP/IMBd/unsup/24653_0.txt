all i gotta say for this movie is that it blows, pointless story line,crappy cast, no laughs, waste of my time and the TV stations, the best part of this movie was the mud wrestling all though it lasted some 5 seconds i love meghan in this movie and i think she was the only bright spot but ya this movie blows i give it a third of a star(only cuz they mud wrestled) out of 5, plz don't watch this movie even if it is the only thing on TV i personally would go to sleep but eh its the best option considering this movie will put u to sleep wut a waste to the national lampoon series damn id rather watch van wilder again at least it had some laughs, o well this is wut the movie world has come to
