This is the concluding trilogy of the original "The Blair Witch Project". Quite frankly, both "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Curse of the Blair Witch Project" are better.<br /><br />"Sticks and Stones: Investigating the Blair Witch" seems/seemed to just be another way to cash in on the The Blair Witch Phenomenon, a phenomenon that is being totally milked dry.<br /><br />I guess the film is ok, if you absolutely loved the first one, but this continuing trend of finding lost footage and of more interviews is/was getting annoying. There essentially is nothing new here and the performances and writing are nothing special. It is a short film that will be easily forgotten and I doubt it will be redistributed when the next line of Blair Witch 2 products come out.<br /><br />As a side story, and possibly showing how doomed "Sticks and Stones: Investigating the Blair Witch" was, Blockbuster originally gave this as a free rental to "The Blair With Project". Then it was a PVT and there were so many of them that eventually the local store was selling them for 1cent with any purchase. I thought 1cent, what the heck? My recommendation to you though is to save your penny.<br /><br />VOTES: The Blair Witch Project-->3: Curse of the Blair Witch Project-->6: Sticks and Stones: Investigating the Blair Witch-->2<br /><br />Viewed: The Blair Witch Project--> Theatre: Curse of the Blair Witch Project--> VHS: Sticks and Stones: Investigating the Blair Witch--> VHS
