Before I completely tear apart this abortion, let me come out and say that this game should not be praised at all. Whoever applauds Square for this game isn't experienced in (a) the world of writing or (b)the field of video games. Now, I've been playing RPGs for quite some time, and I know a tasteless game when I see one.<br /><br />Graphics: Much like that of FFVII's style, Final Fantasy VII's graphics are 3-dimensional. However, there are still so many flawed aspects. For example, the characters are deprived of facial expressions. (2/10) Sound: The musical collection of Final Fantasy VIII veers away from the norm. Although the theme of this installment was a nice touch, the rest of the soundtrack was bitterly mediocre in comparison to that of its predecessors. (4/10) Plot: Do I really need to explain how dull this game is? I suppose so, then. -sigh- Well, after the first disk, you're left with a cheap plot. In reference to the events, I'll put them in order from 1 to 5.<br /><br />1 - The supposed genius--Squall--becomes a SeeD along with his moronic friends.<br /><br />2 - Squall meets his apparent girlfriend, Rinoa, and drifts away from the interverte-lifestyle little by little.<br /><br />3 - After totally pwning the insipid blob (Edea) and her lackey (Seifer) Squall realizes that his job applies to murdering the sorceresses of this wretched fantasy.<br /><br />4 - After beating Edea's butt again, Ultimecia controls Rinoa's fail!Mary-Suish body.<br /><br />5 - Squall and friends gain control of their Sue and beat Ultimecia's butt. Yeah, I said butt again. =OOOO That's about it. The developers decided on tying in some other events . . . but that idea kinda died. R.I.P. Good idea? (1/10) Playability: Remember the Junction system? Do you ever recall the amount of time that you spent spamming your character's stats with efficient spells, such as Ultima or Aero. But to punish these actions, you must first equip your faithful GF to any of the characters. How long does this process take again? Fifteen to twenty minutes at least.<br /><br />In fact, the Junction system is so time-consuming that you resort to actually turning off this game after this process is completed. The gameplay isn't stimulating, as well.<br /><br />Value: Relatively low.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 1/10 I hope that this review will fix the crappy rating that this game scored. :D
