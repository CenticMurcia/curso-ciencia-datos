a real story, a real account, a real movie.....one of the best of all time!! if anyone had any questions on whether clint eastwood could do it again, they've been answered. The flag that stands on Japan's Iwo Jima remains as one of the nation's most prevalent symbols of freedom, justice, victory, and, most of all, freedom. i have never been so moved to see such a movie then Flags of Our Fathers, and i know that this movie will awake the eerie memories of WWII vets from the war in the Pacfic some 65 years ago. If this movie does not win at least 3 Academy Awards, then we as a nation have lost a patriotic feel towards our history. We will never forget, and we will always be thankful.
