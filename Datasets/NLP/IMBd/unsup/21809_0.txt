Do not be fooled by all of the naysayers out there.....this is one hell of a movie....especially if you are a fan of Michael Hutchence(inxs).<br /><br />I own this movie on VHS and have been waiting a long time for a much deserved DVD release..the acting is superb and you really feel as though you are spending time with old friends every time you watch this masterpiece. Definitely one of the best Australian movies ever made.<br /><br />This movie has it all, sex, drugs, rock n' roll, and laughs upon laughs upon laughs. I cannot emphasize enough that everyone who loves comedy/drama involving young hip 20 something outcasts should run out and rent/buy this film.Trust me. 10/10 *****
