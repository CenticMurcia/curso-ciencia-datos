I'm at a total loss when I read the other reviews about this movie. I'm seriously wondering if we all watched the same movie.<br /><br />Now, what in particular was the points which dragged the movie down?<br /><br />1) The tempo was god-awful slow. <br /><br />2) The plot was as original as the 174:th western flick in late 1979. <br /><br />3) The acting was horrible with the exception of Ben Cross which was the only real actor in this debacle. <br /><br />4) Dolph had as many (and well thought out) lines in this flick as he did as Drago in Rocky IV. <br /><br />5) The budget was almost non-existent which means that this film did not even have the normal cushion to fall back on like it's fellow titles in the trash bin, a $50 million effects and props budget. <br /><br />In short, the director of this movie seem to have aspired to reach the grandeur of an Uwe Boll production. Really says it all, doesn't it?
