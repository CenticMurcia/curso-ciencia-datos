What an odd movie. I have to say that this is in a category in its own. Besides the annoying homosexual theme that this movie had, it was very boring to watch. What's even worse is that this was a View Askew production, I've yet to see a bad one (until today). The story had no head or tail; it just went in a zigzag line. I'm not planning on summarizing this movie, but I just want to say that whoever is thinking of buying this should consider renting it first, it was a disappointment On a bright note, the acting was very well done
