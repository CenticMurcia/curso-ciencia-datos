Awful Terminator/Blade Runner rip-off. In fact, with a little bit of irony, the flick is highly enjoyable : the wooden acting, the hole-crippled screenplay and, yes, some nice and totally gratuitous boob shots.<br /><br />In a post-apocalyptic future,a man and a woman struggle for survival against a not-so-efficient cyborg with an obvious hip malfunction and some nice mutants.<br /><br />A nice trend to watch : the hero never thinks of a good weapon to fight the cyborg (makes you wait for the teapot or the shoelace), however, the villain can strike from good distance using a hub cap like a deadly Frisbee. Alas, I'm not making this up.<br /><br />Once again, a moronic and boring movie, but could become with some wicked humor a moronic and funny movie.
