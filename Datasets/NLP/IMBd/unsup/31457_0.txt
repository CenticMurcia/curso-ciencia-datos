Continuation of the events in the original "Evil Dead" movie. After recapping the events of the first movie (telling the story somewhat differently, even eliminating three of the characters), this movie has poor, tormented Ash (Bruce Campbell) constantly being harassed and tortured by sadistic demons - including, in the movie's most memorable sequence, his own possessed hand.<br /><br />Absolutely hilarious; this effective mix of hardcore horror and slapstick comedy provides a lot of laughs, impressive effects, and the very game Campbell putting up with a lot as the film-makers set out to abuse his character as much as possible. "Evil Dead 2" manages to be even more entertaining than the first movie, a goofy and fun horror/comedy with a chaotic finale that I would recommend to any fan of this genre.<br /><br />What is also funny is that the character of Ash is already showing signs of the super-obnoxious moron he would become in "Army of Darkness".<br /><br />I loved "Evil Dead 2".<br /><br />9/10
