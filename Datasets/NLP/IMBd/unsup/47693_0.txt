I am truly disappointed... I saw the cast, and I was really expecting something out of this movie. I try to give Romanian cinema the benefit of a doubt, but this film is more than a sane person can stand. <br /><br />Two particular comments (other than the ones of my colleagues): (1) I am a strong believer in the fact that if you want to see disgusting scenes with no apparent role in the plot, you should try a third-rate horror movie, the kind with zombies and crap. In no circumstances such scenes should appear in a supposedly respectable film about historic events and social issues. If the director wanted to induce psychological tension, there are other ways to do it, except extensively showing people die and being burnt alive! <br /><br />(2) Also, for someone who has lived in Timisoara all her life (the place where the action takes place), I can really tell that the accent of the actors is far off. You want a movie that takes place somewhere else than in Bucharest? Fine! But have the courtesy to make a survey of how people live, behave and talk around there! Otherwise, it is just NOT authentic. It really sounds fake! (Especially the "German girl"...)
