This has to be one of the most entertaining movies I have seen. The action never gets too violent, and the comedy is great!<br /><br />It's great that they choose Robert De Niro to play Jack Walsh, because he adds a great sadness to the character. Charles Grodin is PERFECT as The Duke, few other actors could have made an "annoying" character like Jonathan charming!<br /><br />The story is about a man (Grodin) who stole 15 million dollars from a Las Vegas gangster (Denis Farina), but then got caught by the police. He escaped from his bail bondsman and is now on the run. A bounty hunter (De Niro) is trying to catch him and bring him to LA. But he only has five days to do so...<br /><br />Of course, it is a roadmovie. Which means that along the road (from New York to Los Angeles) the two characters (who are hunted by F.B.I., the mafia and another bounty hunter) start to like each other. Or they just might in the next life...
