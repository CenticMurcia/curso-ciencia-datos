A boy (selfish with every girl on his feet) ruins his brother's wedding, while 3 ghosts try to turn him back in the good guy he used to be...the boy manages to solve things up and to take back the love of his life.End.<br /><br />I watched this movie thinking it would be a funny comedy...and a romantic one, of course. Well, it wasn't. Is has a few enjoyable moments but the rest of the movie is full of Hollywood clich√©s. It really could have been so much better, the plot was intriguing (or at least that's what I thought after watching the trailer), the idea of the ghosts of these girls finally giving a lesson to this full of himself guy seems to completely vanish after the first one. Disappointing. I love the cast, but each one of them taken apart. Could really be brothers Matthew Mcconaughey and Breckin Meyer?? And why do a girl like Jenny (Jennifer Gardner) would love an idiot like Connor Mead (Mcconaghey)???? I think the goal for a movie is to make people believe for 2 hours that what they're watching could be true, this movie fails this goal. Too bad. Could have been better. I wouldn't recommend "paying" for watching this.
