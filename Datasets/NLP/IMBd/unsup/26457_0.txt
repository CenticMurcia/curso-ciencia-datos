This propaganda is boring, predictable, and annoying.<br /><br />Richard Gere, with his loyal support of Tibetan Buddhism, hates China with a passion. However, his attack of the Chinese judiciary system ends up weak.<br /><br />The movie tries to ridicule the Chinese system one American hero (Gere) and a Chinese altruistic lawyer (Bai) in a bland film.<br /><br />True suspense fans will find this movie predictable and boring. People who are trying to understand the truth of the Chinese system will find this one very biased. Chinese audiences will find this movie insulting because all but one Chinese character are portrayed as barbaric, cruel, and malicious in this propaganda.<br /><br />This movie should be shoveled to a back storage of a 49 cents rental store. It is not worth anyone but Gere's time to watch this pathetic one.
