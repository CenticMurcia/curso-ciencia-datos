I was elated when I won two tickets to the closing night film at The Melbourne International Film Festival. Suburban Mayhem had been wrongly titled and I was at a loss to establish how such a film could get made. What would I be able to learn from an attractive girl who likes to suck and .uck and whose only redeeming feature is a cute baby. This film should of been titled "Suburban Misogyny". I think that in this day and age it is very sad that for whatever reason women are still being perceived in such light on screen. I found this film meaningless and lost. The characters in this film were unlikable and had little room for development. Even the father who you were supposed to like was shallow and out of depth. I went into this film wanting to like it but left feeling very very empty.
