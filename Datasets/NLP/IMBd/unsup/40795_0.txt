The location and photography were excellent but it ends there. Watson did not look like he had retired because of health after a long hitch in India. Holmes did not have aquiline features. But those are minor distractions. Why oh why do these makers always have to rewrite the story. No one yet has equalled the story as written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I really had hopes that Masterpiece Theatre would do it right. Not a chance! This version is a disappointing dud. I sort of thought I was in for disappointment when they completely left out the analysis of Dr Mortimer's cane. They could easily have left out the seance. Too bad! They could have had something good with the same effort.
