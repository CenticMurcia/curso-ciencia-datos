SPOILERS<br /><br />I have managed to catch a couple episodes of the British Whose Line Is It Anyway, and I must say, it was incredibly funny. As I mentioned before, I enjoy the American version a little more, but if you watch them side-by-side, you will realize that they are both two great shows that should still be on. You will also see that a lot of the people in the American version are in the British version, and I enjoy that a lot, but I also get to see a lot of the talented and funny British comedians, too, so that is also great.<br /><br />Here is the basis. It is practically the same. A group of comedians to improvisation games together. After all of the games, the host decides who the winner is. However, whoever wins still plays the last game with the other contestants.<br /><br />Overall, this is a terrific and very funny show that, from the episodes I have seen, was a wonderful show right until the very end. Anyway, this, like the American version, is hilarious and you would not want to miss it.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Recommended Shows: Whose Line Is It Anyway, Thank God You're Here.
