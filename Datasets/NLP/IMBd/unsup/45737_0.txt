People, don't ever bother buying, renting, or even watch this movie. I was extremely stupid to buy the DVD of this movie (believe it or not, because it cost only around US$ 3). Boy oh boy, I regret it soooo much! The moviemakers of this movie was trying to make the worst work in their lives or something. Nas' acting was horrid in this movie, luckily it only lasted for few minutes. The flaws of this movie are too much to talk about. I nominate this movie as the worst movie of 2001, maybe even for the whole history of filmmaking!
