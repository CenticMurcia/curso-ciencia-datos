The frame-story is the necessary evil of the movie. The only thing about the frame-story worth mentioning is that Eva Pawlik is also an excellent actress. The outstanding value of the film lies in the presentation of the ensemble of the Vienna Ice Revue with European Champion Eva Pawlik on top. Everyone interested in the history of figure skating has to have seen this document of art on the ice.
