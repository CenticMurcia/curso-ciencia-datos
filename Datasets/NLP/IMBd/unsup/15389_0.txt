"Columbo: Murder, a Self Portrait" was one of the Columbo movies that aired during the early 90's as a part a Saturday night rotation on ABC with "B.L. Stryker" with Burt Reynolds and Telly Savalas's revival of "Kojak". Most of the two-hour installments of "Columbo" tended to drag, in spots, but "A Self Portrait" moves at a brisk pace, benefiting from effective and inspired performances from guests Patrick Bauchau, Fionnula Flannagan, Shera Denese, George Coe, and Isabel Lorca. Falk's friend Vito Scotti makes one of his frequent appearances on the show, this time playing a bartender.<br /><br />Written by Robert Sherman and directed by James Frawley, the film also sports a great Patrick Williams' score.<br /><br />And even Columbo's pet "Dog" makes a brief, yet memorable, appearance.<br /><br />One of the major highlights are the different "interpretations" of the dreams of the principals. Fascinating lighting, setting, and camera-work make this a "Columbo" to remember.
