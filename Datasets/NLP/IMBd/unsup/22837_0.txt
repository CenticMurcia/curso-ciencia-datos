Once again, its got to be another horrible film creeping to the shelves of a video rental store near you. Why the heck ever bother checking out this garbage? It has everything you would expect from a crappy movie. Horrible acting, horrible special effects, brainless story line and all. If you have kids that prefer such forsaken garbage, be my guest. It can be easily compared to the horrible Carnosaur series. Looking for a good rating for this film? Look no further.<br /><br />3/10
