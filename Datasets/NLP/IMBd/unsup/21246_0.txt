Belligerent baseball team Gashouse Gorillas are truly a mean bunch. And they have no trouble making 96 points while the other team still has nothing. That is, until Bugs Bunny as the opposing team is playing every position. Then, it's really time to play ball! You'll never forget the final sequence.<br /><br />"Baseball Bugs" was one of the many classic Looney Tunes cartoons on which Mel Blanc and that whole crowd collaborated. Seeing how great this cartoon is (no to mention how great the other classic Looney Tunes cartoons were), I gotta wonder what it must have been like actually creating the cartoons. They must have really had fun!
