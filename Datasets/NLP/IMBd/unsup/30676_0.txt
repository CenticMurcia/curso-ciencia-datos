The movie was good enough on most of its parts. First of all, the acting was very good and the script was very good. The only problem I had with this movie is that it was a little bit boring. Most of the movie and dialogue was top of the notch excellent but it got a tad bit boring.<br /><br />Overall this movie was very cool and I thought that it depicted Wyatt Earp's life well and Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid are awesome. Rating 9 out of 10.
