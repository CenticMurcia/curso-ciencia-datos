I really liked the first two movies. They weren't great movies, but they fulfilled their purpose (and Hart Bochner was in Final Cut, good enough for me), but this movie...HORRIBLE.<br /><br />Where should I begin. Well, first off, it makes no sense. The motivation of the human killer near the end is revealed, and well, let's just say he's lived 30 years out in the open, not hiding the fact that he was Mary's prom date, so why now all of a sudden is scared? Everyone knows she is dead, everyone knows he was her prom date, but it all got swept under the rug for some reason, but now all of a sudden he's willing to kill to keep a secret that has never been a secret? Um, OK...<br /><br />Second, isn't this supposed to be Urban Legends??? What Urban Legend is someone getting killed with a broken bottle? Or strangled with a plastic bag? And why is Bloody Mary wanting to use Urban Legends??? It's not like her death had anything at all to do with them? And dying a tanning bed is NOT an urban legend, it's just a rip-off of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.
