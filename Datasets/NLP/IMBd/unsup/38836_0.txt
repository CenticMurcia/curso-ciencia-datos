I saw the last hour of this movie on TV when I was about eight years old and the robot walking along the deserted city street was an image that has stayed in my brain for 40 years. I had dreams about that robot periodically throughout my life. I never learned the name of the movie until recently and, of course, was disappointed when I viewed it again. As an adult I can appreciate the character studies but I wanted to see an army of robots. There was only one and it had little screen time. It seems to me now that it would have been easy enough with some different placements of the single robot and clever editing to make it appear that as if there were many of them.<br /><br />Anyway, that said, the robot was pretty original looking. I've seen many robot movies of that time period, and this one didn't look like any of those. It's little to recommend this film, but old science fiction buffs shouldn't miss this one. It shows how much can be made of so little.
