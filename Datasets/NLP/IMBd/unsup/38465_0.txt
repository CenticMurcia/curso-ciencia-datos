Writer/director/producer Greg Lamberson's first stab creating his own low-budget horror film comes across as a cross between "Street Trash" and "the Stuff" while being not quite as entertaining as either of the two aforementioned movies. This movie about a guy who moves into an apartment where he slowly gets murderous after a dinner of rather potent 'wine' and 'yogurt' starts off extremely slow and will leave you searching for the remote, but about a half hour in it gets slightly interesting. I applaud what Greg accomplished with the budget that he had, but sadly I still see this movie as a misfire.<br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />Region 1 DVD Extras: Commentary with Director Gregory Lamberson; Making Slime featurette; Bonus film? "Naked Fear" with optional commentary; a promo for Shockarama Cinema; theatrical trailer; and Trailers for "satan's Black Wedding", "Criminally Insane", & "Women's Prison Massacre"
