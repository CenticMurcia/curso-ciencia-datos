This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen (the first 20 min of). When the movie started I thought "well OK this it just one of those teenage comedy flicks with sexy teenage babes in" so an OK way to waste some time. After the first 10 minutes I was like "well OK they just need to get some action started and then the movie will be worth watching" and then after 15 the first action scene came, and what a load of crap that was. There ware no close-ups of the sexy babes shooting big guns, half of the time the action was stopped because someone had to say something stupid and the whole thing was full of errors and stupid crap. So after seeing the first action scene (app. 20 into the movie) I ripped out the DVD and almost through it in the trash can.<br /><br />To anyone considering this movie "DON'T RENT IT AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NEVER EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT"
