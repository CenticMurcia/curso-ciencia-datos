Its a bit late for me to post this review. But memories were rekindled after the Saawariya fiasco of the apparently great Sanjay Leela Bansali. I was in India at that time, and many people talked about Black as if no one every made a movie like that ever. First of all its a remake, so attributing a "genius" tag to Bansali is uncalled for. I also did not appreciate the fact that he did not admit to the fact that it is a remake of The Miracle Worker. I mean, be a man. Tell the world you are making a remake. Secondly, in Bollywood, overacting means good acting seems to be the norm. Rani was as shrill as you can see. You can paint emotion but if the colors just bleed than it looses its grace. Bansali just went overboard. Some scenes make no sense. The empty rooms with slide images portrayed in the background. The needless filled sets. They distracted more. The film has its moments. Especially the one where Rani meets AB after a long time. I will not go into more details for the sake of those who haven't seen it (yet). In the same week, I had the good fortune of seeing Million Dollar Baby and.. boy.. what a difference. To see how emotions are handled subtly.. now THAT was a treat. Perhaps Bansali ought to learn from Eastwood.. if he gets down from cloud 9 that is...
