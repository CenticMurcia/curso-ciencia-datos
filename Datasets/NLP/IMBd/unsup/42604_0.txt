I won't go into the problems that I had with this movie. Most of them have been touched on, from sexuality, to mild swearing, to stereotypes. I had a hard time staying interested after the first 30-45 minutes. I was bored and looking at my watch a lot, especially after they found the city. The animation was nice but the story was not.
