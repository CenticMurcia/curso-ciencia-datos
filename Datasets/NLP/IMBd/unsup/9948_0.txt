We watched this movie in school. We also watched Spartacus. I definitely prefer Ivanhoe to Spartacus. I think that Ivanhoe was more interesting with all of the jousting. Though, as I was watching it I kept thinking of "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" by Mel Brooks. "Its King Richard back from the Crusades" Though at the end of the film, our teacher take a vote and the boys thought that Ivanhoe should choose Rowena and the girls wanted Ivanhoe to choose Rebecca!Overall I really liked this movie. I really want to read the book now. Though some parts are boring. The jousting is wicked cool though. If Sir William Scott was still alive, I think that he would of been very proud.
