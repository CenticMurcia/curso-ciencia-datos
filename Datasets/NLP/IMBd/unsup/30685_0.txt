Months after the film Tombstone was released came this film, but it instead shows the full life journey of one of history's greatest lawmen, from Razzie nominated director Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill). It shows Wyatt Earp (Razzie winning Kevin Costner, also producing) growing up on the corn farm with his father Nicholas (Gene Hackman) and brothers Virgil (Michael Madsen), James (David Andrews) and Morgan (Linden Ashby). Then grown up, he marries sweetheart Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish), who soon after died from typhus, while pregnant, and Wyatt burned their house and all possessions inside, turning to a life of crime to survive, forcing him to run away from Missouri to Dodge City. It is there he first makes a living skinning wilder beasts with brothers Ed (Bill Pullman) and Bat (Tom Sizemore) Masterson, then he builds a reputation as a good lawman, grows his moustache, meets partner Doc Holliday (a near show-stealing Dennis Quaid) who is slowly dying of tuberculosis, and makes sure all townspeople do not have any guns. I kind of lost my understanding of what was going on in the last hour or so, but it was still worth seeing the events in Tombstone and O.K. Corral. Also starring Catherine O'Hara as Allie Earp, Isabella Rossellini as Big Nose Kate, TÃ©a Leoni as Sally, Navy NCIS's Mark Harmon as Johnny Behan and The Passion of the Christ's James Caviezel as Warren Earp. The performances are all good, the story has compelling moments, and all scenes seem beautifully filmed, a pretty good epic western drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and for some reason, it won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screen Couple for Costner and any of his three (film) wives. Very good!
