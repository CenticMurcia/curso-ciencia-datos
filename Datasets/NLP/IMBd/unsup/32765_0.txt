Pretty decent short film. The technical aspect was not great, some bad sound here and there, but for the budget, it is watchable. Obviously you cannot expect a hit when movies are shot with a low budget and with a skeleton crew(which I'm sure this movie had). The acting was pretty decent overall, and the story was good as well. I liked the Goth(so to speak) girl and the main actress was also pretty good. I did like the end when the guy being interrogated turns out to be a very significant character in the movie(do not wanna spoil it). The movie is about 40 minutes long, so that is a plus because usually movies like this that are too long are hard to watch all the way through.
