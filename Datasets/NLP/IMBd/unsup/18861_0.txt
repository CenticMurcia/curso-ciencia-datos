This was one of the best horror movies that I've seen in a long time. For a first time producer in Rob Zombie, to make a film like this is just amazing. This movie was banned from theaters in the US, but still got a huge buzz and became an instant horror classic. This movie provides everything you want in a horror movie, but i will not give away any details but Rob Zombie does a great job in bringing the horror movie back to its roots. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat or your head tucked in your shirt through out the whole movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror movies and a lot of gore. Once you see this movie go check out the sequel: The Devil's Rejects (Also a great movie).
