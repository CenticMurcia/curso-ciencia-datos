I live in Japan and watch a lot of Japanese films. Like anywhere there are the gems and the dregs. Unfortunately, this falls into the latter. It is shallow, pretentious and shot through with amateurism, from the none existent cinematography, to the flat dull performances. Chara should stick to singing, and this is probably Asano's worst performance on screen I've ever seen. This is more evident if you don't need to rely on the subtitles, as the original dialog comes across as hollow and flat in the native tongue. The concept is interesting and original, but that doesn't mean anything if the execution is lacking. Another point worth mentioning is that this is NOT a short film, it clocks in a just over an hour, a little longer in the original Japanese version (72 minutes) and I think this is it's biggest problem, it stretches an already thin concept beyond breaking point. Disappointing from Shunji Iwai, who is on of the more talented directors from Japan. Though to be fair, this is a relatively early piece, and his later works are much more confident in style and content. One for the fans only I think.
