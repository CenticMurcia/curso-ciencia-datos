Definitely one of the worst films of 1998, if not THE worst, "The Godson" lacks one fundamental element of comedy: Humor.<br /><br />The cast, including Rodney Dangerfield, Dom DeLuise (who spoofs Don Corleone), and Kevin "Kids in the Hall" McDonald, would make you think this film a riot. However, it is quite the contary.<br /><br />The jokes all fall flat, including the excrutiatingly unfunny "bank" skit, that just went on and on until I was squirming out of my chair - not from boredom (well, not ONLY because of boredom) - but because like many of the "jokes," it outstays its welcome to a point of discomfort.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is one of those films that should be seen only if you're in the mood for it. Which SHOULD be never.<br /><br />1/5 stars -<br /><br />John Ulmer
