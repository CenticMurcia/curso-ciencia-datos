Julio Medem had directed a few movies before this one, with his "key" movies (Vacas, Tierra, Ardilla roja, Amantes del circulo polar) being basically the same plot rehashed in a different way. The afore-mentioned movies, in my opinion reflected limited directorial skills and zero originality.<br /><br />So, he "moves into the 2000s" with a movie in which you see a constant parade of genitals followed by sex. If you like naked bodies and uncensored sex, go for it by all means. However, don't try to pass it off as "transcendental" or "artistic" like Medem did.<br /><br />There is no plot. None. You get more of a plot swirling a bowl of alphabet soup with your spoon. Even Najwa Nimri, usually extremely convincing and talented, phones this one in.<br /><br />What it boils down to is this: if you want to see sex, see this movie. If you want to see a movie with sex and a plot, then keep looking.
