I may just be a philistine, but this examination of the lives of European monks ultimately struck me as pointless. The film simply follows the monks through their daily routines, without any back story on the individual monks or narration to give viewers any context. Occasionally, quotes from the Bible will appear on the screen, with the same quotes repeating frequently and offering no real insight into what is going on.<br /><br />To a certain extent, the film assumes either a familiarity with Catholic belief, or an overall sympathy with the contemplative way of life. To someone who does not embrace a mystical outlook, the film will come across as alien, or an exercise in boredom.<br /><br />This is not to say the film is without its good points. The cinematography is superb, capturing the breathtaking beauty of the Alps. However, this is ultimately not worth watching a nearly three hour film.
