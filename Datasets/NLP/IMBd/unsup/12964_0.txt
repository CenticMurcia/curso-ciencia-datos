I just finished watching this movie with my friends, and I am actually angry right now. I want to punch myself in the face because this movie was so incredibly horrible. I want my hour and a half back. Please, never see this movie. I do not understand how the actors of this movie could allow this to be released. They are successful actors, but this movie makes them all look money hungry and that they do not care about stealing time and money from the viewer. I hope I have saved someone the time. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE! The plot is horrible, the acting is cheesy, and the jokes are not even original. You sit there in a stupor waiting for it to get entertaining, but it never does. I am ashamed of the actors/comedians for making this. The only real joke is the one that the producers/writers/actors played on the unsuspecting viewer!
