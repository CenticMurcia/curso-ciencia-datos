Sorry to tell you guys but this was a total waste of time. This was the third Mexican film in a row. First night of the Bloody apes, second Curse of the Doll people & then Cemetery of Terror.<br /><br />Doll people is excellent, great classy horror movie. Apes was equally good, very gory & bloody. I loved it, but Cemetery was a total flop for me. So bad that I had trouble keeping awake. The pace is good but the there is no chemistry on screen, no seat jumping moments & totally unbelievable effects. Maybe a better plot would have helped the film cause I have seen this to many times already. But as it is, this seem to be a classic so If you have enough time on your hands...try it for yourself.
