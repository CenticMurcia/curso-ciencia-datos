I have watched this movie about 3 times in the past 2 years, the first time was while I was in Iraq for my second time. This movie has motivated me to get onto the Internet, come here, register, and post this. <br /><br />This movie is such an insult to me by the way it depicts the U.S. Army. The ice cold barracks, the fellow soldiers you cannot trust or respect, the unchecked sadistic nature of these soldiers. It's war hating, soldier disrespecting propaganda. It was bad enough without the upside down American flag. Yes, if the state of U.S. Army was actually as it is displayed in this movie, then yes that scene would be fitting, but this is not true. <br /><br />While active duty in the Army for over 5 years, a junior enlisted to sergeant in the ranks, in the 3rd infantry division, and 2 year+ deployments to central Iraq under my belt I think this movie is a pure crock of you know what. And no, I'm not a right wing bush voting war monger. <br /><br />Was this movie dramatic enough to hold my interest? Yes. But for this bleak world around a military base to be depicted as truth and honestly is absolute crap. I have never seen so much dreariness anywhere in the U.S. Army. I don't know how to go on with words, I Just want to put the word out there that fictional depictions of life, like portrayed in this movie, do far more harm than good. <br /><br />Post traumatic stress does exist, it has taken a while for me to stop missing being deployed, I missed the camaraderie, my buddies, and the excitement of deployment life, and no it was not about baby killing and slaughter. The issues that this movie is supposed to represent should be out there, and they are, but this ridiculous portrayal is a disgrace to those who serve, and care, and try to be honorable on a daily basis.
