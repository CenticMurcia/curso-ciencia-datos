Lovely movie, I actually had the luck to be able to see it while i was in school. I saw it several times and was facinated. Bloodvengance in Iceland, vikings that appear as vikings,and not with the silly horns or their helmets. Just the down and dirty,realistic fighting that was so common between clans in Iceland and the rest of Scandinavia during the iron-age and the early medieval era. The tale of vengeance and killing really grips me. I recommend this movie to anyone who want to see a movie that portrais, or at least gives a glimpse of what it could have been like, and is not destroyed by Hollywood's myths about vikings. For those of you who want to see what is perhaps the best movies about vikings and see this one and if you like it see the follow up In the Shadow of the Raven.
