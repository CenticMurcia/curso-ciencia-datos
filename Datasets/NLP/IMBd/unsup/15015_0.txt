I am a 50 year old woman from one of the most conservative states in the United States (one that banned gay marriages). I watched this documentary with tears streaming down my face the entire time. What a wonderful story! The families were fabulous and loving. During the documentary I realized that being a heterosexual was only a small part of who I am. I am a mother, a wife, a friend, a businesswoman, a productive member of my community, and a woman who relies heavily on my faith. These people are just like me. The only exception being I have a partner that is man. These wonderful people are families first and their sexuality, while it is important does not define them exclusively. I am hopeful with Rosie and Kelly's continued work we will approach a better understanding and acceptance of non-traditional families. I know without a doubt that my God loves them all.
