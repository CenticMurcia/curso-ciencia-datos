I noticed that the IMDB classes INTERNATIONAL VELVET as an American movie , this despite the fact it`s filmed in Britain , has a British director and an almost entirely British cast . Mind you it is funded with American money and produced by an American studio so by definition it is technically an American movie <br /><br />I guess that`s why INTERNATIONAL VELVET has such a typically American ethnocentric view of the English . Another reviewer has stated that everyone talks in ridiculous and posh accents etc and I totally agree , it`s laughable the way the Brits are portrayed in this movie though perhaps not as laughable as Tatum O`Neal`s " English " accent which is every bit as bad as Al Pacino`s " Scottish " accent in REVOLUTION . I guess if the heroine was played by a genuine English actress an American audience wouldn`t be able to relate to her <br /><br />INTERNATIONAL VELVET is a rather drab movie that`s best viewed on a boring Sunday afternoon which was when I saw it . I will give the movie credit for the scene where the German rider falls off his horse because for some unexplained reason I found this rather amusing in a movie devoid of amusement
