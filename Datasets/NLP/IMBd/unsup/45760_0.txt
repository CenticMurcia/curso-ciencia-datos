Dreadful-- abosolutley dreadful. That describes "Untraceable," a serial killer film starring Diane Lane as the FBI agent out to catch a murderer. It's an interesting premise-- a killer who uses the Internet to torture and kill his victims-- but aside from that this movie is not worth anyone's while. There are moments where the acting is so histrionic and melodramatic you can't help but laugh. Some of the characters are underdeveloped, inclduing, in my opinion, the main character, and the script wasn't exactly up to snuff. <br /><br />But the kiss of death for "Untraceable" is its predictability. Assuming you're a half-smart person, you can tell who the victims will be, where the killer will not be, etc. The movie also ends somewhat abruptly, and the closing shot is utterly stupid and does not fit in with the scene.<br /><br />Say this for the methods of torture-- they are creative. But watching this movie is much like getting tortured within itself.
