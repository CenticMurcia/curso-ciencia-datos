Who gave this a score of "10"? It's hard to believe anyone involved in this production was savvy enough to register here.<br /><br />The main conflict in this movie is not the well-established cinematic trope of enmity between vampires and werewolves, but...gentrification? The werewolves are street people, and the vampires are buying up property and gentrifying it. That's the high-concept at work here.<br /><br />Hey, I saw this at an Earth Day party this year, 2007--I see someone else made a comment on April 29. Maybe we saw it together!<br /><br />The make-up, if I remember correctly, was surprisingly subtle--not in a good way--but, like, in a they-weren't-really-prepared-to-make-a-monster movie way. I mean, werewolves are hairy, they rip their clothes, and they have fangs. I think we all get that. They aren't just slovenly and crude.<br /><br />Watchable only as a curiosity--stay away.
