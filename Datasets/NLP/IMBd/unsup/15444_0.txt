I don't watch supernatural thrillers...ever. But at our camp over the summer we were given the choice of watching 'A Distant Thunder' or 'Robots', basically the whole camp watched 'A Distant Thunder' because abortion had been a hot topic of the week. We ended up watching the film 3 times with various bits being explained to us and some of the leaders had seen it 6 times and were still noticing more about it. The film is perfectly made, cleverly written and wonderfully acted. It is perfect for groups who are exploring abortion or if you want to stir up a youth group. I should also say that a group of 20 16-17 year olds watched it and we had 4 girls up for most of the night as the film seemed a little scary but the DVD comes with a cut version which may be more appropriate. A must see for anyone! I'd highly recommend it.
