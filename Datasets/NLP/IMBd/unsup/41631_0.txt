this is a masterpeice. well it would be a masterpeice if it was supposed to be a comic look into the future. everything about it jusst makes me laugh from the way rickenbecker runs to the cheesy flashbacks and the un-needed nudity of the lets face it ugly lead female. if ever you feel like a good laugh watch this film.
