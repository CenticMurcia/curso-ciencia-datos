A moving and inspiring story based on the struggles of the working class especially the Longshoreman.<br /><br />You learn the harsh reality of what it took and how much was sacrificed for workers rights to gain the benefits that are so much a part of not just the longshoreman but everyones rights in the workplace today. Anyone who strives for fairness, honesty and equality in their own life and in the lives of everyone around them should see this movie.<br /><br />Ian Ruskin's performance as Harry Bridges was a true portrayal of the man and his character. You find it hard to believe it is not Harry himself you are spending time with.
