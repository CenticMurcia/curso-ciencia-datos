although it was kinda hilarious,it was downright terrible. i have never given a film a one, but this one deserved it. the violence was just too much and my favorite flick is John Carpenters "The Thing". for chrissake, an old lady gets beaten and a kid gets purposely run over. now it did give me a few laughs, but this was a complete disgrace to the film genre and should not have gotten almost six stars. it makes me sick to think people actually liked this film. house of the dead was a somewhat better movie than this. the best thing i liked about the movie was the comedy, though. the mayor was a pretty funny guy and the kid who played Melvin was a RIOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
