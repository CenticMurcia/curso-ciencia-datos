I got this movie out for the family, and yes there are unsettling bits in it, vis - the dog fight, the abuse, the orphanage, the tree scene, when you think about it probably the whole film. And why is that? Probably due to the verisimilitude of the film to the times, the grainy nature just added to the realism, the times were tough so lets not sugar coat the experiences of those who went through them. Disney probably made this film by mistake but i'm glad they did. And I just love a story where a wolf gets equal billing in the sensibility stakes, even if it's a dog actor. Good film, good acting, great trains and the U.S. countryside never looked more beautiful. Oh and the DVD did jitter but settled down after clean ?, and it was letterbox for the widescreen so I didn't have to suffer amputation. 10 - 10
