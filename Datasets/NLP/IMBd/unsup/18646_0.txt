I missed the opening as I found this documentary while zapping. The documentary channel is new to me and I'm loving it quite a bit.<br /><br />Shake hands with the devil had special meaning to me as it gave me a glimpse back into the heartfelt emotions that so many of my old compatriots have deeply rooted in their hearts and souls. I am certainly no militarist lover. I've watched many a documentary by ex-politicians/military personnel trying to say "I'm sorry" about various wars. I've watched both previous movies on the Rwandan genocide, but this documentary hit home the hardest because, instead of showing the gut-wrenching and sensational time of killings, it brings to light the inaction of the rest of the world and the reasoning behind it. (well it's not completely void of gore, as there's actual footage of murdering, but always a far distance in the background.) I think it takes great courage to go public with one's sense of culpability and insufficiency, ones depression and sense of hopelessness. This is a depiction of human sorrow in nearly it's purest form, both at the deeply personal level and also on the international scale. As the closing remarks state so well, we have learned nothing, it could all happen again tomorrow, how can we live with such sorrow as that truth.
