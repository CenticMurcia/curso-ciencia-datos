Time Chasers features big chinned, Castleton graduate NICK MILLER (QUE elevator music) and his trusty textured wardrobe wearing friend-to-be-girl-friend LISA (QUE ... nothing). It also features the evil library clerk, CEO dressed J.K. Robertson. Oh yeah, it also has a guy wearing a pink shirt found at the day of the shoot cause he forgot his outfit. The storyline goes from a plane to a grocery store. Plus, a few shots of a plane flying into a camera that's recording a computer screen at the director's house on his off-day. That's all I should say, because the only interesting part was watching the credits to laugh at the fact that this movie actually had people to credit.
