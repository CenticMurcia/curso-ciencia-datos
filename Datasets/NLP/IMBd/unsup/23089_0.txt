I recently saw this movie, and for the most part found it informative and interesting. Of the greatest importance was the different cultural and social uses of one word that has "so much power." I enjoyed the interviews with the various people, including some scholarly linguists like Dr. Reinhold Aman, and Hollywood actors, such as Janeane Garofalo. This film cleared up some confusion, as far as the acronym (what F*CK stands for) and that it has nothing to do with Under the Command of the King to Fornicate. It was interesting to see the use of the word and the changes thru the decades. At one time it was rarely used, and now in some movies/songs it is used over 280 times. It is virtually a snapshot of our culture and how it has evolved over the past century. I would recommend this film to open-minded adults and linguists everywhere.
