I saw "Preston Tylk" at the San Jose Film Festival and was actually excited to see it. The program billed it as a neo-noir thriller and described its interesting premise. A guy goes out for coffee, comes back and his wife is dead. After that, things get weird. Unfortunately, the premise doesn't hold the film together. The acting is poor, the characters are reaching (striving, in fact) to be more than cliches, and the story is boring and played out. "Preston Tylk" proves a sad fact that just because a film is independent doesn't mean it has something interesting or new to say. Skip it.
