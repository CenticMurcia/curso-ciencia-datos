What a fantastic film. Having seen all of Kevin Smith's post Clerks productions, I was relentlessly pestered by my friends to watch this classic and having finally got hold of it, I must say it was a pleasant but not unusual surprise. I didn't really know what to expect other than it is in black and white and scripted by our beloved producer but what a hilarious film it turned out to be.<br /><br />The dialogue is typical Kevin Smith work, evident in his later films such as dogma and chasing amy, and might I add work that I thoroughly enjoy. The film was shot on a budget so don't expect anything fancy. No real big names although by now you should have heard of some of the actors.<br /><br />It will appear that this film is more appealing to Kevin Smith fans and not really for the faint hearted movie viewers who prefer clich√©s and typical dialogue (including them awful one liners). Oh no no no, this is one fast talking, twisted and very entertaining movie, but one that can only be appreciated when one can lower his/her inhibitions.<br /><br />Give it a shot, it's something different and if it's your cup of tea then you should love this movie, but if not then come back to it at a later date, you may actually appreciate this film at some point in your life!
