This is a nice easygoing film - the storyline is familiar to anyone who's acquainted with romantic comedies, though this film really isn't the comedic type, actually.<br /><br />Anyway the plot is very simple and nothing extraordinary, and there are too many montage scenes where you get the feeling that the film is trying to substitute songs for the lack of action in plot. Also, it is rather formulaic particularly in the middle of the film ... the whole misunderstanding part is so cliched.<br /><br />However, it's pleasant - it still makes for a worthwhile watch on TV, and predictably - of course the best moment is when they finally are together after all. That scene does make up a little for the flaws I grumbled about earlier, though definitely not entirely. Because:<br /><br />1. The dialogue leading up to the kiss is very romantic. 2. The kiss itself. 3. I'm in love with the instrumental music in that scene.<br /><br />So you get the idea - it's up to your taste.
