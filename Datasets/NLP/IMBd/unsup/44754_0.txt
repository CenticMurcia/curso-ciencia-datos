"The ButterCream Gang" is not only a horrible movie, it is quite fascist as well. Everyone in the film has blonde hair, except the bad guy who has brown hair. There are no Hispanics, Afro-Americans, Asians (except for a brief mention of Mahatma Gandhi, but I don't think that counts), Native Americans, or homosexuals in the film. In fact, when Pete (the bad guy) joins the bad gang, he changes his last name to a Mexican name for no apparent reason. There's also many misogynist images, such as the woman in the pink dress sweeping the porch.<br /><br />It's also quite lame. The ButterCream Gang (the good gang) mowe people's lawns for no money, save "the Widow Jenkins" (not Mrs. Jenkins, Widow Jenkins; they have to remind her that her husband is dead every time they say her name) when she falls down, and, of course, attend regular church services. About one quater of the movie is father-son pep talks about how to deal with the bad gang, one of which mentions Gandhi, and I know if Gandhi lived to see his name mentioned in this chauvanist film, he would cry with shame. The bad gang do not do anything horrendous, merely break bottles a nd spraypaint sad faces on the sides of buildings. I'm sure racists love this movie.
