I paid good money to see this back in 1989 at a first-run theatre! A friend talked me into it. I did NOT want to go shell out 5.00 for this. He said he'd pay me back if the movie sucked...so I (stupidly) agreed. Halfway through the film he handed me the 5.00 without saying a word. But there's two hours of my life gone for good! This film SUCKED!!!! Badly acted, written, directed, sub-par special effects...there's not one good thing to say about this. And seeing a large portion of the movie again through a different camera angle is inexcusable--I wanted to walk out at that point, but he wouldn't. He said "We've come this far..." Also he was driving me home so I had no choice. I have nothing against Cheryl or Kris but, really, didn't they read the script before they did the movie? Were they that hard up for money? AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
