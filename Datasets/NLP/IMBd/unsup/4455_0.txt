OK, so the acting isn't great. The script is poor. The special effects are terrible, but this is a film for kids. Adults can't make accurate comments on this, because we KNOW engines don't talk and shiny time isn't real.<br /><br />My 3yr old acts out scenes from this film over and over again. He tells me that lady carries magic and diesel 10 is bad. And therein lies the beauty of this film. It captures a child's imagination. If you want to watch a masterpiece then don't watch an adaptation of a child's book, that 20 years ago you would have loved. Diesel 10 is a great villain, he's funny and evil at the same time, and there are enough engines and "in jokes" to keep most children amused for hours.
