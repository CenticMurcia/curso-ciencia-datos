I haven't seen this particular short, but I couldn't help but notice how everyone mentions the MST3000 episode this appeared in. Apparently it never occurred to anyone that you guys weren't it's intended audience and that it was taken entirely out of context? I have no doubt it's cheesy as all heck, and probably somewhat offensive, but it's an ultra low budget educational film under absolutely no pretense of being high art. Harvey and Centron made thousands of them, it was a living for them. If you REALLY want to criticize a Herk Harvey film, why not write about his Carnival of Souls, the only movie of his he specifically filmed for wide release, and one of the all time classic atmospheric horror movies? MST3000 was a very very funny show, precisely because it would take a movie out of context, in some cases edit the movie extensively, and then exploit any incongruities and flaws that turned up in the process. That isn't a bad thing since they were witty enough for it to almost always work, but unfortunately a large number of the fans come away from the show NOT remembering the lack of context, NOT noticing the tremendous edits, and worst of all, NOT coming away with the LOVE for these movies that it's pretty obvious most of the people working on the show shared. Which results in a handful of people posting sneering critiques of the one industrial/education film that happened to end up on MST3000, ignoring the THOUSANDS of similar films and their original purpose, not realizing that they're the ones that are out of context here, not this short.<br /><br />IMDb doesn't allow the posting of URLs in reviews, but if you go to the Internet Archive's Prelinger Archive, they have a whole selection of Harvey's industrial/educational shorts, as well as Carnival of Souls, available for download (since they are all in the public domain).
