I could not disagree more. This was an embarrassing episode which lacks the "punch" usually associated with great Twilight Zone twists.The story is already stated by other reviewers. I saw this episode when i was 10 and i was shocked at the ending but looking back now it was only a pun. Larry Blyden's "afterlife" sure wasn't hell. If hell is to be surrounded by beautiful women 24 hours a day and being worshiped and loved by every one of them then maybe its where we all should go. I certainly wouldn't "get sick" if I were in that situation. Lets face it , it isn't hell. Hell is 120 degrees of constant work, torture, and torment for eternity. Blyden got off quite easily. The episode seemed superficial as well. Actually Sebastian Cabot was the only thing that stood out in this episode-one of the great character actors of all time.Yes the ending is not what you expect but neither was the depiction of hell as we know it. This ranks with "Too Serve Man" another "classic" which was nothing more than 25 minutes of fodder thrown on the screen just to set up a big 1 minute twist at the end.I guess some reviewers are just easy to please
