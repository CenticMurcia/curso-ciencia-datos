I'm only on to the second season, but this show is now one of my favorite anime! <br /><br />The plot with Naraku is interesting, though I found it a bit convoluted at first. But once I watched the episodes explaining who and what he is, and what he did, everything made sense. Reading some online spoilers also helped ^_^<br /><br />As I'm not that far along into the story, there isn't much that I have to say. I don't know why, but when I first saw the ads for this show on YTV, I thought that it looked stupid. I thought that it would a plot less, action based story for guys. Was I ever wrong!
