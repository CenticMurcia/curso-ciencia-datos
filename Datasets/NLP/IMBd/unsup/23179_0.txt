Really well written movie that pokes fun of both American and Indian cultures but with respect for each. Filmed partly in Seattle, but mostly in India. You see an American call center director has his section outsourced and he reluctantly travels to India to keep his job for a few weeks more till his stock options vest. He finds a culture he slowly comes to respect and embrace through an Indian woman he falls for and friendship with his coworker. The story plays out over many location shots in and near Mumbai. You almost feel you've been there by the end of the film. A great Indian cast really puts this one over the top with many laughs. Your next call with an Indian call center won't be the same.
