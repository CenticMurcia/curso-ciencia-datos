I'd say half of the movie is Hollywood fiction, and the other half could be a remote possibility- only because I believe that the Earth's magnetic poles have shifted, in the distant past. However, I don't think jump-starting Earth's nickel-iron core, will resume proper rotation, preventing gravity failure from sucking every known object out into space.<br /><br />I was fascinated by the visual renderings of what may lie beneath the Earth's crust...especially the hot, hostile environment inside the Mantle. Can you imagine? I still laugh at the deep-burrowing craft developed for the mission itself....which is the mechanical equivalent of a Diamond/Carbide-toothed sea Lamprey(species of Leech).<br /><br />I agree the filmmakers opting for such a lofty objective, were obviously gunning for huge box-office receipts just like Deep Impact, and Armageddon. Nice try guys. At least get your science down right before making such an ambitious film, and don't cast Hilary Swank for such intellectual roles, like a Physicist anymore.
