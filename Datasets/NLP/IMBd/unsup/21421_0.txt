Again, Ringu 2 much spookier to the American Makeover "The Ring 2" and again, the effects were much spookier . And the deaths were more disturbing. And the end was freakiest when that Kanae girl was seen standing behind Kawajiri when he was recovering in hospital. And when Yoichi's mother Reicha died when walking across the road and she got hit by a truck. And the blood of Reicha headed towards her beloved son calling his name. And when Kurashi went into the Institution to see Masami (a close friend of Tomoko's who was shocked by Tomoko's death), she walked past a t.v. and it showed Sadako coming out of the well and everyone in the Institution went berserk! Too disturbing to think about, eh?<br /><br />This is definitely a must see!
