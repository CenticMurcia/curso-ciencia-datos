This is the first time I've ever written in these comments - I just wanted to warm someone else before they lose an hour and a half of their life.<br /><br />A cheap budget does not forgive a HORRIBLE script or amateur acting and directing. I watched it last night and was mislead by some reviews to believe that this film had some interesting elements. It does not.<br /><br />It was the worst film I have ever seen in a theater. The audience laughed out loud at ever plot twist and cheesy one-liner. It was not supposed to be a comedy.<br /><br />There were so many laughable moments that I can only touch on a few. #1 - It insinuates that there were slaves in rural Quebec (*The English part?) in 1968 that were killed by these crazy villages who kept their skin... on a blanket? #2 - There are so many red herrings that the twist at the end is just a laugh (undead slaves walking out of the cornfield). #3 - The directing and editing is so bizarre at times that it removes the viewer from the film. #4 - the moral ended with 3 pages of text to shove the history of slaves down the throats of the viewers - is more of an insult to those who died than anything else.<br /><br />There is so many more problems with this script / film - I just don't have the time. I just hope this saves one person from the pain I endured.<br /><br />This film should never have attempted to associate with their memory.
