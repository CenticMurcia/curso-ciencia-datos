Others have noted that the military customs and traditions were carefully observed -- not saluting uncovered, etc. -- but do not note that LCDR Coleman, in the scene where DiNozzo reveals CPL Yost's Medal of Honor, also snaps to attention but does not salute (she was not covered, being indoors; her hat was under her arm). The Marines, however, *were* covered even though they were inside since they were carrying arms on duty, hence coming to attention as well as the salute.<br /><br />Subtle point but shows the care the producers have taken to get most things right in this show.<br /><br />Very good series; this is an excellent and very moving episode.
