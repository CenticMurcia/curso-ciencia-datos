**May Contain Spoilers**<br /><br />I feel sorry for kids 34 years ago who were enticed by green-tinted newspaper ads and entranced by a cool Famous Monsters cover; they must have been truly disillusioned when they actually saw the movie. One member of Robert Horton's expedition accidentally picks up a gobbet of alien glop on his uniform and carries it back to the space station. Horton and Richard Jaeckel in one of his many thankless roles argue over who's fit to lead the expedition, when they're not fighting over Luciana Paluzzi. Much of this action takes place at a Mod-style party that effectively dates the film for all time. The slime, meanwhile, kills several people and mutates into a what looks like a one-eyed dill pickle with tentacles. The officers and crew find out the hard way that new creatures instantly emerge from the spilled blood of the original and that sunlight heals the monsters' wounds. They shoot at the slime creatures anyway with ray guns and when their guns run out of ray, throw them at the monsters. Some of the blue-screen effects are as terrible as the script. The idea of a deadly creature being picked up by space travelers brings back faint echoes of the superior IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE. Fans of films with aliens trashing spaceships had to wait eleven years for another good one.
