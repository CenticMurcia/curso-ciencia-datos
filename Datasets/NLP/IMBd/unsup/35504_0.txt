I go to see a movie for two reasons; to laugh or to be absorbed in an adventure. This movie was both boring, disturbing and hard to understand (not even counting the subtitles). Both my wife and I had the same reaction and after 20 minutes stopped the dvd player. Basically the plot had to do with eskimos being cruel to each other in the worst crass ways. In one instance a family is given the meat from the butt of a seal by the tribe because the hunter was unsuccessful that day. While they're eating the other eskimos taunt the whole family. What a downer. Save your money and don't waste your time.
