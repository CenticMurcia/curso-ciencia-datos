Though I was a kid when "Looker" came out. You gotta absorb yourself into the world of science fiction(sci-fi). Albert Finney("Annie", "Shoot The Moon"), Susan Dey("The Partridge Family", "LA Law"), James Coburn, Dorian Harewood, and others make of a very fine cast of characters in the movie. Despite the nudity, this movie was well handedly made. Finney played a plastic surgeon whose patients die of under mysterious circumstances. The first victim looked hot in her black bra and panty, who needed that robe? Then a man named Reston(Coburn) who runs a shady corporation who uses TV as his weapon of choice. And that gun of theirs, it's unbelievable. Why need bullets to kill, when you can use a special light to cause disorientation. That will make regular drugs, obsolete. This movie looked liked a drama at first, but when I watched some more, it was much more interesting. This is one 80's sci-fi film I really enjoyed. It was well made , and as the British say, "It's a real Right-LOOKER!" 5 STARS.
