This movie is produced after the Macross Robotech series. Its not scenes from the series its a whole new drawn movie. It has some of the story from the serie but a whole lot is different. Its much better drawn than the serie and it has more violent and romans in it.<br /><br /> So did you like the series you will LOVE the movie: Macross Do You Remember Love.<br /><br /> One of my all time high Anime and saying that though i have 120 anime DVDs means a lot.
