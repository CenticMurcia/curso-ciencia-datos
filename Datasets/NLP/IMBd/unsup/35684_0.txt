WTF? This movie was just plain weird. It is about a bunch of people trapped in the living room of a wealthy guy, but there is really no apparent reason why they're trapped in there. Then, some sheep with their eyes covered, and then a bear. A BEAR? Are you kidding me? <br /><br />Were they just trying to spend someone else's money, or a government grant, or something? If that is the case, great. If not, watch real movies, like any Tyler Perry, or some early Sean Mc Namara (Bratz).<br /><br />The worst scene involves a massacre over some big stair steps at some weird beach, and a baby cradle falls down. Is that bizarre or what?<br /><br />Until next time.
