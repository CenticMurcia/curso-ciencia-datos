I don't understand what the point of making this movie was. Every part was drug out until it got annoying and boring. Honestly do not even think about renting because of Dennis Hopper's reputation. I know the man can act and he is very good at it, but this movie almost killed him. Honestly he was horrible at being a mean cop and it was overall just annoying. Not to mention Grover's part in the move. This was his big first acting appearance and it was pathetic. The man made a good plot for the movie but when it came down to actors and doing it....he was way in over his head. So all I'm saying is if that you really want to test it, if you really want to see how Bad Dennie Hoppper can be, then go ahead. I warned you.
