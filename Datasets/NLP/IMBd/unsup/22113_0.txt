A washed-up boxer is given a magical chance to win an important fight, thanks to the "big, tall wish" of a little boy who idolizes him.<br /><br />This is one of the most underrated episodes of the series, featuring brilliant performances from Ivan Dixon as the fighter and Steven Perry as the boy. Remarkable for its time as a TV episode featuring African-American actors in flesh-and-blood roles, but had nothing whatsoever to do with civil rights issues. Serling's sensitive script and innovative direction also help create a beautiful and superbly realized story about the importance of faith, and the tragedy of the cynicism that age and experience can create.
