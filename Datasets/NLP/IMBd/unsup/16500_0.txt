ToolBox Murders is often compared, and often called a "remake" of the 70's "The Toolbox Murders" it is actually not, it takes on a life of it's own Deep in the shadows an evil being "born of death" lurks in the shadows and structure of an old run-down apartment building that has recently reopened, which has awakened this enigma's rage. As people move in, so does the killer slowly, and quietly killing them one by one.<br /><br />The cast is great and Angela Bettis as Nell, offers a great performance, i'd say one of the best in her career so far. When you need the strong husband that guards the hesitated and timid wife, you get Shawn whom is played by Brent Roam who does a great job as the guardian, safe-keep of his wife. This movie also has a kooky supporting cast that is also well played out one that stands out in remembrance is the character of the weird and shy repairman, his look is that of a grungy, careless non responsible individual and often leads you to believe that HE could be the man behind the mask....is he? Also it was really great to see Rance Howard (father of Ron and Clint Howard) in this film, he's such a great talent.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a must see on my list of lists, so please take my advice and rent/Buy this film as it is highly well executed and shot, by Hooper.<br /><br />Some of the gore is so brilliant and innovative, some that other movies have tried....but it never looked this good! The gore alone is what makes this such a film....Finally Tobe Hooper brings to life another enigmatic, mysterious being, just as he did in 1974 with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Gunnar Hansen as LEATHERFACE.<br /><br />- Rick Blalock
