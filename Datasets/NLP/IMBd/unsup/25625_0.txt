When I first saw the ad campaign for this movie, I couldn't wait. Then I saw the trailer which made this film look like a great satirical film. Then I saw the film. All of the best (and pretty much only) funny gags are in the trailer, and what we are left with is a preachy, poorly acted, heavy handed PSA. There are too many storylines and many of them go nowhere and make a viewer wonder why they were there to begin with. This would have been much better as a short film. Shishar Kurup who plays Alex, the cameraman, is one of the few bright spots in this flick. I saw skip the movie and just watch the trailer.
