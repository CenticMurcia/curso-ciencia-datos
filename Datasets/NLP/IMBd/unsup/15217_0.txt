when i've watched "Barda" i was expecting' a quality tension movie but i was disappointed when i saw it.instead of tension i just felt boredom.the story of the movie goes like this<br /><br />a group of armed bank robbers entered to a bar after the robbery.few minutes later they took few customers in the bar as hostages and after that they begun torturing them until the night's over and cops bust in and arrest all of them<br /><br />That wasn't the film which makers promised in it's trailers.Film completely filled with torture,beating,rape and murder.i still wonder how could they charge people to see a humans in the movie getting tortured,humiliated and so on.<br /><br />it's a waste of time if you have passion for snuff films you just can get thousands of small videos in the net and i wager they're more high quality than this low budget crap
