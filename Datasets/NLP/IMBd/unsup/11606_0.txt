Midnight Run is one of the most underrated movies of recent memory. There has been many attempts a regurgitating the story line from my fellow commenter's, so I will go in a different direction.<br /><br />The Deniro character is awesome. Most Deniro fans will have to see this movie a couple of times to understand his comedic brilliance in this movie. The interaction between Deniro and Grodin is incomparable. It has been rumored that Grodin aggravated Deniro so much on the movie set that it brought out the best in these two actors in the film.<br /><br />The soundtrack is marvelously written by Danny Elfman. I have one question on the soundtrack...who is that playing the Slide and Electric Lead Guitar on the soundtrack? Is this Danny Elfman himself? There is not any listed credits for the musicians so it is impossible to tell who it is...but suffice it to say that the slide guitar player sounds like Ry Kooder on Steroids. The music complements the chase scenes like I haven't heard or seen in many years.<br /><br />If you do not have this movie in your collection, BUY IT. It is one of those movies you can watch every couple of months and never get bored with it or its characters.<br /><br />Jim Morris
