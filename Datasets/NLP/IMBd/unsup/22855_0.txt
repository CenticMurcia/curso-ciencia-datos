i am so pleased i bought this movie at first i thought oh dear lets hope the film is more original then the title and to my surprise it was. this movie is full of action and suspense from the beggining, it has special effects like you expect to see in big blockbuster hits and even though the acting is a little on the over the top side its made up for by the brilliant gore and spider special effects.<br /><br />contains spoilers the govenment is carrying out experiments on a spider and injecting it with alien DNA but when a sola flare hits the space craft were the experiment is taking place the spider escapes and begins to kill of the crew one by one then laying egges in a surviver with boldging bodyparts the special effects really get going when the spider comes out of the hosts mouth and begins to attack anyone in its path including three nosey college newspaper reporters the spider is finaly killed but not before laying egges in its creater ( some phsyco messed up bloke) who when the students get out of the lab underground find there boss dead and the phsyco bloke sitting in there seat then the spider is born. the spiders leggs come out of the back of the bloke and it grows as big as 3 double decker bussess. the spider then gets into the city ( with amazing real special effects) reaking horror werever it goes. i wont tell u the end because hopefully by now your on the edge of your seat and you will have to by or rent this movie 9/10
