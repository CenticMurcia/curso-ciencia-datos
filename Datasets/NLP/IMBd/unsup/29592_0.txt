After the long wait it finally came.. Death On The Road. An audio visual treat filmed on the Dance Of Death tour 2003/04. The package comes with 3 discs. 1 x Extras - Fan interviews (a bit lame, promo videos, photos and a behind the scenes on the road (very good). The other 2 are a stereo and 5.1 version of the gig (a bit pointless in my opinion). Anyway, the actual gig has been put together by Steve Harris again so the edits and cuts are immense... and there are a few black and white crowd shots. A bit of a shame but it doesn't take too much away from the finished product. The set contains a healthy wedge from the 2003 album as well as the trade mark anthems. Lord Of The Flies makes it in as the Blaze era token track.. not bad but it would have been nice to have had a lesser heard classic thrown back in (Powerslave? Wasted Years?).. The stage production for the tour rivalled that of the mighty 7th Tour of a 7th tour back in 88. Castles, Reapers & a couple of Eddie's are the setting for the show. A visual treat for sure. A very good concert DVD is whats on offer. A few flaws in terms of editing in my opinion but its pretty damn good. Is it as good as Rock In Rio? Nearly! The next DVD looks like it'll be the Ullevi Stadium show from 2005. I strongly feel that Steve should hand the editing job over to someone else to get a new feel to it. The TV broadcast version doing the bootleg rounds is bloody good. Needs a bit of tweaking but hold on to most shots for a few seconds at least. That could well be the best new line up Maiden DVD we'll see.
