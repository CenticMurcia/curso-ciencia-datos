1st watched 12/22/2008,(Dir-Roy Ward Baker): Strange group of 3 horror stories combined with weird live musical interludes from current British artists of the time(supposedly). The stories that the movie is based on were written by a popular horror writer and that writer is portrayed in the movie by John Carradine. He meets up with a real vampire, played by Vincent Price, who takes him to the "Monster Club", which is where the rest of the movie is set. The Monster Club is a strange hippi-like club in which only vampires, werewolves, ghouls or a combination of any of those thru mating can join. The stories start at various times and are interesting with the first being the best, but the silliness surrounding them lessons their impact. Vincent Price has some funny lines but there isn't much else appealing in this movie. The second and third stories are forgettable and therefore the overall affect of the movie is a negative one. The attempt, I believe, was to honor monster movies, but despite many other horror character actors appearing it doesn't do a very good job at this.
