Okay this show is better then any I have ever seen. it is unique every character is different, the actors are absolutely AMAZING. I didn't like the last episode it wasn't s proper ending. i think they should continue on and make a third season! I'm DYING to know what happened to Brooke and also who Harrison chose. This show has made me, Laugh, cry, smile, frown. There has never been a show I loved more. My favorite Characters are Sam, Brooke and Marry Cherry. I think Sam is absolutely gorgeous. as is Brooke. Marry Cherry makes me laugh SO HARD! If I got to meet the cast I would faint. their all so amazing. If this show came back it would be the greatest thing ever. So please bring it back. it does have a very very good fan base. Please bring it back, and cure the horrible curiosity that is making many teens and fans of the show, wonder and yearn for answers. thank you.=]<br /><br />Christina. <3
