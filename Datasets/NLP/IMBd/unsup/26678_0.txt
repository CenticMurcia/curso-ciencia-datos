It's funny how I stumbled on this movie. It all began with a fan fiction character I created named "Roka Embers" which is a Hungarian name. I got curious and typed that name on you tube. I found some old Hungarian cartoons including this title. I watched it in Hungarian, and then found an English version.<br /><br />I love the movie! It is one of the few animated movies that you really just fall in love with. The comic relief mixed in with the more serious and idealogical aspects make this a classic I won't soon forget. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an old cartoon to watch. I was surprised to actually find the English version. But a good fellow on you tube has a collection of obscure movies and he had some other foreign and domestic films that are rarely seen. But all in all, this is one great movie.
