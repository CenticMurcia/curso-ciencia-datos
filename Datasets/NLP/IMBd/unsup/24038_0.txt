First things first, I want to clear something up. The critics are wrong again. Worst remake ever? Get serious. Not even close. Has any of this armchair experts bothered to watch the new "Stepford Wives" or "Planet of the Apes"? I can easily list two dozen remakes that sucked far far worse. With that out of the way, I want to say I liked Stallone he was a obvious choice and especially Mickey Rourke. Rourke had just the right mix of sleaze ball zen master attitude and macho coolness to pull it off. Caine was a perfect addition to the mix. Test audiences agreed. Rachel Leigh Cook was a tad weak but not bad. Same goes for the actress who played her mother. McGinley as Con McCarty was both funny and enjoyable. Loved his character the most. Even though it's not a loyal remake, it is a fun and hip remake.
