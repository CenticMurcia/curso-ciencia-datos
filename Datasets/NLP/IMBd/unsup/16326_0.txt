Very odd but fun cartoon short that was nominated for an Academy Award. It shows a bunch of dogs that act like humans constructing a building. The foreman comes out and has them play like a symphony while building! This leads to countless sight gags as the dogs construct a mammoth building in record time. No dialogue--just the music which is "Hungarian Rhapsode #2". Bright, cheerful, fast-moving Merrie Melody. TCM shows this every once in a while and their print is in pristine shape. The music is loud and the colors are so bright and vivid that they pop out at you. Also there is a character from other 1940s cartoon in this. He's a small dog with a terminally depressed expression. He has a hand in the ending. Well worth catching.
