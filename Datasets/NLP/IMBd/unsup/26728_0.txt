First of all I have to state that popular is a simply amazing show! ALL the characters are hilarious and each has a great story behind them.<br /><br />When I first started watching popular my first thought was "how great another average teen comedy-drama about popular and unpopular teenagers in a stereotypical high school" which was, I am sure, many other peoples first impression. But as I continued to watch I realized that popular is definitely NOT your typical teen comedy-drama.<br /><br />Popular is often satirical and sarcastic as well as incredibly heartfelt and dramatic. It does everything in its power to sort of push the boundaries of popularity and prove that nobody is perfect, even blonde beautiful cheerleaders.<br /><br />I really believe that popular should have made at least another 2 seasons, it certainly had enough potential! There are plenty of TV shows that are not nearly as good as popular and that have made Way more than 2 seasons!! The entire cast is incredible and if more seasons had been made maybe more people would have realized these actors potential and they would have become as famous as they deserve to be. Carly Pope in particular is strikingly beautiful and very talented. Tammy-Lynn Michaels and Leslie Bibb are also amazing and deserve more roles.<br /><br />Bottom line: watch popular, it will make you laugh, cry and you see yourself in at least one, if not all the characters :)
