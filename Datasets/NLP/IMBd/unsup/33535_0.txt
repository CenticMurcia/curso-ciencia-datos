huge spoiler alert.i'm about to give away the whole movie,in the hopes that no one else will ever watch this piece of excrement.a man gets off on taping people and getting their reactions before killing them, usually in a horribly disgusting way.oh yeah, he also talks to his victims as if it's all nothing more than a stroll in the park.he gives them little pep talks. for example, something along the lines of "Hey,it's okay,everything will be alright.keep your chin up".this is a paraphrase of some of the so called dialogue. that's pretty much the whole story.Oh, yeah we also get to hear him narrate too.what a joke.this is without a doubt the most vile,wretched thing anyone could make into a movie.it is not thrilling or exciting in any way,but stomach churning.less than 0/10
