All too often, budding filmmakers who undertake this particular kind of film end up making themselves look bad- as filmmakers. (Even seasoned professionals are fully capable of biting off more than they can chew, sometimes.) Rarely do beginners risk adding insult to injury by putting themselves at risk in front of- as well as behind- the camera. It's been done, of course (and will no doubt be done again... and again and again...), but it's seldom been done as well as it has here. CAVITE, while technically not a one-man show, is just about as close as one can get these days- and it's an impressive piece of work. Minimalist movie-making at its best. Even seasoned professionals could learn something from this one.
