First off, just to let you know, Queen Latifah cannot act, she has about as much acting ability as my left nut, just because someone can go on-screen and play themselves, over and over again, does not mean they can act, second off, I wouldn't even have had to watched this movie to tell you it's a piece of crap, the only reason I watched it's 'cause I work at a video store and it was playing on the tele, even then I stopped looking up after five minutes and tried to block out as much of the useless chit chat they were spitting out, and I can tell I'm not the only one who didn't like it 'cause people where walking out faster then they were coming in. This is, what I like to call Hollywood Hogwash, targeted towards 9-13 year old girls, and 12-14 year old boys, I wouldn't add this DVD to my collection even if it was given to me for free with a $100 bill inside. I find it very sad that a movie like this can actually be made and distributed. Five minutes into it and I can already name three things wrong with it, (1) The opening scene, with Queen Latifah doing stunts on the bicycle, Matt Damon as a super agent I can almost believe... (2) Queen Latifah in lingerie, a well pampered poodle is still a poodle, meaning a mutt's a mutt (3) then there's the scene where she's working on her taxi all night, in lingerie mind you, why??? when she's done, she's all clean, oh well, at least we were spared a shower scene!!!
