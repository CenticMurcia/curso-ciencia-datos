I can hardly believe that people like this movie. It was simply ridicules. David Dhawan has simply lost his mind. After Masti every director is exploiting the same script. The jokes were pathetic. Non-sense comedy and above all Sanjay Dutt. He was probably the worse in the movie. I mean his annoying one liner "missalen" sayings in that Punjabi accent were awful. Through out the movie he was the most annoying character and rather than funny. The script is quite loose. I mean how a stranger walks into the life of three married couple can and just pretends to know them. All in all for people who enjoyed this movie they need a head MRI.<br /><br />Please! Do not waste your time and money on it and if possible do not even watch it for free.
