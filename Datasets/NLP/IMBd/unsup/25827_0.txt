This is a qualified 10 out of 10 as the first hour or so of this documentary is great, the last half hour and/or the 90 minute total length started to put me too sleep. I mainly gave it a 10 because I was amazed at the techniques used in this film, fantastic animation, music, great sense of humor, editing and these are things I don't usually notice in a movie. The filmmaker must have had a huge budget to make this film. I hope some day she does a TV series as she is truly an innovator.<br /><br />I thought the first hour was magical. The filmmaker is an excellent narrator & her narration was great. But after about an hour or so, I started to fall asleep, I think the film maker has the potential to be another "Orson Welles" if she learns pacing and that more is not necessarily better and figures out that an hour of stimulation beats an hour of stimulation & a half hour of boredom.
