Watched "Around the World in 80 Treasures" for the first time tonight - as I am just back from Cambodia, and heading for Tajikistan. Dan Cruikshank seems to me to be a complete charlatan. While he picks some interesting places for his 80 treasures (eg, this evening Samarkand and Bukhara), I was appalled at his treatment of the scripts and artifacts of the sites he visited in Iran. Hasn't anyone told him that it is totally unacceptable for him to rub his greasy fingers over the 2000 year-old scripts? What sort of model is this for the rest of us? In Cambodia, the restoration of Angkor Wat is proceeding well. They now have rope barriers to keep people half a metre back from the hieroglyphs etc. In the main Angkor, I saw not one person reach over to touch the carvings. How come 10,000 tourists at Angkor Wat are more culturally aware than Mr Criukshank?
