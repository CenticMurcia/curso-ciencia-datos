Peak Experience brings together some quirky and intriguing characters for a ride of their lives. They are diverse and attractive, and even balanced and likeable. The setting is gorgeous and production values are relatively high. The let down is the bizzare sci-fi twist to the story that really de-rails any hope of a satisfactory resolution to the conflict between the characters. This element to the story is entirely unnecessary and ugly. A real shame as the film would otherwise have real appeal and market-ability.
