I see that there are six people who gave this idiotic, misbegotten, miscast film a 10 rating. I can forgive the twenty or so people who gave TERROR OF TINY TOWN a ten rating, but anyone who gave this a rating substantially higher than 1 is an idiot. Anyone who gave it a rating higher than 3 has never seen this movie. Anyone who gave it a 10 should be punished, punished severely. They should be forced to see it TWICE. I demand their names!
