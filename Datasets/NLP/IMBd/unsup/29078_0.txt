Even the presence of EDWARD EVERETT HORTON who is at his flustered best, can't save this innocuous little comedy from being a total bore.<br /><br />ROSS Alexander's career never did materialize as Warner Bros. hoped, and this film must be one of the reasons why. He's the spoiled rich boy in a girl meets boy story striving for a Cinderella touch, since the girl is a poor waitress posing as the daughter of a rich couple so that they can mingle with high society.<br /><br />Nothing works, not even the idea of a waitress disguised as a rich girl. ZaSu PITTS and GUY KIBBEE are the wealthy couple and JUNE MARTEL plays the hapless girl, making no impression at all.<br /><br />Even for a programmer, it's a total waste of time.
