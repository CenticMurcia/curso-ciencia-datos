If you are like me, you have bee to Blockbuster or any other video rental and have seen movies such as this on the shelf numerous times. These movies are terrible, but we keep renting 'no name' horror movies for whatever our own reasons maybe. My own reason for renting these types of movies, is hoping that maybe there will be one movie in the mix that will surprise me and actually be decent. To my surprise and liking I find a gem every now and then. This was not one of those times. Do I blame the makers of these films? No i do not, nor do I think anyone else should blame them for us spending our money.These films have very small budgets ,I would imagine. So lets not be so judge mental on these guys that don't have 30,50,or $100 million dollar budgets; instead lets hope that one day these guys will be somebody and be able to make good movies. I'm sure these filmmakers don't want to make bad moves but they don't have the money to make what they would like. Thank You
