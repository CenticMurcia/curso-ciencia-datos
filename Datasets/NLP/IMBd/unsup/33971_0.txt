that movie is full of outdated jokes, which we know from films like naked gun, top secret and the like, just worse. there's not really a storyline, at least not a plot which makes u want to follow the movie with interest. <br /><br />it's a ridiculous heap of scenes, which is boring from the beginning to the end and it's not like i don't appreciate that kind of joke. more than 10 years ago i laughed my butts off at naked gun, but now this film couldn't cope a bit with it and it's not at all original. in a nutshell: don't bother! another piece of junk in the German movie scene.
