Tastefully done, almost frightening. The lack of emotion is amazing, but if you were "in the business" at the time, I can't imagine how thick-skinned a madam would have to have been.<br /><br />This movie is more than surface-level entertainment, it documents the socio-economic and psychological aspects of prostitution in 1917 without being dry.<br /><br />I would watch it again because there is so much going on I'm sure I missed something while I was fixated on the sets and costumes.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Being a movie shot in the late 70's there isn't any overkill for the thrill as if this would have been produced today. Now, if you are easily offended or are looking for a lot of sex and violence, there is surprisingly very little, which allows the viewer to focus on the story and not the skin.
