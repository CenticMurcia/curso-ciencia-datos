The Blues Brothers franchise self destructs. Why was a classic Baby Boomer goof off movie made showing its middle age trepidations ? What's next The Blues Brothers Country Club ? What has the kid to do with anything anyway ? These were some of the thoughts that seared my mind as I watched this Kluge of a movie. And like buggy software, every time you thought it was finally working, it froze up on itself. The music, which was the hit of the original flick, seems stale, even trite in this one. The car chases and crashes look like the out takes from the 1980 version. What humor there is is almost Disney like cutesy instead of funky and brash. Where was the kid's skate board and puppy ? Who were they afraid of offending ? To whom were they pandering ? Guess.<br /><br />This movie was made for the advertisers who product placement seemed to be the only real concern of the moviemakers. We never expected a plot, but Gad !, would someone get a fresh set of monkeys at the dialoge typewriter, please ! All the shortcomings of the original flick were duplicated like from rote. The only message in this movie was, when you're big enough you don't have to care anymore. Just flip out some left overs, and some scraps, the adoring masses will tremble in gratitude. This movie is an unintenitional self parody, a seemingly endless grinding and rebooting of a failed concept. Its a serious downer in almost every respect. Rent the original, if you've never seen it, then staple on a hurl handbag to watch this chewy-as-gravel, poke in the eye. Be warned, next you'll see, "Blues Brothers visit the Muppet Babies on Ice." Will a Blues Brother(c) become a Furpy (c) or a Poke'mon (c) ? Does anyone care anymore? Thanks for decimating an American icon into a fast food franchise theme meal.
