Many claim this movie as one of the best of 1990s Bollywood for its family values. Its family values are only true to a point. It hails Indian values, and makes a not so subtle statement that America is the home of debauchers and drunkards. It insinuates that wayward immigrants to America have to be "redeemed" by Indian virtue. It was so comically bad, hence, the 3 rating.
