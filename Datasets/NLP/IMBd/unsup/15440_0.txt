I've told many of my friends and co-workers to watch this movie, but only tell them it is a courtroom thriller about a botched medical procedure. The film makes a subtle and brilliantly presented point while interesting to watch.<br /><br />I had the privilege of running into Jonathan Flora when he was touring in Ohio. He's quite an impressive guy and his wife, Deborah (Ann Brown) is a genuine sweetheart. I was equally impressed with the premium quality of production in this film from a very limited budget. For that point alone, if I were a producer, I would hire Flora on the spot. Buy this movie and share it with your friends and family.
