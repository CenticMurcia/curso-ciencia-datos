The Olbermeister is always worth listening to... I've found the Keither's insightful (correct spelling) comments and summaries generally right on the mark. I particularly like it when he attacks the faux news (noise) folks for the prostitutes they are to the fascist "upper" hand now running into oblivion what was the American Republican Party.<br /><br />Fux news' false pretense that presenting two disparate opinions provides a valid forum has been shown as the wrong argument that it is on the show. To me, Fox New's b.s. "fair and balanced" is a modern day equivalent of the conflicts between the followers of Jesus of Nazareth and the lions in the Flavian Amphitheatre in Rome.<br /><br />Keith's sparing with the "billo" or "oraly" or whatever you call his competition is especially interesting- as well as entertaining- to me. Before I knew better I used to watch the o'reilly factoid on a regular basis. He still has some- however rare- sound opinions but he sure as hell ain't open minded and generally focuses on increasing the current smokescreen put up by this dirty white house. I liked it post 9-11 when he "took on" the charities for their failure to give much of the donations to the needy in a timely manner; I am disgusted that he hasn't lived up to his promise to denounce this administration when weapons of mass destruction have not been found in Iraq; and also find it revolting and channel changing that he repeats and glorifies distortion and other fascist propaganda.
