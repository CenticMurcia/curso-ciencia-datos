This film was included in THE ANIMATION SHOW VOLUME THREE--a compilation of short films arranged by Don Hertzfeldt and Mike Judge. Overall, this is a very impressive DVD--and much of it is due to CITY PARADISE.<br /><br />The plot of CITY PARADISE is pretty much indescribable, as it's very surreal and will make your head explode if you think too much. The animation style is pretty exciting--with a combination of live action and animation. In many scenes, the faces are digitized human faces applied to spider-like drawings--though many of the minor characters are simply animated. The backgrounds, like the people, are also a combination of digital images and animation.<br /><br />The story, from what I am able to describe, is about a Japanese woman who comes to London. However, once there it just gets weirder and weirder but you also find yourself transfixed because of the unusual story and animation. More an artistic work than a cartoon.
