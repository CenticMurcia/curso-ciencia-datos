Disney's 1969 film "The Love Bug" is an excellent one. It took place in San Francisco, and it is about a man who had raced cars for a living. Suddenly, he finds himself at a dealership, and ends up seeing a car that had a mind of its own: a 1962 Volkswagen Beetle!!!!! So, the car got all fixed up and he raced, winning many races!!!!!<br /><br />I've seen this many times; when I was a little boy, I've always thought of these movies as not interesting. Usually when a really old Disney VHS gets put in, after the logos and such, something boring was to follow! It wasn't until around 1996 or so when I got acquainted with really old Disney live action movies much better.<br /><br />1999 was when I was sick, and we rented a lot of videos; this being one of them. At that time, that's when the movie became stuck in my head and became an instant favorite.<br /><br />"The Love Bug" is a great film. Don't drive away from this great one!!!!!<br /><br />10 stars
