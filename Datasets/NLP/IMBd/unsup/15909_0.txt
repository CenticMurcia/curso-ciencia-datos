Ever feel like your perversions are beyond human comprehension?? Rent this movie; you will be patting your own back and congratulating yourself on your high morals in no time. At the next family get together you will look around at your normal (newly realized of course) ancestry with admiration. For no social circle, other than those seen in paradise lost and my brothers keeper, is odder than those seen in crumb. So enjoy - and buck up young camper, you're not so odd after all.
