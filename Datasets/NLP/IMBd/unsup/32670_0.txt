Uggh! This is a terrible film and this was obvious by the first scene. The film begins with three very white-bread kids being taught by their grandfather how to be ninjas in some sort of Mario Brothers-like training facility. Considering how similar all this looks to "Pocket Ninjas" (the #4 lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), I knew I was in for a painful time! <br /><br />Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!! And, oh God say it isn't so, it's up to the thee kids AND Hulk Hogan to save the day. Can it get any worse?!?! Well, with tons of lame stunts, tons of special effects and minimal acting, the answer is YES! To show the FBI that they mean business, once the baddies take over the park, they make certain rides go SLIGHTLY faster!!! What beasts!! In fact, while there is lots of punching and kicking, this is only family-friendly violence--so the kids naturally win and no one shoots, stabs or even tickles their opponents. Because of this and the constantly insipid writing, the film is a total bore to anyone older than about 6.<br /><br />So should this movie be on the infamous Bottom 100 list? I think probably not for two reasons. First, very, very young kids will enjoy this insipid crap--and to me, a film should not be on the list if it is in any way enjoyable. Second, the production values are not that terrible and the film makes no attempt to be anything more than it is--a dopey little film that would most likely make a parent kill themselves or the kids if they are forced to watch it!!
