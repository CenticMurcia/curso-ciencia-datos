I have to admit that the first time I saw this film (the color version) I wasn't too enthused with it, probably because it was 3am on a Sunday morning. But after I saw it a second time (the full Black and White version), I fell in love with it and I now own it on DVD and have seen it quite a few more times.<br /><br />I found this movie to be very interesting and also very saddening. Though it is characterized as a piece of fictitious work, "?" is brutal honesty in its rawest form. While many will knock this film because of its pornographic nature or constant attacks on society, I was able to see the deep, hard points the story brings out about the world we live in today. Those who criticize swearing in movies and the other things meant to be rude and crude, will not like "?", but these elements were downright funny to me and fans of the dark comedy genre should definitely own this film!<br /><br />I do really like this film, and it made me laugh over and over again.
