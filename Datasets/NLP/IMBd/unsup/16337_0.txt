I think it is wrong when people attribute a certain quality to a community and expect that to be the their only quality. With this film, it attempted to steer from the stereotypical way of thinking and not focusing so much on the trials and hardship of lesbian romance within a Brit/Asian family, because by so doing, it will not be different or stand out for better or worse from other scenes. For those who say the film is not well shot, i thought it was beautifully shot, the first kiss was magical, not because of the kiss, but because of the location. If you're looking for soft porn or anything remotely of the sort, this is not the film for you. But if you love a romance, that is about love and what love should be, then this is a film for you. People spend so much time looking for more, that they forget the actual message of the film; love comes in different shapes and sizes, if you're Asian you can fall in love with someone who isn't, and if you're a woman you might fall in love with another one. We cannot pick and chose who we fall in love with, it just happens, love happens. Critics are always looking for something extreme and dramatic and forget about the simple and real; life isn't always a drama with explosions in every corner.
