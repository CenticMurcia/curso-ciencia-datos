Since this seems to have been largely unnoticed by most of the previous commentators, I will just add a paragraph here to point out that this movie is an adaptation, of sorts, of one of the major hits of the Viennese musical stage during the first decade of the 20th century, Oscar Straus' Ein Waltztraum/A Waltzdream. The characters' names and some of the situations are kept, as are a few of the original numbers, mostly used as background music. (Most of the actual songs are new, and not from the operetta.) You might say "So what?", especially if you have no interest in silver-age Viennese operetta. But this factoid is of interest in that, 3 years later, Paramount would try the same thing, once again with M Chevalier directed by Ernst Lubitsch, on another of the major hits of the Viennese musical stage during the first decade of the 20th century, and that time the result would be a smash success: The Merry Widow. (Replacing Miriam Hopkins with Jeannette McDonald helped a lot, as did Lehar's music, which is a lot better that Straus's.) This movie didn't do much for me - neither does A Waltzdream, frankly - but it's interesting to see a first attempt at something Paramount, Lubitsch, and Chevalier would soon do so much better.
