Moderately interesting but maddeningly slow and ultimately sleep-inducing thriller, set in the desolate highways of rural France. Starts off promisingly enough, but then it takes AGES for anything important to happen. The last 30 minutes are essentially a looooong, silent chase, and we are about 90% sure that the supposed villain is not really the villain. The remaining 10% is not enough to make the chase suspenseful. (*1/2)
