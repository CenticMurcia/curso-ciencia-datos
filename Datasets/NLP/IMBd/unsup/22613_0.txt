A subtle and complex experience. It runs as smooth as silk yet creates just enough tension to keep you on your seat. As in all great films, dialogue takes a back seat to the unspoken interaction amongst the characters who, without words, are able engage us and force us to see the universality of love, sex, betrayal and manipulation.<br /><br />It is undoubtedly rare to see a western film with all Asian characters in major roles without being stereotypical or pushing an obvious socio-cultural theme. Uncommonly (and, personally, to my relief) race seems almost coincidental and, most importantly, apolitical. Yet, inevitably, because of this rarity, we can't but be intrigued as we watch these people behave as all Americans do, yet with a grace and refinement so unique to Asian culture. It leads us to explore and to question whether or not this cultural element actually affects the way these characters relate and live their lives and if the story would otherwise have taken a different course altogether. Food for thought.<br /><br />"Charlotte" is remarkably powerful and engaging in its simplicity. Just beautiful to watch. Bravo.
