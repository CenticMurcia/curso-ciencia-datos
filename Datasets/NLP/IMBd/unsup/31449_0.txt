Evil Dead II (1987) After the huge success of the first film, Sam Raimi and<br /><br />Bruce Campbell reunite for this Quasi-Remake/Sequel. Ash and his lady<br /><br />are off on a nice trip through the woods. They stop off and rest inside an<br /><br />old cabin. Does Ash realize that he's been here before, or hasn't he? Raimi and company (armed with a bigger budget and over the top special effects) bring us the second installment of the Evil Dead series. This film focuses<br /><br />more on black humor and camp instead of shock and horror. Technically<br /><br />this film is far superior to the one that was release a few years back and in many ways it's a better film.<br /><br />What a better way to spend the night? Watch Evil Dead II with some of<br /><br />your friends and let the party begin! Leave all logic at the door. <br /><br />Remember, this is a movie, and a fun one at that.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />A++
