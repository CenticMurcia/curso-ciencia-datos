One of the few truly hilarious adult films of the 90s. Sophisticated while being silly, sly, witty, wry, insightful, ironic -- for mature people with a high degree of self-awareness, self-honesty & ability to recognize and accept the fluidity of human sexuality. Great acting: natural, unaffected, unself-conscious!
