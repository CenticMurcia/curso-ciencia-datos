I find it interesting that Chaplin himself considered this to be his most clever and witty film, because I thought it was desultory and downright boring.<br /><br />It's supposed to be a black comedy about a cad (Chaplin) who plays women like violins and then murders them, but there's little to no humour to be found here. I suppose it could be one of those films you have to see more than once to appreciate--that's happened to me before and could happen to me again; and since I like Chaplin usually, I would be more than willing to give this another shot. But until I do, my negative review stands.<br /><br />Grade: C-
