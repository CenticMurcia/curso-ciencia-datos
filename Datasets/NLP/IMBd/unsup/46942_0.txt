Another bad one I rented and watched today. Miss Buffy should have blonded her hair again to at least attempt to look younger for the part portrayed. While on the subject of hair, what was the story with Baldwin's hair toupee stylist? How many toupees were used in this movie? They weren't toupees? Omigawd ... egads if they weren't.<br /><br />Sarah didn't come across very well in this movie, which made the "romance" unbelievable. It was if she was forcing her lines and forcing herself to tolerate being in this role and even being around Baldwin. As a result, to me the romance relationship just didn't have heart or even lust. It had no click.<br /><br />Scenes like where the old rich gal tells Baldwin to marry the hussy after Sarah got drunk at the elite high-societal gathering and made a twit of herself in front of everyone ... really rankled my chain. This kind of behavior is now acceptable? If the old woman was being facetious, the delivery of lines did not carry that element.<br /><br />I don't believe this movie would be good even for the teenage group. I think this movie had a decent story, but the poor casting, dreadful and inappropriate music scores, forced lines (and forced acting), horrid clothing no teenager would be caught dead in, bad makeup (sorry Sarah, but au natural neckline without makeup made you look again too old for this part), and a bad hair stylist took away from anything redeemable in this movie.<br /><br />Once again, the one good thing going for this movie was the art done on the DVD jacket cover. I recommend that it be taken off the shelves.
