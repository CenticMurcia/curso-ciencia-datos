I had the misfortune of viewing this film on the first day of a course on "Media and Democracy." Based on the fact that the professor accepted everything portrayed in it as fact, I dropped the course that afternoon. I have never seen such a hopelessly biased film in my life. As a 19-year veteran of the US Army, I can tell you that the atrocities alleged in this film did not occur. Our troops do not shoot bound prisoners in the back of the head. We do not indiscriminately shell civilian residential areas. The film's most absurd claims, such as that US forces used some sort of laser weapons against Panamanian civilians, don't even bear refuting. The fact that such a blatant piece of anti-military propaganda won an Academy Award says far more about the makeup of the Academy than it does about the film.
