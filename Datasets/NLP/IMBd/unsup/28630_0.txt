OK, so in my opinion this is either the most brilliant satire on the action genre done by those who write and direct in it, or it is the worst possible action piece of crap since Segal's Into the Sun.<br /><br />Either way you should be laughing your ass off.<br /><br />The plot is so obvious in the way action films are. All the actors appear to have taken acting lessons from Van Damme for this one (wooden as chopsticks). People have the BEST\worst lines ever with such gems as "They're using flares!" in a fearful way.<br /><br />I am surprised nobody else thinks this was a straight satire where the best way to make fun of the genre is to do it without smiling. I mean, they used stock footage of Backdraft and Top Gun. This from the director of Segal's Submerged and the script writer from Street Fighter! I think people should have seen Eddie Griffin and not expect him to be a Lorenzo Lamas. His acting is as dumb and overdone as any of the greats in the action drama.<br /><br />So please, consider laughing at this one instead of pissing about it being a poor action movie. ALL action moves are poor displays of cinema anyway (minus Bruce Willis films). They are great because they are cheesy, and this my friends takes the cake and kicks a grenade into it.
