This movie was probably the worst I have ever seen. It doesn't help it that it makes high school seem like a horrible place full of cliques and a mean, prissy, "boss" figure that runs the whole school. It also makes the it seem a bit to nice and immature. Honestly I don't see to many sophomores, or any year student, screaming OMG!! NO WAY!!in the halls every day. Also the whole "stupid cheer leader" thing isn't exactly realistic in high school, maybe try a few swears and they'd be heading down the right path in a typical high school. If you honestly want to see this just telling you that the obvious lip syncing done by the actress that plays Yasmin is really the cherry on top of a horrible movie. Don't forget the racial stereotypes.<br /><br />My final comment is don't watch it unless you want a good laugh at how stupid something is.
