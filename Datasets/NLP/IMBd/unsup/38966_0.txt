This movie was not funny because of its poor treatment of the subject matter.<br /><br />It would be difficult to make a funny movie about the KKK and, without trivializing the evil of the KKK, romantic obsessions have killed a lot more people. Better movies like Strangers on a Train succeed at depicting killing your spouse because comic moments are balanced with an authentic appreciation of the horror.<br /><br />Also horrifying, is the number of people who think this movie had a positive message and think the real life couple enjoyed a happy ending. Trying to kill someone is not a sign of love but of selfish attachment. As Gloria Steinem said: love is wanting the best for another person, romance is just wanting the other person.
