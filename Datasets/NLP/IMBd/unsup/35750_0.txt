Literally the worst piece of crap movie I have ever seen, and I have seen Glitter. That is the only valid thing that I have to say but I have to reach ten lines to post this comment considering no one has anything but nice things to say about this axe wound of a movie. In summation, some chick gets kidnapped by some crazy idiot with a bad haircut and is made to clean pans. Apparently she also has some kind of a daughter who she is trying to find. Anyhow, its not even worth my time to attempt to retell the rest of the story, so in brief, rocks fall and everybody dies. Highlight of the movie: you get to half see some chicks boobs while captor guy whacks off.
