Although there are a couple interesting characters and good production value, the story is lousy. I stuck around for Nick Stahl's storyline, which was interesting but ultimately frustrating. Rory Cochrane's character was interesting as well, although only about 10 minutes of the movie is devoted to it. The writer couldn't make 90 minutes of movie out of these more interesting characters, so he chose the expedient love-story route.<br /><br />The music is actually pretty good. The acting is good from what I can tell, although lousy story makes the performances a moot point. <br /><br />Adam Goldberg's character is annoying, and basically a reprise or a conglomeration of his other urban/disco Jewish caricatures. <br /><br />The bottom line is if you are interested in music or the entertainment business and have low expectations and 90 minutes to kill, then there are worse ways to spend your time than by watching Sunset Strip.
