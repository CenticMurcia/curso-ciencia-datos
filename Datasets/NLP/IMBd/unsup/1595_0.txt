I've heard a lot of complaints about not filming this masterpiece in color. Watch it again, and this time look at the beautiful use of light and shadow and the depth of atmosphere, especially in the night scenes. I don't believe that these effects could have been achieved with the strong lights needed for color at that time. All we need for the Olympus Ball scene is our imagination. Maybe the lack of color made us feel what was going on during that strange waltz.
