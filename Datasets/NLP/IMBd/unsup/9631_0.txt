Great story, very well written by James Ponsoldt. Whoever assembled the cast did a great job.<br /><br />It must have cost plenty as there are some well known names here.<br /><br />The interaction between everyone seems to flow perfectly. I can relate to some of the scenes in the movie from my earlier days<br /><br />at High School ( the toilette paper in the trees etc.) Nick Nolte should get recognition internationally from "Off the Black" as should Ponsoldt.<br /><br />Off the Black will do well at the box office if promoted. It has something of interest for everyone and is a GREAT story. I hope it does not get lost due to its lack of murder, overt sex, blood and gore. What this movie promises AND delivers is something teenagers and adults of all ages can relate to. Go see "Off the Black" and "Apocalypto" on the same weekend and I am certain you will feel better after the Ponsoldt Movie.
