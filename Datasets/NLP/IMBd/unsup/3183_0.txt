No, this isn't the biopic of Jim Bowen & Tony Green but a good comedy with dual roles for Caine & Moore. Sometimes its good because its funny, sometimes its so bad its good. The pairing of the two British acting giants is worth 90 minutes of anyones time. This movie tries to hark back to the classic British comedies of old & succeeds in parts. If you take this film in the spirit it was made then you should be laughing & groaning in equal measures!
