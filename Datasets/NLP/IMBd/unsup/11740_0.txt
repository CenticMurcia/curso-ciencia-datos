The movie was getting a lot of buzz everywhere I went at the Cleveland film festival. For the most part, it definitely deserved it. The film is very entertaining, well acted, and more or less well-written.<br /><br />The oddest part, however, was that everyone kept talking about how plans are in the works to make an American version of this film. All I could think of in response to this news is...the American version already exists! It's called Super Troopers. An American knock-off of a Swedish knock-off of an American film! Only in Hollywood.<br /><br />Strange Hollywood "good ideas" aside, the film is a lot of fun even if the plot is unoriginal and predictable. See this version before the US cranks out the 3rd generation wannabe.
