At an apartment complex in Hollywood, a couple named Nell (Angela Bettis) and her husband Steven (Brent Roam) move in as they meet some friendly and not-too-friendly neighbors. It was once a place for the stars to live along time ago until weird stuff began happening with mysterious disappearances years ago. A homicidal maniac uses weapons of any kind from drill to hammer begins killing off some of the residents one by bloody one and secrets from the past are coming back.<br /><br />Co-starring Sherri Moon Zombie, Juliet Landau, Christopher Doyle and Adam Weisman, this is a nifty reimagining of the low budget "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" wannabe known as "The Toolbox Murders" but this one is directed by horror maestro Tobe Hooper. Hooper really admired the original as the best rip-off of his masterpiece he'd ever seen and decided to update it for a new generation. I gotta say how pleasantly surprised i was at this new version from an artist as he improved on the material very nicely. Much like the original it has it's use of buzz-saws, drills, hammering and gore galore but very done well! the acting is quite decent and the story has much improved.<br /><br />It's an old-school style remake that i highly recommend.
