Like some others here I had seen this movie once many years ago, I was very young and came upon it at least 30 minutes into the film. Over the years I forgot the title of it, but never the plot and Rod Steiger and of course Dolores. I never saw it TV again. I would ask people about it describing the plot but no one seem to remember it.It wasn't until I was looking over Steiger's filmography that I found out the title. I bought the DVD and watched last night and memories of years and years came back over me.The music the photography, the hopelessness. So beautiful, so sad.If you have not seen it yet, please do so. One of the most forgotten movies and one of the best performances Rod Steiger ever gave.
