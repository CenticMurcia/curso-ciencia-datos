This movie is great. An absolute ten. It could be considered somewhat boring the first part of the movie, but the only time I think of that is when I watch it with friends, and they say "isn't anything going to happen?"...you really should watch b-horror alone or with friends with the same taste. Anyway, the gore scenes in the movie are innovative and well executed. George Eastman is perfect as the beast. The music is awesome too, by the way.
