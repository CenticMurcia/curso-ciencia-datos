Yes, ol' John Carradine is back, playing yet another crotchety old coot, this time in Vampire Men of the Lost Planet, aka Horror of the Blood Monsters, aka about 57 other titles. This one is a classic. It's a vampire movie! It's a space movie! It's a caveman movie! It's 3 treats in 1!! In the first part of this chilling opus, an annoying narrator waxes poetically about the vampire culture on earth, as we watch a bunch of half-doped vampires attack some stage extras with toothpicks instead of teeth. Then, we are whisked to Mission Control, run, apparently, only by 1 man and a woman with lots of cleavage. Then we see our plucky astronaut team, lead by the irratible Mr. Carradine, who obviously needed some ruffage. Then they land in the middle of a Filipino caveman moovie, where they help the good cave people fight the bad cave people...sort of. The "special effects" are the real eye candy here: most impressive is the Chromatic Radiation, which changes the film's color from blue to yellow to green to whatever gell the cameraman chose at the time. Watch quickly for an elephant with carpeting glued to it's hide, several wandering water buffalo, a couple of saw-toothed iguanas, furry bat people who fly on strings, lobster people who attack with claws, pre-historic midgets who attack with bows....the list goes on and on. This is Roger Corman at his worst. MooCow says check it out for a hoot, but don't say you weren't warned!<br /><br />:=8)
