I admit it, I am a huge Lucy Lawless fan, and even I was nervous about this movie. I have been waiting for this since February. I knew the whole concept of LOCUSTS taking over the world was a bit far fetched, but, I was willing to go for the ride. And I ended up enjoying it. :) Honestly, much to my surprise.<br /><br />I could go with the main plot, bugs devouring the crops. And somehow, Lucy made me believe that a giant bug zapper would work. In the end, I thought Lucy did a great job. She was not over the top, and did not slip into her 'Xena' mode. Lucy played the role strong, but not overly butch. Lucy took this role because she thought it would be fun, and "good Sunday night fare". She did not take it because as one person has said 'she needs the money'. Well, I know for a fact, that is not true. Lucy chooses her projects based on things other then money. <br /><br />All in all, I thought this was a good movie, and held up better then I thought it would. If you can allow yourself to get into it, you would see that the acting was good, the plot can be worked with, and Lucy got mostly naked for us! What more could you want? Xx
