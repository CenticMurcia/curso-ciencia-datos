Read my one line summary. Out loud, if it helps. More than once, if you need to. Do you honestly believe that it can be spoken, and that individual retaining just a smidgen of dignity, and continue to be respected? I wish I could claim that it is the only of its kind in this. Oh, how I would love to claim that this does not deserve its low rating... as I type this, it is #82 on the Bottom 100 on the site. This is irritating and intolerable from start to finish. No, I am not the intended viewer for this, but I maintain that this isn't likely to appeal to all that many. Simply put, unless you find chimps adorable and hilarious, there's nothing in this for you. It's well-trained, I'll give 'em that. I frankly wanted Ed to go nuts and kill everyone, which may be because the last 8 days, I've watched the Halloween films. If this is for children, then what's with the numerous crude jokes that are not appropriate for them? The material is atrocious, utterly devoid of creativity and the delivery is outrageously poor. If you laugh even once during this, it will probably be a reflex, or one of the kind that comes from a desperation that you can no longer contain, that you must *express*. The lead is annoying, and every "acting performance" is horrible. Jim Caviezel? Are you kidding me? Every character is one-note and stereotypical, and that girl is ridiculously precocious. The cartoon sound effects and "goofy music" try way too hard, and it winds up being embarrassing. Editing and cinematography are unimpressive. This mess manages to squeeze in every clich√© in the book. I recommend this audience-insulting crap solely to those who have no taste, or those who *have to* see for themselves how awful it is. Your movie sucks, Matt. 1/10
