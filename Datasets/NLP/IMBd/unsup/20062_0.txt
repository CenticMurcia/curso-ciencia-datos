Narco<br /><br />Highly promoted by the young and trendy Guillaume Canet, I wasn't overwhelmed of joy when I decided to check this movie. First film of a French talented duo, it tales the weird story of a narcoleptic guy, victim of his illness, his greedy wife, and die hard buddy, Lenny Bar. His only redemption will be only found in his talent of writing comic booksÂ… But somebody has already spotted this skill, and try to abuse his work. First good thing, everything is fast and good. The humor is like the Simpsons' : sharp, efficient, precise and numerous, as numerous as the bullets shot in the bull eyes of the human behavior. The actors are tremendous, funny, and cool, especially the very good and talented humorist Benoit Poelvoorde. I have bought the story and laughed so much. Please do rent this comedy classic for the next decade.
