It's really hard to describe this movie, there is something about it that cannot be explained with the script, acting, or directing. It must be just magic. Few movies got it, this one has it. Not everyone get's it, but if you do, you will love it. The characters, the story, everything.<br /><br />After a while I entirely forgot I was watching a film and just got totally absorbed by the screenplay while developing a deep sympathy for each and everyone of the characters. It must be ages ago when I watched a movie that touched me so deeply like this one and I was surprised when I saw the low rating on IMDb. It's a shame, this masterpiece has really deserved more. <br /><br />For viewer who look for something that is nicely polished, Catwalk Actors and Popcorn Feeling, don't bother. This isn't it.<br /><br />But if you like films with a strong emotional/melancholic atmosphere that are touching your heart without any of the ingredients that are used for "Hollywood Mass Production Romantics" then the chances are good that "Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself" will give you a wonderful experience beyond words and you might loose so many tears that you become almost dehydrated in the last part of it. So incredibly touching and powerful I probably haven't seen it before...I was blown away.<br /><br />Before you watch this be prepared to go into the deep deep river. A beautiful one. Thank you for making this masterpiece.
