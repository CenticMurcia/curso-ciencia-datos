I'm a huge fan of 80's horror. And to me, the cheesier the better. But this is a flat out terrible movie. Silent Night Deadly Night was a great flick with some very decent acting and enjoyable kill scenes. But this sequel is damn near unwatchable. The first 40 minutes (almost half the movie) is just clips from part one, which makes this a terrible viewing if you try and watch the films back to back. And the acting is bad, not even an enjoyable bad, just nails on a chalkboard unbearable kinda bad.<br /><br />Yes, the movie does deliver on some good death scenes...late in the film. But getting to them is a nightmare. The back and forth dialogue between the doc and Ricky is just flat out retarded, Eric Freeman could possibly be the worst actor ever. Even the lame ass actor who read his line off his hand in Blood Feast was better.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say pass if you're thinking about watching this. It's not enjoyable on any level.
