An absolutely terrible film, the characters are all so lovely & good I wanted to be sick, Alan Bennet portrays a rose tinted view of the world and although for a bit of light relief I don't mind optimistic films from time to time 'the history boys' takes this concept too far for my liking.<br /><br />From the first few minutes the film is just annoying to watch, there are some fine actors but the overall optimistic & downright annoying feeling simply makes the film unwatchable.<br /><br />The lack lustre & unimaginative plot seems to go nowhere very slowly the only redeeming feature I can think of is the soundtrack which contains some classic 80's tunes.
