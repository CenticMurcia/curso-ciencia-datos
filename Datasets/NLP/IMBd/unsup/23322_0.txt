HOOOO Boy, did they bite the bullet on this one! I can really only comment on the first 20 minutes of this abysmal film, as that's all my wife and I could stand - we were laughing so hard at the God-awful acting! Is Eugene Levy having a hard time, that he should have to stoop to appearing in trash like this? I would rather coat myself with fresh blood and swim through the Amazon River lengthwise (it's infested with Red Bellied Piranha). Don't they make enough money from their questionably silly investments already? Why did they have to butcher the film industry with this example of celluloid pollution? This movie sucks WORSE than a Barney Frank Fan Club Convention! The only nice thing I can say about those two is that it's a good thing that triplets didn't run in their family! This film is just a 2 hour, slightly STUPIDER version of Full House!
