Dick Powell , in this film, is the unlikely, subject of a would-be love triangle with Gale Page and Ann Sheridan. Unlikely because he resembles David Byrne from the Talking Heads and isn't exactly the type of guy you'd think Page and Sheridan would fight over.<br /><br />That being said, the real reason to watch this movie is Ann Sheridan, who is beautiful, but gorgeous.<br /><br />All in all Naughty But Nice is good, but ok.
