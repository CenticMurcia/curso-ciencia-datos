In 1992, when "Sneakers" came out, the Internet was just getting off the ground. What they portray in this movie seems more like what one would expect to find in a 21st century movie. Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier play hackers, with an entire syndicate made up of Dan Aykroyd, David Strathairn and River Phoenix. Following a few strange incidents, the whole group finds itself involved in a vast, bizarre scheme. The movie isn't totally easy to follow, but the occasional comedic bits make up for that (namely the Scrabble scene, the voice recording, and the end). Not any kind of masterpiece, but worth watching nonetheless, what with its mixture of suspense and goofiness.
