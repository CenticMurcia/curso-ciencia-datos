I don't understand the whining about plotholes and other negativity because this is simply a great film with a nice reference to Invasion of the Body Snatcher, with Donald Sutherland in optima forma! All the acting was good, especially the relatively unknown Thal. The supporting cast was simply splendid, I really enjoyed seeing those familiar faces, especially the geek scientist (I had seen him as a redneck cop in The Client) and the black actor (from The Thing). The special effects were also masterfully done, considering the modest budget for this film. I also loved the story, and for those who think it's unoriginal, consider it's borrowed from an early Robert A. Heinlein novel!<br /><br />I wish more sci fi fans would know this movie because it deserves a lot more fame than it got. But this way, it's a very nice cult hit which has an appeal of it's own. I have enjoyed this movie twice and want to see it a 3rd time on DVD even tho it has no extra's. It's just a wannahave for my collection.<br /><br />I give it 9/10, there wasn't simply anything wrong with this movie as far as I could see!
