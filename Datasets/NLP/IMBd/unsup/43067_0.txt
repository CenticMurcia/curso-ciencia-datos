As a real cinephile nothing upsets me more than a movie changing genres midway through, thankfully few directors are foolhardy enough to try this. The movie starts off as a pretty good noir, you get all the wisecracking, fast talk, seediness and violence that you want. Bob Mitchum is no Dick Powell in Fairwell my Lovely, or Ralph Meeker in Kiss Me Deadly; but he still manages to do a fairly good job. When the film moves scene to Morro's Lodge, south-of-the-border, the movie becomes a classic farce, and we get sheer comedy from Vincent Price dealing out all his favourite Shakesperianisms.<br /><br />***** spoiler******** <br /><br />when the launch sank, and i saw it coming, my jaw just dropped, as well as my spirits, it was beyond ludicrous <br /><br />***** end of spoiler********<br /><br />If ever you want to see a true hijacking of a movie by an actor watch Vincent Price in His Kind of Woman. Its first rate comedy and very enjoyable, but you feel rather like a customer in a restaurant whose been presented with their main course and desert on the same place - nauseated. Cue Raymond Burr as mob boss Nick Ferraro, hopelessly trying to inject nastiness yet palpably unable to deflect the comic trajectory of Vincent Price. <br /><br />***** spoiler ********<br /><br />The scene where the mob are trying to inject Mitchum with brain-wiping drugs, when he is moments away from rescue is hilarious in a truly post-ironic manner. You really want to roll on the floor, the way the it drags on and on, how many times will Mitchum keep the needle away, will the scene last another half an hour??<br /><br />***** end of spoiler ********<br /><br />I suppose if you really like to laugh AT movies rather than WITH them then you've really got to get this. For myself I don't like to laugh at movies, i haven't really grasped camp aesthetic, and i don't really want to. I don't like to write negative reviews, so I'll end positively. If you really want to see a nice Mitchum noir, get hold of Angel Face, such a great movie. For hardcore noir enthusiasts the first half an hour is really worth viewing, then turn the TV off.
