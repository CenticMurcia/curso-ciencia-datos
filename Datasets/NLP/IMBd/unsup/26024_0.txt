At the end of the day,i have seen worse,but also a lot better,Facinelli and Regan do well in their roles,and for Christian Slater,he yet again made this movie worthwhile for me,despite the fact you only hear his voice.It doesn't really get your immediate attention,but if you be patient i think you will agree that this movie is actually worth watching.I particularly enjoyed the scene outside of Regans house,smart effects with the flash grenades,i gave this movie a rating of 7/10,which i feel it deserves.I read a comment from another user that has the opinion that Christian Slater cant act!Which is an insult to myself,i own every Movie that Christian Slater is in except Name Of The Rose!And i can ASSURE you that this man is a Very talented actor.
