I use to be a big fan of Michael Moore in his early documentary days. He has now turned into a Socialist nut case. So nothing has happened good in the eight years of the Bush administration? Nothing!?!?!? For a man that flies first class on his trips, America has worked out nice for him.<br /><br />How could anyone vote for a party that wants to "Spread the wealth around"<br /><br />If everyone had to wake up at 6 in the morning and put in 8 hours of work, let's go "Spread the wealth around" When I and maybe 30 million people like I go to work on a Friday that has to hold up this economy, while a majority of the rest of the country sits on their butts and does nothing and has more children. Yeah, America is pretty fair, play by the rules and you get screwed.<br /><br />Hey Michael, put down the taco too.
