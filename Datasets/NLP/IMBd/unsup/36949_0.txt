Went to the movie expecting a funny comedy and was disappointed. Where the movie set up a scene where a joke was expected, what was offered was weak and flat. The whole movie had a been there, done that feel with no real saving graces except the female lead, she was good.<br /><br />The rest of the actors were okay, but nothing special. This was the first movie in a long time that I was sorry I went to. The script seemed to need another once over and a lot of the scenes should have been done again.<br /><br />The best part was the fact that all of the students in Berkley went into San Francisco for fun and frolic.<br /><br />The best and one of the few funny parts came at the very end and had nothing to do with the story.<br /><br />The whole movie had a "John Hughes" 1985 feel to it which may explain the "Sixteen Candles" and "Breakfast Club" posters which pop up in the movie. This film is more like them than "American Pie", but not as good as the 1980's films.
