Movies have changed in many ways since this was made. The Adventures of Robin Hood is one of just a few oldies that I can watch. The casting, costuming and sets are all incredible. Its a good thing that this was one of the first movies shot in Technicolor, as that process holds up really well as you can see in the new ca 2003 DVD release, unlike Eastman color films that have all gone to hell. Fantastic greens, purples etc.. make the movie come alive again. Great action and swordplay along with real chemistry between deHavilland and Flynn makes it easy to see why this is on the top 250 movies list right here on IMDB.
