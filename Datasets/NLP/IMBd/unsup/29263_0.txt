After professional thief Jack Tulliver (Snipes) and his crew pull off a meticulously planned armoured car heist, they are ambushed by another group of thieves, who kill most of Tulliver's crew but are unable to kill Tulliver before he escapes. After carjacking Sgt. Kelly Anders' (Outhwaite) sedan, he makes a getaway, but leaves Anders under suspicion from her fellow officers. Meanwhile, Tulliver must save a team member who has been captured by a sadistic millionaire who is in charge of the group which ambushed Tulliver. All of this reveals what is in the case, and why it is under such demand. Despite action star Wesley Snipes heading the film, 7 Seconds was a failure in the DVD market which it was directly released to, and received bad reviews, described as "drivel" [1] with "sloppy screen writing"
