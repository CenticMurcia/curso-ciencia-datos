A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge begins with the Walsh Family, who has just moved into the old Thompson house, where Freddy Kruger did his dirty deeds in the first film. Freddy Kruger is still very much alive, and not only is he still haunting people's dreams, but now he is trying to get into the real world through the body of Jessie Walsh, a teenage boy who can't figure out if he is really being attacked by Freddy or if he is just flat out losing his mind.<br /><br />This is a very good movie that has some great qualities to it. The lighting is extremely creepy and amazing, even more so than in the original A Nightmare On Elm Street. There are several great nods to the original, in particular one where Jesse finds Nancy Thompson's diary and reads bits from it about Freddy Kruger. And, like always, Englund does a wonderful job at playing the frightening dream-slasher.<br /><br />However, there are also some major flaws in this movie as well. The first flaw, and it is a big one, is the main character. The character Jesse acts so incredibly girly and homosexual that it is distracting and annoying. The characters are poorly developed, making it hard to feel sorry for them when they are attacked by Freddy. This movie breaks a lot of the rules of the first film, to the point where it would be hard to watch them back-to-back.<br /><br />In the long run, this is a very scary movie, and one of the best sequels. Definitely worth watching, just don't expect it to be near as good as the first Nightmare movie.
