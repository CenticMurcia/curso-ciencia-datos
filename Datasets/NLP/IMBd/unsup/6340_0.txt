One of the most mind-bending and thought provoking films of recent years. I have to start my review with some kind of reasoning for why I have given this movie an 8 out of 10, as i will proceed to give it a raving review... Its the directors first film, and as his first film I have reserved the 9 out of 10 and 10 out of 10 for his next two films (pending he keeps putting the same amount of passion into his future work).<br /><br />The films strength comes from a strong plot, elegant directing, and solid acting. Be forewarned, "Limbo" is not film for weak-minded people, nor will you be able to even comprehend the plot if you are brain-dead; however, if you value a film that does not need excessive movie additives (i.e. naked women, sex, huge explosions, and car chases), in order to be extremely engagingÂ… "Limbo" is dead on point, and not to worry, you will still get your fix.<br /><br />I await future films and applaud Ikimi's work. <br /><br />Taheehee Chimps
