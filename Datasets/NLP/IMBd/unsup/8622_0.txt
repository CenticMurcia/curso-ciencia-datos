First let me say, that I usually don't like sequels (Aladdin sequels - Lion King Sequels - Ugh!). Few of them come close to the standard of their original. Disney's "Cinderella III: A Twist In Time" is an exception.<br /><br />The story is very well crafted including homage to just about everything from the first. "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True" (which was a typical quickie sequel - a total waste of time dud) is appropriately never mentioned. The voices are well cast and the animation is movie quality - not a TV show rehash like the extremely disappointing "Princess Tales videos" (shame! shame!) Granted, my child is three and she doesn't know the difference between the bad quality and good quality stuff - but I do and Daddy has to watch these over and over again with his little princess.<br /><br />Without giving away too much, some complain that the evil pumpkin coach scene in this one is a little bit on the scary side. Though my child (again, she's 3) was a bit scared at first, she was excited by it, and Cinderella's comment at the end of the scene made both she and I laugh out loud together. Now she watches that scene again and again.<br /><br />Especially fine performances by the deliciously wicked stepmother, Lady Tremaine and her daughters Drusilla and Anastasia. The opening song is hysterical when it gets them and Drusilla's every sarcastic remark still makes me smile ("A stick... let's beat her with it." / "Oh... I wonder if it fits?"). The music is very good in this one as well.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that they axed the other mouse characters besides Jaq and Gus an Bruno is also missing.<br /><br />But for the money, it is an excellent ride.
