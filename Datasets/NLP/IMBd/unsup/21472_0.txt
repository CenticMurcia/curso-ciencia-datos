She was dominant! In my opinion, she is in the top five of all time great actresses. Her presence captivates you. There are actors and actresses that you will watch any movie they are in. She is one of the handful.<br /><br />The supporting cast was terrific as well. However, this movie was all Crawford. Most of her movies have slipped into relative obscurity today. Its unfortunate, because she was on the same level as Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis. The problem with Joan was that she never appeared in a legendary movie. Every star from that era had a movie which made legends. Hepburn had the Philadelphia's story, and Davis had all about eve. Mildred Pierce was a great movie in my opinion, However, its not highly regarded like the other classics. Enjoy this movie for superb acting and a lesson in why warmth and honesty should never be neglected.
