A quickie flick to cash in on the success of the original, Freddy's Revenge suffers from lack of originality and purpose. The only reason's to watch this movie are for some carnage and because of Robert Englund's gleeful performance. If there is one constant that has always been strong in this series, it has been Robert Englund. The rest of the cast is basic horror movie fodder. There is a very creepy dream sequence at the beginning that plays into the fear of where that yellow bus really takes you and a real fun pool party, nightmare style. There could have been a really good movie about how a person transforms in high school. There is a start in this movie, but then all that happens is killing of the brain cell kind.
