A charming romance for the first season and a half. The writing is superb and likeable actors made this a pleasant series to watch.<br /><br />Mary Page Keller in particular was magnificent to help make up for a wooden Matthew Laurance as the other lead. The supporting cast of Chris Lemmon and Alison LaPlaca are even better actors than the leads and Jody Thelen and Eileen Sorkin were effectively cartoonish contributors.<br /><br />The series takes a romantic stroll from Ben (Laurance) and Laura's (Keller) first meeting through the ups and downs of courtship. And this is a very delightful courtship indeed! Unfortunately near the end of the second season, the series veered completely away from the last sense of reality. Great stories and good laughs.<br /><br />I wish I could get this series on video. When will Nick or TVLand start airing this wonderful program? (Please!)
