This version of Legend of Sleepy Hollow has all the ingredients of a classic. The mood is set in the beginning through music and a great opening scene...I make it a point to watch in the autumn between Halloween and Thanksgiving...I guess you need to have grown up in the 80's to really appreciate the feel of this particular version...Great Family Film and stands on the ability and confidence of fine acting...even in the quirky monologue...This film is getting rave reviews from at least 20 or 30 of my family and friends. I suggest anyone reading this review to go and get yourself a copy on the VHS format with the original cover...I don't know why they didn't print any DVD version yet...it is worth a view either way.
