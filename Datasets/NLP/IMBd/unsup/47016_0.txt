This film is similar to Jurassic Park II, in that the computer graphics make the movie. A campy film that doesn't take itself too seriously is OK in my book, but this one is too campy by far.<br /><br />As in the first film, the plot makes no sense, the acting leaves one with no feeling of tension. The additional of a cute kid is not helping, as it did not for "Blue Brothers 2000" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom".<br /><br />If you're an action movie lover like me, you will be tempted to try this film. But only those with the highest tolerance for letting go and enjoying the wild, stupid rile will enjoy it. And don't take along your SO looking for a romantic comedy.<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- Those who didn't mind the lowbrow but punched-up action in "Jurassic Park II", "The Mummy", "The Mask", "Batman II", "Mars Attacks", etc.<br /><br />-- Computer graphics afficionados who want to try to figure out how they did all the special effects<br /><br />I regret I must give "The Mummy Returns" a 2 out of 10.
