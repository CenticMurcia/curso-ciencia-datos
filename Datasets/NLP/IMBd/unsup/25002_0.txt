Yep. Mulder is gone from the x-files for an entire season. Nothing Important Happened Today begins the post-Mulder era of the X-Files. A conspiracy is covering all the evidence up from the season 8 finale and Doggett is mad about it.<br /><br />To start off, I found it very interesting that we get shots of both Doggett and Reyes waking up topless in their respective beds. If there is supposed to be some symbolism there, I'm missing it.<br /><br />Cary Elwes, a favorite actor of mine from "The Princess Bride", comes to the show for a few guest appearances. He does a fine job as the sneaky, slimy, A.D. Brad Follmer.<br /><br />I feel sorry for Doggett in this episode. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is telling Doggett to drop his case of investigating Kersh and trying to find Mulder. They just treat him badly and he doesn't deserve it. He's just doing his job. It's a very abrupt about-face by everyone, and it leaves Doggett confused.<br /><br />Reyes finally agrees to go along with Doggett so that he's not completely alone. Then Skinner, who appears to be the most adamant about Doggett dropping this case, surprisingly goes along with Doggett to the plant. He can't seem to make up his mind.<br /><br />There is a scene of Reyes finding Mulder's pencils in the ceiling of the x-files office. It's a nice tribute. Also, Scully needs to get a new mobile for William. That thing squeaks too much when it turns.<br /><br />Overall, Nothing Important Happened Today is a good episode with the new x-files team, and Scully kind of tagging along. However, the new Super Soldier angle doesn't do it for me, and prevents this episode from being something extra special.
