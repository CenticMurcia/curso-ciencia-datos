This is an awful,wretched,painful,terrible film, ranking second only to the excremental smear that is "September Dawn" on the list of inept cinematic portrayals of LDS history. Questions of history aside, it's just horribly made, with cinematography that looks like an 8mm home movie, and acting that wouldn't pass in a junior high school play.<br /><br />The ending sequence is one of the most hilariously ludicrous in movie history.Unlike the utterly worthless "September Dawn" (which I cannot stress enough may be the worst film ever made), "Brigham" has some value as a sort "Plan 9 From Outer Space" type curiosity.If you want to laugh at the silliness of it all,and see Joseph Smith portrayed as Bull Shannon,it may be worth your time.
