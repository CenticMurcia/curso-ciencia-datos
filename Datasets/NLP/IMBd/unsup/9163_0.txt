Whenever a film maker goes short of ideas about Colombia, he resorts to the drug theme. This is a permanent clich√© in the movie industry and it is easy to forgive if it is the sloppy work of an outsider. But when a Colombian director needs to go to these extremes of bad taste to broadcast (once again) the false notion that his country is a narcotics paradise, you can only feel sorry for him. What a narrow mind and what a scarce imagination.<br /><br />I only hope that the next time someone uses the name of our country in the title of a film or any artistic work, it be with the purpose of honoring it and not as a commercial gimmick. And yes, that it be of any artistic value.
