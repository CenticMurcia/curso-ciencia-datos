Terrible movie. I will be the first to admit it, but you have to admire Frank Gerrish. He's a great Utah actor who excels in any part that he is given, regardless of the movie's quality. His role spares this movie from being a bad memory. The school scenes are filmed at the Salt Lake Community College and our main actress is a professor, but for some reason it is more like a high-school.<br /><br />The screenplay is terrible. Give me the screenplay and give me Frank and you will have a conclusion to a trilogy worthy of. . .well, at least worthy of watching.<br /><br />The direction of this movie is. . .to put it nicely, lacking. But honestly, the poor guy was working with what he was given. For a low budget the directing is tolerable, the screenplay still a disaster, and the characters are terrible. With the exception of our hero and Frank Gerrish. If they were given better lines. . .Give me the power to remake this movie. It's ripe. It's asking to be parodied in its absurdity but seeing its potential stops me from burning it out of my memory. <br /><br />I hereby announce my plans to begin production of Copyrighted Name: Redux. Who cares if they killed of Frank Gerrish's characters. If Uma Thurman can dig her way out of a grave then so can Frank.
