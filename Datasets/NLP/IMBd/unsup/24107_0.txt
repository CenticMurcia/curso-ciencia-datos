I believe that Blake Edwards' monumental comedic accomplishment were with the very talented Peter Sellers. I believe that his most enjoyable role was in the film titled "The Return of the Pink Panther" in which former Chief Inspector Dreyfuss escapes from a Mental Institution to kill Clusoe and to build a Doomsday Machine. Even the latest production of the "Son of the Pink Panther" does not come close to the original series, and certainly the acting is not up to par with new Italian comedian, nor by the aged Herbert Lohm. <br /><br />I give the "Son of the Pink Panther" a thumbs down for its lack of originality and overt repetition of the same routines from Peter Seller's performances, God rest his Soul!
