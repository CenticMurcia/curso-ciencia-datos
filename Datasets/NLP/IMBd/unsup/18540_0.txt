Dumb! But almost entertaining.<br /><br />The scientist in me couldn't help but analyze the gator's behavior. If the mutant gator was cold-blooded, it was moving far too fast for far too long. And it was eating far, far, far too much for a cold blooded animal. For an animal that size, after chomping down four or five people, it would hole up in its lair to digest for quite a while. If it was warm blooded, that would explain how Wally Gator's badboy cousin could be moving around so much so fast as warm blooded animals have a much better system of dispersing metabolically generated waste heat than cold blooded animals do. But that still wouldn't explain why it was hungry so much. No warm blooded animal that size would want to eat that much. And this critter was eating and eating and eating and eating and eating and eating and eating and eating and eating... What a glutton! With an appetite like that, it would have the entire island depopulated of humans within a week or so.<br /><br />The ending of the movie was kind of whacky. The two surviving characters are standing at the back of a vehicle, about to depart onto their separate ways, and they're all smiles and cracking jokes to each other. What the...? You would think they would be still in a state of emotional shock and feeling depressed about the horrific loss of their friends... But no, they're feeling rather happy. I couldn't help but suspect they were on prozac or something.<br /><br />Should you bother watching this movie? Only if you enjoy seeing a mutant gator eating and eating and eating and eating and eating and eating...<br /><br />One dead hoof down for using pathetically dumb science to the point of absurdity and annoyance. One dead hoof up for having such a cartoony monster, which i have an embarrassing weakness for.
