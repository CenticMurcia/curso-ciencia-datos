I've been a fan of BOTTOM and YOUNG ONES for years, since I was 11 to be exact (Im 20 now!!) and I hadnt seen nothing until I saw the BOTTOM LIVE videos!!!!<br /><br />Okay the second one was a wee bit iffy for me but still I loved it!! The parrot was funny especially when everyone applauded and Ade says "Thats right give the lump of plastic an applause!!".<br /><br />The way they improvise when something goes wrong (missing lines- Rik's speciality, tripping over wires, doors flying open) is PURE CLASSIC! The improvisation bits always crack me up, leaving me in utter stitches!!!<br /><br />Go.....see.......now!!!<br /><br />H xxxxx
