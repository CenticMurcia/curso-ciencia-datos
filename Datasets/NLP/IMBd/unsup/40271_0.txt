Patrick Bergin displays just the right blend of charisma and intelligence as Robin, but I join many other reviewers in pointing out the woeful miscasting of Uma Thurman, an actress of limited range who's perfectly suited to embody Quentin Tarantino's cartoon characterizations. <br /><br />The rest of the cast do their best in a vain attempt to had some heat and light in an overly drab period re-creation made worse by its sluggish plot. One almost begins to yearn for the unrealistic Technicolor and bogus Sherwood Forest of the old Flynn/Rathbone version. Even the castle interiors in this film are so dark and misty that they might as well have filmed those scenes in a London pub clogged with tobacco smoke. <br /><br />The ideal situation, in my view, would have been for Director Kevin Reynolds to have swapped Bergin for Costner, who was as badly miscast in the contemporaneous "Prince of Thieves" as Uma Thurman was in this one.
