I skimmed the favorable reviews and wonder if I just watched the same film. For the first hour or so, I was hoping it would get better. Then I was hoping it would just end. The pacing is very slow. The night time scenes are poorly lit. The dialog--at least in English translation--is at best stilted.<br /><br />The film is poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly acted. It often seems like the actors are moving from pose to pose rather than acting. Among the funniest scenes are when characters are attempting to not be seen by moving about in the open in very conspicuous fashion.<br /><br />Another point of humor: when characters are chasing other characters in fight scenes, the chasers are often on wires and hop down the bunny trail towards their opponents. I'm not used to bunnies doing the pursuing. The unfortunate thing is that this was, apparently, not intended to be humorous.
