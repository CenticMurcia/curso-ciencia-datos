Very disappointing film from a director who usually delivers. John Schlesinger has previously impressed audiences with movies like "Midnight Cowboy", "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman". Flashes of brilliance here are never delivered consistently. Highlights are far too infrequent, in a movie that never could decide what mode it was in.<br /><br />Cast - all just there, and nothing more - included Matthew Modine, Melanie Griffith and Michael Keaton. Ultimately predictable, a lot of potential was wasted here. "Pacific Heights" could have been a great legal thriller.<br /><br />Friday, April 5, 1991 - Knox District Centre
