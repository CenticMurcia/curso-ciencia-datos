The conflict in Kossovo serves as backdrop for this Spanish film. Directed by Daniel Calparsoro, whose "Asfalto" we recently saw, is an intense film that takes the viewer behind the horrible war in that part of Europe. How similar is the movie in comparison to the real events, we can't say, for sure.<br /><br />We are presented with a group of Spanish soldiers that are sent to restore electric power to a small town. As the group approaches the Serbian border, they encounter an unexpected turn of events as they are attacked by one of the factions and end up straying into a no man's land where no one is supposed to enter. The soldiers are faced with the horrors of a war they were just supposed to stay away from.<br /><br />Vidal, the daring soldier, is instrumental for getting them back in track after the Lt. Alonso suffers what appears to be a shock. Alonso turns out to show all signs of a coward when he is captured. It's only Vidal who at the start appears to be the one that wants to be sent home in order to avoid any confrontation; this young man proves to be a natural born leader who finds a way to get back after experiencing some tense moments in that forbidden zone.<br /><br />The best thing in the film is Eloy Azorin, a talented young actor who is perfect for the role of Vidal. Eduardo Noriega, an actor who has done better in other films, is quite a puzzle as the cowardly lieutenant. Ruben Ochandiano, Carla Perez and Jordi Vilches are seen as part of the platoon of Spanish soldiers.<br /><br />Daniel Calparsoro seems to be getting better and better all the time.
