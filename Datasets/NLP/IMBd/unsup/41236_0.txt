I bought Raise The Titanic on DVD for one of my mates for Christmas 2003, mainly because we've read all of Cusslers books and thought them very very good. I knew the film was pretty poor before I bought it, that was another reason to get it though, some poor films can be quite entertaining.<br /><br />It follows the book very poorly, missing out huge chunks, the actors are all poorly cast (with exception of Alec Guinness), as non of them appear as described in the books, where's Sandeckers fiery beard?<br /><br />Anyhoos, the best bit that made me laugh was the US Huey helicopter with a nice Russian red star on it. Why they couldn't have found a Russian heli from somewhere, there are enough budget films that dress random Russian Mil helis up as American ones. :)<br /><br />Best part I thought was the internal set of the Titanic, looked genuinely like a rusted up old ship.
