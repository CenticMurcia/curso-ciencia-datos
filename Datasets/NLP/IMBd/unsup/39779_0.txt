I am a pretty versatile movie watcher, and i am willing to give any movie the benefit of the doubt... but this movie was ridiculous! It was interesting, almost riveting, for maybe a half hour. But as any hitchcock fan will tell you, everything is scarier if you don't know exactly what it is your afraid of! They "let the cat out of the bag" far too early, and the rest of the movie dragged; there was no more suspense! My advice to all of you is to avoid the film at all costs. If you know someone that has seen it, do yourself a favor, and let them talk you out of seeing it. The one redeeming factor is seeing Jason Lee in a role different from his typical Kevin Smith Film roles (not that they're not good too!)<br /><br />...and that's about all i have to say! Thanks for letting me vent:-)!
