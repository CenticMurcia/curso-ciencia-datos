This show is easily one of the most true to life series to ever hit the air. It has an honesty and a truthfulness about it that I haven't seen in anything else.<br /><br />The freaks are judged and criticized, but they are not the two-dimensional extras of other shows. The geeks are mathletes trying to fit in.. not with the cheerleaders or the jocks. Not with the so-called popular people. But with the freaks. The interesting, unpopular, strange freaks.<br /><br />The freaks and the geeks are the main portion of the high school population. The kids who get picked last. Who get made fun of for putting up their hand to answer a question. The kids who get made fun of for flunking every test. Kids who have too much sex, and kids who don't have sex at all.<br /><br />This show is timeless. Almost 10 years later I am dealing with the same things in high school and it is conveyed in the most upfront way.<br /><br />The fact that it was never given a real shot is a true shame.
