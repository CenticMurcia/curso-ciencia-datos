I admit that the gentle pace of this film may not be for everyone, but I think it is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The acting was solid throughout with wonderful performances by the Polish brothers and a luminous Michele Hicks, but even more striking to my mind was the intelligence and thoughtfulness of the script, the evocation of grief and loneliness and the candor of the film's portrayal of at least a portion of the conjoined twin's experiences. It is a striking and original portrayal of both intimacy and isolation.
