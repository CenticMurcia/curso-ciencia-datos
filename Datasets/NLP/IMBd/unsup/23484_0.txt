We screened this film at the reelout queer film festival in Kingston last month. The producers wouldn't send us a preview copy of the movie, ensuring us that it was of fine quality and would pack the seats. Well they were right. I'm a huge slasher buff and prefer the old school 70s/early 80s style slice and dice flicks to the lame self-referential ones today. Maybe it was the graininess of the 35mm print the studio sent, but I felt like I was watching a film made during that era. The film wasn't at all camp, (something one naturally would expect from a gay horror movie) in fact, it was pretty darn intense. And the creators of the film were damn smart to write sympathetic characters we could relate to. This movie shouldn't be classified as a "gay" movie, anyone who enjoys slasher flicks with likable characters to cheer on will enjoy it. I hope it becomes available on DVD soon and look forward to the inevitable sequel HellBent... er?
