I just rediscovered this show that I used to watch when I was in elementary school and have to say that it's held up really well. The three brothers are so great together and the story lines are always hilarious for people of all ages. This show is enjoyable even if this is the first time you've seen it. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to find. The relationship between Lou and Joe is well developed, and Andy is one of the most realistic kids I've seen on TV. Overall, if you ever have a chance to see the show, I would. My family ranges from 2-40 and every person in my family adores this show. The concept is different than the family shows that come out today.
