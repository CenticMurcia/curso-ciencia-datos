Don't be fooled by the statement that "This in-depth documentary is based on two years of research using various Authenticated National Archives documents from: United-States, England, Russia, Germany, Romania, and Bulgaria, and with historical footage and images from national archives with the participation of an international team of experts." The "international team" is narrow and biased in its exclusion of the Armenian and Russian voices; the "in-depth" documentary makes erroneous statement (e.g., the socialist revolution could not start in March 1917 and be led by Lenin at least because he was out of the country until April 1917); the images collected are biased in minimizing the Armenian cause....<br /><br />It is not clear why the film is describes as providing "a balanced view" of the struggle between the Ottoman Empire and the Armenians in Eastern Anatolia. This is a film about the conflict between the Turks and the Armenians, yet in the film all the commentators are from Turkey plus some from its geopolitical ally, the US. There is no one from the Armenian, Russian or European side to balance their biased views. The film clearly sides with the Turks accusing the Armenians and presenting the Russians as partially responsible for the crisis. The Americans in contrast are presented as peace-makers. The film reminds Soviet-style propaganda and tells more about contemporary America and its ideological brain washing propaganda machine than about the conflict.
