It's movies like these that make me wonder what insane people would be shameless enough to put their names on this piece of trash. Spoiler: There is a ridiculous dance scene that made tears come to my eyes as I was laughing at the dork flailing around to a boy band. Dialouge= terrible. Little girl= annoying. Dad= stereotypical. Watch it for the laughs, not for the quality. There are some good Disney movies out there, this is not one of them!!! There is also a scene where the entire family must defend there lives in an exaggerated smoothie malfunction scene. Parents, this is one movie that you probably don't need to watch with your kids.
