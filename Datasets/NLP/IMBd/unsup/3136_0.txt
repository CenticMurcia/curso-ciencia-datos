Realistic, deep characters, fast-paced storyline that grabbed me right from the very beginning, great special effects, and amazing acting! I saw this for the first time when I was 13, and have been watching it ever since. I love how Holmes gets all of his trademarks throughout the movie, and Watson is hilarious ("perhaps there's something we've learned in school we can apply to this!"). A note to those who haven't seen it yet: watch all the way past the end credits. There's something important after the credits.
