Julie Harris is one of America's most acting stage treasures. England has Dame Judi Dench, we have the wonderful Julie Harris who brings life about Emily Dickinson in this one woman stage performance. Of course, only somebody like Julie Harris would have the power to hold us for the ninety minutes of performing solo without any supporting characters like Emily's sister, father, mother, brother, and sister-in-law. Maybe that would distract us from the real purpose and that is the life of Emily Dickinson. When Julie introduces herself as Emily Dickinson to her audience as in a theater, we believe her to be this long-revered poetic genius. Julie is charming, brilliant, and marvelous as Emily Dickinson on-stage in a performance that will forever should be studied by acting students all around the world. Julie's Dickinson is one of humor, light-hearted, sad at times, and real. She becomes very real to us and we feel like we just spent an evening with the real Emily Dickinson.
