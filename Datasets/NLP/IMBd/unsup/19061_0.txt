Jean Reno is such a great actor and I can't figure out why he would take a role like this. Times must be hard. The plot is weak, the tie ins are weaker. Someone is killing girls that look like a girl they do not want to kill? Some cop is trying to find the killer of his mother, but settles on preventing illegal aliens from being killed. A bad cop is a good cop, and the good cops are engaged in illegal research. Dead people aren't dead, weak kittens suddenly become "ninji" types, people suppose to be good with guns can't hit a target, and people shooting blindly into the dark never miss making a fatal shot. It's dumb, the actors always look dirty, the English dubbing is amateurish (Did I say it is a French movie?), etc. Jean Reno's beard on the cover should have been enough to warm me that all was not well with this movie. It is just my opinion, but the movie is worse than his beard. Blockbuster should be sued for putting it on the shelf. While I am sure the pseudo intellectual film crowd will "slobber" all over this movie, most people will want to spit on it.
