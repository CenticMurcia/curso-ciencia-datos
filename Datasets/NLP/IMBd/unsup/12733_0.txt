Matt and Shari are wonderful in their upbeat and entertaining show, "Room by Room". I found the show when I had just moved into my own house and their decorating ideas have been very valuable to me. Their personalities are also engaging as they make all the tasks seem easy. I also enjoy their coffee break crafts. There isn't any type of room that they haven't tackled over the years. Their seasonal programs are some of my favorites as they show decorating ideas for Halloween, Christmas or springtime! Matt is playful, and his expertise on tools, painting and woodcraft show anyone how they can tackle even the most complicated project. Shari is wonderful. She has a real flair for decorating and making a house a home. It is their joined on screen presence that enlivens the program. They are the best, and I never miss the show.
