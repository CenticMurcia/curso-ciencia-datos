Inspired by a true story, this movie took place in Argentina and Uruguay in 1965 when a couple of gay lovers involved in a money robbery and then hunted down by swarms of cops. In the end, they both burnt the money they had robbed and died together. They were right or wrong? That depends on you but honestly, this movie is one of the best of its category with amazing acting by both main actors (Leonardo Sbaraglia as Nene and Eduardo Noriega as Angel) plus extraordinarily good cinematography. Many people may say that this movie is full of violence, sex and nudity but they all must agree that the love story it contains is so much beautiful that touch everyone's hearts. Their relationship was challenged by that wrong decisions, betrayal and jealousy but they both finally found somebody to share each other's life and death. No matter if you are gay or straight, liberal or conservative, you will all enjoy every second of this incredibly well-made movie. No man will regret that he chose to see this masterpiece. Marcelo Pineyro, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Eduardo Noriega should have won many more awards than they already did. I don't know if it has ever been on screen in the US,; if yes, it should be nominated for the best actors, best director and best cinematography categories, if not, the academy members must be ashamed of themselves.
