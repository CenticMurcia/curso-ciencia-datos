SPOILERS!! This is without a doubt one the funniest thrillers I've ever seen on television. The basic premise is this... each person has something called a Glow (sort of like a soul) that keeps them youthful and energetic and as we age, we lose that Glow. So how do the villains of the story (cliched old men and women) retain that Glow? They steal them from their youthful neighbors, HA-HA-HA-HA, and them dump their wasted bodies into the basement dumpster. The directing was pretty good actually considering how incredibly horrible the script was. The acting was equally atrocious. Every sort of cliche you can think of (dump cops, clueless neighbors, silly contrivances of the story) can be found in here. It's amazing, LOL.<br /><br />This movie is about as ridiculous and ludicrous as its horrible ending where the nosy cop bites the big one but luckily for the female protagonist who needed a weapon, the body was buried with his gun together.<br /><br />1/10
