OK. This seems to be a documentary about a film crew going to MN to film a "mysterious" hole in the ice. But the hole is closed so the crew does some soul-searching as they explore the hole, its meaning, its possible causes, ....<br /><br />It's an Indie film so it's not superficial cr*p. No, it's heavy and serious and meaningful and fresh and vibrant and significant.<br /><br />And it's really a mocumentary. Wow. So many layers.<br /><br />What really really happens is New Journalism || New Film-making: It's not about the subject - the hole in the ice - it's about the director's feelings about himself as he confronts the not-hole.<br /><br />Wow. You know, like Maureen Dowd's articles are not about the subject but about how she feels about the subject.<br /><br />Since this is about Karpovsky we see that he's got some problems with his woman at home, with his camera crew, with friends. He talks to the camera from a bathroom; he talks on his mobile. He begins to question his existence; the meaning of life; god. Wow. It's really heavy.<br /><br />Then he checks into a mental hospital and we go through that with him.<br /><br />So it could have been an interesting story. But Karpovsky's real and/ or imagined problems aren't interesting.<br /><br />Wow. You just don't know what's real and what's not. Wow.<br /><br />There is nothing in this film: no creativity, no humor, no insight, nothing nada. See it if you want to hear a whining & uninteresting guy crying and talking about himself.<br /><br />But, hey, it's an Indie. Wow.
