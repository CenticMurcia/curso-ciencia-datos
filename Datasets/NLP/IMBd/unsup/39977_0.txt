This truely wasn't a very good movie. The story had potential though. Like the previous user said, it was beautifully filmed, but it wasn't consistant. It gave you pointless shots of sceens that had nothing to do with the story. <br /><br />The dialogue had be laughing. She kept complaining about how she wanted a "change" in her life... Now if you've see this movie, tell me her life didn't change. It wasn't that well thought out.<br /><br />I went into this movie thinking it might be a good sleeper film (one you haven't heard much about but is really good [like Shakespear in Love]). But it was really bad. Wait for cable or for some network television to show it. At least the commercials give you breaks.<br /><br />PS: One fun thing to do during the movie is to keep track of the number of dogs they have.
