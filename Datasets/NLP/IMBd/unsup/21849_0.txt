The movie starts out with "flashback" scenes from Dracula 2: Ascension... then has them on a quest searching for Dracula and Elizabeth ... Luke's beloved.. and the priests immortal enemy.<br /><br />I really didn't like this movie and am amazed I sat through it.. I really don't believe there will be a Dracula 4.. but if there is I can only hope it will be better than before.<br /><br />To basically sum up the movie it goes as this..<br /><br />The Priest and Luke travel to Romania to find Dracula and Elizabeth (Erzabet) along the way they get into trouble.. The priest finds a love interest... but eventually they find Dracula's castle (more like Luke gets thrown into the feeding pit) Luke finds Elizabeth thanks to Dracula throwing him down some stairs. The priest finds his love interest dieing. Dracula and the priest fight.. Elizabeth helps "save the day" and then begs her love Luke to kill her.. I really hated the ending of this movie and thought it was complete B.S<br /><br />That and if Dracula's face changes after every regeneration (im guessing every time he's roasted,toasted, and burnt to a crisp .. then WHERE the heck did this guy come from? shouldn't it still be Stephen Billington?)<br /><br />Dracula is dead... now the priest has turned his back on god and is the new "king" of the undead.. along with his beloved Julia.. and Luke.. well poor Luke is just alone in the world without a dime to his name..<br /><br />I give this a 2... I'm really disappointed in Wes craven... I expected more from him given his other movie projects
