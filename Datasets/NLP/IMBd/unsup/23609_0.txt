I truly enjoyed this movie. With both Ed Harris, Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Robin Wright Penn, John Turturro and John C. Reilly in the cast, I was surprised that this movie didn't get more famous. It was flawless, the script was well-written, and the whole cast did a good job. Gary Oldman is simply hilarious in this, he had some really funny & sick lines. And I gotta admit, I decided to watch this just because he was in it. A truly versatile actor. Ed Harris and Sean Penn were exceptionally good as well. The ending could have been done better, but overall this movie was good from start to finish, and if you like good crime/mobster films, you should definitely see this one.<br /><br />Score: 79/100
