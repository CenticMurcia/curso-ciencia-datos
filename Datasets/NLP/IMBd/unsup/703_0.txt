This is possibly the funniest mob movie that I have seen. Billy Crystal is perfectly cast as is Robert De Niro(He makes a very convincing mobster!) The entire cast of mafia thugs is perfectly cast. Lisa Kudrow is convincing as Crystal's enduring fiancee. I haven't laughed this hard or often in a very long time. This movie was even better the second and third time around. The dialogue is the key to the chemistry in this movie. A favorite scene of mine involves De Niro's character venting his feelings on a pillow! The culminating moment came in the end, it was a very satisfying conclusion that left me in the high spirits that the movie created. Here's to another De Niro/Crystal pairing in the future! This is definitely a film worth seeing.
