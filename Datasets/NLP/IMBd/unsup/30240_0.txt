The Secret of Monkey Island is game that has always been close to my heart. The game is a undoubted classic.<br /><br />Graphically the game is not quite on par with its sequel but animation wise its on the top of its game, with the graphics enhancing the comedic feel. Also, the different graphic-style makes it stand out from its sequels. The classic soundtrack by Michael Land is easily one of the best in gaming history. Even with the limited MIDI technology of the day the game compensates with powerful drum-beats to create a steady world of sound for the game.<br /><br />Humour has always been the main thing with Monkey Island and the classic laughs of the first game still work well. The game creates a nice illusion of a big adventure before its rather over-the-top ending.<br /><br />The Secret of Monkey Island is both a classic and well-developed game altogether. It's main weaknesses are its slight datedness and length.
