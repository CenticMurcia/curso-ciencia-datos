Clerks is a very unique movie in itself this is the very first B&W movie I could sit through. I love Kevin in this movie but Randall is the best. Dante makes the movie seriously hilarious. Big pat on the back you started something Keep it going. Love the Peter and Fart jokes. I look for all of Kevin's movies. Though he claims to be a crappy actor and director I wouldn't know how to function without my Sunday ritual of non stop view askew Movies. I have all except Drawing Flies. Sorry Kevin that one was a little out there for me. I look forward to seeing more and more each year. Jersey girl was great Affleck did a great job and so did the little girl. Look forwards to seeing more of Matt daemon and Affleck and more Randall/Dante. Heard there's a Clerks 2 coming Looking for it.
