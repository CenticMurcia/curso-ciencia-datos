...who love the campier aspects of this movie, I must beg to differ.<br /><br />More than most of my friends and relatives, I admire a movie that's so bad it's good (please see my Comment re: "Killdozer") but in this case The Green Slime is so bad it's JUST BAD! I can watch a good bad movie (i.e. A Boy And His Dog) every few years and enjoy laughing at it. Green Slime I simply cannot watch for more than 10 minutes, tops.<br /><br />And yet I find that this despicable little piece of slime :-) ISN'T AMONG THE BOTTOM 100!!!<br /><br />It takes an average of 2.6 or below to make it into the Bottom 100. Amazingly, Slime has an average over 4. So I have dutifully cast my IMDb vote of 1 (the worst) today.<br /><br />I URGE THE MOVIEGOING PUBLIC TO JOIN WITH ME IN THIS HEROIC ENDEAVOR TO DEMOTE THIS MOVIE TO THE STATUS IT DESERVES!!!<br /><br />CAST YOUR VOTES WITH ME, FOLKS!!! VOTE 1. DRIVE THE AVERAGE DOWN!!!<br /><br />BOTTOM 100! BOTTOM 100! BOTTOM 100! BOTTOM 100!
