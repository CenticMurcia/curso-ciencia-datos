Sensory overload is what came to my mind after watching Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers'. With psychedelic, subliminal visuals and a soundtrack that shifts gears from scene to scene till the credits finally roll--it's an unrelenting barrage of images and sounds that certainly makes an impression. But as Mickey (Woody Harrelson playing a serial killer on the run) says towards the end of the movie when he is getting ready to shoot Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr. as a manic journalist) 'Killing you and what you represent is a kind of statement--I'm not 100% sure what it is'. After the influx of sensory overload, what exactly is Stone trying to say? We are not sure, I guess. And neither is Stone--even now he's still having trouble defending his film. But not everything is bad, however, since the innovative visualization--that of mixing various formats, be it 35mm, 16mm, 8mm and even standard NTSC video--has left us with a visually and aurally interesting piece that can be appreciated again and again. And really, that's what keeps me coming back to this film. About it's content, I'm not sure. Some have even said it is an immoral film--including the director's ex-wife. John Grisham--the famous author--even took to court against the film since it spawned some copy-cat murders. But there's no doubt that it's a film that you cannot ignore, and has firmly cemented it's place as one of the most notorious films in history (Premiere placed it in their list of the '25 Most Dangerous Films Of All Time'). See it if you appreciate cinema, but if you're looking for a message you'll be hard-pressed to find something coherent here.
