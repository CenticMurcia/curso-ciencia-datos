I can't even tell you how horrified I was to watch this awful movie. The book and the movie are NOTHING alike. The secondary characters and even the plot are not from the book. If someone truly wanted to make an awful movie, fine, but why use the title and lead characters from Ms. Howard's book when the story is completely different? There is no Grant Shaw in the book, Grant Shaw is the actor from Melrose Place. And who is Mrs. Beacham? She is not in the book, either.<br /><br />Anyone who has read this book and may be tempted to watch this piece of cheap filmmaking, don't bother. It is not worth it. Even if it wasn't based on a Howard book, this movie is not worth your time. Paint your nails, hammer some nails, eat some nails, anything other than watching this drivel makes more sense. And I hope Ms. Howard has more sense than turning over her work to producers who will butcher it.
