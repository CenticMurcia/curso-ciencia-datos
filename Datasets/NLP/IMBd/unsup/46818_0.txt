This film was shown here with the title "Metal Force - Apokalypse in L.A.", so I did not expect a Knight Rider film, which was good, because it is not one. Instead this is more like Mad Max.<br /><br />I watched this film mainly to see what Hudson Leick has done apart from Callisto in Xena. She was very different here, mainly beautiful, and not much else.<br /><br />The main problem I have with this film is that I don't understand the villains (another parallel with the original Mad Max). What are their goals, and how does killing the senior McQueen and Hannah help them?<br /><br />I find one parallel with Knight Rider, though: In the pilot of Knight Rider, Michael Knight is almost killed, and then reconstructed with essentially a new body. Here, Hannah's body is killed, and she gets the car as the new body.
