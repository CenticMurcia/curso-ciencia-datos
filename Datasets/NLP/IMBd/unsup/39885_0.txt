This movie is totally out of tune with the first and second ones, which respectively were fantastic and good. From the brutal approach to movie action of the former ones (thanks to Bruckheimer), this one has scratched most of this off (no more social realism of the first and no more really bad guys of the second) and replaced it with superficial layer of humor and Murphy's funny faces, which really aren't funny when you've seen them before in his stand up comedy shows or The Nutty Professor.<br /><br />The old actors (Rosewood and Serge) are embarrassing parodies of their earlier roles, and I do mean embarrassing. The rest of the cast acts in the way I've come to describe as "polished but poor".<br /><br />This movie tries to be a family movie, and it doesn't work at all. Plus, it gives the series a bad legacy in the process.<br /><br />I'm sorry i watched it. Avoid.
