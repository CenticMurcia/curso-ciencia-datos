Reading all the comments about how funny and amazing and "true" this film is, I hope that the world has progressed a LOT since it was made or that the people who commented didn't actually see the vast majority of this film. When I first saw it as a child, I thought it was great too.<br /><br />I recently had the chance to see it again, and I cannot believe how awful it actually is. This film is racist, sexist, classist and homophobic and not in a satirical way. It casually condones and glorifies rape (yes, having sex with someone who is too drunk to even know who you are is actually rape).<br /><br />The only good thing about this film is the soundtrack.
