Six people are doing some research in a Canadian cabin. On the flight back they try to land at an airstrip, only to be shooed away by the one person left at the airport. The characters of the movie go back to the cabin to speculate what it all means. Is it a virus? An alien invasion? Both? They don't know. Unfortunately, because of lousy storytelling and incompetent directing the viewer isn't sure either. One thing is for sure. The next part of the movie will bore you to tears as uninteresting people mull around a boring cabin for the rest of the film.<br /><br />Again, a movie with good premise is horribly botched by Rebane. The sheer isolation and lack of information that the characters have could make for a very psychological thriller. Personality types could be explored in this setting. Tension could build leading to a dramatic climax. It doesn't happen. In all fairness to Rebane, his film the Alpha Incident does a nice job of this.<br /><br />So, what we are left with is a dwindling population of protagonists as they are, for some reason, disappearing. Finally, three are left. They hike to some town(Rhinelander, WI). Figure that out. I'm no Lewis and Clark but I think there's something closer to Canada. One more guy vanishes and we are left with Stan and Sara. And that's when the movie gets worse, if that's possible. For some reason they are turned into naked children and transported to a springtime meadow. I don't get it. Rebane probably didn't either, but hey, we need an ending.<br /><br />I usually enjoy the Bill Rebane films in spite of the their shortcomings, but this one was very hard to get through. The alien effects were terrible, even for 1974. The characters weren't bad but they were badly acted. The scenery was nice, so I guess there's that.<br /><br />Even if you like Rebane(I'm sure there's more crazy people like me), this one just doesn't hold up.
