When I was a kid, I played games like Freddi Fish, Payama Sam and all the other games but never a game of LucasArts. When I grew 16, My brother went to the library and came home with a game magazine witch contained a demo with Sam and Max Season 1, ep. 6. I asked to my brother if he'd installed the demo, but he said that it was for little kids. He did it anyways and since then, I wanted to play adventures again.<br /><br />A year later, I knew about the past of LucasArts, I've read that LucasArts would bring back Monkey Island in a special edition version. I never played it and I really wanted to play it. I've played it. It was the best adventure game yet I've ever played. The images were beautiful, the voice work was splendid, the humor was extremely hilarious and I've fell in love for the Monkey Island franchise. I hope that LucasArts'd bring back the other games in a special edition version.<br /><br />Until now, I've only saw the second biggest monkey head yet.
