This is not a great piece of cinema. This is no Seven Samurai or Shawshank Redemption. But this movie is very entertaining if you like a good "Shoot'em Up". The action is done well and I think the acting is fine. This movie is better than a lot of A List movies with 10 times the budget.<br /><br />Andre Braugher does well in this movie but then any fan of his shouldn't really be surprised by that. Scott Wiper, whom ever he is, does well and makes a good movie. I'll look forward to seeing what else Scott Wiper can do. Don't be afraid of this one.
