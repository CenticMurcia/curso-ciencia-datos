I'll save my total disgust for Supes IV. But here is my beef with Superman III: <br /><br />The opening sequence was ridiculous. I appreciate that the filmmakers want to make a fun movie, but to do a scene that reminds the viewer of the Keystone Cops is off the mark.<br /><br />Richard Pryor. Great actor. Great comedian. Poor choice. But I guess it's not his fault. The premise of the movie itself was silly. But I love Richard. (God rest his soul...) <br /><br />Okay...I'm still waiting for someone to explain how someone with no computer training or education can solve this unsolvable code...using print statements! <br /><br />Christopher Reeve. I'm a big Chris Reeve fan, so I won't bash him. (God rest his soul...) The only thing that REALLY bugged me was that his hair was brown...with highlights! HELLO!?! Supes hair is jet black...or did no one look at the first two movies? <br /><br />The line "Let's see how long he can live without air!" What??? Are you kidding me? Ummm...didn't he just send a nuclear elevator from Paris into space a few years back? Get real! <br /><br />Lana's son...Tommy or Timmy or whatever. What an annoying little kid. He deserves to get beat up.<br /><br />Special effects. Did they fire the SFX people from the first two movies and hire some graduate of Devry? No offense Devry...<br /><br />Aghghhh!!! I was just so frustrated watching this movie. Oh but wait until I saw Superman IV: The Quest for Peace!
