I saw this show today and was highly entertained! The writing is excellent (I wasn't surprised, knowing O'Brien and Smigel were involved) and Adam West was as great as ever. The type of storytelling here isn't exactly new, but with the writing and the ever-likable West, it really worked. Too bad the networks didn't agree.<br /><br />So, how about now? Would this show work now if they did it again? I'm sure Mr. West would be willing to give it another go, and if it was on NBC, well, they need all the help they can get right now and this is the kind of show that could help them get out of their 4th place rut, if only to a small degree. I know I would love to see this cult hit resurrected! <br /><br />Random thought: if The Max Weinberg 7 played the Lookwell theme as Conan went to his desk and he didn't know about it, I wonder if he'd recognize it?
