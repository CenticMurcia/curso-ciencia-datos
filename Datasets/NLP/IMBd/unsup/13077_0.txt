What an unsuspecting surprise. It was a Friday evening and after a long working week, I threw myself on the lounge with my wife and switched on the television for some brain numbing trashy entertainment. After channel surfing for a while - and an elbow from the wife who took charge of the remote control - we settled on this film, DINNER WITH FRIENDS.<br /><br />At first I thought it was a horror film about friends and divorces. I cringed at certain parts that were related to our lives, and most of all, I understood the pain of it all. There were times when I just wanted to get up and lose myself in the WWW of my computer, but I had to see this movie out.<br /><br />Apart from the film trying hard not to be too stage orientated, it was thought provoking cinema. In my world the dialog was precise. The acting, classic new age Hollywood bravado mixed with the old school! And the direction, very unobtrusive and it just got on with the story.<br /><br />At the end of it all, you know the film succeeded when it creates discussions and heated debates with your partner. We haven't talked about a film like this since EYES WIDE SHUT (you can see my review for this film @ /www.imdb.com/title/tt0120663/usercomments-509).
