"What Do You Say To A Naked Lady?" is a fascinating look at the sexual-social attitude changes in the United States during the transitional late 1960s. Mr. Funt, the power behind the popular entertainment programs "Candid Microphone" and "Candid Camera", may not have meant it to be, but this film brilliantly documents the generation gap between the 1950s post-WW II parents/grandparents and their 1960s flower child progeny. <br /><br />Dated to the extreme, it is a film of its time. (When a woman tries to sleep with a gay men, he's tells her he can't because he's 'queer'. A white grandfather type tells of his opposition to his son marrying a Mexican girl. The children, however, are wonderful and not 'too dark'.) If you are interested in where we were and how far the attitudes of the typical American have changed, this documentary is a must see.
