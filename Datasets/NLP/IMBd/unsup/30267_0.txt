I have studied the 20th century faces of women's history for quite some time, and have long adored the likes of Alice Paul and Inez Milholland Boissevain (despite her luxurious faults). This film revealed itself to me at the perfect time, as I prepare a presentation on the faces of woman suffrage, it is ever-present in my mind. I loved the film in it's entirety and highly recommend it to all women, their children and any man willing to sit through it. I would also advise rewinding it, and viewing it again, as my second time through was just as delightful and revealing as the first.<br /><br />I cannot pick out a favourite scene, but the journey of Emily Leighton was poignant and inspirational... as she realized the importance of equality, and that she did, in fact, have "the head for" politics.
