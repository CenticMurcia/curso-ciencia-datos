This is movie is extremely average with nothing much in it. It's trying to use the success of Death Note to try to sell itself. <br /><br />I had already read and heard reviews for this movie being horrible. So I had very very very low expectations in this one. But the problem is when you see L , you really start expecting something smart, something intelligent. And you get highly disappointed :-( If they had made this movie without the Death Note characters , it would have be a bad movie. But using the same characters is even worse, as you tend to expect them to do their regular bit. Believe me, when you see L on the screen, you will start thinking that he is upto something, or he will come out with something smart and surprising. But no .. nothing like that at all. <br /><br />That is the reason why I gave it a 4. Unlike the earlier Death Notes : <br /><br />* there is hardly a plot <br /><br />* no brilliant moment at all in the movie<br /><br />* it goes a little sentimental at times <br /><br />* lines of L are very often useless <br /><br />* there is no Ryuk <br /><br />* there is no Light Yagami <br /><br />* emotional side of L is seen as he gets along with 2 children<br /><br />In fact, I am going to stop talking about this movie at all. I'd like to mention at this point , that Death Note 1 and 2 were simply awesome !!!
