Everybody is here admiring the movie and you know what??? This movie deserves that.<br /><br />Some say its following Company, some user even said Hooda is made up to look like Devgan in Company. W-T-F ?? Some so-called (they call themselves) RGV fans have given comments earlier about the movie which are only distracting the RGV fans (may be they will review Ramu's Sarkar in the same way), I request them not to do this and go for traditional Bollywwod masala flicks. <br /><br />I am also a fan of RGV and I have compared all his gangster movies with this one and felt finally that this one is a completely independent one. May be it's based upon Dawood Ibrahim's life which the viewer shouldn't care about, the story is well and realistically said. Chunkey Pandey has done a very good job. Randeep Hooda looks very talented delivering a cool performance. Especially his dialogue delivery (I loved his so called monotonous voice), body language were nice. Watch his next release "Risk" directed by Sawant and you will feel his voice. I loved the dialogue muting style. We can also find this style in Ramu's Sarkar and Sawant's Risk.<br /><br />As Vishram Sawant, a former photographer, is the director of this movie; you can see high quality photography in every frame. The camera angles, lighting are creative and simple, not dramatic and loud. Supporting actors and the set, props are very supportive. No doubt Yaspal Sharma and Sushant Singh gave great performance as bad guys, but Zakir Hussain who is also as talented as them is in a small role as Babban. The narration by Markand Despande is touching with slight humorous as the same one of Company and Satya. All characters are made with own personality which is not found in typical Bollywood films.<br /><br />The only thing I skip while watching this movie is the song "Khudko maar daala re" which is a signature of RGV production. May be this is also signature of Vishram Sawant as his following "Risk" also contains a same unwanted number. <br /><br />At last this movie is not for spending a lazy afternoon, but a collectible one for RGV fans. A 10/10 excellent !!
