I felt like this was a very good movie. Whenever the mother cries you feel her pain. It is a bit obvious but it's still a good movie. There are some cheesy attempts at suspense. SOme of the parts are suspenseful though. There were a few careless things overlooked that the police should have noticed but that's just me nit picking. The performances were very good by everyone although at times Laurie seemed a bit over-dramatic. Also Some of this movie is a little bit unrealistic. But overall it was a good movie that made your heart ache. I highly recommend this movie. If you have kids then you will most likely cry at the mere though of your children going missing. This movie was a good movie so grab a box of tissues and watch this movie.
