I watched this movie because my husband wanted to. From the trailers, the website even the promotion it looked as though it was definitely for guys. They sold Dennis Hopper, the good looking young guy and of course the "sexy" girl... big surprise. And when we watched the movie, from the beginning I thought "here we go again, another bang em up, chase em, over the top action movie".<br /><br />But I was pleasantly wrong. The movie had a story, a plot and some good acting. While it was obviously still produced with men in mind (plenty of the actress in her red underware), it still kept to a pretty emotional story about a disfunctional family trying to find each other. I wasn't surprised that they were brought together by a car. And I wasn't surprised to see that there were bang em up and chase em scenes. But they were fun and a bit surprising. My expectations were very low but my opinion of this movie ended up very high. To be honest I didn't pay close enough attention in the beginning because I wasn't expecting much so I ended up watching it again. There really was something for everyone in this movie. I would watch it again.
