Having watched this movie for the umpteenth time, it still retains its freshness and charm. Neil Patrick Harris is perfect as the grandson intent on fulfilling his grandmother's Christmas wish...to discover who the woman Lillian was that her husband wrote about in his journals. Harris comes home to arrange for a long-distance management of his grandfather's real estate business, and discovers along the way that there is more to life than business. He discovers that loyalty, friendship, kindness, and compassion are still values worth embracing. Naomi Watts is perfect as Harris's love interest, and Debbie Reynolds lends charm and dignity to the role of Ruth. The movie could be maudlin, but avoids the syrupy sweet moments that often wreck Christmas movies. Since forgiveness is the true spirit of Christmas, The Christmas Wish delivers. This movie is worth the time invested in watching it. I never leave it feeling empty.
