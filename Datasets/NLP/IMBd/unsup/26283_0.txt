This is insulting that there are actually people here that would be so insulting as to give a film like this a "10." To those people I ask one simple question...Do you watch movies? NO SERIOUSLY, do you watch movies?<br /><br />Get off your butt at home and watch movies. <br /><br />To be fair those people who are comparing this film to Bend it Like Beckham are being unfair Beckham released last year in the united states and American Desi released in 2001, so please compare apples to apples.<br /><br />However, let's not chime in and give this film much credit. The story is trite, and the attempt to project Indians into a movie though admirable should have been done with some skill and tact. Look at BETTER LUCK TOMORROW. A Chinese film with a theme and a story. What is the story in American Desi? Oh my God I am going to college and I need to deal with stereotype situations with my Indian friends, this film could have been shot on a home video camera. I agree that I am quite amazed that this film cost $250,000 or so to make. Where did the money go? No structure, clich√©d plot stereotyped characters and all the recognition in the world just because it was the first Indian American film released into the marketplace? i don't buy it at all!<br /><br />You want to see a better film? Watch American Chai at least that movie had a distinct story with a structured plot and won awards, deservedly so!
