What a genius! Fellini went and broke the cardinal rule of screenwriting. In the end, the character woke from a dream. The whole stinking movie was a dream. The first time around, it's one of the most confusing, annoying things ever, but it makes perfect sense the second time around.<br /><br />Beautiful.
