One of the first shows where the brothers go against humans instead of the supernatural. Benders storyline was too condensed for a one hour show; a possible second part could have been warranted. The writers could have given more character development of the deranged farm family. The motive or build up of the family could create great story tension. Benders is a homage of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and other similar films such as Wrong Turn. Every time the viewer sees the chilling farmhouse, he or she can remember a similar movie/story with the vacant and lonely rural house. Dean and Sam show the brother's bond growing stronger with Dean going out on a limb to save his brother Sam. In the end the female officer lets the brothers disappear to carry on with their important mission.
