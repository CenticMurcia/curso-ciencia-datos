*Contains Spoilers*<br /><br />"Doug's 1st Movie" was one of the best Disney movies I've seen in a long time. I saw the movie the day it came out in the movies and remember waiting on line for a long time to get tickets for it. <br /><br />The movie takes place after the series with Doug and his friends looking for the "Lucky Duck Lake monster". They find the monster at Skeeter's house (I love that scene) and help the monster adapt to human civilization by helping her wear clothes and go to school. But alongside this part Doug is getting ready for Valentine's day and trying to prepare for the Valentine's day dance with Patti.<br /><br />One thing that I was unhappy about was that Doug and Patti didn't kiss at the end of the movie. I was really hoping they would since it was Valentine's day. But at least the movie revealed the truth about the "Lucky Duck Lake Monster".<br /><br />Overall I loved this movie (10/10 stars) and watch it whenever I get a chance to.
