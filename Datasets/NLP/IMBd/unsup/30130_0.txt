I just love the film Natural Born Killers. I reckon Oliver Stones managed to thrill me once again with his work as he is unafraid to expose what some might say "explicit images". I feel he does this with reason behind his work and truly make you think by the end of the film. The casting is brilliant in my opinion as the actors and actress's, i feel, really capture the events and feelings in the film.<br /><br />I decided to do my film essay on this film as it contain so much detail and things for me to speak about in the essay.Many people i have spoken to about this film don't like it and say it's just mindless violence. I think this is rubbish and they haven't obviously gained the full perspective of what the film is trying to present and obviously don't understand Satire. I have no problem with people disliking to film but i dislike it when people comment on the film as just being mindless violence and not giving the film it's chance to show it's potential. A lot of the film is about love and the struggle of relationships which i'm sure many can relate to. I believe Quentin Tarantino managed once again to create a fantastic story.
