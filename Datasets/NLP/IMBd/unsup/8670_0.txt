This is without a doubt, the Best game in the Metroid series. The graphics are awesome and the game play is very satisfying. But in the end how could you not love a game were you play as a hot female going around and blasting aliens. Sure it has some cryptic elements, but in the end is it really possible to make a good game without those? This is not only my favorite game for the SNES, but is also my favorite video game of all time. There is one thing about this game though that I find kinda odd though. Like the fact that 80% of the monsters in this game sound like monsters that appeared in Godzilla movies. This is one f**k of a great game 10 stars out of 10!
