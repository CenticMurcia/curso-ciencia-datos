I've enjoyed a lot of Spike Lee's films, but, unfortunately, this wasn't one of them. In a way, this film imitated his movie career: it started out fairly strong, but then had some difficulty being entertaining. This film grabbed my interest early on, and it looked like it had the possibility of being an engaging flick. To my surprise though, about a half hour into it, the story completely changed, and became this drivel about the main character selling his stud services to impregnate successful lesbians for $10,000 a pop. To me, the plot turned into one with about the depth of a porn flick. I tried to hang with it for awhile, but it was such shallow nonsense that I had to turn if off. I did take a couple peeks into the latter part of the film, and saw that it did return, somewhat, to the original plot, but there wasn't anything there that that looked too interesting to me. Maybe there are some who might be entertained by this, but I'm looking for something else, something that comments on our society or us as human beings, something that might stimulate me to examine my own values or views, or at least elicit some laughter or other emotion from me. I know Spike Lee is capable of this, but I didn't see much of anything along those lines in this film.
