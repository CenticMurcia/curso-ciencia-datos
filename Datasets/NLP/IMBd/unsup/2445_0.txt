The number of goofs in this movie almost had me laughing.<br /><br />The fantastic doomsday device is "Tesla's Death Ray." In this movie, the device consists of some electrical apparatus and a set of headphones, which is crammed into a wooden box that can fit under an airline seat. After Tesla journeyed to a remote part of Siberia in 1908, to test his death ray, he found its destructive potential is so great that Tesla never spoke of it again, so say the characters in this movie.<br /><br />Despite a wealth of information available about Tesla's inventions and his notes, the makers of this movie plod onward with this fantastic device and numerous goofs. A geiger counter is used to track down Tesla's electrical device, earphones are used to control and direct its destructive force, Tesla installed a self-destruct mechanism but hid the device in a cave, and Tesla tested the device on "the 13th day of June in the year of our Lord, 1908."<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Tunguska explosion occurred on June 30th, 1908, (not the 13th). Anyone expecting any facts about Tesla, his death ray, or the Tunguska explosion should look elsewhere. This hodge-podge doomsday device is the only excuse for what follows, and with the exception of "Bongo the Bear," I must rate this movie a pointless zero, (no stars).<br /><br />
