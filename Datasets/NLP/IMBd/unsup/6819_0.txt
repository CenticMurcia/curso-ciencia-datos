In my senior year of high school (1974), we produced this musical. Ummm, yours truly played Scrooge. I had the LP of the original cast recording, but I'm too young to have seen the B&W original live action production on TV (I agree with the other posters who state that the animated version was disappointing compared to the live action production.<br /><br />Please let me know when and how a DVD or download of the original B&W live action production of "The Stingiest Man in Town" becomes available.<br /><br />Thank you, Steve Marcus semarcus1@yahoo.com
