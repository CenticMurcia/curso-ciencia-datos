I have seen this film twice and liked it even more the second time around. With so much commercialism of the Christmas holiday, this film promotes all that the season is supposed to be about, that people are more important than money, compassion for others in difficult situations, and finally, the ultimate and hardest lesson, that of true forgiveness. Many films have great scripts or excellent acting but this film was about the story and the lessons to be learned. I hope that it will become available for purchase in the near future.
