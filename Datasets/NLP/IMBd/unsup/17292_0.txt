Ryan Reynolds (who plays Mike Hanson) should be getting more major rolls; as should Ron Livingston (who plays Tyler Carter Bellows). It seems that no one notices the massive amounts of talent these two dudes have... if only I had the money. Of the women in this movie only Alyssa Milano (Amy) stands out as portraying anything other than a stick figure. She was warm approachable, loving, and real. The rest struck me as mannequins.<br /><br />The script was OK but struck me as thin - much like "Wild Hogs" - Walt Becker's other major effort. Given time I can see him pwning (it's a gamer's spelling) Hollywood.<br /><br />Another reviewer called this a great date movie... that's the last thing I would want to see with someone I was trying to get to know. It's all about marriage - too soon for a date movie. Nonetheless, if you want a light romp through relationship land then this is pretty darn light reading. 7/10.<br /><br />-LD<br /><br />______________________________________________<br /><br />my bread: http://www.joesbread.com/<br /><br />my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
