I was quite excited to see this movie as it would be the first of the Dogma95 series to play in my town. As many of you know Dogma95 is a film group that requires it's film makers to agree to some different rules, among these being the use of natural light and natural sound, as well as not crediting the director of the film. Sounds like an interesting concept, but it doesn't work... at least not in the case of Mifune. First off, there are some crucial scenes in the film that just don't make any sense. Second, there are some severe timeline problems (ie. Kresten says he is going to Copenhagen "tomorrow" for 4 days in a row."). And finally, there isn't any sort of climax and resolution the film just meanders for nearly two hours and wraps up with a generic ending. Not a well written film, surprisingly the only thing about it which is enjoyable is the directing which Dogma95 would like you to not pay attention to.
