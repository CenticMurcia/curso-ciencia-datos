What a bore this film was , why is it that when Australians make films about grotty dirty people with no zest for life and basically are dull , people stand and praise these films. Wake up these sort of films are not original and not even good story telling , Australia has made a many better films then this one, lets hope this vanishes into that wilderness of forgotten dull Aussie films.
