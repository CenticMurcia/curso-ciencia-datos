I'm sure anyone who has read Mr. Flynn's autobiography, "My Wicked, Wicked Ways", will agree his real life was as exciting as Don Juan's. Women, adventure and a bit of his "wicked ways" makes for enjoyable reading for an Errol Flynn fan. Having said this, "The Adventures of Don Juan" is a wonderful, entertaining movie with Mr. Flynn looking handsome, fit and very comfortable in this role. The fencing scenes, costumes and a terrific Max Steiner score are excellent. The supporting cast simply adds to the entertainment value. After many years it was a pleasure to see this movie once again and realize what a wonderful actor Errol Flynn was. No other actor could have played the part better, or looked as good in tights.
