Shakira's performance was by far the major highlight of the night. Nobody moves like her. She performed her hit song 'Objection Tango' and totally rocked out with the remixed version that we were treated to. Jimmy Fallon did a good job hosting the show, but once Shakira came out, you forgot all about him and just concentrated on her. Even the stars agreed, after the show, people like P-Diddy, 3LW and Carson Daly commented on Shakira's performance and how great it was, and it was talked about for days. The year is 2006 now as I am writing this review, and I still remember it like it was yesterday. This is Shakira's domain, LIVE performing! She rocked just like she did at the Latin Grammy awards in 2000 when she performed her best showing of 'Ojos Asi' to date.
