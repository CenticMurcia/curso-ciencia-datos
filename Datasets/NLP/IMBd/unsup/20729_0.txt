To be honest, I didn't even remember when this movie came out. I was single then so I may have deemed it a chick flick and moved on. When I finally did see it I had been married for a short time but been with my wife for a while. There was very, very little that we could not identify with. I almost felt like I was watching my life so the title is perfect. Bruce and Michelle are amazing in their roles and I challenge anyone to say there was not one part where they were not emotionally moved by their performances. While there were some funny moments(the scenes in Venice are good, and Michelle's rant at the end is classic) this is really a dramatic movie and I really feel the main characters played more to the dramatic aspects of the script. Honestly, I really don't think that it matters how long you've been married, or with someone, you really have to see this movie.
