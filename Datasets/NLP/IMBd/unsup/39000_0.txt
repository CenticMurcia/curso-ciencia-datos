The acting was bad, the writing was worse. It looked like something from a high school drama team--and this is being unkind to high school drama teams.<br /><br />Willmott seems to have a dim understanding of the Confederacy, its ideology, the Civil War or US history in general. He gives us no explanation why the United Kingdom or France would come to the aid of the CSA in the spring of 1863 when the CSA was in serious trouble--i.e. Grant--Vicksburg. Nor does he explain how the Confederacy, a nation only 1/3 of the Union could annex the states of the Union--even if it had a desire to do so. This is the same problem later with the "Tropical Empire" section of the film--again how could such a tiny state--one that was bankrupted by the war--occupy all of Latin America? In the Davis Plan where slavery is reintroduced to the north via taxation where are the slaves going to come from? The Confederate Constitution bans the importation of slaves from abroad and most Confederate states banned the interstate slave trade as well--e.g. Mississippi would not have allowed its slaves to be sent to New York, etc.<br /><br />Then there is the WWII section. The CSA allies with Germany but attacks Germany's chief ally Japan--as well as a number of other bizarre assertions dealing with both Germany and Japan.<br /><br />The film continues piling more and more surreal experiences until finally the horrible experiment is over. Don't waste your time. It is not funny, it is not edgy, it is simply garbage. Not the worse film ever made for sure, but not worth the nearly 90-minutes of your life either. If I were to grade this film as part of a class project I'd give it a generous C-.
