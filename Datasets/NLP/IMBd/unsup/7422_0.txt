Brilliant film and excellent acting from Eliza Dushku! I liked her even before when I watched Tru Calling. :) She is not very famous but very charming. Her best roles are acting scary in my opinion. For the moment there are too many artificial movies full of tragedies and sci-fi... not like this one...great script...tragedy...fear...and of course Eliza Dushku. Irecommend you this film as one of the good ones...because it's original...not one of the same old FBI movies and investigations that you wish you never watched to the end. The original is always the best decision...<br /><br />Great MOVIE!!! ENJOY watching it!!!
