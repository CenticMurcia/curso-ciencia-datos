A diverse crew of clueless space explorers go through lots of bad cheesy effects, slimey goo, cheap tank robot runs on Duracell, an understanding of alien species in only a day, and more lunacy in this nothing is happening taut thriller on why time was wasted watching this self loathing boring movie. Also, lots of people wearing letters like A's & M's. That's about all I could remember before I checked myself into the local looney bin.
