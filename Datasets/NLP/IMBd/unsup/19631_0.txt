Sorry but I have to say this film was truly awful. A repeat of the Thomas Crown affair, which was only good because of the originality of the 1960's script. Yes Ms Hayek does seem to get a lot of top and bottom shots, I wonder why that is? And Mr Brosnan squaring up to the physically inferior Mr Harrelson.<br /><br />Plainly the scene that said it all for me was when Mr FBI is getting some TLC from that Barbados copper, crap accent, and they repeat the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The one where Mr Ford is getting TLC from Ms Allen on the pirate boat, when Mr Ford is pointing to the bits of his face that hurt and Ms Allen is kissing them.<br /><br />So this movie has absolutely no imagination in the script. The acting is non-existent as the performers seem only to be massaging their ego's. Oh and that bloke from Neighbours the Aussie soap, as the ships captain, what accent was his meant to be? And the best part is, with no expensive sets, CG effects, crashing cars etc, this film would have been very cheap to make. And will make stacks of money. Like Mr Paul Zbyszewski's other production effort "The Weakest Link" what a talent! Sadly the rating scale does not go to Zero....
