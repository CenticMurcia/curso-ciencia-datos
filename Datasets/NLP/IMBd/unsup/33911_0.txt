This movie, based on the book by the same name, is a completely false representation of the story. The movie was originally planned to be released by a major studio, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Al Pacino. But when Stone personally met Noriega, accused the script of being completely untrue. Therefore, no other studio bought the script and the only way to get it released was for a low budget, television release. Biopic? Don't think so. This film is everything but real, therefore you should think of it as a story you could could get lost in, instead of basing your whole knowledge of the events solely on what you see on a screen.<br /><br />Never believe what you see in movies. That is why they are what they are.
