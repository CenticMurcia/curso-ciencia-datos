What zetes said. The movie is on TMC right now, chugging away in all earnestness, well-meaning and clueless as how to show really real reality. The directing all artsy lugubriousness. It's a mashup of the latest (as of 1972) method acting chops, 50s lung-heaving melodrama and trendy Euro bleakness. <br /><br />Nobody behaves the way people so in this film. No one, backwoods or anywhere, talks in one halting monotone and walks only at one lumbering speed. Real humans speed up, slow down, cheer up, pipe down, loosen up, get down. <br /><br />Maybe Tomorrow is a useful Before/After teaching tool. Duvall shows fearlessness, eagerly wrapping his glottis around some stupid Hollywood-hick accent. It's the fearlessness he would use to be among that exclusive crew who, in a way, solved Actor's Pi. They finally found the near-mystical ability to transform themselves on screen at what seems like the DNA level.
