Assault! Jack the Ripper, is a violent "pinku" film, made in the mid-70's, and pretty much wipes the floor with any American horror made around the same time. It was a bit ahead of its time, I'd say.<br /><br />A surly waitress sort of befriends (or dominates) an introverted pastry chef at the restaurant where they work, and when she coerces him into giving her a ride home in a rain storm, they encounter a young girl in the rain who is apparently insane & uses the convenient icing knife in the back seat to slice herself open. They do manage to get her out of the car but accidentally kill her and hide the body. And I guess, that gets them hot, and an evening of sex ensues, after which there's some great desire to do all this again, with a different victim.<br /><br />The pastry chef is VERY spooky because he's so expressionless, and the waitress is domineering and basically never shuts up. She says they're like husband & wife. OK, well, hubby is so taken with his new hobby he begins to set out on his own and select victims, even in broad daylight, and when SHE finds out, she's of course jealous & wants to join in the fun. Of course, eventually, the waitress finds out what happens to people who hook up with budding psychotics.<br /><br />A very strange and nasty film, mainly because of the time in which it was made. Well done & worth seeing for fans of Asian horror, and predates the American slasher cycle by several years. 7 out of 10.
