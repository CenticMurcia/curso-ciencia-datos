This straight to video film when I was young was quite good because it went back to the original style of Scooby-Doo the TV series. The only thing that could put it down a bit was the songs. Scooby and the gang get lost and end up in a desert village outside a alien spotting station. Aliens are starting to appear and the gang decide to investigate. During the process Scooby and Shaggy fall in love with Crystal and Amber (a golden retriever). In the end (suprise, surprise) they find out the aliens are three people at the alien spotting station secretly digging for gold. They also find out there are real aliens, Crystal and Amber! Scooby-Doo was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows, and he was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Worth a look!
