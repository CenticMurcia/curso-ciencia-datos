Set in a New Brunswick college town,our heroes are a pair of easy going roommates named Luke and Roger.After sneaking into a sorority girl's room to return some quarters,Luke spies the girl sprouting tentacles in front of her friend-who's casually huffing liquid nitrogen.Luke reasonably comes to the conclusion that the two are aliens-though none of his friends believe him(he was drunk at the time).After a pair of suspicious deaths,Luke becomes convinced he's right and begins investigating."Decoys" is loaded with fake scares and plenty of bad CGI imagery.The almost complete lack of gore and violence is also hard to forgive.There are some mildly humorous moments,but the pace is rather slow and the acting is weak.So if you want a proper and intelligent Canadian horror watch again "Ginger Snaps" or check out late 70's slasher classic "Rituals".
