I recently viewed the movie Contagion and was amused by the concept of the movie. I also was amused by the extremely bad acting. I believe they made the movie in a rush. I hope that's the excuse. For example the female doctor taking care of the president vividly explained to her assistant that it was a level four virus. Which is extremely deadly. Well after telling him that she rubs her lip just after touching the level four virus. That made me laugh out loud! Also the smart mouth elusive kid. " Who'd ever thought he has the carrier of the virus." The movie was extremely predictable and poor. I don't have cable and I haven't seen a movie in a long time, but I can still recognize a poor movie and that was a prime example of a poor movie.<br /><br />Quinton H.
