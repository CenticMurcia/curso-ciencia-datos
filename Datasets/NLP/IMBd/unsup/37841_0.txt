I suppose this was an attempt to turn an L Ron Humbug...I mean Hubbard novel into a science fiction movie. Besides the evil Scientologists, um, I mean Psyklos, being absurdly laughable (dreadlocks and moon boots), the entire film just didn't take itself seriously.<br /><br />There is so much potential in the story, but nothing was followed through, resulting in shallow, if any, plot, hollow characters who were merely caricatures, inept special effects and inane attempts at credibility.<br /><br />Every copy of this film should be returned to the studio where it should be burned and the ashes swept up and buried in a deep, abandoned salt mine.
