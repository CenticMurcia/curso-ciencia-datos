I own this on DVD. It is one of the greatest things ever. Whenever I'm alone in the house, I'll turn off all the lights and crank up the sound. It is an amazing experience, made all the more powerful when you realize how ALIVE Freddie was back then. This was truly a divine performance (and yes, Love of My Life still makes me cry every time).<br /><br />The part that truly breaks my heart, though, is this: in the interview with Freddie Mercury, the interviewer asks "Do you think Queen will still be around in ten years?" Bear in mind that this was in 1982. Freddie seems so hopeful, so easygoing. He has no idea that in ten years the songbird will be silenced. It hurts me to see that. Oh, how I love him.<br /><br />For any die-hard Queen fans out there, this is a must-see.
