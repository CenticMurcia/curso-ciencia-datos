1 star out of 10. I watched this thinking it was going to be a comical satire, but it's just an old film from 1936 made by a bunch of pompous, self-righteous, non-knowledgeable people about their paranoid "dangers" of smoking marijuana.<br /><br />The acting in it is atrocious - beyond awful. The performers (and I cringe to use the word performer in regards to any of them)who were supposed to be portraying teenagers were, for the most part, obviously too old to be teenagers.<br /><br />The word "swell" was apparently the overworked usage in 1936, just as "awesome" is the overworked word among today's young people.<br /><br />The effects of marijuana on the characters are at times similar to what heavy alcohol consumption might be, while at other times the characters behave more like they've been snorting cocaine, and eventually it is compared to the symptoms of schizophrenia.<br /><br />The film definitely shows how outdated it is in several ways - like when two characters are discussing a third one and indicate he's a bad egg, after all his parents are(gasp)divorced! <br /><br />Naive teenagers are easily picked up on the sidewalk by dope soliciting adults that they apparently don't even know, and go with them to their apartment.<br /><br />One man smoking a marijuana cigarette, cups his two hands around the cigarette and then blows out enormous amounts of smoke - obviously not even inhaling. Another man just sits in a chair and giggles insanely, while all the women turn into nymphomaniacs.<br /><br />Some may find the film so awful as to be amusing. I was just bored by it and it's heavy-handed message.
