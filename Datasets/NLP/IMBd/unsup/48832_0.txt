I just finished watching the original Blue Lagoon. Then, tuned in here to read about the sequel. I read the lines from the film posted here, and nearly vomited. I'm sorry, but not one of them seemed realistic. Then I watched the trailer. <br /><br />Lines from the trailer:<br /><br />"Remember what mother said would happen when I became a woman?" "Yes." "Well, I've become one."<br /><br />I almost want to see the film to so how much worse it gets. In fact I very well might. <br /><br />The original had a certain charm to it. It was not all about the nudity, and the lines were spare. It was about these two people having to get along while going through the growth process. That's what was interesting. When love and sex happened, it wasn't dirty in the original but rather a natural progression.
