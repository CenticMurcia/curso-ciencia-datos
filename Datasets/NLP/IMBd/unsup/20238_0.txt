I don't even have words to express how I feel about this movie/documentary. All I can say is that it moves me to tears every time I watch it. And for what it is worth...I am a 50 year old white male school teacher. Well..that was all I was going to say, but I see I have to do ten lines. I could actually write a 1000 lines about this movie but I won't. How about some adjectives.....brilliant, breathtaking, stunning, moving, tender, brutal, harsh, real, beautiful, heartbreaking, uplifting...just a few off the top of my head. Thank you so much Mr. Lachappelle for making this wonderful film...it changed my life.
