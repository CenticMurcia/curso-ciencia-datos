I first wanted to see this show because I am such a Kevin Smith junkie. I hang on that mans every word. He knows how to write and direct films I enjoy. I am glad he directed the pilot, or else I might not have ever watched this show. I love the comic book style in the show, and the good old straight man, funny man formula that has been around for ever. Ray Wise makes a very believable devil by always trying to seem like he is doing good, but it gets you in the end. The characters all work well together and make you want them to get the bad guy in the end. All the elements work well together in "Reaper". The casting is great, the stories are great, and the entertainment value is really great. All around I would say that this is my favorite show on TV now with Smallville running second. This is one show that always has me asking what is next. With all the souls in Hell this show could go on for a while and we never know what will escape next.
