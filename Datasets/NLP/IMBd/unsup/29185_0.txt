Luis Bunuel's The Phantom of Liberty is quite a hilarious surrealist film. Bunuel does an awesome job putting together episodes, in which each of them have such unique story lines to them. The most interesting scene to me would definitely have to be the relationship between the aunt and the nephew. Boy, do we get a shock here. Another quite shocking scene that we encounter right after the nephew scene is the scene in which the nephew enters a couple's room. As it turns out, the couple is a little bit on the wild side. We see the woman enter the restroom tidying up her exotic outfit, as her partner goes in right after her, releasing to the audience his bottomless trousers. While the guests are in the other room, the couple enters and the woman takes out a whip and whips her partner. Can we guess where? (Bottomless trousers?) We all get the point. If anybody wants to get a quick laugh, watch Bunuel and his cast pull off an amazing performance.
