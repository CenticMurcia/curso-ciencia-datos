Like many of the characters in this Fame-wanna-be film, the acting and the plot are extremely clumsy and awkward, but the film's heart is big and definitely in the right place. I wonder if the talent in "Camp" have ever acted before or if this is their first attempt. The film, rough in many places, is huge on singing ability. If only "American Idol" drew so many talented performers instead of the hodge-podge they do...<br /><br />While I enjoyed "Camp," it seemed to gloss over many of the pertinent issues it presents such as teen sexuality, wrapping it up in a pretty "I forgive you" ending. The character of the has-been playwright seemed pointless altogether, and wholly predictable. Short on development, it could've had a lot more emotional impact had the lead male role (Vlad) bonded more with him.
