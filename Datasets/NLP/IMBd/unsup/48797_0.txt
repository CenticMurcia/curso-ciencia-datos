You really do wonder how a human being can screw up something this bad. Is it really that difficult to make a movie about a monster that kills people? Just get a monster, and have it kill people. And try not to edit in forty minutes of a girl in an isolation cell, if that's not too much to ask. The psychological thriller touch doesn't work at all. It's like I wasn't even watching an actual movie because well, the two plots completely cancelled each other out. You don't care about the monster because I think it was imaginary (or something), you don't care about the girl because she's wasting precious monster time. She's also a very bad actress by the way, but nobody's perfect. This movie is really annoying to watch. There's an intense boredom involved because nothing really happens, we know from the first minute these are all dream sequences and hallucinations. The direction also just plain sucks, you can barely make out what's going on. This thing is just really messed up in every aspect of film-making.
