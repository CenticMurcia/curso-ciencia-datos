Too add to the comments already made in this database I would like to point out that viewers seem to forget that the testimony in the film by Major Hap Arnold, Captain Eddie Rickenbaker, Major Karl Spatz and Fiorello LaGuardia substantiated Colonel Mitchell's facts.<br /><br />As for whether the court-martial did what it intended to do, obviously it did not in Pearl Harbor's case, however, it may have helped development of better aircraft and aircraft carriers during the 30's, especially when one considers this was during a depression.<br /><br />What could have been brought to light was the complacency of the public at the time, roaring 20's, etc.. Also the public's isolationist outlook.<br /><br />At any rate, General Mitchell will always be a hero to airmen, along with General Hap Arnold and others.
