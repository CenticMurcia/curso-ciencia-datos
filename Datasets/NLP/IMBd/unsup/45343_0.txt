In the early part of the 21st century, an unknown virus began spreading amongst the populace. Within weeks of the initial outbreak, the virus had engulfed the entire planet: from the smallest rural communities to the greatest cities. Soon the earth was infested with a new threat - the undead. Three video diaries explore the dystopian world that was left behind - charting the early days of the plague, through to the last days of the apocalypse.<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Don't let the name fool you. "The Zombie Diaries" is not really a zombie movie. Basically, the zombies are kept in the background and don't really pose a threat throughout the whole movie. They show up every so (not) often and stumble around. That's about it. The rest of the film is full of pointless dialogue and a terrible "Hostel" like subplot that doesn't really make any sense, is totally unnecessary and has absolutely nothing to do with zombies.<br /><br />I liked the hand-held camera idea but it's not as well done as in "The Blair Witch Project" or "REC". I also liked how all three video diaries are connected with each other...but that's all I liked about the movie.<br /><br />The acting is awful...really, really bad. The writers make it impossible to care about any of the characters because there is zero character development - the characters themselves could have been zombies and it wouldn't have made any difference. They still would have been mindless idiots.<br /><br />All-in-all, I was very disappointed with this movie and it does not deserve the good reviews it's getting.<br /><br />4/10. (I'm being generous.)
