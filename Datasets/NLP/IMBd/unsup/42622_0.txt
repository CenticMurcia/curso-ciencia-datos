At first this seemed like an enjoyable film with a good premise but it quickly becomes clear that the storyline is being manufactured in a wholly predictable, and more than a little, unbelievable way.<br /><br />The underhand and drawn out way Dr Lipman goes about ingratiating himself into his new family in order to obtain a donor match for his leukaemia is way too ridiculous - he's obviously severely ill yet he wastes precious days beating around the bush and tricking his brother into a blood test instead of coming clean immediately ... with obvious results.<br /><br />It's got some nice acting to begin with but unless you're a little slow you'll see what's coming after 10 minutes and after that it kinda feels like an insult to the viewer's intelligence.
