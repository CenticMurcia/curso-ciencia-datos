Since this film doesn't have huge studio promotion or A-list stars, you might be inclined to dismiss it. But this is a very entertaining film, with a surprisingly good look for a small-budget independent production. This football film has lots of solid action and avoids most of the usual cliches. It features solid performances by a mostly unknown cast. Nearly everything works -- the drama is dramatic, the comedy is funny. Do yourself a favor and give this film a chance.
