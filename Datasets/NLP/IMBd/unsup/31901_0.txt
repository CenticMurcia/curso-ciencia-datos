Man, I stayed up all night watching this movie. I don't know... but it might very well now be my favorite of the genre.<br /><br />Committing the plot to any review on paper would do the movie a great disservice. For the movie is instead thick on atmosphere: largely relating the sexual adventures - and misadventures - of a group of friends around their seaside neighborhood set to the delightful music of 50s rock 'n 'roll. This is a particularly comical coming of age farce that just runs from one outrageous skit to the other.<br /><br />Of course, the dubbing of this German/Israeli production makes the movie even more enjoyable. I'd like to personally thank the original producer for taking such a risk to film such a movie.<br /><br />Hot Bubblegum - as it was titled when I saw it - is in the line of "Porky's", "American Pie", "Revenge of the Nerds" ... but it just seems to beat all of them. It's probably a lot more raunchy also! I reckon you'll be just drawn in and if you don't - you bloody well should! It's fun, fun, fun!!!<br /><br />
