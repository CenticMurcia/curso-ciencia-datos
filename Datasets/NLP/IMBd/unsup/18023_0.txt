My daughter loves this show. She started watching it at 10 months. Even though at that age she was too young to understand all of it, the shapes and colors made her smile and laugh. Now she is four and still enjoys the Polies. <br /><br />Although I don't watch every episode with her. Most episodes contain good lessons on sharing and being nice to others. I can not understand how anyone would not like this show. <br /><br />Now that my 4 year old has a little sister, she can relate to how Olie and Billy treat their younger siblings. This is a great show. I wish they had all these great shows when I was growing up.
