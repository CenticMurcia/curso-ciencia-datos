I never heard anything about this movie. I saw that this was playing at my local dollar theater and was intrigued. It was a fast paced, gore-fest with an eerie atmosphere that I enjoyed. Its sad that this wasn't marketed because it felt better that most straight to DVD horror out there (Even Horror That Gets Released At The Theater) The story revolves around a few men appointed to find these mysterious objects. These mysterious objects give these men immortality but they need human blood to prolong the effects. If you like zombie films with a bit more of character development and more of a plot, then this film doesn't disappoint.
