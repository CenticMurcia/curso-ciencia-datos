Hard to say if this was meant to be taken seriously, but a college professor is commissioned (by none other than exploitation king David Friedman) to go find a Bigfoot-like creature in the Okaloosa wilds in Alabama. Along for the trip is an overly helpful former student, and a bunch of over-fed rednecks with guns, to take pictures only though, of course. It seems as though the character played by Friedman lost his son to this beast, and he wants revenge. And the professor is apparently none too bright, because he seems to suspect nothing.<br /><br />The beast is a rather tragic figure, really, since it's some poor schmuck in a gorilla suit with some kind of rigid ugly mask. It, of course, manages to elude capture and bullets and just about everything else, and the professor, while talking to himself the whole time, manages to kill everyone but the girl and they ride off into the sunset, sort of. You see the beast from afar, several times, but no matter how far away it is, it always is treated like it's right on the intrepid explorer's tails, and they're always moseying for their lives.<br /><br />Throw in some guitar & mandolin picking, and a bunch of talking, and that's about it, really. Oh, and there's some other fine upstanding campers in the area, and the girl, after a fine show of cellulite, dresses up in a red frilly skirt and shorty top, yecch....and I think she's also got on patent leather shoes and white knee-socks. Absolutely stunning. Anyway, this gets her white trash boyfriend all hot, & while he's having his way along comes our monster & cuts in. Definitely the highlight of the film.<br /><br />Plenty of unintended laughter, really....and I'm in awe that someone could crank something out like this and be serious about it, really. Definitely a "regional" film, probably best enjoyed by "regional" folks. 2 out of 10.
