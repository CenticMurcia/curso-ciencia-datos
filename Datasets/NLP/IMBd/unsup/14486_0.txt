Any negative comments about this movie and only come from a teenage Friday night action movie buff or someone who knows nothing about dance. I won't rave about how good it is because you'll discover that yourself one you see the DVD. It could be the supreme dance movie. The choreography and dancing is the best I've seen in fifty years of 'dance' movies. Patrick Swayze, his wife Lisa Niem, George De La Pena are supposed to be over-the-hill dancers, but in real life...they are far from it. All three, plus a brilliant ensemble dance to perfection. If you're a dancer or love movies about dancers, this is a definite must-see! Ten stars for sure!
