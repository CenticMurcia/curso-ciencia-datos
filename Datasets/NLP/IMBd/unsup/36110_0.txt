What can one say about a movie like this?I feel like I've been in a pillowfight,where all of the pillows were soaked in Ether.I can't believe anyone thought that this would be a good idea.Apparently some of those guys in Hollywood,drank too much wood alcohol during prohibition.I still can't believe I saw this.OK,imagine this,if you will:A Roy Roger's style western,complete with its stupid translucent plot line,extremely lame acting,pathetic special effects(assuming there are any),lousy stunts,silly slapstick comic relief,and horrific,lunatic singing.Now,shrink all of the characters down to 1/3 their normal size.And,Viola' you have,the Terror of Tinytown.Sort of a Roy Rogers on acid,if you will(or if you won't).Although, in all honesty, when I first saw the "cowboys" riding around on shetland ponies,I nearly busted a gut laughing so hard.But, other than that,its pretty much a waste of time.
