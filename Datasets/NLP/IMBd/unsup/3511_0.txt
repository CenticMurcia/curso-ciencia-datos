For a few weeks now I've expressed interest in wanting to see "The Best Man." As a white male, when I said this, most people gave me a look as if I just said, "I'm thinking about investing money in 'Phat Beach II'!" There seems to be a belief that "The Best Man" is not a movie for me because I'm white.<br /><br />If you were skeptical about seeing "The Best Man" because you're not black, ignore those fillings and go see the movie. It's slow at points, and yes, it does have some tired cliches in it, but it was nice to see a movie where people talked and developed relationships, regardless of their skin color.<br /><br />"The Best Man" is not a black film. Yes, it stars black people and was made by black people, but it's more a film about one's friendships and how they develop as one grows older. Don't miss it because you don't think it's meant for you.
