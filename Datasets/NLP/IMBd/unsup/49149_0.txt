This movie is like two or three movie plots all spliced together--and in my eyes, this isn't done in the most successful manner. First, Lionel Atwill orders an up and coming actress to travel to Hollywood with a fading actor. Almost as soon as these two leave, Atwill has a heart attack or something like it and is ordered to take complete rest in the country. He invites along his secretary as his nursemaid and the stage appears to be set for romance at Atwill's country home.<br /><br />However, then it starts to get VERY strange. It seems that Atwill's ranch has a runway with lights and a beacon--very posh indeed. And, it just so happens that BOTH a Bonnie and Clyde style couple are seen nearby and are being chased by the police AND a plane is about to crash because it's almost out of fuel and the only place it can land is at Atwill's landing field!! Talk about ridiculous! Now the Bonnie and Clyde-style couple is an interesting idea I suppose but Wallace Ford is given horrible lines by the writers. In particular, he says "oke" (pronounced like "oak") about three dozen times when he means to say "okay". After a short time, my teeth began to grind every time he said this!! In addition to these creeps, once the plane crashes, the survivors all come into the ranch house and the whole thing plays out like a stage production--with almost all the action happening in one claustrophobia-inducing room. While interesting at times (especially at the thrilling conclusion), the whole thing seems ridiculous, very far-fetched and poorly written--as if desperately needing a massive re-write. Not a great film by any standard, but there were a few good scenes here and there that might hold your interest.<br /><br />Why, oh why, did Wallce Ford need to say "oke" again and again and again--it will probably haunt me for some time to come and I'll start avoiding his films!
