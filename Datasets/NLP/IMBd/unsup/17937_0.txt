This epi certainly poses a good question: what happens when evil collides with evil, as Serling himself puts it. I grant you that I was sort of bothered by some nitpicky details-- the uniforms the SS were shown wearing were wrong for the period and the Halftrack was an (obviously) American one. However, the use of the small staff car and the Mercedes-Benz six-wheeler were very good touches.<br /><br />Francis Lederer was a man totally devoted to his craft, still teaching Acting until the end of his very long life, and I was amused by the fact that Dantine was himself a former concentration camp inmate!<br /><br />All in all, this is one fine episode, thanks primarily to the acting that is on display here.
