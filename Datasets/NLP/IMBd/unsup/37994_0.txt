thankfully ive only seen this movie the one time and that was Plenty enough for me. .it was SO stupid, it wasnt funny.. i would advise NO one to rent this movie..if its available on video.. save Your money and rent either the one with Buster Crabbe.. or the one with Sam Jones..<br /><br />it was so dumb and i know it was just a take off from the original.. what the heck were the ones that made this stinker thinking?? it made NO sense at all.. just shoot this lousy movie into outer space..
