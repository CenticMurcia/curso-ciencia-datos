(There are Spoilers) With no one, including members of his family, taking Kyle Hunter's, Trevor Blumas, symptoms of hurt and depression seriously Kyle ends up killing himself from carbon-monoxide poisoning one rainy evening in the family garage. <br /><br />Kyle's dad Michael Hunter, Andy Garcia,who should have known his problems and how serious they were since he's a collage professor in psychology, as well as threats people like Kyle all the time is so devastated by his son's death that he ends up leaving his wife Penny and daughter Selly, Chelsea Fields & Linda Cardellini,to live by himself since he couldn't face them anymore. We later learn the real reason for Kyle's suicide and it shows how right Michael was in feeling guilty about his death and what he had, unconsciously and unknowingly, to do with it. <br /><br />It's now three years later and Michael is getting his life back together, and putting Kyle's tragic death behind him, as he goes on the lecture circuit and is invited to speak at his alma mater Kansas University. It's at Kansas U. that Michael meets one of his former students Dr. Barbara Wagner, Teri Polo, now a licensed psychologist at the Holly Health School for Wayward Boys who asks him about seeing one of her patients 17 year-old Tommy Caffey, Vincent Kartheiser. <br /><br />Hesitant at first Michael agrees to talk to Tommy who's about to be released since he's doing so well, psychology and is about to reach his 18th birthday,at the school. Tommy, almost by accident, get's to know Michael's young teenage daughter Shelly who falls in love with him when she meets Tommy at a dance by the railroad yard when he was out on a night-time leave from Holly Heath. Tommy also murdered a young girl Chole, Kim Schraner, earlier that evening when she aggressively come on to him by the deserted railroad cars not knowing what kind of monster the shy sweet and good looking Tommy really is. <br /><br />Tommy learns all about Shelly's deceased brother Kyle and uses that knowledge to manipulate Michael into , or having his personal psychologist Dr. Wagner, give him a clean bill of health and thus release from the hated, by Tommy, institution.<br /><br />Tommy had developed a murderous hatred of women, or young girls, who try to be intimate with him because of what happened to his mom when he was a young boy; she was brutally murdered by his dad Joseph Caffey, Sam Bottoms, when he found that she was having an affair with another man. The truth behind Tommy's mom's murder, and what caused his dad to keep it secret all these years, is something that Tommy has been trying to keep locked deep inside his mind and that's the reason for his dangerous psychosis that eventually leads to murder and madness.<br /><br />Disturbing but thought-provoking movie that has you almost as shocked as Michael is by the time it's over with Tommy skillfully getting under his skin, and sub-conscious, by morphing himself into Michael's son Kyle and, unknowingly, bringing out the truth behind Kyle's death that Michael, by his actions in trying to help his troubled son, had a lot to do with. Michael begins to realize later the reasons for Tommy knowing so much about Kyle, he's been secretly dating his daughter Shelly, and even more shocking the real reason for his mothers murder that shaped Tommy's mind and turned him into the Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hyde that he became. <br /><br />The ending of the movie "The Unsaid" is a bit confusing at first with Tommy going wild in his effort to get out of the Holly Health School and almost murdering his psychologist Dr. Wagner and then taking Shelly hostage in the process. But when confronted with the truth by Michael, and seeing that he really needs help, and that a life on the outside will only end with him being either dead or on death row the movie couldn't have ended any other way.
