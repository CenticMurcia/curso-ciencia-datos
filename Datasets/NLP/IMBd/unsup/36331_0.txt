Probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and, having seen many movies from all different times and genres, this is a big insult. First of all, Isabel Lorca's incredibly bad French accent makes it very hard to understand what she is saying, and terrible performances by all of the actors. Also, the editing is the worst in the world. There are about 500 obvious switches of the horse, from albinos, to Arabians, dapple grays, etc. Plus, what was with the song? "You're the Lightning in my eyes, you lift me up, you bring me high!!" Also, the stunt doubles that they got were very bad. She looked like her neck was snapping back, especially when she was jumping for Mme. Rene. Also, the plot with her stepfather was completely ridiculous, as was her going blind, since both those plots went absolutely NOWHERE!!! It was as though someone got to lazy too shoot the rest of the movie. Plus, Lucas Mitchell was very ugly. Just a note. Mickey Rooney must have been in a very bad place to do this movie. DO NOT SEE IT! Unless you want to mock it, like me and my friends, in which case go right ahead, and rent it for a long time, since you'll want to watch it over and over again, you'll be laughing so hard at it! And I will agree with auwhite that it was indeed very disturbing when, let's just say, certain aspects of her wardrobe were missing, and that part of her body was sticking right out in front of the camera. (GROSS!)
