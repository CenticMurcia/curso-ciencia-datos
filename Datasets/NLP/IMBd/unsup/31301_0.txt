I have to admit that I haven't seen this film in a while, but I loved it as a teenager. It is very eighties, very sickly sweet, but Paul Nicholas is absolutely gorgeous in it! Not much plot, but some lovely camera work with cracking scenery. Don't watch this with anyone who isn't a true romantic through and through. Have just bought it on DVD from Amazon as I really want to see it again.<br /><br />The basic plot is: girl is getting married, boy sees girl and falls in love-at-first-sight. Boy spends the run up to the wedding trying to win the heart of the girl, even though she thinks he's an idiot. You can probably guess at the ending. Lots of beautiful countryside, a gorgeous manor house and fabulous horses. The comedy is a bit funny-by-numbers, but it made me laugh anyway. If you fancy a feel-good movie, something to curl up to with a hot chocolate, this is worth the time. Be warned though, I can imagine it has probably dated quite badly. <br /><br />All in all, a nice way to waste an hour or two.
