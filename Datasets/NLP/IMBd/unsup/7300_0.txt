If IMDb ever needed a ZERO category for a film, this is it. Voting ONE is to heap unwarranted praise on this trite and pretentious effort. The silver wasted in the emulsion would have gone to far better use in dental fillings. Oh, it undoubtedly was a hit at the Toronto Film Festival as the beautiful people oohed and aahed at its daring innovation and creative groundbreaking. Yeah. Right. Acceptable words fail me. Would the BRAVO channel have shown this were it not required to meet Canadian content regulations? Would it even have been made if its perpetrators had not been able to feed at the public trough. We do some things very well in this odd country of ours. Making movies is not one of them!
