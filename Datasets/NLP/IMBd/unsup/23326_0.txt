Whats wrong with this film??? Nothing, I completely enjoyed watching it. There are some lamb bits but its a movie for young girls so if you don't like that kind of stuff of course your not going to like it, but you must have known what it was about before you went to see it? Its a girlie film, with comedy and romance just like all there films. The boys in it are cute and Mary-Kate and Ashley are very talented so really any thing there in is going to be well produced. It was very predictable but it was still good viewing, and i would see it again. So if you have young girls this film is perfect. It got a lovely ending and has a good moral about sisters and shows you how to get along etc etc. So rent this film (or buy it) cause its good, funny and sweet!
