Anybody and everybody should see this film at some time or another. We are introduced to Robert Crumb, an artistic genius who has gained fame through drawing underground comics, and his eccentric family. We also meet some of his friends and people who find his work marvelous and others who despise it. Robert Crumb emerges as a man who isn't as strange as he first appears. What makes him someone to respect is his ability to say exactly what he feels and not hold back. He is giving our right of free speech here in the states a good exercise. I especially suggest that bullies see this film, in that they may see what their taunting and cruelty can do to a person (namely Robert's brother Charles). If you're looking for a true story about an underdog who hits it big, watch Crumb.
