This Pilot episode sucks you right into the show very quickly. The episode starts with a battle sequence in which Hobbes saves his best friend Waters' life. As the episode continues we learn that Hobbes has returned home and is engaged to be married. Because of this he plans to leave the service and settle down in California. He is however called on one last mission to which he remains extremely suspicious even after he is told that he is going to enter a virtual reality world created by the pentagon with the purpose of simulating war games. He is told his mission is to enter the game and find a man named Santiago and kill him. As he is watching the orientation video, the video suddenly cuts off and Hobbes wanders out to find out what is up. He quickly realizes that he has entered the game and is immediately running for his life. The rest of the episode is full of action and mystery as he is healed mysteriously by a woman who does not talk, finds that his fianc√©e's virtual counterpart is married to his best friend, Waters, who is one of Santiago's right-hand men. Hobbes also gains an unlikely companion in Michael Pinnocchio who robs him of his wedding ring minutes after entering Harsh Realm and continuously threatens to eat Hobbes' dog, Dexter. The episode also features two well known cameos for fans of Carter's other more popular shows The X-Files and Millennium. Lance Henricksen (Frank Black) plays the general and the voice doing the orientation video is none other than Gillian Anderson (Dana Scully). Very entertaining episode which sets the show up very well for a wide variety of opportunities. This being the first (and only really) attempt by Chris Carter of a solely SciFi non Horror show, I thought he did a great job and I was excited to see more.
