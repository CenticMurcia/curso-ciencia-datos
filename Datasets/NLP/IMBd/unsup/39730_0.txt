My wife and I regularly watch romantic comedy's as end of week, child in bed, brain wind down, light fluffy fare. That said, I do like some quality of acting or comedy, e.g. 4 Weddings, Music & Lyrics, Bridget Jones, Notting Hill, Love Actually (oh god... is High Grant the only person capable of a decent Rom-Com???), Sleepless in Seattle, You've got Mail, etc.<br /><br />This movie was just bland, unfunny, and so poor that we turned it off half-way through. Not a chuckle, not even a smirk.<br /><br />As many other reviews here have pointed out, the characters seem forced and just don't work together. It's not even that they are annoying... it just didn't 'work' for mine which is very disappointing as the individual actors have proved track records of quality films.<br /><br />Avoid, or if you must watch it, be ruthless and promise to turn it off after 15-20 minutes if it doesn't really grab you.
