Madhuri Dixit's comeback movie, though bit loose in script and the story-line, sums up the importance of arts in our life beautifully. Aaja Nachle brings to surface how the business of expressing oneself (read performing arts) is an integral part of life.<br /><br />Aaja Nachle has captured commendably well in the movie, the idea that everyone has an intrinsic desire to have that 'one moment of glory', the idea that everyone can 'show us some jalwa or the other', that dance, theater, music programs and such socio-artistic activities are essential to keep a society in tune with its innate desires to express, relate and emote to situations, that art forms can elevate a bored society stuck in the mundane business of life to new energy levels from time to time, and most importantly, the state has a role to ensure that the citizens have enough modes and means to avail entertainment at low costs.
