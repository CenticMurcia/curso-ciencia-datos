This picture is most famous for its grand monster creation: a lobster-like, humanoid female prehistoric beast that's a reincarnation of the leading lady (Marla English). It was designed by Paul Blaisdell, a mega-talent creator of many of American-International's monsters. However, this is one of the dullest features ever seen, with good B-cast just talking, talking, talking, and featuring deadening monster attacks that never attain excitement or suspense. Even English, whose body English is great, resembling either Elizabeth Taylor or Vivien Leigh, can't rescue it. The beach photography is OK and the music about par, but there's just not enough to get thrilled about in the lackluster Bridey-Murphy inspired script (the reincarnation craze in the mid-1950s).
