I don't know if most know this, but in the magazine Toy Fare they have a column entitled Twisted Toy Fare theater, which is a several page comic strip of any sort of toys doing something comedic.<br /><br />Now this show is obviously the real deal version of it. That is truthfully why I love this show so much. The concepts are just so off the wall and hilarious. You would never expect that guys moving around action figures to do things would be hilarious, but it really is. This is honestly one of the best shows Adult Swim has put out since they began to air shows like Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Family Guy. Creators, including Seth Green (Austin Powers trilogy, Chris Griffin on Family Guy), have managed to make us laugh at things that are incredibly original and include lots and lots of toys.<br /><br />So check this show out for a well needed 15 minute laugh.<br /><br />10/10
