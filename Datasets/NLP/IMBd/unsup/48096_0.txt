How could someone make a movie this awful? It's neither funny nor dramatic, neither fish nor fowl, though it does smell.<br /><br />How could anyone have thought the premise would be funny to begin with -- men sent to German enigma factory dressed as women in hopes of fitting in with the all female staff and stealing an enigma under their noses.<br /><br />Gee, that's some real funny stuff. Not even Jerry Lewis would stoop to this lame plot setup in one of his terrible movies.<br /><br />This movie tries for comedic moments -- they fail -- then goes for something dramatic, which skewers the tone. Either you're going for a farce or you're not, fellas. Don't switch the tone like that. It doesn't work, but nothing in this cross dressing disaster works.<br /><br />I'm not sure who was worse, Matt 'dumb Joey' Leblanc or Eddie 'huge head' Lizzard. Both stunk worse than ten day old feet. <br /><br />Perhaps these actors should go on a new mission: steal the prints of this craptastic movie and burn them before any unsuspecting viewer can see this dross. Now that is a worthwhile mission.
