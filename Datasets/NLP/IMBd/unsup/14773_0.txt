I know people who are just as shy and ditsy as Tom Wheeler and certainly adolescents who wish for the same thing. I doubt that there are many hookers like V but she has the proverbial "good heart". The son's (Frank) well meaning hopes for his dad and the situations it creates are truly funny.The sex-ed presentations is one of the funniest comedic plots ever. It also strongly point's out that a "book should not be judged by it's cover". The plot is not complicated, the characters well developed and understandable and it doesn't take itself too seriously. What more can be asked of a comedy? I own it and have seen it many times and always feel really good when it ends. Outstanding Entertainment. A must see and must buy for your film library
