I most enjoyed this movie. I viewed it years ago, and found myself enjoying it all over again. I couldn't quite remember who did it, but during the 'gather all the suspects in one room please' scene, I suddenly remembered. Ustinov looks to be having the time of his life here, and being paired with David Niven, who wouldn't? The rest of the cast are mostly hit and miss, the hits are Bette Davis, Olivia Hussey, Simon Mccorkindale and Mia Farrow. The misses are the spectacular "what WERE they thinking?" miscasting of Jack Warden as a Swedish doctor ("Vaht, you accuse me?") Peter Finch as a communist sympathiser, and Angela Lansbury just chewing the scenery up as a booze swigging romance novelist. The who-dunit is actually presented in an entertaining (and surprisingly violent) way, and makes for an entertaining time.
