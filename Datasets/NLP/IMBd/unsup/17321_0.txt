It is nice to see such a good horror film, better to see if you know the background, that is real story on which this film is made.<br /><br />Even though film is picks up well from beginning and doesn't allow spectaculars to move from the seat, after some time you can easily predict what will happen next. At some places director could have reduced the human body cutting scenes. These scenes are more ugly than horror. Also they have not shown anything happening in the outside world even though policeman in first scene is killed and these 4 friends disappears. That is bit surprising. Also all 4 friends looks energetic throughout the life of their characters even though they do not eat or drink anything after their accident...It is one more goof in the film.<br /><br />This film is good entertainment for horror film lovers.
