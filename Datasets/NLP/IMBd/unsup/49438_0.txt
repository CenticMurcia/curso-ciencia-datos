I think I only watched and suffered through this dud so I could come here and warn everyone. Do NOT watch this film unless it's under pain of death!! <br /><br />Richard Losee is the star, director and producer of this. If this was someone like Clint Eastwood, it would be a commendable achievement but not in this case as Losee lives up to his name and is inept and incompetent in each role. As an actor, he's stiff and wooden, the action scenes are bad enough but the love scenes are cringe worthy in their total lack of passion, cold as a fish comes to mind. As a director, he lacks the ability to make any scene interesting or exciting and flubs every chance to do so, couldn't direct traffic. But he fails worst as producer as that makes him overall responsible for putting this mess together in the first place!<br /><br />The plot, what there is, concerns the kidnapping of a small child who turns out to be Losee's son (in real life as well), when he's hired to be the ransom driver for the child's family. Taking it's cue from Dirty Harry but doing it badly, Losee has to drive in his souped up car from ransom drop to the next to get instructions. <br /><br />Cue lots of fast cars driving around for no discernible reason and a ludicrous 'drag race' with a bunch of rednecks who are even lower on the evolutionary scale than the rest of the cast. It all comes to an end much slower than you are wishing it will, if only the film had moved as fast as the hero's car. Perhaps if you thought that the 'Dukes of Hazzard' is about the best that it gets, you might enjoy this film, but I doubt it.....<br /><br />Give this bomb a sidetrack and put up the detour sign.
