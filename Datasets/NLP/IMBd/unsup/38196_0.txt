Getting it out right now, this film is completely lame..and basks in it's absurdity. The film follows the same line of many "Friday The 13th" type of psychos picking off scantily clad teens, but it just wallows gleefully in it's cheesiness the film is hard not to enjoy a little bit. You have the prototypical heavy kid who is ripe for exploiting himself{aren't fat people supposed to always be the butt of jokes in the Anti-PC 80's?}with getting his butt stuck in a window as he is flashing people(I couldn't help it..I giggled uncontrollably), dresses as a woman while spying on chicks showing their tits, and gets his stomach ripped open with guts splattering out. Betsy Russell plays a young teen with hideously, tiresomely goofy nightmares whose boyfriend is Leif Garrett{in the "how far my life has sunk" role often welcomed by once "prominent" stars}. Lucinda Dickey plays Betsy's "pal" and Lorie Griffen{the babe in "Teen Wolf" who is the stuck up snob we all know and love}plays a goofy, but lovable ditz. The film embellishes silly characterizations, but has an "I don't care" attitude that one might admire. There are some violent deaths, but most of the gore is shown not seen in the actual moment. It is not a good film, but it could probably fill the craving for a cheesy 80's horror item if one is looking for it.
