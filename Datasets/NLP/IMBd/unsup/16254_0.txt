While the quality may not be the best, the concept and action were perfect for anyone under the age of 12! Now, years later, I find myself remembering the oddest parts of this show, mostly the outfits and vehicles. I seem to remember the Cartoon Network running this late at night; a nostalgic must-see!<br /><br />Ace Goodheart and crew boarding their ship, the Phoenix, to do battle with the menace from space,...or some such place. The creative force behind these concepts is impressive, most impressive!
