You are all out of your minds if you gave this movie less than an eight. And if you hated Some Like It Hot, I'm convinced that you have no soul. If you hated something as masterful as The Apartment, then you have a hole where your heart should be. If you hate everything Billy Wilder ever did, you have no soul, heart, or brain-- you're just a retarded stick with opposable thumbs. In other words, I hate you if you hate Billy Wilder.<br /><br />Wilder was and always will be one of the greatest writer-directors that Hollywood has ever known. Some of you are forgetting the purpose of film-- to take you away to a world that you didn't know and entertain you. That's what Billy did, only he made it funny, satirical, or both. Sunset Boulevard did get dull at points, but that's life. If you don't want movies to be somewhat real, go delude yourself and watch Teletubbies. Personally, I wish that someone would bring Billy back from the dead to make another movie and make all of the people who probably enjoyed Disaster Movie appreciate his brilliance.<br /><br />So God, please send your son down here so that he can do that Lazarus thing and bring back Billy. We need him down here. With a new generation of Hannah Montana's that will marry Jonas Brother look-a-likes, I need Sunset Boulevard. Because it reminds me that Hollywood isn't perfect. It's real and imperfect just like the rest of life.<br /><br />I Heart Billy Wilder!
