This movie was sh1t. Like most of the crap we see about the war, it's very one sided. Based on facts? Not unless these facts have been proved. You could say that men in black was based on a true story. Doesn't make it true. I seriously doubt this is an accurate plot. Marines are some of the most law abiding people I know. The acting was a little dry from the commanders. I don't mind that though. All these guys would just go on a rampage enacting genocide? No I don't think so. I gave it 3 points only because it looked good. I also liked how the movie made the marines have a prayer after the insane slaughter of civilians who clearly had no weapons. No one even twitched, or thought twice about it rofl. This guy makes Micheal Moore look good. If thats even possible. The brits here have had it so one sided and spewed down their throats by so many "documentaries" rofl that don't even try to keep a non-bias, it's no wonder some of the other reviews here think of this movie as non-bias. Very laughable. You have seen one too many Vietnam movies.
