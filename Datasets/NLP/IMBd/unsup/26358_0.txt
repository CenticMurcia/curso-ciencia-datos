Yardsigns comments on "Prince and the showgirl" contain errors.<br /><br />There are no shouts of "Violence!" The cry is "Vivat - Vivat - Vivat" followed ,though not in the film, by "Rex",=King] or "Regina",= Queen, as appropriate; meaning "The King ,or Queen,Lives!" There are no thundering "canons".A "canon" is a priestly appointment. Yardsign obviously means "Cannon". The Abbey scenes are an incompetent mix of studio fake, and real shots of Queen Elizabeth's coronation in 1953. The whole caboodle was shoved in to boost ticket sales in the U.S.A. as "Olde Englande" was very popular with American audiences at that time. Being an ill-conceived add-on. the Abbey scenes are weak and let the film down. I would nominate the seduction scenes as best displaying Marilyns genius as a comic actress. What a shame she had only a short and witless dance routine and that dreary fourth-rate apology for a song. A waste of her talents.
