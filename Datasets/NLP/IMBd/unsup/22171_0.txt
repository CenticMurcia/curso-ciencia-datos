Here is a list of my favourite things to do with films.<br /><br />My favourite director is John Woo My favourite actor is Chow Yun-Fat. I like films with artfully choreographed gunplay. I like long action sequences. I like a slight bit of martial arts but not too much. Good photography. The sense that the director gave a damn about the film. The sense that the actors are just as hard as the characters. Exciting editing. but not too over the top.<br /><br />To name but a few. The conclusion is HARD BOILED KICKS ASS!!!It features all of the above and more. Chow Yun-Fat matchstick gritted between teeth. 2 9mms and carving his way through hordes of badguys. who truly deserve to die. Is it just me or is he the coolest guy ever to walk the planet. It is tricky to go through all the things that make this film great, every second was mind blowing and it is near impossible to put into words how good this film is. Normally when I see a film I'm dissapointed. "Oh I would have done it like that" or "I would have missed that bit out" Often I'll go not expecting much and not get much. sometimes I'll go expecting alot and get nothing, Rarely I'll see a film expecting it to be awful and it's not that bad. But this, I had such high expectations from this film, I didn't think a film could be as good as what I expected. I was amazed that it was better. A masterpiece. go get it now. 10/10. Can't you see what I'm saying it's brilliant. However there was one minor flaw Chow Yun-Fat should have worn a big black trenchcoat.
