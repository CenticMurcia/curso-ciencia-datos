Luxo Jr. is a wonderful example of why people still prefer cartoons from 50 and 60 years ago to today's material. The problem is simple: these new cartoons, such as Pixar ones, aren't funny! Oh, they may be clever as anything, but funny? Not really, so it misses the mark because 98 percent of the human population watches a cartoon to get some laughs.<br /><br />To describe this two-minute animated short as "ingenious" and/or "innovative" is a lot more laughable than the cartoon itself. All it was, was Pixar lamp watching his little child lamp play with a rubber ball for a minute We see a lamp hit the ball and then hop along and then jump on it. <br /><br />Wow. I have news for those who thought this was "ingenious." Drawing Inanimate objects coming to life is as old as cartoons itself, so what's "innovative" about this?<br /><br />You want innovation? Watch Felix The Cat silent cartoon from the early 1920s - 85 years ago. That was innovative, as were tons of Looney Tunes and Pink Panther cartoons....plus we laughed a lot more, This "cartoon" is nothing.
