Avoid this movie! I saw this film as part of a press screening in San Francisco. At the time of this writing, it had not been released yet in the theaters here. This film will be appreciated by unsophisticated, young, art students with angst and a pack of Gauloise non-filter cigarettes, but not by anyone else, unless they're Norwegian. (Norwegians are so happy to see a film in that language that they temporarily lose their common sense) Beautifully shot and very well acted, this film makes for a frustrating evening spent. The entire audience was muttering as they left the screening. Some were visibly angry for having been suckered into the screening. As it appears to have absolutely flawless accolades everywhere *before release*, it appears that their publicity machine has been working overtime to pump up what is essentially 103 minutes of wasted time. (That actress is quite pretty, by the way. Let's hope that she gets a better script next time)
