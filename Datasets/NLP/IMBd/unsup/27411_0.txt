The only likenesses between Predator and this piece of rotten-cheese are: the jungle, the soldiers, aliens creatures.<br /><br />Unfortunately these ingredients are mixed so badly with stupid and clich√® lines and unopportune shots that I wonder what was the screenwriter thinking about while he wrote this cheese.I.e.: what about the long and senseless scene of the soldier with the snake into his pants while the main character of the movie watch it and takes fun of him instead of helping? We are supposed to smile and thrill at the same time, but in reality all that scene is simply idiotic and it's a misplaced step that bring us to hate that character since the starting.<br /><br />If you liked "Predator" then go and watch "Predator 2", that was an interesting follow up (although missing the presence of Schwarzenegger) ... but watch "Code Red" ONLY if you like a descent into "C movies". <br /><br />Vote 3/10
