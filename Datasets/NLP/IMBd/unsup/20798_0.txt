I first saw this Three Stooges short when I bought the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 3, and so this is one of the first ones that I watched on the first disc, and I can say a lot of things in this short film's favor! I can say that it is excellent, it is a very funny Three Stooges film that is very filled with hysterical moments and everything that is typical from the Three Stooges! This is one Three Stooges short that I can say that the frontier has never been this funny, except in the world of the Three Stooges, in that world, a lot of very funny and hysterical things can occur! I really love a lot of the Three Stooges shorts that I have seen, with both Curly as the Third Stooge and Shemp as the Third Stooge, I haven't seen Joe Besser as the Third Stooge and I don't intend to, because I heard that he was not funny, he was totally annoying from what I heard. This is another of their best shorts from the early 1940's! <br /><br />Out of all of the Three Stooges shorts that I have watched and loved in my life, I can say that though there are some shorts that I like better than others, I can not say that I have seen one Three Stooges short that I have hated, I love all of the ones that I have seen, and I believe that is a very good thing that I have! I just do not know where I would be without the Three Stooges, because I would not know about all of those gags and pratfalls that they did! <br /><br />10/10
