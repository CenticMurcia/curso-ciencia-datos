Tooth and Nail is a horror movie that is neither scary nor interesting. So what's the point of watching it supposed to be? A few guys dressed up in costumes that make them look like rejects from Michael Jackson's old "Beat It" music video amble through a hospital. Occasionally open their mouths to show big fake yellow teeth whilst grunting and groaning. The leaders, Michael Madsen and Vinnie Jones, ham it up in a couple of brief scenes a bit more than the "standard" "Beat It" rejects, and while that is marginally entertaining for about 5 seconds, it hardly makes for a worthwhile movie. They have such dialogues as: "We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way. I don't really care which way. But by sunrise, I'm gonna be gnawing on your bones!" ; and; "Let's play a game. Hide and seek. You hide, I seek. And if I find ya, I'm gonna eat ya!!!" <br /><br />When one character tells a cannibal "I am going to kill you", the cannibal replies "Not if I eat you first."<br /><br />Clearly the dialogue of Tooth and Nail is abysmal. There's isn't anything else going for it either. The acting ranges from terrible to mediocre. Madsen is a great actor but there isn't really anything he can do to get any mileage out of such terrible dialogue and a dire script.<br /><br />The whole movie takes place in about 3 different rooms in a hospital and a few connecting hallways. Therefore, there isn't anything interesting going on visually.<br /><br />Tooth and Nail looks as if it is a real-life film student's home made class project and sounds as if it has dialogue written by the student's younger sibling after the student partied too much the night before it was due to be able to write it himself.<br /><br />The main characters are completely uninteresting and stupid. You probably won't care at all if any of them live or die. You may even find yourself rooting for the cannibals, because at least their hammy performances hold a small degree of comedy value in a "This is Uwe Boll-level bad" kind of way. The main characters, aka Foragers, have no redeeming qualities to make them worthwhile in the least bit.<br /><br />Tooth and Nail is one of the worst horror movies there is.
