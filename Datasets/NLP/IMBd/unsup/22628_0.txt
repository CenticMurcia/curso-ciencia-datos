Finally had a chance to see it. Goulet and Howes have such rich voices. Production values are 1960's, but if you get away from the fact that they are singing/acting on a set, what a joy to see. Definitely plays better as a musical then the dance/musical of Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse (although that version would have been great, too, if they didn't film it on a set.<br /><br />Also, Peter Falk plays Goulet's friend. And he's not just comic relief - he actually acts and is the voice of logic for Goulet, who believes he may be hopelessly in love. The songs are thoughtful, wistful, even sad in a heroic way.
