Watched the world premier at the Toronto Film Festival.<br /><br />You are drawn into this dark movie and cannot turn away. The performances by Jannik Lorenzen, Jesper Asholt and Julie Kolbeck are spellbinding. The movie is shown from the point of view of 10 year old Allan (Jannik), giving a very unique perspective on this messed up family. Director Peter Sch√∏nau Fog really pulls this together.<br /><br />Jannik Lorenzen is an incredible actor. This was his debut film, and I think that he's is equal most other child actors today. I really hope to see him in more films.<br /><br />Jesper Asholt plays a challenging role, the evil and disturbed father, with incredible conviction.<br /><br />The cinematography and directing are first rate, this is not a low budget or low quality film.<br /><br />Apparently based on the life of the book author, which is pretty disturbing too.<br /><br />It's too bad this Danish movie (with English subtitles) will be unavailable to most North American's...
