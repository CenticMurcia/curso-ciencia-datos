This impressive time capsule of late-seventies/early-eighties NY is poignant at times, but still fun to watch. On the surface it's an anti-establishment teen film, but at its heart there is a deeper message about having confidence in yourself in spite of what others want you to believe to be true about who you are.<br /><br />Alan Moyle creates a moving sophomore directorial effort, while Robin Johnson, Trini Alvarado, and Tim Curry shine in their well-developed roles. Robin Johnson especially gives a great and underrated performance.<br /><br />If you have a soft side for 1980's teen films, do not miss this one.
