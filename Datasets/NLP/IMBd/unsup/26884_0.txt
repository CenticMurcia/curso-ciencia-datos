First things first. This movie is clearly done in a style in which bad acting and a bad script are over dramatized to create a potential cult classic. The problem is it's just too annoying to enjoy. The acting comes across as something from an elementary school production, and the script seems like it was written by several people who didn't collaborate. Granted, the movie was made over four years, and its easy to lose track of what you are doing. The budget of $20,000 wouldn't do anyone justice, and that $20,000 didn't even come all at once, so I understand the problems. Not a great movie, but a lot of great directors had some rather questionable material come out of their first hours behind a camera.<br /><br />That said, Rusty Nails is a great guy. I saw this movie at a film festival that he hosted. He's a witty, funny guy and doesn't strike you as a person who makes bad movies. He can hold his own in front of an audience. I really want to say, judge this movie, not its maker.
