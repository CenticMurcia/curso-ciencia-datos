Jamie's foray into celibacy parallels the modern woman's foray into feminist sexuality. The last generation of feminists fought the battle of sexuality on men's terms: we can f*ck for fun just like they can! The emphasis was on doing what men do the way men do, in the workplace and in the bedroom.<br /><br />Jamie is the an icon of the young women today who are reconsidering and rebelling against this "feminism" which is centered around a masculine idea of success. These women are staying home with their children and reclaiming control over their sexuality. Jamie's sexual adventures are emotionally unfulfilling so she takes a pledge of celibacy for 90 days. She falls in love with a quality man during this time, and through this relationship comes to terms with her past sexual behavior and its repercussions.<br /><br />So far, sounds like a chick flick, right? The one relevant theme this film fails to illuminate is the universality of Jamie's journey. It is not a woman's journey, it is a human journey through the landscape of sexuality, and the value we assign to this most intimate of relations.
