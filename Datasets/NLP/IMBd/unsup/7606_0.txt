So many people at their peaks produced this classic - Lubitsch, Hecht, March, Cooper, Hopkins, Horton and Paramount, getting it past the Hays Office just before its peak. Personally I regard Lubitsch's Trouble In Paradise from the year before as one of the best films ever made, but this is certainly one of his best pieces of work too.<br /><br />Miriam Hopkins meets fellow Americans Gary Cooper and Frederic March on board a French train, and after an odd beginning their relationship develops into love. She loves the pair of them and they both love her, but whilst plenty of gaiety was displayed by all three there was no gayness between Cooper and March. I don't know if Noel Coward approved. The three agree to a gentlemen's agreement of No Sex, which is maintained, broken and for the benefit of the Hays Office re-established in the orgasmic climax in the taxi which re-visits the orgasmic climax in the taxi of Trouble In Paradise. There's no music in the film itself  but for the occasional dead section where people are going up stairs or dropping theatrically onto sofas for instance you could just supply some of the background music from Trouble In Paradise from your head. The actors are all delightful in their roles, especially Miriam Hopkins playing the blonde who decides not to decide. It's a charming albeit pretty frank theme expertly handled by Lubitsch, slyly toying with his audience as usual, though I suppose if he could come back today and re-make it that any charm would be lost in graphic scenes of sex and violence  back then it was discipline that was required instead.<br /><br />What does it all mean  Three is the Magic Number! It also means this is a beautiful film, sure with a few minor faults mainly associated with a few stodgy stagey scenes, but well worth the watch at least for being out of the ordinary.
