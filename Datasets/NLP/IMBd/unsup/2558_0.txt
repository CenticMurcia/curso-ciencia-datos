I think that score's fair. There was something voyeuristic for me about this film as I have met people similar to the poor unfortunate deceased. I didn't expect a lot from it but it was the best film I'd seen out of the last 10 I've watched.<br /><br />The central actor (Paddy Consadine) played his part perfectly never really letting you into his head. Not entirely unpredictable story BUT still a good story. And I think that's why this film succeeds; because it has a good story.<br /><br />I don't really understand some of the low scores for this film. I guess that it may not translate outside of Britain due to the characters involved?<br /><br />Next film Paddy/Meadows please. Recommended.
