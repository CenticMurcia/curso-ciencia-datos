The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones is great. It was on TV before it went on to video. Its what got me into history for GCSE. I'm glad it's on video because they hardly put it on the telly. If you are a movie buff then you know George Lucas is the daddy of films and this just proves it. I'm a big fan of the movies and a big fan of the TV series. The episodes are like films, this series is truly great TV and Sean Patrick Flanery is a fantastic actor and I'm going to make sure he is going to be in my films. Also the action is great with some of the first every special effects on the TV thanks to Lucas Film. Also the first episode the Mexican revolution is great and is like A Fist Full of Dynamite. The Internet movie database could do better by sorting out which order the TV series goes in. Bruce
