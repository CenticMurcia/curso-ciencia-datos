Someone said: China's king of action, Japan's king of horror, and Korea's king of comedy. I said, what? and watched ATTACK THE GAS STATION. MY GOD WAS I WRONG! KOREA EARNS THE TITLE ALL THE WAY! I thought SHAOLIN SOCCER was hilarious. I thought, er, no Japanese comedies come to mind--oh, yes, SHALL WE DANCE was hilarious (back then), but nothing beats ATTACK THE GAS STATION in pure lunatic fun!! It's like watching JACKASS:THE MOVIE, with a plot that's really good and unpredictable!!<br /><br />If you claim to be PUNK, watch this movie.<br /><br />If you've got HOT BLOOD in your veins, watch this movie.<br /><br />If you've got FRIENDS who'll back you ALL THE WAY, this movie's about you!<br /><br />If you're an ANARCHIST, you're gonna wet your pants and scream with JOY!<br /><br />IF Someone's p***ing you OFF right now in your LIFE, this movie is your THERAPY!!!<br /><br />ATTACK!! ATTACK!!
