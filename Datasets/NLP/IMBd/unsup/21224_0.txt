I watched Hood Angels last months as a couple of friends decided to put the movie on.<br /><br />There are three main female characters in the film (Cinnamon, Felicia and Traci) who all get involved in bad situations but through innocent circumstances come together after they are sent to prison.<br /><br />I believe that the film did have some potential as the main character Cinnamon tries to uncover the truth about her brothers murder and there are one or two twists along the way. The main antagonist in the film is Shayla who has instigated a lot of the trouble and she can be quite a bitch at times. Her cat fight with Felicia is probably one of the best fight scenes in the film.<br /><br />There were however some disappointments, the acting could have been improved between some of the characters as they could have had more personality and the effects could have been a little better, also there is not a lot of action in the film until the final half an hour which is worth seeing.<br /><br />Sadly i can only give this film 4 out of 10.
