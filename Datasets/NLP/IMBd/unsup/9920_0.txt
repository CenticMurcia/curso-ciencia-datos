I am a fan of DJG/ Dae Jang Geum/ Da Changjin. A huge one! Last year, I watched those movies on ch 55, avoiding DJG at all costs, because one of my friends told me,"So ancient...don't watch!" One night, I was bored out of my brain. I switched to ch 55, and guess what was playing- DJG. Since I was so bored, I decided to watch anyway(This is the one when the miso tastes funny; in a bad way, so Jang Geum and Han Sang Goong investigates). And holy crap: I was drawn to it. I stared at the TV until the end, and I was officially HOOKED.<br /><br />Every night, I watched watched watched... even 'preaching' to my friends about it. The friend who told me not to watch it was also hooked. In fact, practically my whole class was hooked.<br /><br />This drama series is both funny and soul touching. Lee Young Ae is a great actress; it is undeniable. Choi Pan Sool, the merchant who monopolized the palace's goods, has such solid acting that every time I see him angry, I feared that he would burst a blood vessel! Truly memorable.<br /><br />This is about the story of Jang Geum, a palace maid who is an orphan, but adopted by Kang Dook Gu and his wife, 'Qiuxiang', I assume (It is later mentioned that when Jang Geum's house was raided by Yin Mojie's men, all letters were taken, and all of them were love letters from Kang Dook Gu to his wife, and the letter always starts with 'Blah blah blah Qiuxiang'. That part is HILARIOUS). She is exceptionally bright and goes under the wing of Han Sang Goong. However, due to Chois' meddling, the two were exiled to Jeju island as slave-servants, in which Han Sang Goong died on the way. Jang Geum then trained to be a Medical Lady, because it was the only way a slave-servant can enter the palace. After much work, Jang Geum manages to re-enter the palace and meet up with her old friends. But when Choi Sang Goong and her gang find out, they try in vain to drive Jang Geum out. During the time Jang Geum was a Medical Lady, she contributed much, and in recognition of her work, King Jungjong bestowed on her an official title. She was the first and last woman to gain an official title and be the King's principal physician. However, in the end, she chose the path of a commoner. Waaaaaaa.......I wish she didn't.<br /><br />Leaves you wanting more, doesn't it?
