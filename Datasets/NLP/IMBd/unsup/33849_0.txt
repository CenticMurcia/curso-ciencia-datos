Despite the pedigree, this version of the classic newspaper story is a real stumble by the great Billy Wilder. It's a head scratcher why he would even want to make it. He's one of the movie's funniest, most talented, and above all, most original voices, so why remake an old warhorse like this? Walter Matthau is the shifty editor and Jack Lemmon is his ace reporter. Matthau wants Lemmon to cover the execution of a local radical, but Lemmon wants to leave town and marry Susan Sarandon. Matthau is funny but Lemmon is really at sea with this...he stutters over his dialog, is way too old for Sarandon (who has NOTHING to do) and actually does not have all that much screen time with Matthau. All that aside, there is a great supporting cast to relish, including David Wayne (very funny as a fuss-bucket reporter), Vincent Gardenia, Cliff Osmond, Austin Pendleton, and a few others. There's also a pretty disposable appearance by Carol Burnett as a hooker!
