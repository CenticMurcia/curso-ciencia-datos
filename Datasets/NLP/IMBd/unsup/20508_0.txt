I actually saw this movie on a trans-Pacific flight - first thing I thought, when it came on, was that it merely had the same name as the French Taxi movies I love so much. Next, when I saw the opening sequence was nearly identical, I started to get worried that the original had been remade and destroyed by Hollywood. I was right!<br /><br />If you watch this movie without prior knowledge of the French Taxi movies, you may or may not like it. It's a fresh idea and a fun movie. The acting wasn't great, but at least non-serious roles like this don't require top-grade acting. What made this movie horrible, though, is that it just didn't measure up to the originals (Taxi and Taxi 2). Even though I don't understand French, and my Taxi DVDs do not have subtitles, I still thoroughly enjoy them, as they are packed full of exciting car chases and slapstick humour. They are both incredibly tightly-packaged movies - they never lose my attention. The remake had several completely unnecessary scenes inserted, was full of bad jokes, and to top it off, had far less interesting cars.<br /><br />Though this movie is useful in helping you understand the Taxi story (if you don't understand French), I must urge anyone to watch the originals as well/instead!
