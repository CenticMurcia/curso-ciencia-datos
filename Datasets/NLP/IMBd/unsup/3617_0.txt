This crime-time travel movie was interesting all the way, but I can't help thinking it could have been much better. There were just too many holes in this story, too many clich√©s and implausible things that made it less enjoyable than it could have been. <br /><br />It wasn't an intelligent time-travel story, not like "Frequency," or "Somewhere In Time" or a bunch of others. For instance, when the killer has his two adversaries right in front of him and walks away without checking to see if they are dead, it isn't smartly written. When everything important happens at the last possible second, literally, then it's too contrived. The movie is filled with contrivances, and it's too bad because it good have been an excellent film. <br /><br />Hey, I like happy endings, too, but this is too much and an insult to any viewer's intelligence.<br /><br />For pure amusement, I recommend this. You'll be entertained. But don't be surprised if your intelligence is insulted a number of times.
