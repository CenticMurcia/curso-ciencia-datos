as fans stick up for it and say that haters don't understand its aims, I on the otherhand can understand its aims and the context and still think its a pile of rubbish. none of the depth and tales of wisdom that these images are meant to represent come across well enough, they whole movie smells of cheap cologne, its actually pretty boring and you really don't have to watch anymore than an hour of this rubbish as they narrative/story just don't exist. so he uses a car instead of heroine, or we are all to absorbed by technology, whatever, the film doesn't have enough to say to justify the running time of this ultimate fake arty farty rubbish. madonna in that film with the candle wax was more entertaining, and there are hundreds of films about addiction or technology with more panache and substance requiem for a dream, trainspotting, primer, . this should be burnt and just forgotten. i turned it off after 1hr 15. and then wrote this, cos i hate people who think this stuff is some how great, and if you don't like it, its because its just too cool to be appreciated. get over yourself Cronenberg, not saying the topic s not interesting but this is a lame attempt at film making from someone who really should know better.
