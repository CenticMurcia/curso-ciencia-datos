Lets face it, b-movies are a load of s**te. Well, not all of them, because Drive is one of those cheap (around $4 million) movies with relatively unknown actors (Mark Dacascos, anyone?) - but its actually quite good!<br /><br />The story is a run-of-the-mill near-future plot: A bio-enhanced hero on the run from a gang of hitmen hired by the corporation that created (and wants back) the device inside him (which makes him stronger and faster) teams up with a lonely black man whose life gets worse by the minute and goes on a journey across the US of A to find a corporation that can remove the device inside him.<br /><br />Plotwise, its nothing spectacular, but with the well-choreograped martial arts action, you forgive the cliches of the story and get sucked in by the entertainment value.<br /><br />The actings not bad either. Dacascos (who is, I've discovered, a king of straight-to-video movies) outdoes similar actors (Van Damme) where the acting is concerned, and is also a great fighter. Hardison also shines by adding humour to the fray and Pyper-Ferguson has a certain charisma and presence as the bad guy.<br /><br />Drive definitely puts many major action blockbusters through its paces... 8/10.
