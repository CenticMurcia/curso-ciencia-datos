As an 11 year old boy with an over-active imagination, this film was a massive treat to behold. The acting was believable, the effects were good and the music was very moving (whilst they were building the Thunder Road/on their maiden voyage). I would like to think that any child would be v. entertained and possibly inspired by this film, as much as I was.
