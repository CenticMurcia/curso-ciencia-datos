If you mind languages other than english, watch movies about music to comment the special effects, think that women with hairy armpits should be put away, prefer dancers that are anorectic and not "bulky" or "big boned" this is NOT he movie for you. Go see American Pie or something.<br /><br />If you like music, this is a FANTASTIC movie to watch. Read the "credited cast" list and you will be surprised at the big names that have taken part in this movie. I bought the CD a few years ago and it is still in my top 10 list.<br /><br />There is a little documentary information in there somewhere, but it all gets crushed under the artists fantastic performances of Kurt Weill Music.
