The first installment of Resident Evil was true enough to the video game to make it a great movie. The movie did not really concentrate on "The Resident Evil" meaning the house that was haunted by zombies. Although the zombie virus was created by Umbrella,... the video game concentrated on the fact that the mansion was infested with zombies. That made it "Resident Evil". The mansion was haunted by a resident that was evil,.... But the first movie was good because it had stayed true to the fact that zombies (whatever the virus infect-ant was) were the main theme. Resident Evil (the first movie) was really good. I'd give it a 8.5 on the movie scale.
