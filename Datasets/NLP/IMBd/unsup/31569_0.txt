I watched the movie because it is casting DeNiro but it looks like all actors need money and they play also in bad movies. I was expecting more, because i was missing DeNiro, but it seems like "disappointment" is the word that describes this film. "Hide and seek" reminds me of "The Others" with Nicole Kidman - there is no action but there is suspense that makes you think at a lot of things, and in the end a stupid idea comes out. Of course there is something interesting in this film. The performance of little Dakota Fanning (Emily Callaway) is extraordinary. I cannot imagine how a 11 year old girl can act as good as her. I surely hope that she will grow to be a first class actress, because we really need some!!!
