This was one of the best films I have seen in quite some time.It was very easy to get caught up in the story.The children captured my heart,even though at times they were dreadful little monsters. Emma Thompson was magnificent as the loving and caring Nanny McPhee.The story,the casting,and the writing,all came together to make this a perfectly enchanting film.Every actor/actress brought something wonderful,that made them more than just two dimensional characters pulled from the pages of a book. If you haven't seen it yet,I recommend that you do.Even if you don't have a child to share this movie with, you will enjoy the very endearing Nanny McPhee(warts and all).
