This is one of the most baffling movies... I paid the full $7.50 to see it knowing it wasn't going to be the best... but Hey! John Malkovich... you know... how bad can it be? ... ... I was utterly stunned by the degree of ineptness Julia Roberts displayed in what was obviously supposed to be her vehicle. Malkovich is thoroughly uninspired and under-used, but you can't blame everything on the director... he probably could have tried harder... or at all. I spent a good two or so days trying to forget this movie ever existed but it remains to this day... and I still want my 7.50 back
