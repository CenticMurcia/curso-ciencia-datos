The first time I saw this movie I thought it was entertaining. The second time I saw this movie I rolled laughing. The third time I saw this movie I thought it was the most ingenious comedy I had ever seen. Now, every time I watch this movie it just gets funnier and funnier. Many people think that it is lame or cheesy. The point of the movie is to be cheesy. It's a satire of early American life. As far as the historical relevance and the mentality of people in America at that point in time, it's astonishingly accurate. Matthew Perry's character is supposed to represent bureaucratical society, while Chris Farley embodies the lower class American "pioneer." In truth, it is a fantastic representation poking fun at the "way things were." Cheesy as it may be, it was intended- and lives up to its intentions with comedic splendor. A+
