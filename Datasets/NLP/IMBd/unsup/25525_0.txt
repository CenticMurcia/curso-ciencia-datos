The psychiatrist Dr. Lila Colleti (Gina Gershon) works in a penitentiary, where the prisoners like her, and is divorced. Her ex-husband Paul (Nick Boraine) and she are disputing the custody of their two daughters in court, and Paul wins the dispute of the girls. Paul moves the daughters to his place and Lila becomes depressive and upset, goes to a bar and uses drugs with alcohol, having a blackout. In the night, Paul and her mate are murdered, and Lila becomes the prime suspect of the crime. She accuses her manipulative patient Ed Baikman (Sean Patrick Flanery) to her boyfriend, Det. Macy Kobacek (Michael Biehn), but he is not sure of who is the assassin. "Borderline" is a good low budget thriller, having some flaws in the screenplay, but holding the attention of the viewer until the last scene. The forty years old Gina Gershon is still a very sexy woman and is another attraction in this above-average film. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Dist√∫rbio Mortal" ('Mortal Disturbance")
