Just bad. I'll refrain from giving it a one because I suppose the filmmakers must have done what they could with a budget ranging in the hundreds. <br /><br />Still, the story jumps around incoherently, the characters' motives are never logical or duly explained, and the poor direction is just a chore to watch. <br /><br />I doubt many people will even have to heed this warning, but stay away. Because it seems to be IMDb policy to not let a review through until it has 10 lines of text, not that anyone cares, I'll add a little more about what I thought of the movie. I thought it was the worst kind of movie junk, the kind that leaves you feeling soiled and unfulfilled after the final scene.
