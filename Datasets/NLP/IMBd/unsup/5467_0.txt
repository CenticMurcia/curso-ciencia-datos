good movie, although sometimes its hard to see the subtitles. the movie is about a priest who finds a secret message in the book of revelation, the day the anti-christ will be born. this movie is well paced and interesting. this movies interpretation of the devil is that of baphomet, a god the templar knights worshipped that priests accused of being the devil, though adapted by satanists to be used as the devil (search on the internet for baphomet and you can find a picture) throughout the movie alot of cult sybols are shown such as the pentagram and the eye of horus, showing that the director did at least a bit of research, they also mention a few bands at the beginning, one of them being iron maiden, and they play with the belief that a record played backwards can contain secret messages, but kind of mock it.anyway i would recommend this film to anyone interested in horror/mock horror/ or movies about the apocalypse/satan. the only problem i have with this movie is the ending is too clear for this kind of movie, it should have left the audience thinking about what happened.
