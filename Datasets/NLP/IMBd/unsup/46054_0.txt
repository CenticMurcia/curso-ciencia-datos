The discovery of strange tadpoles leads to the uncovering of a monster made of pollution which goes on the rampage and soon meets up with Godzilla.<br /><br />Though not the worst Godzilla film, this is never-the-less a let-down. Containing the first real metaphorical monster and the first human death scenes since the first Godzilla film, this could have been a return to the glory days. But sadly it's all let down by its camp atmosphere, ridiculous psychedelic images, extended concert scenes and that rather irritating young boy. Not to mention those pointless cartoons which turn Hedorah into a figure of fun rather than the serious threat he is supposed to be. The idea behind the film has potential, what with its atmospheric scenes of people being forced to flee their city, but the producers decided it might be too frightening and stuck in a load of deliberately silly nonsense. They ought to have made up their minds whether they were making a kids' film or a more sinister movie along the lines of the first Godzilla. Instead they adopt a kind of 'half-way-house' approach. The special effects are also disappointing, the film gets pretty slow later on and the dire music is completely at odds with what's happening on-screen. A wasted opportunity.
