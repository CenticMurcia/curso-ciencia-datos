Gong-Li and film making partner Zhang Yimou have another fine hit; in a series that is beautiful filmmaking as well as one the government would find disapproving of the reality of triads.<br /><br />She plays a "moll" , also a singing star triggering more than an ample reward for the conniving under bosses who would try to topple the boss.<br /><br />Stunningly photographed and acted, maybe near the Hang Zhou coast (or a rare unfilled canal in Shanghai?) ... with his beautiful concubine, and the narrative device of a young male orphan as fellow observer; the Boss hits the mattresses due to an attempted murder from within; and retires to an island to discern the traitor giving orders to kill anyone who arrives or leaves the island without his permission.<br /><br />Then the Boss waits, and Gong-Li idles no longer singing in the cabaret; and the "smoke out" begins.<br /><br />Excellent poignant drama sensitively photographed.<br /><br />As in all her films, and the directors, the people as bystanders and victims of any corruption is a subtle attended theme!
