I rated this film a "2" because Sharon Stone wants soooo bad to give a "great", "oscar-winning" type performance.<br /><br />So many gaffes in this production and I am surprised what with Sidney Lumet's track record that he allowed it.<br /><br />See the first "gloria" with Gena Rowlands - it is much, much better. However, if you like Sharon Stone, she is okay in this movie.
