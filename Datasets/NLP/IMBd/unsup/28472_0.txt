With the pedigreed authors and actors involved, I was expecting something very special from Common Ground. But, as I watched it, I was reminded of the propaganda films they showed in junior high and high school about the evils of drugs, and the threat of venereal disease. The script and direction were just about of that caliber. And the message seemed to be that being homosexual, in and of itself, somehow makes one noble. What twaddle. And before any of the PC brigade accuses me of being homophobic, I am in fact homosexual. And as such, I found this movie a real embarrassment.
