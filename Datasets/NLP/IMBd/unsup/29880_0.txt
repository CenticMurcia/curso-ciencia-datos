I was very surprised at how good this movie was. My rottweiler, Lyric, who is now 13 years old was in this movie when she was 7 weeks old. I named her Lyric after the role of Jada Pinkett. Lyric went on to be an American/Canadian Champion. Her show name is Am/Ca CH. Von Traeger's Lyric. The movie took place in the 3rd Ward in Houston, Texas. It was awesome being on the set during the filming of this movie. I am looking at showing Lyric at the "Reliant Center World Dog Show" in Houston this next Month. She will be shown in Veterens Class 12 years and older. This is a rottweiler specialty show. Thank you for letting me share. Kerri
