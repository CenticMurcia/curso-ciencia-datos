Out of all the Blackadder series, this one was my favourite. My favourite character in it was General Melchett excellently played by Stephen Fry, but all of the other cast were down right brilliant as well. The writing was also top notch.<br /><br />It is World War 1. Captain Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson) is in charge of a trench where the occupants are- the scruffy Baldrick (Tony Robinson) and the over enthusiastic George (Hugh Laurie). Away from the trenches is Blackadder's boss General Melchett (Stephen Fry) and Captain Darling (Tim McInnery). The final episode sees Blackadder, Baldrick, George and Darling go over the top and get killed. That moment in my opinion is the most dramatic moment in a sitcom.<br /><br />All six episodes of this were hilarious. No matter how many times you see them, you can't stop laughing. They are very clever, full of intellectual hilarious gags.<br /><br />Best Episode: Private Planes- Series 1 episode 4: For the excellent guest appearances of Bottom duo Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmonson.
