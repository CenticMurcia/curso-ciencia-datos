The Last Mimzy is one of the most contrived movies i have ever seen, notwithstanding it being in the fantasy genre. And for a person who loves entertainment that is wholesome and positive in its outlook, this one made me nauseous. The acting is generally awful, except for Chris O'Neil (as Noah Wilder) who comes off best; he reminds me of the young Henry Thomas in E.T. The teacher and his companion played by Rainn Wilson and Kathryn Hahn make quite a funny pair as well, but that's about it. However, being a fan of both Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson, i was disappointed with their roles. I felt embarrassed for Timothy Hutton, a superb actor looking tired in a pitiful part. And i didn't even recognize Joely, despite the fact that i have met her in real life. I was hoping that The Last Mimzy would be something quirky like Zathura, but no such luck. By the end, i was just thinking: "Give me a break!"
