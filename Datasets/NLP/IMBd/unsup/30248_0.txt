I just finished watching this movie...and wow. It's very interesting, and it puts forth a different light on suffrage, one that I had never been privy to before. I never understood the depths that these women went to to give the right to vote for all. It's a beautiful movie, and is quite well done. The music makes it interesting as well, and there are plenty of emotional parts.<br /><br />Its a great movie and it makes you feel that these women fought for so much, and that the least we can do is vote.<br /><br />Great.<br /><br />
