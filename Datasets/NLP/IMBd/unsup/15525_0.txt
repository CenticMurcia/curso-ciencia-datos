Aquaman a.k.a. Mercy Reef sucks! Don't know where where these good reviews are coming from, mass hysteria maybe? Acting isn't bad, Ving Rhames is the stand out but the lines the writers have them saying are dreadful, and the exposition is simply pathetic. The scene introducing the obvious love interest, Lt. Torres, made me laugh it was so bad. "These orders come from way above my head" (what, to do a flyover?) "This is not the LPGA Torres, you tee off with the men!" Glad it wasn't picked up for a series, from the same folk that brought you Smallville but nowhere near as good.<br /><br />Watch it if you want to see how not to make a TV show.
