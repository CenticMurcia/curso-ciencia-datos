"Cutting Class," the directorial debut of "Excalibur" screenwriter Rospo Pallenberg, receives a failing grade because it doesn't know what it wants to be: a slasher flick, a comedy, a teen drama, or a hybrid of all three. Add to that, so much potential arises within the script by Steve Slavkin for satirical jabs at the high school movie experience that you find yourself, when the movie mindlessly passes over these moments, banging your head against the wall at such wasted opportunities.<br /><br />It's as if the filmmakers were cutting film school class themselves. But the movie isn't all bad, with some nice production values and some gory special effects-laden deaths, it helps keep it from being a complete bore. "Cutting Class," however, still receives a failing grade in my book when you think the movie couldn't get any more tedious, when it reverts to type and descends into typical slasher/haunted house movie territory in the third act. And don't forget about some gratuitous female nudity as well (so keep your eyes peeled).<br /><br />The story surrounds a would-be love triangle between high school outcast Brian Woods (Donovan Leitch), cheerleader Paula Carson (Jill Schoelen), and her basketball-hunk boyfriend Dwight Ingalls (Brad Pitt). Brian and Dwight were once the best of friends, but that turned sour when Brian was accused of murdering his abusive father and as a result was sent away to a mental institution for a few years. Now that he's been released, it isn't long before a series of gruesome murders begin occurring on campus and low and behold, Brian is the main suspect.<br /><br />"Cutting Class" does has some pretty cool deaths - a burning in a pottery kiln, an impaling here, a death-by-copy machine there, an ax to the brain - that are flawlessly executed. Most of these deaths happen to men who are apparently connected in some way to the lovely Paula Carson. Most of these men are in fact obsessed with Paula, including Principal Dante (Roddy McDowall), which is a little disturbing. The main problems arise in the tediousness of a whodunit that's all too obvious in the end. The performances are mostly below average. The worst of these is poor Donovan Leitch as Brian Woods. The film builds him up to be a sympathetic, misunderstood outsider but instead he turns out to be way too creepy, sneaking around in the dark and even once appearing in Paula's bathroom as she washes her hair.<br /><br />"Cutting Class," perhaps if the filmmakers weren't busy cutting class themselves during their film school years, maybe they could have made a better than average teen slasher flick.<br /><br />3/10
