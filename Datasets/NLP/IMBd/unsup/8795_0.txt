I recently had the opportunity to view this movie via DVD screener from one of my friends whom is in the Industry. In consideration of the film's budget, i thought it was a well put together movie. Keep in mind, Jason Yee went from Professional Fighter to Entertainer. Jason being relatively new to the industry, i felt his efforts to achieve such goals need be commended. Thinking from a Martial Arts perspective, I very much enjoyed how he kept the fight scenes in check with reality. both Jason & Kung are True Fighting Warriors that always keep it Real! Now, if your some Hollywood peon judging movies by how much special effects can do it justice? Go watch a Hollywood Jet Li movie or WWF Raw. i enjoyed the movie for what it was & look forward to any upcoming films from Jason. I noticed other comments left by very shallow and closed minded people. if you think on those terms, you need to get together and go Bowling with Simon from American Idol. 85 minutes worth! Always keep it Real! L.A.M.F.F.S.U.T.D.
