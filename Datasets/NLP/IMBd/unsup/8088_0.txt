I would definitely recommend this film, if not for its cutely romantic outlook, or its refreshingly talented stars, I'd give it a thumbs-up just because it's English. Granted, I haven't seen a whole lot of British television or film, but it seems that everything I have seen has been either outlandishly funny or suicidally dramatic. English romance always seems to fall under the second, and sometimes numbingly depressing, idea. How wonderful, then, that I should run into this quiet little movie, which, although I will admit that Boise, Idaho is not the largest outlet for foreign film, I don't remember ever being released in my area. I remembered Mr. Sewell vaguely from "Hamlet," and have longed to see Mr. Fiennes in a film since "Shakespeare in Love," but never remember seeing Ms. Potter in anything, and I am sure that I never seen Mr. Hollander before. While I would not lie and say that this is a profound film and that there is anything to be learned from it or much to be thought of after seeing it, it would be only natural to praise it for its pure movie-like, feel-good quality, a small escape from the everyday. It resembles little, other than the highly implausible plot, of a Hollywood film. American romantic comedies seem built according to specifications designed only to provoke that slightly nervous, overly sweet feeling in the majority of female audience members. They usually have all the weight of a Twinkie, and leave one wondering how something so simple could be so utterly manufactured. This movie is more like a Wheat Thin, possibly underrated, certainly rather bland looking, but somehow much more satisfying and although it comes salty or in low sodium flavors, is surprisingly sweet without a trace of gooeyness. Hope yet for slightly awkward American girls.
