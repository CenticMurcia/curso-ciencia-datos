This is quite possibly the worst drug movie that i have had the displeasure to watch. This is the kind of dumb crap that sets the legalization movement back decades. Completely unrealistic! There is no substance to this at all. This not even close to anything that could be construed as a movie about pot. not even trippin' would be this fricken stupid. I would rather watch Miley Cyrus on the Disney channel. Posers and only posers would find this movie funny or entertaining. I cant believe that John Kranski was in this turd of a movie. What a waste of my time. If you disagree with my comments, i would appreciate it if you would respond to me and let me know your thoughts.
