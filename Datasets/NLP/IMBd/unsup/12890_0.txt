Having performed the role of "Ruth" at secondary school, I have many fond memories of "The PoP". This hysterical Australian version of the operetta had me laughing aloud. How wonderful to see the art of Gilbert and Sullivan brought forward around 100 years! The jokes, the facial expressions, the modernisms, the tempo and lyric changes, the movement... all done to entertain. My classical musician husband also watched and thoroughly enjoyed the humour and theatricals. My young children watched, sang along and laughed - consider the effect a Victorian operetta would normally have on 3 kids more interested in SpongeBob and Yu-Gi-O?! Days later they were still singing away. The adaptation works for me. But I'm not a purist. I like to have a bit of fun and colour in my life, I appreciate good singing (being trained myself) and I see no reason why I should drag my kids into Victorian times when it can travel towards us!
