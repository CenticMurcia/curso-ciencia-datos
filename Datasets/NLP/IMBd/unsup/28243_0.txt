This tackles animation in a different way from a lot of the past recent animated films.<br /><br />It is a beautifully crafted piece with a great and crisp finish to the feel, movement and enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Touching in places with good characters. More of a serious cartoon with fewer laughs than found in typical animated films.<br /><br />It is a good light introduction to Manga although there are many types of Manga animation styles. This is built up using a multitude of emotions, felt by all the main characters and filtering a few layers down giving it a very real world feel despite it being shown in the future.<br /><br />It is not hard to imagine this almost being a real possibility for the future. However, you can still feel the fantasy of it. With that you can draw between the lines and see how this could have been done on the flip side, turning it into a bright, fun, funny and cutesy too feel good extended cartoon.<br /><br />Good for all ages and fans of animation. A big screen treat. I will am very much looking forward to the BluRay release.
