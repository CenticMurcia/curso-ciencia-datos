I always regarded Hallmark as "the TV channel that I can skip over". That is until I saw this movie. I was lucky enough to flip past it just at the begining while I was waiting for my friend to get ready for a party we were supposed to go to. We didn't go. We watched this instead.<br /><br />After having seen as many movies as I (who hardly does anything else) this was a very welcome break from the monotony of the standard portrayal of the native americans. I am not a native american (or even american, I'm european) but still it was very nice to get to see "the other side of the story". Next to the story I need to applaud the many outstanding performances by the actors and actresses, of which regretably none so far is well known. Also to be noted is some exceptional cinematography combined with great special effects (for a TV movie).<br /><br />Great story, which has something to say. Great acting/directing. Great cinematic craftsmanship. What else could be asked from a movie?<br /><br />Had it been produced by a movie theater production company it would have become a huge hit, but unfortunately it will now probably be lost among the TV movie onslaught.<br /><br />If you have a chance to see this: take it.
