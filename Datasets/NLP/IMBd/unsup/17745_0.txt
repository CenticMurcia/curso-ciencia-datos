Having just watched this early '90s suspense thriller about computer hackers (I think) for the first time, I was partially confused about some scenes though overall, I was a little entertained by some of the comedy elements that were sprinkled throughout. My favorite was between Robert Redford and Lee Garlington as Dr. Elena Rhyskov whose room Redford broke into. He, with his gang's help talking over his earpiece, try to convince this doctor of his good intentions and how he doesn't want her paramour (a mathematician they're trying to catch red-handed) to know about them. I especially laughed when Redford substituted "help" for "head"! It was also good seeing Redford and Sidney Poitier in their only team-up though technically Poitier was supporting here. Dan Aykroyd was also funny about some "facts" only he believes. And most of the supporting cast, especially James Earl Jones, provided their own moments. So while I have reservations, I do recommend Sneakers.
