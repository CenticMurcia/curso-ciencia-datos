The Rock/Goldberg match was probably the best of the night it took ages for them to start but when they did it was a very intense match. The other good match or the best match was the first Team Angel/Eddie & Chavo the crowd were very dull and started to say "boring" to this match but they were all wrong cause the mat tallent of these guys was excellent and at the very amuzing end the crowd was cheering and really enjoyed the match. The 6 man tag match well I dont want to talk about that cause all I have got to say is swear words and im not allowed to do that.........why does HHH always use that sledgehammer stop it now you make me sick. Thge Big Show/Rey Mysterio I liked what Big Show did to Mysterio funny as hell. Womens match well Im silent, I hate Jazz. Lesnar/Cena good really but I hate Cena so much the rap thing isnt funny its annoying. I didnt like the raw tag match I dont like RVD and Kane together there not right together put them in a match against each other.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed Backlash very much but remember Backlash isnt the best PPV of them all in the past years.
