The first time i saw this movie was on cinemax 2 days before halloween. It has the best score and the filming is excellent. The plot keeps on going and never stops. Their is not one part in the whole film that is boring. I must say that since the first time i saw it I have bought it on tape and when I got a dvd player i bought it for that too. so if you are a true fan of horror you must see this film!
