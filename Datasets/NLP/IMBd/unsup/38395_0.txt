Perhaps I may not have understood many of the jokes that seemed to come from the anti-French sediment in the United States during the brief period this film was made, and I do mean brief. Of course the film is situated in Texas where they have to include every stereotypical character found in any other teenie bopper movie. No human being with an IQ over 40 could have written such crap, the script appears as if it was written by a few 14 yr old girls until you hear the out of place and unfunny sexual innuendos that are often said. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen (still not as bad as Glitter though). To sum up, don't waste your money and waste your time - instead go out and get some freedom fries and American made wine.
