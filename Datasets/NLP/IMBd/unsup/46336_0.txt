Just looking at the video box, which features a young woman with an axe raised in the air, you can probably guess what the film is going to consist of. Although the film isn't really ever boring and moves along at an average pace, the utter cheapness of the production pretty much sinks the whole affair. In contrast to that, one could say the sparseness of the production contributes to the overall detachment, the girl being alone at the farmhouse with the 3 killers. One of those "either you like it or either you hate it" low-budgeters.
