Goody-goody two shoes Katherine Verdoux (blonde cutie Erica Eleniak) hires sleazy private investigator Rafe Gutman (a deliciously smarmy and sarcastic Dennis Miller) to finding her obnoxious missing punk brother Caleb (a perfectly grating Corey Feldman). Rafe traces Caleb to a remote whorehouse on the edge of town that's disguised as a mortuary and populated by luscious lady vampires led by the evil and alluring Madam Lilith (ravishing redhead Angie Everhart having a whale of a wicked time). Director/co-writer Gilbert Adler really pours on the tasty gratuitous female nudity, gleefully over-the-top graphic violence, and often crudely amusing dopey puns. Miller has a ball playing the slimy anti-hero; he keeps things bouncy and funny throughout. Moreover, the solid supporting cast likewise does the trick: Chris Sarandon as slick, sanctimonious televangelist Jimmy Current, Aubrey Morris as Lilith's eccentric henchman McCutcheon, Phil Fondacaro as obsessive explorer Vincent Prather, William Sadler as a pompous mummy, and Kiara Hunter as enticing dominatrix bloodsucker Tamara. WARNING: Possible *SPOILER* ahead. The definite sidesplitting sick highlight occurs when Lilith's vampire harem gets slaughtered while "Ballroom Blitz" blares away on the soundtrack. Good, trashy tongue-in-cheek fun.
