I just finished watching this film less than a minute ago and I am not entirely sure what it was all about. I've seen other Miike films and never been this confused before.<br /><br />Usually there is some sort of weirdness in Miike's work but this film just seems like a child(disturbed child) has attacked a really poor quality, boring gangster film with a crayon.<br /><br />Miike is good at making weird original cinema, and I hope he sticks to that from now on, but this film was just a mess. It's an incredibly boring film, with silly moment.<br /><br />I'm really struggling to comprehend why this film even exists, while at the same time trying to understand why I have given it 3/10. The only good thing about this film in my opinion was it's stylish cinematography, especially in the final fight scene. I wont say what happens at the end but it's odd! <br /><br />Every other Takashi Miike film that I've watched I've enjoyed, but this was just too boring for me. However it has its moments so definitely worth watching if your a fan of extreme Japanese cinema.
