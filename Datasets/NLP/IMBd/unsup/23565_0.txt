The Lost World is a wonderfully entertaining film which incorporates stop motion techniques to bring the dinosaurs of the movie to life in a manner that is really incredible for the time. This movie really is a showcase for special effects in the setting of a big monster adventure movie. With large outdoor sets and big monsters, this film feels more like King Kong or later films with effects by Ray Harryhausen than most of the contemporary silent films.<br /><br />The story revolves around a group of adventurer-scientists who go on a mission to rescue a fellow scientist and prove that there are still dinosaurs living in the Amazon long after they are thought to have been extinct. Once there, they capture one of the dinosaurs and return to London with it, with results that might remind one of a much later dinosaur film. A side story of a romance adds to the plot.<br /><br />But it is the dinosaurs that make this movie. The special effects are incredible and, in my view, hold up today as much as any computer generated imagery. This is a great adventure story, skillfully put on film and years ahead of its time.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for anyone who likes dinosaurs and monsters.
