This was really one of my favorite films...serious and well-acted, particularly by Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, taking nothing from the other fine actors in the cast. If I have any criticism at all, it would be that it should have been better edited. The last "flashback" scene in the film could have been eliminated and a good portion of the the train station scene when Earp looks for those who killed Morgan and injured Virgil. But then, that is the Director's call and Kasdan couldn't seem to let the project go. Costner was superb.
