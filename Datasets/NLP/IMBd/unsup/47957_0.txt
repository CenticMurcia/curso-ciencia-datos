<br /><br />I didn´t enjoy the film at all. There was too many things in the film that didn´t match the story in the book. Bille August has taken himself too many liberties changing the story all the time. The entire book was based on Smilla´s thoughts, dreams and memories. Things which August totally failed to express.
