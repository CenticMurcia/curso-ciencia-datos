Farrah Fawcett is 60 years old. And it shows! I just could not believe that the walking mummy on screen was once the prettiest of the Angels. Hollywood is really harsh with aging actresses but this doesn't give them any excuse for trying (unsuccessfully) to look sexy and desirable until...death, especially when it's not in their genes. As for the movie, the plot and the acting are horrible. The characters and reactions unconvincing. I only watched it to the end to see if it would get worse - and of course it did. The film is supposed to show (once again) how rotten the U.S. Movie industry is and how it affects people's personalities and actions. But no morals are gained due to the shock of viewing one of the worst films ever!
