I rented this movie because it had Adrian Paul in it, and yes, it did have Adrian Paul in it, but it just barely could be considered a speaking role, more likely hired for his body as he is featured in a couple of nude scenes. I could not believe how terrible the writing was, and the "special" effects I found to be inappropriate as well as damaging to the possibility of being appealing in a "psycho drama" kind of way. If you really want to mess up someones evening, recommend this film to them.
