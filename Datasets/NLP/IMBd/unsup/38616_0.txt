Tom goes to the mayor was alright, but this show is the most uninspired piece of crap I have ever seen. There is absolutely no skill or ability shown whatsoever. I even like a lot of things many would consider revolting but this is just moronic. Of all the quality shows Adult Swim could be showing how they picked this thing is beyond me. I mean here let's write a typical sketch together- Tim and Eric meet in a public bathroom and start making out. The next seen Eric is pregnant, they both look sad then go to the grocery and sing about corn. There, another one knocked out. OK or how about a "live" sketch where Eric is on the street wearing a sign saying "Handy Twenty" then when people think he's going to give a H-job he really just wants to give hand shakes- brilliant! Or how about a "Beaver Boys" sketch where a bloated Tim eats shrimp while getting it all over his face for no reason. But wait! It's secretly laced with cocaine and he goes into a feral rage and runs downstairs in the hotel beating elderly men with a large fillet of tuna. It's a gem! Or they do a horrible rap song about corn left in fecal matter while covering them selves in chocolate pudding-WITH REAL CORN IN IT!! How could you not film that!? <br /><br />Because it sucks that's why.
