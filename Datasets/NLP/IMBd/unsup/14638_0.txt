OK the much awaited movie. Aamir after RDB and Kajol after a long break. The movie starts off with some brilliant locales and Kajol going to Delhi for a dance program where she encounters Rehan (Aamir). The sher- shayari bit in the first half is really good maybe coz of the way Aamir says it .<br /><br />Then there's a twist in the tale just before the interval and the story changes. I don't want to write a professional review , just things which i felt. First of all the side cast is amazing . They have been well chosen and do justice to their roles . The story is pretty mediocre . Aamir is fantastic as the happy-go-lucky tourist guide and Kajol glistens as the docile , demure blind girl.<br /><br />There are instances of Kunal Kohli's trademark sequences like putting songs where they just aren't necessary and some elongation of scenes . But the thing that makes this movie from being a common fare to a must watch are Aamir and Kajol . Their screen presence is amazing and the chemistry they share was just too good. They are the only 2 actors who could make a simple hug look like the reunion between two lovers . The ending sequence was also brilliantly handled .<br /><br />There are many mixed reviews to this movie . As i normally don't like any of the Yash Raj movies , this one i found to be quite touching . I would recommend this movie just for the magic that Aamir and Kajol create on the screen.
