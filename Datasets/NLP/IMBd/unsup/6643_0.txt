I kinda liked the plot of the movie, but what makes the movie so awful is the characters. The new girl that played Paige was more dressy and preppy, and Julia she was more down to earth laid back kind of girl. I'm so disappointed in the movie. All expect for Prince Edward were all different characters. If your going to make a sequel to a movie at least have the same people or don't make a sequel at all. There are just to many movies that don't have the same characters as the first movie. I was so excited when I heard that the movie was coming out. The poster that they have for the movie looked like Julia and on the cover of the DVD. I'm sorry I wouldn't buy this movie.
