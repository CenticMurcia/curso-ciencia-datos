If you want a real movie about love and life ,WATCH THIS! I have never had a favourite movie before but now this has become it. A simple story about 3 couples but the words are the real powerhouse here. They are so powerful, intense, real, truthful that I could NOT stop watching this movie.<br /><br />This movie is for people who definitely enjoy to expand their horizons, like movies that personally affect you, give you something to think about and really touches you on the inside. It was very raw and offbeat as well so you need to appreciate creativity to understand and love this movie.
