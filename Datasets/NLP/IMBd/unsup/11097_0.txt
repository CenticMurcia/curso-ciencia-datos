If you are interested in being an independent filmmaker, this is a movie to see. The movie as a whole, from the unusual abduction to the plight of the sadistically minded heroine fighting the kidnapper and herself, brings a vision to the screen that holds both a humorous and twisted tone. Don't be surprised to feel awkward, frustrated, terrorized, and satisfied simultaneously when you catch this one.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />
