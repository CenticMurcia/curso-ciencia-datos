I went to see Boogeyman with my buddy and thought it was the worst movie ever (1 person dies). Until he put on Silent Scream (VHS)when we got back. After 17 minutes into the movie the guy in the peach pant I was able to count out the change in his pocket. He had .53 cents in his right pocket. That was the point of argument that he actually had .55 cents which he had 2 quarts and 1 nickle. His pant were so tight that he could squeeze 2 dimes and a nickle out of a quarter. But I recommend this movie to your buddies whom you don't like. I mean that the person that you really want to waist 2 hrs of his/her time. This movie sucked so bad that I had nightmares only on the guy with peach paints.
