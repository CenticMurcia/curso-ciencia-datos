Director Paul Baurtel's follow-up to his cult hit "Death Race 2000" was this pretty awful little action picture that has all the amateurishness of the previous film but about half the budget - which wasn't so high to begin with! It's a crummy-looking, unfunny, unexciting film, but at least it has some beautiful women and some fast cars..... (*1/2)
