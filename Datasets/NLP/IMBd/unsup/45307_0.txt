One of the worst movies ever made, not only in the SF genre (which includes an amazing array of cinematic dung). It's about a robot who tries to shag Kirk Douglas. Harvey Keitel desperately tries to make it a threesome. Farrah Fawcet is there to watch. The movie had a potential to become a good SF classic, like "The Forbidden Planet", but it just lacks any spark, like the director was directing it and making pancakes at the same time. It's terribly flat and artificial. The actors are so "good" you want to get inside the TV and give each one a good kick. Douglas using his final line kills the movie altogether. If you don't end up throwing the tape out the window screaming, in the middle of the show, watch it to the end and learn how not to make movies.
