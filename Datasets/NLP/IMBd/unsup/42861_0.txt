I saw other movies more bad, anyway for me it's just a cheap try to make a SF movie. Even first Star Wars movies are better. Actors are very ugly and they play like a bunch of kids. Talking about kids play, I remember when I saw "Alien VS Predator", I was very impressed about special effects but very bad impressed about actors. It's like I start myself to do a movie and instead professional actors I use the neighbors from my street. Special effects are good, nothing to comment but the rest???? I like so much SF movies and I don't want to be ruud but this one it's just crap... Am I wrong...... or it's just a parody........<br /><br />Cornel (Cat Best)
