This movie was awful, I cant describe how bad it was, looks like some student film lighting was only so-so bad movie bad story bad acting I hated it. There are sometimes jokes that just are not funny, like how people are always eating burritos. And there is some connection to Area 51. WHY just WHY movies like this make me wonder how DV movies make it, that and bad green screening burned my soul. I think that the director lacks the basic understanding of how to use music in a movie, he always has things in Spanish. Also the large about of "" Video Effects only shows this films lack of creative vision and lack of technical vision. Other then that the story with idea of all the Mexicans just disappearing from California makes a poor poor idea for a movie. Also the random transition to news casts and random PAUSE and written random stupid Latino facts. Horable just horrible they tryed for a satire but instead they came out with crap.
