Basically. This movie could easily turn out to be real - hell, I won't be surprised if something like this has already HAPPENED somewhere in the world (most likely it has).<br /><br />Me and my sister showed this movie to our little brother because he's been caught stealing SEVERAL times from the family business - so we made him watch this and he rather-ed enjoyed it until the killing came along. And we could see it in his eyes, he did begin to think 'what if... that was me'.<br /><br />What was great about the movie is that it wasn't too predictable nor was it too complex to for a 14 year old to follow.<br /><br />After watching the movie we lectured him about how a simple theft can lead to more and more crime, and eventually - your life being taken away.<br /><br />So, not only was it enjoyable - I it was also rather educational.
