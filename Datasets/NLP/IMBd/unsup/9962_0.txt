Well-made TV-movie, largely acknowledged as the first made-for-television film to tackle the subject of homosexuality, has divorced San Francisco contractor Hal Holbrook looking forward to a visit from his fourteen-year-old son who lives out in Los Angeles with his mother; things are shaky when the kid meets his dad's new male friend, and once he figures out that Pop enjoys this male companion more so than eligible women, he runs away in anger and confusion. Levinson/Link production won raves upon its first network showing, and indeed it is smart, focused, and without stereotypes. Still, when the kid runs away (for a large section of the film), precious time on the clock is wasted as the adults search for him and worry. The film isn't melodramatic, thankfully; it's brave, it has a thoughtful, melancholy undermining, and the gay theme is served well (only some of the dialogue dates it). But more courageous the whole thing might have been with more hearty talk and less shame and tears.
