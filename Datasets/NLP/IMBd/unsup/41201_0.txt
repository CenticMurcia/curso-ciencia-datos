Watching this movie was like watching a train wreck go in slow motion! We KNOW what the end result is before it happens. Christopher Scott Cherot (The dude who did Hav Plenty and starred in it)Wrote and directed this but it was obviously not a good follow up to that Cult classic movie. And as you also can obviously guess,he's done nothing since then...that we know of that adds to much of his resume.<br /><br />This movie would've made a great BET movie of the week and should not have even been released to theaters. I'm still trying to find out why a main character who is supposed to exude virility,gangsterism,and respect has a name called "Summer G"....Gosh, STUPID!!<br /><br />The whole rappers in the Hamptons thing was weak...okay P-Diddy but they made it seem like it was the new thing to be doing for all rappers or something. Although Richard T. Jones is an excellent actor I felt he was miscast-ed in this role; he looked more like a R&B crooner or something and NOTHING at all like a rapper.<br /><br />Chenoa Maxwell whom must be best friends with Christopher Scott Cherot to be in another one of his low-budget films looks like she works out with Hulk Hogan or something...when she was in Hav Plenty she was cute as hell...what Happened!? She looked like a man in drag.<br /><br />This overall was a pointless,loss of direction,VERY boring movie with your basic stereotypes that just confirms that the movie biz is on a decline with great stories and creativity. I thought Christopher Scott Cherot was the next Spike Lee, or John Singleton...if he continues like this he will be as memorable as Mattie Rich, and if you don't know who he is then that's what I am talking about.
