I was really surprised by the lack of any identifiable emotion this movie instilled in me. I think I kept waiting for that magic moment when all the tension, in the form at times of boredom, would break into a mad stirring of passion...or something other than boredom. I don't want to blame this on the actors, since I didn't really see anything wrong with them, but the script had all the strength of a wet grocery sack. It seemed to have potential, and the camera work was well done, but I just never caught on to whatever I was supposed to care about.
