I have watched such cinematic abortions such as Showgirls, Gigli, Glitter, Police Academy films and low budget bollywood films with no plot or three different plots. Why? Because I'm a sadist when it comes to bad films. <br /><br />A "friend" brought it over after work and it was so awful we zoned out after 30 minutes and started talking.Lets just say the conversation we had would have made a much better film but thats not to be repeated here as children may read.<br /><br />The film was predictable and pointless and I have lost 30 minutes I will never get back.<br /><br />I'm so annoyed by the film i am still planning my revenge on the "friend" that brought it over to my house.
