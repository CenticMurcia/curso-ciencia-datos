I thought this movie came across very well considering that it could've easily landed in the cheese bowl. I could've lived without the 'female' robot; that was a bit silly. But the story was engrossing and the overall feeling of the movie was warm. At times it felt a bit hurried, but I suppose 200 years worth of a robot's life in 2 hours and 10 minutes warrants that. 8 out of 10 vote on this one. Well worth the rental.
