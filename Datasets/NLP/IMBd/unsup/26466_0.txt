I'm not sure why so many people are giving this film such a poor review. I thought the movie was suspenseful and thrilling. I loved Bai Ling and I thought Richard Gere did an excellent job acting in this film. Admittedly he did carry the film "on his shoulders" as another reviewer suggested, but I don't think that takes away from the movie at all. He was, afterall, the lead role.<br /><br />I've seen this movie a dozen or so times and my impression of it has never been bad. Again, I've always found this movie to be quite thrilling. And everyone I've shown it to has felt the same way.<br /><br />Anyway, I thought I should defend the film since so few are giving it its due credit.<br /><br />Check it out, rent it sometime. Maybe you'll see it's not so bad as everyone suggests. I easily rate this an 8/10.
