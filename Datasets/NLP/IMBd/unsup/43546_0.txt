When you film a movie you can use your freedom to make whatever you want: you can tell a story or just put the focus on a segment of people's life and nothing more. For example, Lost In Translation is simple. Maybe you don't have a perfect start, middle and end. Just a couple of days of an actor. But its clear and have a drama behind. You feel the ambiance.<br /><br />La Ni√±a Santa it's a very poor try to use this kind of direction. It's not clear, it's not entertainment, it's not drama. Just people (you do not know who is each one), a place (where?), some relations (incomprehensibles) and little less than two hours boring. Bad idea (if exists one).<br /><br />Some critics loves this movie. So, first watch it. Later you'll tell me that I'm right.
