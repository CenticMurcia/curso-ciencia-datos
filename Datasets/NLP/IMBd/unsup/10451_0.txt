OMG this is the best show ever I just got season 2 on DVD (i already had season 1) and spent the whole night watching it again my God I love it so much. It mixes the right amount of humour with romance and horror, the story lines are brillaintly written and fast paced enough that you are never bored you are always sitting on your seat waiting for the next epsoide. All I can say is that you must watch it and you will get hooked. BTW the 2nd series is way better than the 1st so if you watched it and believed it was mediocre watch the second season cause it is brill. PS I DO NOT GET THE COMPARSION WITH BUFFY HEX IS 100 TIMES BETTER. XOXOXOXO
