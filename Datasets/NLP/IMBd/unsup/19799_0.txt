I would not say this is a fact based film. With its many substories that probably did not happen but as far as Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and the Battle Creek San was concerned it is fairly accurate. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg was pretty much as depicted in this film, a most excellent job by Anthony Hopkins. However the real Kellogg would make you eat half the Yogurt and the other half was used as an enema. <br /><br />Anthony Hopkins ,Bridget Fonda, Matthew Broderick, John Cusack, Dana Carvey, Michael Lerner, Colm Meaney, John Neville, Lara Flynn Boyle, Traci Lind, Camryn Manheim all turn in great performances with Hopkins, Broderick, Cusack and Lara Flynn Boyle as stand outs! I am not much for period based films but the amount of talent and the accurate detail of the quack medical devices used made me change my mind, at least with this film.<br /><br />That said I did not like the film when I first saw it. It was one of my wifes video picks and while I had heard of the film I did not know much about it. It had just been released to video. The problem was that so many images of the film stuck in my mind. After seeing it several more times years later I fell in love with the film and it is in my top 20 film list. <br /><br />The film may be an acquired taste but chew, chew, chew and it will be good for you!
