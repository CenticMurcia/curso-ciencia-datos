This one really is as cheapo as they come! The motivation to make it in the first place clearly comes from someone finding a big abandoned house in which to shoot the majority of this very unscary piece or rubbish. The only parts worth exposing your mind to are the 'blood and gore' moments, or 'rubber and watery ketchup' as they should be known. I have never seen pin-headed latex dummies take such a butchering as in this film. The lanky killer dispatches her victims in a variety of ludicrous ways, from snapped arms to hacked-up heads. The thing is that it's all so rubbery and unconvincing that hysterical laughter is often the response, providing much need respite from the dreadful 'plot'. Utter nonsense but worth a watch purely for the manner and delivery of each kill.
