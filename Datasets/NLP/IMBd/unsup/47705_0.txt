In early 70s, Jacquou Le Croquant series was a great TV success. Not sure this will be equally the case for this 2007 version. What could have attracted Laurent Boutonnat in Le Roy's novel can be easily spotted here : Wide spaces, fighting between nobles and peasants, post revolution ambiance.. <br /><br />Laurent Boutonnat comeback to movies is unfortunately not a great experience.<br /><br />Without Myl√®ne Farmer, but all sorts of meaningless symbols and a handful of ready made scenes,this leads to a very disappointing movie, This picture that could have been great is simply a succession of movie-clips , without any coherence.
