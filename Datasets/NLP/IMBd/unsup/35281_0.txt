I know how difficult it is to make good and reasoned thrillers these days. It seems all the good plots and ideas are long ago taken.<br /><br />Yet, although this film was formula in some ways, it did escape some of the non sense of a slasher and chase, kill em all dead and bleed em dry blood feast.<br /><br />It always amazes me how stupid some people can be. For example, they rent a lodge, talk on phone to owner before, and are not greeted by him when they arrive. Bad MOON rising? Then the poor couple find nothing amiss with no key, an open door and finally a kitchen as if somebody had just run away from frying eggs and bacon?<br /><br />Come on, any average intelligence person would smell something very wrong from the get-go? Further they are careless with the cells, careless with their travel bags and act as if they are so dumb, Darwin and the audience is there hoping an ax will fall and out of the gene pool they'll be.<br /><br />However, on the bright side, this film was dumb and unrealistic, but at least when somebody is dead, they stay dead.<br /><br />Please don't buy this flick at the video mart, just rent it for a few good laughs.
