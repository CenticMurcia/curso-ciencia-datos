I don't suggest watching this movie even when you have much time to kill. It's full of clich√©s, its plot is beyond predictable and there are major logical flaws. The killing scenes are stupid and funny. The sexy actors and sexual material don't help much. The abusive mother,goofy,affectionate father, the hot sister and the problematic daughter constitute the family. Then there is the friendly teacher, the abusive- psychopathic guy who happens to be very handsome, the good and handsome boyfriend-to-be and the silly and slutty cheerleaders. So there's everything needed to constitute the teen-slasher scary movie, but it just doesn't happen. I advise you to sit and watch The Urban Legends again, rather than watching Fingerprints. The only thing i liked about the movie was Leah Pipes, whose performance was worth much superior movies.
