Eklavya: The Royal Guard is certainly getting a lot of mixed reviews. Some people love it, others hate it and even more others don't know what to make of it. This is probably because the film has a lot of potential in its storyline, its cast, and its setting. My problem with it is that it doesn't live up to its entire potential.<br /><br />In the director's haste to make the movie short, it actually takes away from "what could have been". There is not enough background information and display of the relationships between the characters. There are also some boring scenes and some parts become annoyingly repetitive. The best part about this movie is the acting. Amitabh and Saif especially show to the world once again why they are such great actors. The cinematography is also fantastic.<br /><br />Again, the potential for this story is so much more than what is displayed. Nonetheless it is worth watching for some of the VERY gripping scenes. These few scenes make the movie what it is. If the whole movie was compiled with the same conviction that is in these scenes it would be good enough for an Oscar nomination! (You will know what scenes they are once you watch the film.)
