This was a great show which only lasted a few short episodes in the late 1990s. I have been trying to figure out if it was an act of Lane's-- namely getting a "better offer" in a Broadway show (his IMDb biography shows he did mostly children's films those years) or the fickle finger of network fate that did this show in. I keep wishing someone would release it on DVD-- especially with Nathan Lane's rising fame after coups like "The Producers" (and even Lion King), but it hasn't come out yet... great performances and typical sharp Lane humor. A rare gem in modern TV, it's a shame it is no longer available. This show is a particular delight for those who have been bitten by the acting bug... or anyone living with someone who has. Until it is released on DVD, look into another great show about the Nobel Profession: "Slings and Arrows," a great British show available from the BBC.
