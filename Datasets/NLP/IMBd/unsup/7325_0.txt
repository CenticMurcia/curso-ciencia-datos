From the award winning director, Kim Ki-duk, that gave us 'The Isle', 'Address Unknown', 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring', 'Samaritan Girl', '3-Iron'.<br /><br />In this film 'The Bow: Hwal', the old man, the young girl and the young guy all do not have names. However the film still breezes through without identity crisis or confusion. With absolutely NO lines from the old man and the young girl, all we hear from these two characters were whispers to people's ears, laughter and crying. However, it was a masterpiece of absent dialogue. With subtle facial expressions and actions (such as aiming of the bow, striking off calendar dates, holding the girl's hand during sleep, re-construction of bed), it spoke much much louder than words. A favourite cinematic style by Kim Ki-duk.<br /><br />The director, Kim Ki-duk, has also done a good job in creating unbearable suspense on what the old man whispered to the 'fortune seeking' people. I wonder if the Korean DVD will reveal these tidbits.<br /><br />The music used in the film is simple yet moving. I believe the musical instrument used was Er-hu, an ancient Chinese 'violin'.<br /><br />< MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD > < MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD ><br /><br />In my opinion, the last 10 minutes destroyed the film. It was almost a masterpiece from Kim Ki-duk. The idea of supernatural elements and the old man's spirit having sex with the girl is too much to accept. After having sex, the old man spirit allows the girl and the guy to go back to shore while he sinks together with his ship. It was a great film without a great ending. In comparison, '3-Iron' had a stronger ending than 'The Bow'.<br /><br />Mao points: 9/10
