What could be described as a milestone of football (soccer) movies, well, it had the worst sequel a movie can have.<br /><br />Goal II: Living The Dream follows Santiago, but, this time, he transfers to Real Madrid. And now, I even wonder if it was the club owners who produced the film, because this is advertising as its best.<br /><br />Raul, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, yeah go figure, all those stars happen to play themselves in the film. And why the hell do I care? Awful movie. At least Goal I had a fantastic an original story, nevermind adding that it was set on England, the birthplace of football.<br /><br />As a movie, it is done as good as the first one. But the plot ruins it.
