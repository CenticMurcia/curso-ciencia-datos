The first "Urban Legends" movies was fair (worth 5), because it was just like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" movie and at that time, that kind of movies was popular. The sequel of this movie was fair too (worth 4), and again, it was just like "I Know What You Did Last Summer". Finally, the second sequel... It totally disappointed me. It was not about serial killer, who kills teenager, but it was about Bloody Mary, who was phenomenon and kills teenagers in unreal ways. So, the movie is not entertaining at all...<br /><br />Idea and script of this movie was awful. Acting was fair, because some actors trying to be more real in this movie.<br /><br />And in the end... I don't understand whats happened, because it was really boring. Worth to be not in DVD. but in TV...
