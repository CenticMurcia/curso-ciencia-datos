As hopeful as I was for the film, the script was very poor. None of the major plot points came organically from the characters, rather from coincidence. Some might argue that "fate" brings these lovers together, unfortunately there is no "B" story to make this theory work. Had Jason Biggs had a "B" story plot line to perform, this film would have been a great deal more fun.<br /><br />Perhaps if there was a separate subplot for Mr. Prince and Ms. Forlani, the film might have more depth. Ms. Forlani and Mr. Prince attempt to save this work from being completely cliche with some reasonable performances, however the dynamic this script provides them is weak storytelling. These characters repeatedly meet in a series of scenes that "magically" bring them together. The only problem is, there's no magic. Just the same scene recycled over and over again; The same two characters not taking any major action. This causes the audience to be fifteen steps ahead of the plot, and bored out of their mind. Perhaps younger "Boys and Girls" will find this film amusing.<br /><br />On a positive note, the club scene is cool, the soundtrack is great, and the film is well cast. It just has a bad script.<br /><br />Granted, this is The Drews' second major project. Perhaps with experience we will see improvements in their writing abilities. The great poet Rilke suggested that the young should not write romance because their lack of life experience will not allow them to write anything but the cliche. Ce la vie.
