i like a good action film and this is what it is! its a bloke flick.the tough hero,the action,the violence,the good looking babes,the car stunts.overall a great time for guys.any man who appreciates action will love it.stroll on the great leave the brain at the door action flick! bout time they made more like they did in the 80s.jason statham is along there with the likes of Dwayne Johnston aka the rock,mark whalberg and vin diesel providing he sticks to what hes good at(killing bad guys and delivering bad lines)"no more lame comedy please vin" reminds me of those good action flicks you used to get when action stars were action stars.not trying to change what they are good at. been a fan of director Paul w.s anderson and statham for a while so keep up the good work guys.if you like blokes action films you wont be disappointed.
