I cannot wait to see the goofs start on this horrible, horrible movie... The biggest goof had to be paying the writers who came up with this drivel and called it a story. Aggghhhhh Judging from the speed of the swarm crossing Indiana and Illinois, those locusts had to be doing Mach 4 or so... fast little buggers! I was also impressed with the careful military handling of VX.. providing everyone with full face respirators who handled it. Sheesh people, VX is a nerve gas, and is SKIN ABSORBED too... the gas masks wouldn't have made a seconds worth of difference.<br /><br />I also choked on my drink when a certain person died from being bitten a couple times.. sheesh, I survived bike accidents with more wounds than he had! I want my my time back!
