OK. This is just laughable garbage. Really not worth my time writing this, typically I'm the type that keeps negative opinions on films to myself because I still consider movies an artful expression. But I guess after a slew of garbage recently, I must draw the line. It's frustrating to see people with this vision in the driver's seat to make a film. Not to mention the director has a horror niche background. His biggest film to date, 2001 Maniacs isn't something to be too proud of either. Bigger budget.<br /><br />Anyway, avoid at all costs. It's just laughable, corny, with some severe gay undertones.<br /><br />Diamond Dallas Page was pretty decent, Talan from Laguna Beach is so awful. Why? Why, guys?
