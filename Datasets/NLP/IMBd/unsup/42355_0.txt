This is the sort of production that gives Agatha Christie a bad name. It doesn't know what it is trying to do. Part of it is played like a farce, part like a spoof, some of it straight; the direction is all over the map.<br /><br />Harry Andrews struggles through it manfully, but sinks under the strain. The leads are awful and totally confused.<br /><br />There are only two good things: the production itself, in terms of scenery and use of lovely old vehicles, is super. Finally, the only actor to really shine is John Gielgud. He plays his part superbly well, with a delicate touch that shows why he is such a great actor.<br /><br />Worth watching for Gielgud and the cars, but be prepared to watch a lot of awful acting and directing in the meanwhile.
