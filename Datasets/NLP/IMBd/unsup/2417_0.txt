I Saw this Movie and was happy with how it came out. A good movie definitely worth seeing. a lot of action, tied in with a lot of twists. In that sense i mean you go "oh hes about to get caught" when the unexpected comes up. Was good acting as well all around, Bruce Willis made a fine Hero, or anti hero if you could call him that. The beginning started off fast and the ending came on slow. in my opinion the way a movie should come on. About the pg13 though, F bomb was dropped once (twice if you count a replay of it saying) The musical score also did a nice touch to the scenes. Dropping to low sad tones when death is about to occur, and jumping to a pulsing drum run when escape is occurring. Overall i give an 9/10 as very little was wrong if anything at all. I mean as a matter of fact besides maybe length or questionably of motives, i would say there is no problems at all found in the movie.
