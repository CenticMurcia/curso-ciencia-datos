The first thing you'll notice when you first see the Episode is the Animation I mean the Animation isn't what you call Bad but it wasn't the best. However this episode had many moments that made me laugh like in scenes where we see Cartman telling his friends over and over that there's nothing wrong with him when his friends obviously know that there is because there's a Big Ass Satellite coming out of his Ass, or the famous Kick the Baby scene where Kyle constantly kicks his little brother Ike like a Football. Also Isaac Hayes who was the first African American composer to win an Oscar for Best Original Song for the song Shaft appears in the Episode as the Voice of their singing School Chef, named Chef!
