This movie is one of the greatest movies that the people at Disney have ever come up with. it shows the life after two spoiled sisters are forced to work at their dad's dairy after Courtney throws a towel on a flame and starts a fire. so as punishment they are sent to the family dairy. when they arrive at the dairy, they cause many more problems. when their uncle steals all the companies money,Taylor takes 20,000 dollars out of Courtney's 25,000 dollars for her cotillion. then they realize that it's not only about them not getting their money, but about all those people who live off their paychecks. so when they find out that the expiration date was set wrong, they pull all their friends together and try to save the dairy. this movie is great for everyone. i give it a 10/10.
