This show was a staple of my childhood and I find that I still connect to the humour and drama, even if the medicine is out-of-date. The characters were so well-developed that I still find myself hooked to their trials, tribulations, and triumphs. I've especially developed a great appreciation for the supporting actors, which I didn't take much notice of back when I was a kid.<br /><br />I regularly watch the episodes on VHS so I'm happy Universal is releasing them on DVD. Anyone know when Season 3 and beyond is due out? They seem to have stopped releasing them for some unknown reason, yet you can get "He Man" on DVD; go figure :)
