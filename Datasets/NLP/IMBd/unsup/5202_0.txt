This is not only my favorite Dragon Ball Z movie, but one of my favorite movies of all time. The longest and best DBZ film there is. I can't say how much I love this movie. I like the twist of how Goku isn't he first Super Sayian and is no where near strong enough to defeat Broly. Goku gets one of his biggest beatings ever. I honestly think this shouldn't have been a movie but a saga on the show. I mean the idea of a new Planet Vegeta and Vegeta the Prince is great. Also this is the first Goku villain that's held a grudge against Goku before they meet either on TV or movie. Broly's hated Goku forever. Broly sort of does that large super sayian Trunks does that slows him down but it doesn't slow Broly down. I really do love this one and recommend it 100%
