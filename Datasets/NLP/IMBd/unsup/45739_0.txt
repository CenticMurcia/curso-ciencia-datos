Shame shame shame. I'm convinced that Dennis hopper and Steven Segal and other actors in this so called "movie" want to forgot all about this as soon as possible!<br /><br />The acting was poor .... and not a little bit as well. Dennis and Segal we're just a couple of flat actors that only try to lift this movie up with their names and not by their performance.<br /><br />*spoiler (somewhat)* The movie started out nicely with a blown up house etc etc, but it really took a drastic turn down when Romany Malco tried a death scene which was ..... everything from a death scene. No blood ... not even sweat was coming out, he tried to cough a little bit but my 3yr old nephew does a better imitation cough then that!<br /><br />After this "death" scene I already gave up on the movie and started to irritate myself more and more about small things that went wrong. I saw the movie till the end (god knows why) but even the end was .... flat.<br /><br />Glad Segal did better movies after this one .... hence all the actors did lol.
