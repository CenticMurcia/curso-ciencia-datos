A Return to Salem's Lot (1987) is a fun film by the legendary B-Movie director Larry Cohen. The film is about a former resident of Jerusalem's Lot Joe (Cohen regular Michael Morarity) who comes back to town with his son. Whilst in town they learn about it's horrible secret. The town is run and populated by the living dead! The mayor takes a liking to him chooses Joe to chronicle the struggles and the history of the people of 'Salem's Lot. In some ways the film uses parts of the book that the mini-series failed to utilize. While Joe and his son are in town, an elderly gentleman (Samuel Fuller) is in town asking question about an "old friend" who might be around. Seeing the old director tool around in an V.W. bug is quite the sight. Like all of Mr. Cohen's films, it's filled with his usual quirky dialog and interesting direction. Panned by some and hated by most this film has been sadly neglected. Many people fail to realize that this is a movie and it's not suppose to be taken seriously folks! Please remember that the next time you go to the theater.<br /><br />Recommended!
