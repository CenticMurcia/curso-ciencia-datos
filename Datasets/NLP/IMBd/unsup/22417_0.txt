This show is stupid. Its about a bunch of bratty teens getting their sweet 16 birthday party exactly how they want it, for a price of probably over 30 000 dollars! It is a lame show and unrealistic because how can a bunch of teens afford their Sweet 16 for over 9000 bucks? there cant be that many not famous, rich 15 year old kids out there? Honestly, this show is stupid.<br /><br />Plus, the theme is sang by Hilary Duff! AHH! NOOOOO! Run for the hills its the anorexic biatch! Well still, this show is lame and totally pointless. My sweet 16 will not be like this, like a fantasy, people look like their going to a wedding, and these kids are blunt, rude, and only care about themselves!
