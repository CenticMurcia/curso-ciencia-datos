Did the cameraman have Parkinson? Why is the camera spying them when they are on their own? Why does it fall on the floor every two seconds? What type of script is that? I'm sure, without reading it, the book has to be better. The poor guy just suffered this terrible drama and the only thing the girl can say is 'get over it, I've got work to do'. Did I miss when the stalker falls in love with the guy? Not a hint of it!. The first scene is very promising, after that is one mistake after another. Nothing is believable, not even the friends. What about when the guy goes, drunk, to see his friends and they let him hold the baby?, I think it's a very unpleasant film to watch. It gets on my nerves.
