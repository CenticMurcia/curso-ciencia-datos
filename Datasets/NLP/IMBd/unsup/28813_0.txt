I enjoy watching Cary Grant may a fool of himself, he will do what it takes to make a movie funny, but the star of this movie is Myrna Loy, she was in her forties, but she look like she was only in her thirties, and still sexy. he relax way of acting was wonderful to watch, never over acting, therefore she was quite believable, throw in a seventeen year old Shirly Temple, and the other supporting cast and you have a wonderful little movie. I won't spoil it for you, but I would surely recommend this movie for a enjoyable night watching movie. The funniest part of this movie is the race, I could not stop laughing, it was stupid, but rather funny. I think anyone who like Cary Grant and the lovely Myrna Loy will love this movie.
