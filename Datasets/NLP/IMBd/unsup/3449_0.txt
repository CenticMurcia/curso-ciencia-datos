Lets get one thing straight. I know that the on the box the artwork at the video store may be a little misleading but we are watching a home-made movie. It's not The Shining, Psycho, or any other masterpiece. It was filmed at cedar lake in Oklahoma(I Think?). You can hear the locusts in the background. The scenery looks really good. The actors are extremely amature with regional accents but are using realistic dialog(realistic for a bunch of kids camping at the lake). There are thousands of bloopers throught the movie. One was a dead body who had one arm tied to a tree and the other holding on to a branch. This is one talented dead body. Another was a joint someone was smoking that didn't emit any smoke. I thought the story with the two 12 year olds was really funny. There is a so bad it's good element to this movie but the better elements are the 80's slasher themes. This movie is not scary but is enjoyable. Movies that are getting made now are not half as good as movies made in this era; I prefer this film over Leprechaun in da hood or the Halloween webcam movie. This movie shows us that anyone who owns a camcorder can make a movie.
