Yvette Mimieux is a tough, terrific actress, and she cuts an assertive, sexy presence on the screen(especially in these, her later post-"Time Machine" years)but "Jackson County Jail" is just a slapdash effort that managed to catch on with cable audiences in the 1980's. Woman is unjustly jailed while driving cross-country, escapes prison with the help of convict Tommy Lee Jones. Tailor made for drive-ins, ending on a silly, pretentious note. Lock it up! * from ****
