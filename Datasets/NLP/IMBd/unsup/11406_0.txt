Clint Eastwood stars as Wes Block a police officer who hunts a serial killer who targets prostitutes who he handcuffs. However Eastwood finds it hard to be a police officer in the red light district because his urges get the better of him. Some good acting from Eastwood and Bujold elevate this one above mediocrity, but some interest still remains especially since the serial killer plot angle offers some good ideas.
