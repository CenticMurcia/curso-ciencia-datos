I walked into the cinema not knowing what to expect. There had been no publicity whatsoever about this film and I was surprised. Very tense, very dramatic and well acted. An Interesting take on plot thats been done so many times before, but never quite like this. While its obvious what happens in the end you really want to see it through to the end, so it must have done something right.<br /><br />It's also nice to see that here in Britain we can produce something other than Romantic Comedies and cheap gangster films. Here we have something of a certain class that's quite a good yarn while being far deeper than most US films. I hope it's a sign of things to come.
