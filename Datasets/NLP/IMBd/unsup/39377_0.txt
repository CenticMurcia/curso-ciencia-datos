I've no doubts that militaristic enthusiasts enjoy this movie, but it got lousy actors, directors and camera people. It looks very amateurish. The film is made in South Africa in 1987 which makes it colored(no pun intended) with racist hints here and there. It's no doubt the whites are the heroes in this movie. It can be compared to The Octagon with Chuck Norris. Yes, IT IS that bad.
