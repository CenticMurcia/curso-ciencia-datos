This was one of the worst films I have seen in a while.<br /><br />I really think that I or any student could have written or filmed this movie, as long as you have some pretty faces to use as 'characters'. The movie attempts to portray the main actors as actually having mental visions of another human affecting their lives, ala A Beautiful Mind, in the first part of the film. Only toward the very end was this menacing vision revisited. In the rest of the movie, we see the main character happily and mindlessly drifting from neighborhood to neighborhood ending up at the ocean. An occasional reference to the meaning of life or the belief or even existence of GOD is supposed to lend this movie some credence.. a lame attempt.<br /><br />This is the state of Japanese Film making and acting,(in 1996 I know), and you wonder why Chinese actors were used in Memoirs of a Geisha! LOL
