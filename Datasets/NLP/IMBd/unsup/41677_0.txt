I was disappointed that IMDb would not let me give this piece of drivel a rating of zero. I suppose in retrospect it deserves at least one point for the way the director strung together every teen/dance movie cliché in existence. Save the money, and don't even bother to sneak in - that way you could spare yourself the two hours lost out of your life.<br /><br />I would normally leave my comments as is, but the IMDb guidelines require ten lines. Which was the worst cliché? Hard to say. Was it all of the misunderstood yet well-meaning kids in detention? Perhaps the teacher with a heart of gold? The tough talking principle who comes over to the good side? The math teacher who thinks that his kids are being neglected in favour of the rejects (although none of the math geeks are in detention, and the 'teacher' (Banderas) is there for free? The list goes on....<br /><br />If you were to make a drinking game out of this, you could call it "Cliche", or maybe even "Crap Movie". Every time you saw a cliché on screen, you could call it out, and everyone else would have to drink. Bring plenty of booze - it will be a tough game, and you may need it.<br /><br />'Nuff said.
