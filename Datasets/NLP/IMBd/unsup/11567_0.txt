This show is so much fun to watch. It is a wonderful story and the conclusion is just perfect.<br /><br />We bought the video a few years back and have watched it several times. Many of our friends who never saw it before have really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Everything is just right about it - the acting is superb, the look is just right. The music is elegant and the costumes certainly deserved the Oscar it received.<br /><br />Regarding the murderer, it is impossible to REALLY know who it may be. Everyone COULD HAVE done it as and all had a motive.<br /><br />When I first watched it, I thought that maybe Mia Farrow was the daughter of Maggie Smith (maybe because of the red hair) and somehow conspired. Then I thought maybe Angela Lansbury was only pretending to be drunk. They're are many possibilities.<br /><br />We both like this show a lot and highly recommend it.<br /><br />gord & lisa
