One star? Awful? Yes. Please, don't get me wrong, as I am a huge fan of Dustin, Natalie and Jason. But there is nothing these talented actor's could have done to make this mess something watchable. Oh, I know..you think I don't get it. Believe me, I get it..this is film for kids, you will say. Wrong! My 8 and 10 year old kids were BORED stiff..quickly. I was mortified, and I was not expecting Rainman or Willy Wonka.<br /><br />Believe me, I know what whimsical, magical, wonder-mental is. This film is just plain..mental. And you and your kids would have to be that way to enjoy this. This movie would have been good for a Thankgiving or Holiday movie, gone straight to video or even TBS. But no, you have to pay dearly to take three people to see this one.<br /><br />Okay, here is the nicest thing I can say about this movie: Forget it!
