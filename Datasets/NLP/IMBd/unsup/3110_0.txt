This Movies is fantastic!<br /><br />Joe Dante's "Gremlins" is a fun and enjoyable film, but it is scary at times, but I still love it. It really is the best little monster attack type film, and you even root for the Gremlins themselves, because of their enjoyable pranks, stupidity and by far their laughs, it just sticks in your head.<br /><br />This movie even spawned a sequel "Gremlins 2: The New Batch", which is also filmed by Joe Dante, it is great as well, but it isn't as good as it's predecessor. If you haven't seen this film then, go rent it, buy it, you just have to see "Gremlins".
