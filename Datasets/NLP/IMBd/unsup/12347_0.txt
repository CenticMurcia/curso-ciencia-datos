The movie is based on the idea of time-travelling. There were lots of such movies and novels, but this one is somewhat different. There is USS Nimitz, nuclear carrier, equipped in jets, reconnaissance planes, marines, and so on, everything that is needed in modern warfare. Somehow Nimitz is taken back to 1941, just before Pearl Harbour battle. Now it is a super-weapon that can change history and alone destroy all the Japanese fleet.<br /><br />One interesting question is if it is possible to change history. The crew are soldiers and want to participate the battle. In movies such "Back to the Future" characters were able to change history, in more "real", like "Twelve Monkeys" -- they were creating it. Is Nimitz able to win the battle that was lost? What would happen to people who lived then? With some senator, who is going to win presidential elections, but was "missing" after the battle? Will he survive it and lead his nation after the war? The main question is not "will Nimitz finally go back to its time" but "will Nimitz join the battle". One does not think about future but about soldier's duty.<br /><br />The movie consists nice photo shots. The carrier itself, its planes, dogfights between Japanese motor-planes and modern F14. Even if it is not even a candidate for the Oscar, I think it is always a good SF and war movie.
