Bored and brassy small town carhop waitress and aspiring country singer Bobbie Jo Baker (a splendidly sassy'n'sexy portrayal by the luscious Lynda Carter of TV's "Wonder Woman" fame) hooks up with brash wannabe Billy the Kid-style modern-day fugitive Lyle Wheeler (a wonderfully robust and engaging performance by Marjoe Gortner) and his rowdy gang of outlaws. The wild'n'crazy bunch embark on a merry crime spree in dusty New Mexico. Directed with tremendous rip-roaring flair by Mark Lester, with a compact, colorful script by "Unholy Rollers" director Vernon Zimmerman, a constant fast pace, bright, sunny cinematography by Stanley Wright, occasional outbursts of bloody violence, plenty of rousing action (the car chases and shoot-outs are staged with considerable exciting aplomb), Carter's legendary eye-popping topless scenes, the catchy, reflective theme song "City Lights" sung by Bobby Bare, and an uncompromisingly downbeat ending, this sturdy little item really delivers the satisfying lowdown trashy exploitation picture goods. The bang-up cast qualifies as another substantial asset: Merrie Lynn Ross as Bobbie Jo's bubbly sister Pearl, Jesse Vint as Pearl's volatile boyfriend Slick, the adorable Belinda Balaski as Bobbie Jo's sweet best gal pal Essie, Gerrit Graham as groovy hippie commune leader Magic Ray, Gene Drew as mean hillbilly Sheriff Hicks, and "Devil Times Five" screenwriter John Durren as equally nasty Deputy Abel Gance. A fun romp.
