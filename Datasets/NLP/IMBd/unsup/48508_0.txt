My son, who ought to know better, rented this from Netflix and convinced me to watch it with him. Now, I'm not going to complain about the bait-and-switch marketing (the chick on the box cover and on the DVD menu never appears on this disk), which other reviewers describe here, although it is true.<br /><br />For anyone considering watching this, just remember that it isn't really a movie. It's a 75 minute prank pretending to be a bad, campy zombie movie.<br /><br />The prank is that it pretends to be clever in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way, when it's actually moronic in a so-bad-it's-painful-to-sit-through kind of way that I believe violates the Geneva Conventions. <br /><br />Chris Seaver strikes me as a kind of juvenile troll who thinks his low budget antics give homage to Ed Wood's ineptness, but I believe he's so bereft of talent yet has such a swollen ego that he can't distinguish the difference.<br /><br />When the movie was over, it felt like Chris was having a laugh at my expense because he knows what it a piece of crap it is and he intentionally wasted my time, and it was damned hilarious to him. Good one, Chris. It's on the same level as giving someone a turd as a Christmas gift just to see the look on their face.<br /><br />I've read the apologists for Chris Seaver and no one is going to convince me this is a good movie. Save your money, folks, and watch YouTube clips instead. You will see the same level of amateurishness, mugging for the camera, fanboy humor, ham-handed acting and directing, and no-budget production values, but YouTube is free.<br /><br />If I could give this a negative score to counteract the improbable rating this movie has (currently at 3.2, but it should be zero), I would do so.
