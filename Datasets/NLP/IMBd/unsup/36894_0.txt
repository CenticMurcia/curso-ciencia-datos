There were a lot of bad movies made in the 70's.<br /><br />This one was almost at the top of the list.<br /><br />I did not read the credits, but I'm sure that they did not list any writers for this movie. It appeared to me that the players (I'll not call them actors) were making up the dialog as they went along. Maybe this was filmed during the writer's strike.<br /><br />One of the funny scenes was the one where they held up the people attending a dinner party, including the sheriff played by John Caradine. The music in the background was the William Tell Overture, the theme for The Lone Ranger. "Who was that masked man?" <br /><br />The lead"actors" were bad enough, but the support players were just horrible. After saying their lines, if they had any, they just stood with blank expressions, sort of like asking themselves "What is my next line". I guess they used a lot of "locals"<br /><br />Barbara Hersey did make it somewhat easy to stay through the entire movie, but that's about it.<br /><br />I think this movie took place in the early 30's or so, but there was a '39 model car being used several times.
