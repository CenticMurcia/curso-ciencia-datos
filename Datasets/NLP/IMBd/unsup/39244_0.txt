Movie based on real life killers Martha Beck (Shirley Stoler) and Raymond Fernandez (Tony LoBianco). Beck was a 200 pound nurse who met sleazy Fernandez through a lonely hearts correspondence. They met and fell in love. They then met rich old ladies through the correspondence, killed them and took their money.<br /><br />I've seen this film multiple times over the years and its popularity totally escapes me. It does have some things going for it: it's well-directed by Leonard Kastle; the one murder shown is actually quite frightening and Stoler and Lo Bianco give out good performances. Also Doris Roberts has a small early role here. Unfortunately the bad things far out number the good.<br /><br />This was shot on no budget and it shows: the sets are really shabby (although that DOES fit the tone of the movie); all the characters are unpleasant; people scream rather than talk to each other; the dialogue is banal; Stoler and Lo Bianco aside the acting is terrible; the music is hilariously inappropriate; the attraction between Beck and Fernandez is never explained and, quite simply, this is boring! The movie just drones on and on and on. Critic Pauline Kael hated it too--she hit it on the head when she calls this "minimalist film-making". A dull, unpleasant and boring little film. I can't recommend this to anyone.
