"A Day Without A Mexican" is a great example of how low-budget films in independent cinema can broadcast a message without having to comply to the typical conventions of Hollywood. Sure, there are no big-name actors or actresses prancing across the screen, but that's exactly the point: as a viewer, you are not meant to be distracted from the moral center of the film by celebrities. And what a moral center this film has.<br /><br />Part documentary, part comedy, part social commentary, "A Day Without A Mexican" successfully entertains the audience with seemingly blundering Americans ignorant of the extent to which Latinos contribute to the economy and society of California, while simultaneously calling attention to the alienation and discrimination hurled at this ethnic group on a daily basis. It may seem hokey to some viewers that in the end, after all the Latinos (not just "Mexicans") disappear, they come back and are embraced by everyone who finally realized how important they are to the society. Some of the jokes may also be cheesy and may not garner a titter from the audience, but the main point of the movie is not to knock you out of your seat with uproarious laughter. The pop-up facts enlighten the audience (such as reminding many Americans that those people from Honduras and Guatemala are NOT Mexicans) and add an extra layer to a complex film.<br /><br />All in all, "A Day Without A Mexican" is, so far, an underrated film. Don't focus on how low-budget the production is, focus on the points being made and the situations presented.
