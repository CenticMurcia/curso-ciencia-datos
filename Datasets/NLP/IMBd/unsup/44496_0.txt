look, i actually pondered and take as very believable some of the theories showing on this bad''sci-fi''movie presented by Alex Jones. But this is not a documentary, and the supposed facts are simply news articles of the heat of the moment and the word of a very fanatic man: Alex Jones. I say fanatic because he believes so certainly in what he wants to say, that he can't afford to be put in doubt by being neutral and actually showing the whole pictures of his alleged evidences. he just chops parts of speeches, news articles, and surveillance cameras, that can support his opinion that it seems to be very bias. As many ''proves'' in well substanced and NEUTRAL documentaries and articles i've seen and read so far and by my own observation and doubts on the facts as they are released, i believe some of the so called ''Conspiracy Theories'' have a great amount of substance to be believable enough to be scary, but are persons like this MR. Alex Jones ,by his methods and unbased retarded fundamentalism, and questionable ways, that makes people discard and think: ''Oh bullshit...I will not listen to these stupid conspiracy crap''. So thank u for nothing Mr. Alex Jones.
