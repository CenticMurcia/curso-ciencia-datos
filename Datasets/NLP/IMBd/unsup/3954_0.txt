Man do I feel sorry for Arlo. That poor man. If that were me I would be kicking myself. This movie was funny and amusing though. Hes got movers who won't deliver his stuff, a crazy guy driving his Saab, he got scammed on his house and hes getting blamed for all of this stuff at his new job when all he did was sharpen his pencil. Some great actors and actresses in this movie like Richard Pryor, Randy Quaid, Stacey Dash, Dave Thomas and Dana Carvey (The younger, funnier Dana Carvey before Mike Myers ruined his reputation). This is the only movie I have ever seen with Richard Pryor without Gene Wilder. I thought they were only funny when they were together, but Pryor did a great job in this movie. I should go see a just Gene Wilder movie and see if its the same for him too.
