Whoa! This movie is the weirdest movie I seen in years! It differently Walt Disney alright but boy this is strange and certainly boring! All it is really is a collection of dance sequences and musical numbers. It lacks edge and doesn't hold my attention for long enough and some the sequences are kinda creepy! The only good part of the movie is Mickey Mouse in "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" which is somewhat a famous figure for Disney as they used it for their home video logo from 1988-1996! It was funny the way the brooms turned on him like that. Other than that, the movie is flat, boring and dead weight. If you can catch The Sorcerer's Apprentice on it is own that watch it but with Fantastia's other segments, don't bother as they will only bore you! <br /><br />4/10
