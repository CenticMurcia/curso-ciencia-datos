The Lost Room has a surprisingly original premise leaps out of a morass of hackneyed ideas that litter the landscape of movie science fiction. I loved the mystery and the novelty of the story line. The main characters were excellent and well performed by a solid cast. Especially notable in the quirky roles were Dennis Christopher as Ruber, and Ewen Bremner as Strizke. I never cared much for Peter Krause in Six Feet Under but he was very watchable in the lead role of Joe Miller. It was somewhat disappointing that much of the action depended on cars and telephones, which are to my mind the most boring of screen props, but nearly everything else in the scenery was interesting and different. The theological theories were most amusing, almost reminiscent of Douglas Adams at his best.
