This episode of "Family Dog" remains about the funniest film I have ever seen. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy it, but so did my whole family. It's now nearly 20 years since it was made, but my two daughters can still recite the entire dialog, and we still "crack-up" when we think about it!!! The expressions on the faces, the antics, the characters, the situations, are truly inspired. I was not aware, although not surprised, that there was a whole series of episodes "spinning-off" from this original, and I wouldn't mind seeing those. Sometimes, however, the follow-ons can be a little disappointing when compared with the original, especially when the original is so brilliant.
