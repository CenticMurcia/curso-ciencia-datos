As a 1980s Horror movie, Killer Klowns is pretty good. A lot of imagination and execution went into the various Klown vehicles, the Killer Popcorn, the Human Cotton Candy Blood Slurpees, and some of the other Carn-Evil surprises. The puppet show on the wall of the building was not just funny, but sarcastic too. As anyone who has ever tried to do those hand-puppets knows, it is not easy. Especially for those clowns with the short stubby fingers. At one point the Klown even had a scene of George Washington crossing the Delaware. Now that is funny and sarcastic at the same time! Totally 1980s witty humor! Killer Klowns is one of those movies that you really get if you lived in that era, and if you didn't then there really is no way to explain it to you. Killer Klowns is almost like a time capsule to the 1980s. But aside from the attitudes of that era, the acting is what you would expect from a typical low budget movie with a lot of aspiring actors (similar to the non-featured cadets that appeared in the Police Academy movies). John Vernon is in this movie, and his talents are wasted but it is a nice touch to see him in Killer Klowns. It gives the film a lot more credibility, though Vernon was close to the end of his career by 1988. Killer Klowns is not a classic horror movie, because it lacks any real suspense, and it is not very scary. The Director was not very skilled, and most of the scenes are filmed without any attempt to scare or surprise the audience. Killer Klowns it is an interesting horror film which has some good laughs and some good special effects. Killer Klowns takes a well deserved shot at the circus clowns that most kids never liked, and some kids found terrifying.
