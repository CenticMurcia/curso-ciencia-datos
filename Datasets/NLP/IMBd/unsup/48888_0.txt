This is the movie that turned me off from power rangers. I really dont like how the kid, justin, is the blue ranger. it needs to be a teenager. however i did like the Cameo of Kimberly (pink ranger number 1) and Jason (red ranger number 1)thought it to be really cool that they still acknowledged that they were a part of this story. Needs to be a reunion Special or something of the Classic Power Rangers. it would so make me Happy. but other than that there are several problem i have with the movie Justin is just not a convincible power ranger. The Villians arent the greatest either. Ivan Ooze was so much more villianous in Power Rangers the movie. Of the 2 power ranger movies, this one comes in second. if Justin wasnt the blue ranger maybe id change my mind
