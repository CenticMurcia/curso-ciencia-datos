If you believe that film reflects who we are and are becoming and you linger on shock stories in the news then this movie and writer are for you! It is an avalanche of senseless male testosterone with only one conclusion--a dead and dying landscape full of corpses and people who are dead inside. If you believe that people are no damn good, this movie does just show how little there is of worth in life. I do believe that this world and all worlds would be better off without us. If men were bred out of life, there might be a chance for a future but that isn't yet possible. This movie could have been made by a 12 year old boy and other teenage boys who refuse to grow up. I've never seen such selfishness vomited up on an audience at such a rate. I only hope that all the things I saw happen in this film happen to the writer, director and actors involved. It is only right and good karma that that occur. The fact that someone like this gets money to produce such crap makes me realize the world has already been flushed.
