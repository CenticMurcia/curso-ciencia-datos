Dreadful space western goes to show that John Carpenter is, alas, creatively burnt out. Basically an outer space remake of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, as just about everyone else has noticed, this also manages to include elements of THE THING, PRINCE OF DARKNESS and non-Carpenter sci-fi films like ALIENS and SPECIES (also with Henstridge in the lead). Throw in a typecast Pam Grier in leather as a lesbian prison guard (as if JACKIE BROWN never happened) and a mechanical Anthrax score, and you still havenÂ´t got the edge to help this turkey anywhere. Ice Cube is actually pretty good under the circumstances, but the rest of the cast is reduced to martian ghost zombie attack victims... The ending is totally ridiculous, and thus very fitting to the rest of the film. When are you going to make a great movie again, John? 2/10
