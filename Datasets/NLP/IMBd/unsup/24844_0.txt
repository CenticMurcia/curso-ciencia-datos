What a phenomenally horrible film! I am completely and utterly surprised at two things - 1) The relatively high rating and 2) the relatively successful careers the two lead characters have had. The girl was OK, I guess, but Billy Joe! Oh jeez. I don't think my judgment is too heavily influenced by the god awful hillbilly accents either.
