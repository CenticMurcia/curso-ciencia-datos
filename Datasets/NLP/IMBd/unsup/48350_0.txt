Vampire Vincent Price introduces his latest victim, John Carradine, to a nightclub where various badly made-up monsters hang out. There Carradine hears three stories Â– a con artist couple try to steal from a freakish 'shadmock'; Donald Pleasence is a special branch copper hunting down a vampire; and film director Stuart Whitman finds himself trapped in a ghoulish village. Although there is some fun to be had from Price's tongue-in-cheek performance, a couple of good songs and the occasional bit of amusing dialogue ("A vampire film producer?" "Aren't they all?"), the movie is slow-going and the stories prove too floppy to maintain interest despite their short running times.
