This kept my interest in the early going but almost lost me as it turns into too much of a soap opera instead of a film noir, in which it is classified. <br /><br />There are some good touches film noir cinematography here and there which I enjoyed. Barbara Stanwyck, whom I usually like to watch, was nothing but a whining hypochondriac and not somebody you root for because of her constant demanding of everything. Yet, I somehow found her character at least bearable.<br /><br />I did like the ending and I thought it made the film more memorable and credible.
