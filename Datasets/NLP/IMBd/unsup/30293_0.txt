Times Square was my favorite movie 20 years ago and I still love it today! I watched it again this weekend and now I can't stop thinking about it. It is such a shame that no one can find the deleted scenes. I would pay almost anything to see them.<br /><br />Robin Johnson was my hero as Nicky, and the proto-type for the kind of butch girl I've been attracted to ever since. I wish she was still acting. After hearing her on the commentary of the DVD, I wonder how long it took her to lose her New York accent. Does anyone know if she is gay?<br /><br />I still love the sound track and didn't even mind the obviously mismatched inclusion of the BeeGees song (my musical tastes are very eclectic)--I thought the lyrics went with the plot.<br /><br />Thanks to Allan Moyle for the great idea for the movie and to Robin Johnson for helping me out of the closet!
