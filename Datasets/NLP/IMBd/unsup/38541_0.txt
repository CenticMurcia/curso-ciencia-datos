First off, I'd like to say that I was forced to watch this movie and by no means volunteered my time, energy and mind into this piece of trash. This movie has very few positives. I liked the intro with the black and white film...and that's about all I can really say. The one liners are downright hideous and the acting is straight gutwrenching. The riddle about Pumpkinhead is so bad, I swear I've never laughed so hard. There is an unending list of wrong turns that this movie makes and so many unexplained events. For example, why are the detectives and police always at Sean Braddock's place? Don't they have a station or facility for those things? And since when can a sheriff and detective reveal evidence about a case to their families? This film just must have not been thought out well before it was made. This movie was just not a good decision. EASILY!!! 2/10
