This short film occurs in January 13, 2001, where a Times war photographer -Harvey Jacobs (Stellan Skarsg친rd)- is wounded while witnessing a massacre at Nuevo Colon by terrorists. In a desperate effort, the United Nations sends a vehicle to get him out, a BMW driven by Clive Owen.<br /><br />This film, in comparison to any other film of the Hire series is possibly the best. The mark of Alejandro Gonz치lez I침치rritu is without contest the deepest one I've seen to date. It can't be denied that every second of the films matters in one way or another, either it is the feel of the environment, characters or even the state of mind. But since I'm a fan of his work I think I might be a little biased.<br /><br />The real hero of the film is actually the photographer's mother (Lois Smith) who really made a spectacular performance. I've seen the film about five times and I am still touched by her performance. Great Film 9/10 <br /><br />
