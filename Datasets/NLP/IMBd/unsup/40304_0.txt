I was expecting this movie to be much better. Unrealistic, boring, packed with low action tricks, very emotionless as a drama though dealing with such a painful topic. For me this has been the worst and very annoying performance of Cate Blanchett since the Bandits, though she is one of my favorites. Neither do other actors give a impressive performance. There are some good names in this movie, but almost everyone failed to capture by acting. I don't know if the portrayal of the characters was accurate, but their behavior is just so not realistic, as well as some events. The ending is too long and boring, too. I was really surprised how bad this film turned out to be.
