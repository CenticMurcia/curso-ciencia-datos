"What a turkey!" This is a simple line spoken by one of the characters as he's watching a random movie in the drive-in theater, but the phrase is actually much more applicable to the production he's starring in himself! This is a truly abysmal low-budget horror flick, put together by a bunch of amateurs that know nothing about cinema but simply wanted to cash-in on the success of such contemporary classics like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Two very UN-heroic police detectives investigate a series of murders that all took place in a Californian drive-in movie theater. It looks like some nutbag is practicing his sword-swashbuckling techniques on the horny customers there. The suspects include the theater's owner (who used to be a carny), the simple-minded janitor and the local pervert that spies upon young couples. Apart from some filthy gore (the best bits occurring in the opening minutes already), there's nothing to see here, unless if you're an admirer of bad acting, bad directing, bad editing, bad photography and even worse music. I couldn't understand half of the dialogs because all the moronic characters were mumbling, and the other half just didn't make any sense. The "red herring" climax is overlong and, despite its short running time, there are still way too many boring moments in the script. The concept and set pieces easily could have resulted in a much better (pre-slasher?) horror movie, if only some talent was involved. Incredibly bad film, avoid like the plague.
