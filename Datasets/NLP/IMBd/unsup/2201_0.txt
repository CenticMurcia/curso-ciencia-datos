OK, so it's not Oscar winning material, but I don't think it was meant to be. "Highway to Hell" is a fun flick about a couple on their way to Las Vegas to get married. They are eloping and to steer clear of the "authorities", they take a back road that turns into an entrance to hell. Yeah, it's corny but it's very entertaining and very well done.<br /><br />For the most part the acting is very good and the production including scenery and music are top notch. I loved the fact that "Hitler" is played by Gilbert Gottfried! Anne Meara, Ben Stiller, and the lovable Richard Farnsworth are also in the film as well as the late Kevin Peter Hall. As always, Chad Lowe does an A+ performance as "Charlie". I loved "Hell Cop" too. This is a fun movie! (I have not watched this film in over 10 years but I still enjoy remembering it.)<br /><br />This is another film that should be available on DVD. The purchase information shows the VHS tape available in Canada, but it really isn't (out of print). The movie industry would make more money if these old films were made available. There are lots of films I would love to have in my personal collection. This is definitely one of them!
