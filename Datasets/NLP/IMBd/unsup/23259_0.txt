Hello:<br /><br />I do like the comment about the movie. It is very interesting to notice that a small mistake took place in it. It is not a general from Germany that was shot by Robert Duval. That is an old clich√© that every military in my country was a German nazi. Imagine a nazi general amazingly old... He was a standard general of Argentina that might have done bad things between 1976 and 1983 in the times of the Military Dictatorship in my Argentina. I was born in Buenos Aires and the atmosphere of some neighborhoods of it was really fascinating and real. The performances of all the artists are very deep, natural and attractive. Cheers, Sergio.
