From the trailers I thought this movie looked awesome when I was a kid. A woman walking her dog is dragged down into the sewers by some unknown beast. The poster made it look like it was going to be good as well. In the end, however, the movie was rather weak and did not have the impact of the trailer or the poster. It still had some bite to it in the movie, but I just would have preferred they keep the focus on the monsters and not have the twist at the end they had. Typical monster movie for this time though as someone is trying to figure out what is beneath the city and seemingly eating the citizens on the surface. Not as much gore as I would have liked to have seen, however, from what I remember the monsters were not half bad. They are certainly the highlight of this movie which in the end seemed to spend most of their time making that trailer and such which goes to show you can bring in some money even with a rather weak movie, if you know how to advertise. I would say the makers of Ghoulies had the same market team as their movie was weak too, but thanks to the posters of the little monster coming out of the toilet it made more money than it really should have. Not sure how this one did, but you still get mentions of C.H.U.D.S in popular culture today as I remember a Simpsons that mentioned them.
