The first film with Michael Keaton was pretty dull and boring, I think I watched this sequel to see if it was as bad. Basically Abe Dale (Nathan Fillion) has his wife Rebecca (Kendall Cross) and son while eating lunch in a restaurant, when they were shot by a man who then shot himself. Three months later, Abe is still grieving and attempts suicide by overdosing on many pills at home, only to be rescued by his friend Marty Bloom (Adrian Holmes) and saved by doctors. His near-death experience, where he saw his family at the end of a long tunnel with bright light, has now given the ability to not only hear voices, i.e. white noise, in the static of televisions, but see people who will die. Abe passes many people who he can see lit up, and he finds out that this means they are due to die, and when he saves three of them, their light vanishes, including nurse Sherry Clarke (Katee Sackhoff). While looking back at some footage of his wife and son, Abe sees the man who who murdered them, Henry Caine (Craig Fairbrass), and when he sees him (very badly scarred) he finds out that he was seeing light on people also. Abe realises though that after saving the people he did, days later they commit an act that kills many others, so he knows that Sherry must die also, but in the end, he ends up dying himself and saves her as a spirit. Also starring Teryl Rothery as Julia Caine, William MacDonald as Dr. Karras, David Milchard as Kurt, Aaron Pearl as Stanley and Vanesa Tomasino as Laura. This sequel bears little similarity to it's predecessor, and in some ways it is an improvement, it certainly has a little bit more story to it, but as before, it is only good for the okay special effects, and it is still boring quite a lot. Adequate!
