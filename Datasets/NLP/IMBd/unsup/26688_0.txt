A classic gore movie from Italian director Aristide Massaccesi (alias Joe D'amato). It's a typical 80's slasher movie, its point of advantage is a great atmosphere and really good special fx. So good that someone claimed, when the movie was on theaters, that the scene with the fetus was a snuff! The fact is that the actress in the scene is Serena Grandi and the scene is just a great joke!<br /><br />The movie was banned in england for its violence.<br /><br />Some really scary scene, with good pathos was realized in this horror flick, together with excellent special effects.<br /><br />Even if it has its highs and lows it's one of the best gore movies of the 80's<br /><br />So, if you can't stand lots of blood and gore don't look for this movie!
