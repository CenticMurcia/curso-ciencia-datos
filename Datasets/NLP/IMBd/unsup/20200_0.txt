I never write about movies, but this is the one movie that has truly made me feel sick. I credit it as a work of art, it is brilliant in that sense, but on a personal level, I am left more disturbed than thrilled.<br /><br />I gave it a 4... and I was being generous. I cannot fathom why someone would want to watch this movie more than once. I watched it knowing what I was getting myself into, and out of curiosity but I was not expecting what came up on screen. I don't recommend this film to anyone... even though it is beautifully filmed and at the highest quality... you have to have the stomach to watch it.<br /><br />I don't think that it was funny at all either... some people have said so.. but i honestly didn't think any of it was funny.
