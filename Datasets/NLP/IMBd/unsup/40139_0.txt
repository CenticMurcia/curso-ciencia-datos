In an unidentified period in the future, nations become just one in the One Nation Earth, leaded by Franco "Lucifer" Macalousso (Nick Mancuso). The Christian opposers, leaded by Helen Hannah (Leigh Lewis), are systematically eliminated and Helen is put on trial in the O.N.E. Court of Justice. Her lawyer is Mitch Kendrick (Corbin Bernsen), a man who lost his father, murdered by the followers of Lucifer, and the attorney is his ex-lover Victoria Thorne (Jessica Steen). On the beginning of the trial, Mitch changes the defender, stating that Jesus Christ should be judged, and not his follower Helen, beginning the greatest trial in the history of mankind. The premise of "Judgement" is very interesting, but the movie is horrible. The screenplay is awful, having situations, development of characters and lines very shallow, and sometimes very ridiculous. The acting, with the exceptions of Leigh Lewis and Corbin Bernsen, is terrible. The "actor" called "Mr. T" is unbelievable, probably one of the worst performance I have ever seen. A couple of weeks ago I saw another Christian movie ("Left Behind") and I liked it, but "Judgement" is really a bad movie, for Christians only. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Julgamento" ("The Judgement")
