This movie should be shown at film school as a guideline for how *not* to make a movie. This is a film with an ensemble cast, and it seemed dead-set on making every character interact with each other at some point, whether it made any sense or not. What resulted was a plethora of scenes which had no relevance or effect on the story. The characters were poorly-written and under-developed. The long takes were impressive, but none of that matters if the content is bad. The only redeeming quality in this movie was Gary Sinise's performance. The other actors were either mis-cast (we all know David Schwimmer can only play one part) or just gave cliched, bad performances. This movie had no surprises, tons of plot-holes, sub-plots that went nowhere, confusing scenes that added nothing, and was for lack of a better word, just flat-out stupid.
