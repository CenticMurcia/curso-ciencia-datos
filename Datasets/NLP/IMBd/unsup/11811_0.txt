Vantage Point is a movie directed by Pete Travis and written by Barry Levy. The movie follows the events of the president getting shot and goes through several different characters or different points and shows the event as they see it and what happens to them. The cast includes Denis Quad, Mathew Fox, William Hurt, Forrest Whitaker and Sigourney Weaver.<br /><br />This movie was well under the radar for me as I didn't hear of it until seeing the trailer on a DVD for some over movie; I think it was "The Assignation of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford." So once seeing the trailer I automatically thought this looked like a ripper of a movie and I wasn't let down.<br /><br />The story is greatly written and intertwined, i couldn't help but wonder how awkward and mind bending it would be to have read it on script.<br /><br />Great acting by all in the cast, except for Mathew Fox, for me he just seemed like a less talkative Jack. Forrest Whitaker took the highlight for me though; he always steals the screen in a movie and doesn't fail here. His facial and tone just puts through to you the character greatly and makes you understand who is a lot better. Dennis Quad is his usual self and not much to say there, he is an American tough guy actor. I also though the two less Hollywood actors Edgar Ramirez and Said Taghmaoui did great job in portraying their characters and were stern on screen.<br /><br />The movie was put together and shot great, when you just think you're about to find out something from the plot the rewind happens the camera angles are lined up great to keep you guessing.<br /><br />I quite enjoyed this movie and found nothing at all bad about it. I'm giving it 7 and a half President shooting stars.<br /><br />7.5 - www.dylanreviews.ning.com
