After the shocker(but not a good one) that was HalloweeN III, Moustapha Akkad knew he had to resurrect Myers. Throw in a couple that has sex, a crap teen cast and an average killer in a mask along with a b.s. plot and you have HalloweeN 4.<br /><br />After being burnt to a smoking pile of bones at the end of Halloween II, Myers and Loomis ended the series there for 7 years. When Myers was madly asked for from fans, the Akkads decided to make Myers come back in style. So why didn't he? Well folks, here's where the spoilers start. You have been warned...<br /><br />Myers didn't die (? His fiery skull was seen at the end of part II), he just fell into a coma for 10 years. He is about to be transferred from the sanitarium he has been housed in when, surprise surprise, he breaks out. He tails his 7 year old niece Jamie and plots to kill her. Lee Curtis intelligibly jumped ship after II, so they had to bump her off in a car crash with her husband. That is all that is mentioned. No bloody explanation or anything. Jamie is Lauries daughter, and so Myers uses the 'kill-all-family-members theory' to make her a target. Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence are the gems in the acting crown here, which says a lot. Yes, you read that right. Pleasence makes a return as Loomis, which is impossible as he was in the middle of the explosion at the end of II. The only blemish on his face is a not-so-severe burn mark. But the thing that ruined 4 for me was Myers. The mask is a poorly customised Will Shatner mask which isn't scary at all, and Myers is an average killer. Yea, no leaping out of shadows and scares here, just him walking about and turning menacingly. Jesus, even that jerk Ghostface from Scream woulda done a better job. After seeing Myers get shot down an old abandoned mineshaft, the film ends with Jamie butchering her mother wearing a clown costume scarily similar to that of childhood Myers' getup. The whole thing echoes the opening scene of the original perfectly, as Jamie stands atop the stairs, grasping bloody scissors in her hand...<br /><br />I give this film a 3. <br /><br />1 mark for Harris' acting 1 mark for Pleasences acting and 1 mark for having the balls to bring Myers back<br /><br />Only watch this if you are bored on Halloween night and you want a cheesy film to get on with.
