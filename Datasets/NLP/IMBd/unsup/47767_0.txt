This is such a bleak and plotless film that unless you are looking for a reason to slit your wrists its probably best avoided. Through a series of brief vignettes in a surreal Australian landscape we are acquainted with Lola and her unfortunate daughter Alice both of whom are destined to be forever betrayed not only by the people they encounter but also by each other. The unrelenting grimness is even reflected in their sexual encounters with a succession of squalid and unsatisfying relationships.<br /><br />I tried very hard to fall asleep during this movie so that the time would pass more quickly but failed miserably and had to endure it to the end.
