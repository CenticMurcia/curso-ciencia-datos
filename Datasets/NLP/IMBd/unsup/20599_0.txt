I know I'm going against the grain here, because most of the comments have been favourable, but this movie is about as plausible as the Tooth Fairy. I knew from reading the premise that the movie would be predictable, but it was worse than that.<br /><br />OK, I have to admit, I missed the first ten minutes of the program. I came in where the two detectives, (OK, one detective and a Maytag repair man) returned to the apartment of Cheryl Draper, and told her they found nothing. I don't buy it. Police detectives are by their nature and training very suspicious, and make mountains out of molehills. You won't find many detectives willing to dismiss an allegation of murder out of hand.<br /><br />Spoilers follow: The murderer wrote a letter to himself, purportedly from her, in part so that he could get into her apartment and slip the latch. Once in her apartment, he used HER typewriter to write the second letter to himself, which he then mailed to himself. It would be shown to have originated on her typewriter. The thing is, it was not shown that he had an opportunity to write the first letter on her typewriter, so the typefaces would not have matched.<br /><br />That the sanity of Cheryl Draper would be called into question was as predictable as a sunrise. That she would, in the police station, with her sanity questioned, begin to ACT as though she were not quite right in the head was also predictable, with predictable results.<br /><br />If the detective had spent half as much time looking into the case, rather than trying to convince her that she imagined or dreamed it, he might have solved the case sooner. When people are dreaming, they don't realize that they are dreaming, but when they wake up, they do know that it was a dream.<br /><br />BIG spoiler here: The real downer came at the end, when Cheryl was being chased by the crowd, at the head of the pack was the murderer, bent on killing her. What does she do? She runs into a building under construction, and goes up the stairs, where she will ultimately run out of stairs and room to run. She will be trapped, and what a convenient place for the murderer to pitch her off the roof. Right. I think the writer of this Dreck had a bad dream, and should be referred to a pshrink.
