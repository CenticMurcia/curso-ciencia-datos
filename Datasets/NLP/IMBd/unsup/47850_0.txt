Trooper Hook(played by Joel McCrea)is a hard, but good-natured army officer, fighting against the Indians. When taking captive a notorious Apache leader, he finds out the Indian's wife is a white woman(Barbara Stanwyck), with an Indian child. Hook has to bring the woman(and the child) back to her real husband. Of course, there are some complications.(nothing you couldn't have guessed however)And that's about all the story there is...<br /><br />The only good thing about this western is the acting. Stanwyck and McCrea do a good job. The film itself never becomes irritating, but that's about the best you can say about it. There's hardly a decent story, the songs are pretty lousy and sometimes you can notice that it wasn't exactly the wild wild west they were filming in. Notice that at a certain moment the coach in which our main characters are traveling comes to a stop. When you see a close-up of Stanwyck however, the vehicle seems to be moving. It's just one of the examples of bad filming in this movie... 4/10
