I thought the acting in this film(except for the lead actor) was some of the worst I've seen. It reminded me of a high school drama production with a videocam. IF the scenes in jail/prison were actually shot there with real inmates, then they can be excused. This isn't a documentary; it's portrayed as fiction. I followed the exploits of the lead character with some interest. The others around him were almost cartoons. Having never been inside,I can't say the story is anywhere near accurate. It SEEMED to be accurate to those of us who have never had the misfortune of being jailed. Here's some things to ponder: in the opening the cops are banging in the door as the drug bust in going down. The partners are all together. We see the lead get busted as he comes out the door. So where could he stash 300K in that length of time where his two partners also wouldn't have known about it?<br /><br />In the end when he is out,(this is, I presume, eight years later) he gets the money(so well hidden in 60 seconds eight years before that no one found it by accident in 8 years, including the police) and heads over to "his place". Keep in mind his female friend doesn't live with him anymore. So, who has a place just sitting there for eight years? He didn't pay taxes, etc. and it would be confiscated.<br /><br />Rewind the shooting scene at the home and see if any of this acting adds up to an Oscar. It reminded me of the level of acting in a porn film(so did the set). So, he shoots a cop and drives nine hours unmolested to cross the U.S. Mexican border. Certainly the authorities would never put out an advisory.<br /><br />Overall, it kept my interest, but I felt the effort to make it "real" made it look "unreal".
