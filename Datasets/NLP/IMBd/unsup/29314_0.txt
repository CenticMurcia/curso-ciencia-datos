Despite having trouble with some of the incomprehensible dialog (and no I can't read the Kanji/Hiragana subtitles), I thought Sukiyaki Western Django was a solid action movie, that left no stone unturned in its thorough plot line.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino had only a small role throughout its entirety, but there is a heavy influence of his style indicated here with the many back-stories that this movie has to offer.<br /><br />Sukiyaki makes for a good shoot em up, action movie. With the many characters that are intertwined with their side stories, I didn't sit through this feeling at all distracted.<br /><br />The dialog was a little bit troublesome for me from some of the Japanese actors, that tried to not only annunciate their English, but to also provide the old western slang along with it. Overall, it was tolerable, but I had to rewind through some of the dialog to understand. But it wasn't enough to get me at all disinterested.<br /><br />Sukiyaki Western Django is one of the most abstract films I have ever had the pleasure to watch. The fact that this movie was supposed to take place in "Nevada", which clearly wasn't Nevada was actually quite humorous, and the direction did its best to persuade me into believing it wasn't really just a small village in the middle of Japan.<br /><br />The cast was entertaining all around. The protagonist stereotyped "the new stranger in town" and he didn't reveal much about himself except that he knows how to use a gun. However, the sheriff with the "Gollum" complex, the red haired Shakespearean boss, the creepy guy with the over-sized gums, and the sharp shooting Benten were all intriguing characters that kept this movie going. Some of the action sequences are rather memorable and somewhat comedic. Expect mass casualties along the lines of a Greek tragedy in the end.<br /><br />In an overview, I recommend Sukiyaki Western Django, just to see this movie as unique work of art. It's not the best movie I have ever seen, but it is a worthwhile watch.
