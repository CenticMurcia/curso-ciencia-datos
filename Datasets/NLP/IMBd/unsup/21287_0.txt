The movie Cilantro y Perejil follows the ups and downs of a relationship among a few couples. However, the entire movie is supposed to be a documentary about relationships which is filmed by the main character's sister, Nora. The aspect of using a character as almost a director was an interesting technique, because we were able to view the story through the eyes of Nora, thus we are able to witness both the good and the bad. This technique also helped the viewer to relate to the characters because we were able to see their desperation to appear "normal" (by begging Nora not to show arguments in the documentary), and normality is a quality everyone seeks in a relationship. The use of the psychiatrist commentary also helped to break up the monotony of the film by adding comic relief and a professional opinion. Plus, it was interesting to see how the children of the main characters Susana and Carlos were affected by their parent's problems, and how, for instance, the daughter often felt abandoned as if her mother was too busy dating to be with her. This also helped the movie move along, as it was nice to take the focus off the main characters every once in a while. However, I must say, that overall the movie is mundane, and seems to go on forever. There was no true climax, and the end was extremely predicable. The main idea of the movie was just too clich√©, which made me loose interest and not appreciate the film as much. Overall, it lacked originality.
