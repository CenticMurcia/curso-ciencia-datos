I'm not complaining or anything. sometimes i love to eat a bunch of chocolate, until i feel sick. a friend of mine referred to this movie this way, and i just felt he completely hit the point. It has like a thousand protagonists, and a thousand story-lines and uses a thousand of cinematographic tools... and in the end, there is not a protagonist nor a storyline nor a visual language. just like eating too much chocolate, still you won't regret about doing so. Must see... i guess not like it's for everybody. Characters, through a lot, are well developed, and kind on funny. the only real complain i have about this movie is that the whole baby thing, doesn't make sense at all... you'll see why.
