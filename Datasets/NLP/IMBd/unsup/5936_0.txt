OK, I love the film! Kate Maberly is such a wonderful young actress and I would like to see more of her! When I saw the movie for the first time I was 14 and I was really astonished how she could make me identify with Mary Lennox, a 10-year-old girl from the beginning at the century, in a story line no one would give a damn about in our days. It has been an experience of its own since. Now I'm 18 and probably more cynical, so it has lost some of its magic to me, but I still like to try to get enchanted and I would urge everyone to ... well ... open his mind. It's a children's movie alright, but more important it is just perfectly done!<br /><br />Mrs. Medlock, Mary Lennox's adversary, if you want so, is played by the excellent Maggie Smith. She rules the castle of Mary's tragic uncle, where she has to live. As if the castle weren't already a very eerie and uncomfortable place (you feel it), under her orders it becomes some kind of nuthouse as she's jerking around everybody - giving the movie very funny and very weird moments. It's unfair how she treats Mary and just plain crazy what she does to Colin, Mary's cousin. But she's not really evil, not a villainess, but she'll show us that she has a heart. I appreciate this attitude very much: how people are never really evil, only a bit sickened.<br /><br />All characters and actors are really fine, but I want to lose a few more words about Mary Lennox. It's an extremely well-written character for a child and this allows Kate Maberly to carry the movie, make us want to accompany her. Originally, she actually is *egotistic*, but maybe only thus she can find her way and make things right. You'll find her cheeky, you'll like her and you'll understand her.<br /><br />There is much more to say about the picturesque garden, music, friendships, attitudes and so forth... I'll leave it with my above feelings and thoughts. (If you know the movie, you'd find that I'm ignoring pretty much)<br /><br />Because I'm *cynical*, it doesn't make the 10: so 9 out of 10, then!
