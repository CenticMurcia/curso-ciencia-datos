This had potential, but the script ran out of ideas after 10 minutes and became obvious and completely predictable. Billy Connolly is held back and allowed to show only a few glimpses of his great comedy and acting talent, while Sharon Stone goes way over the top as she tries to compensate.<br /><br />A poor film all-round, where deus-ex-machina rules.
