Well, all I want to say is that this movie was a really great movie. It starred Glynnis O'Connor as Bobbie Lee Hartley and Robby Benson as Billy Joe McAllister. Bobbie Lee and Billy Joe fall in love but can not be together because Bobbie Lee is not allowed to date. But Billy Joe tries anyway and when they finally are allowed to date, an event happens that you did not see coming. You have really got to check this movie out!! It is like my favorite movie of all-time! I know a lot of people that commented on this movie wrote something about bad Mississippi accents..Well they are not from Mississippi and they have no right to say anything bad about how horrible this movie is based on something like that! There is nothing wrong with their accents, thats just how it is supposed to be, and if you don't want to hear accents, then don't watch the movie. But if you aren't a total idiot, I recommend that you see this movie. I give it 2 thumbs way up and 10 stars!! Wooo!!
