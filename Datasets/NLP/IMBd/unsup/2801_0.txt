What can I say... well first off this is John Fallon and Christian Veil's new film which has been in the making for a little while now. When the movie began I was surprised at how quickly it got itself into the mind of the viewer. Just the beginning alone is a testament to the violent brutality yet to come. It has been a long time since a film has begun with such a brutal punch! Along the way there are a couple of interesting plot turns and character development but not many. This is a straight forward revenge flick deeply rooted in gritty 80's fare such as Death Wish and The Exterminator. Fans of those particular movies will find themselves at home with Deaden while others will be surprised that such a movie could be made.<br /><br />John Fallon's performance definitely shines as the walking revenge machine. He takes out people like no other and seems to bring a dark humorous vibe to the whole piece. Direction is handled pretty good as well considering the budget restrictions and all. Overall it is an entertaining piece of gritty film making.<br /><br />John and Chris are on their way up!
