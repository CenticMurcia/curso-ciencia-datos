It is a joy to see a movie that has no pretentions of being anything other than just a movie. It is pure entertainment, and it is pure joy. To be able to sit back and enjoy this movie is one of life's pure joys. If only some more movies were like this, the other drivel out there would be so much more bearable (who in Hollywood actually thought THE HAUNTING was good?). If Gibson Frazier does not become a star, then something is wrong. His performance as Johnny Twennies steals the show from an otherwise likable cast --including Dwight Ewell (CHASING AMY), Frank Gorshin (TV's BATMAN), Susan Egan (HERCULES), Cara Buono (THE COWBOY WAY), David Margulies (GHOSTBUSTERS), and Anthony Rapp (SCHOOL TIES)-- with a dapper smile and a tip of the hat. <br /><br />Critics will tell you that the movie is slight. And guess what? It is, and it revels in being just so. But it does what movies were always meant to do... not teach you some social more, but transport us for a little bit of time, from our own dreary lives to some place sunnier, funnier. In other words, the film does nothing but entertain.<br /><br />Unfortunately the films' studio, Fine Line Features, is not giving this picture the full-press coverage that it really deserves, so you will have to look hard to find it in the theaters. An easier way is simply to click on theater listings at "www.manofthecentury.com".
