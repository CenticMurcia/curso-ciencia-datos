I'm a real dusk till dawn fan, since I first watched it on the big screen. And when I learned that there will be one prequel and one sequel, I was very happy. After that, I learned that Bruce Campbell will be in the cast, that also made me happy 'cause I love Bruce. But when I watched the movie this Saturday, I was totally disappointed, I mean, this is the most meaningless, plotless and unnecessary sequel I ever seen. I think Dimension films made a great decision by NOT releasing this crap to the theaters. What's this movie trying to tell anyway? The vampires can easily rob the banks? We know they can kill people easily for sure. And for God's sake, how in the earth that the vampire from the first film (the barman) resurrected after the melting sequence?<br /><br />And for the last, if you still want to watch this thing, watch it like something else, not the sequel to the Big Smash Hit. I hope the prequel (Hangman's Daughter) will be much much far from this...<br /><br />
