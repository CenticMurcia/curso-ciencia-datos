I sat down to watch this movie with my girlfriend, who loves cheap sci fi films, expecting to fall asleep at some point. Just when I was losing interest, I began to realize that I was watching a loose remake of "Treasure of the Sierra Madre", the great Humphrey Bogart-Walter Huston movie from 1948, one of my favorites.<br /><br />I think the scene where the old man began dancing a jig and laughing crazily after finding the "precious" ore tipped me off. Although it was set on an asteroid, the plot was basically the same. The character in the 1948 film who wanted to horn in on their partnership was changed to a woman (Joan Chen) in this movie.<br /><br />Rent both films and see if I'm right. I rate "Precious Find" a 3 out of 10 by the way.
