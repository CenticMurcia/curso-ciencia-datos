Remember that dog food commercial that had dogs magically doing hip hop dance steps because they were so excited about Kibbles and Bits. Cute for a commercial but stretched into a movie not so cute. The plot about a murdered man,Pat Morita(Arnold of Happy Days fame) and his kung fu fighting dog is just plain silly. I laughed as I watched every time the dog did a kung fu stance ,it was just like the dog food commercial. And how about Jon Voight ??? An academy award winner in this movie. What was he thinking ,hamming it up for the cameras no doubt. How far has he fallen. Much too old to do action stunts most of his martial arts scenes are unconvincing stunt doubles. Only redeeming value is younger kids might find it amusing until the next pet food commercial comes out.
