First viewed this film when it came out. This is an excellent film for the amount of excitement it brings to the viewer. Sure, there are some mistakes in it, such as the weapons used, but that should not detract from the overall excellent story line (which is much like "Objective Burma", another excellent film). I believe that it was one of Gary Cooper's finest roles. Fit right in with his overall "homespun" personality. Like all films from this era (1950s) it portrayed the American Indian as the villain. History of the Seminole Wars shows just the opposite. But, if one can put that aside, then this is a highly enjoyable movie.
