I was a die-hard JAG fan. When it ended, I was saddened and unsure which show would take JAG's place in my heart. NCIS (originally titled Navy NCIS) appeared as a spin off of one of the shows in JAG's final season. I love NCIS because it is a very "figure it out" show with out all the blood and gore of CSI. Plus, I love almost anything present day military, so NCIS is right up my alley. The biggest thing that won me over with NCIS was, like JAG, the show isn't driven by the things that happen to the characters but more about how they handle the issues and relate to each other to solve the problems. If you liked JAG, NCIS may become your new favorite show, too.
