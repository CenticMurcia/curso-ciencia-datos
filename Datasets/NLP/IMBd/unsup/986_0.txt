After viewing this film and trying to understand why a family would try to welcome a Nazi Youth into their family, who had all kinds of hatred for all people and was brain washed by monster's who killed Thousands upon Thousands of Jews and many other races. I realized this is only a Hollywood dream works during 1944, which was probably quite amazing to the public who viewed this film. Fredric March(Mike Frame),"The Iceman Cometh",'73, and Joan Carroll,(Pat Frame),"Tower of London",'39, did their very best to help their adopted Hitler Youth, Skip Homerier,(Emil Bruckner),"Halls of Montezuma",'51, try to adjust to the American way of living. Emil was a devil on wheels who did everything horrible you can even think about doing. Betty Field,(Leona Richards),"Birdman of Alcatraz",'62 and Agnes Moorehead,(Jessie),"Dragon Seed",'44, gave great supporting roles to this twisted story. Just imagine if we tried to adopt Usama Bin Laden's son into our homes today, I doubt very much if this film would win an Academy Award. I am happy to say that Skip Homerier did play a fantastic role in "Halls of Montezuma",'51 as Pvt (Pretty Boy) Riley.
