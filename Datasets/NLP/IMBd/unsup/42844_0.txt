Aha...so this is among the low-budget films of the 90s. In my opinion, believe it or not, this is an OK use of the budget. Not that it's socially-redeeming, or anything, 'cause it ain't. It's just that I kept waiting for a really bad part of the movie to happen...but it didn't. Not that it's good, 'cause it ain't. Half bad 'bout says it. Three cavemen return to what's left of their village to learn via the dying breaths of one victim that the plunderers kidnapped three gals from the settlement. So off go our heroes to rescue the babes. That's the extremely simplistic plot. Like I say, I thought that the ancient beasts were OK. The dialogue was mercifully abbreviated. (Hey - that also describes the attire.) There are at least two things that I could have done without: (1) a narrator; and (2) the blending at the end of the futuristic with the prehistoric. Sexism be damned, but the ladies were pleasing to my eyes. Still, don't expect too much if you view this film - not even a lotta bare boobs - just plentiful skin. Buy it only if that doesn't exceed the cost of a reasonable rental.
