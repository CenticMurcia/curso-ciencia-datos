There is only one way to describe this movie and that is that it is a complete waste of your time. A new definition for the low budget movie. Poor choice of scenery. The script must fit on a paper napkin. Only good thing I can say about this movie is Cherish, she looks beautiful (in the first 10 minutes). The movie starts of promising but after 5 minutes it's clear you made the wrong choice to go for the catchy title. If you really want to see this movie and even enjoy it a little bit try increasing the playback speed. When everyone sounds Donald Duck it wastes only 30 minutes of your time. It took me 15 minutes to start doing this and I am happy I did. By the way, Donald Duck is still 100 times better.
