OK....so we got a ghost-town (literally) with a conferate soldier and a gaggle of zombies guarding the corpse of his sister. Do I even need to tell you the rest? I will say its an original way to promote zombies to have them fully aware of their surroundings as upposed to mindless oafs staggering around, but that's as good as it got. The whole plot was awful and what kind of ending was THAT?? The highlight of the movie was when Earl runs into the room and sees N*GGER written on skulls and says in a high pitched voice "OOH Sh*t, that ain't right!" Speaking of which, it was in the legend that Bloody Bill hated blacks yet he didn't kill the black characters any differently from the whites, so they blew that plot twist completely.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was awful, don't even bother, no redemption value at all.<br /><br />2 out of 10 (only because of the opening chase scene prevented it being a 1)
