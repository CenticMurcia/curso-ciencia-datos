This is another of the Warner Bros. "Censored 11" cartoons that aren't shown on commercial television anymore and the only one with their star character, Bugs Bunny. In this one, the hunter is not Elmer Fudd but a caricatured black man with the big white lips and the slow drawl that's a carbon copy of the Stepin Fetchit character. It's largely because of this stereotypical characterization that this cartoon is banned and in this case, I don't blame them. While there are still some funny gags typical of Tex Avery (such as when Bugs' various body parts quickly disconnect when he gets scared), the Fetchit character's presence makes the whole thing uncomfortable, especially during the final sequence when he's challenged to a crap game. So unless you're a completist of the Bunny, Avery, and/or Warner cartoons, I don't recommend All This and Rabbit Stew.
