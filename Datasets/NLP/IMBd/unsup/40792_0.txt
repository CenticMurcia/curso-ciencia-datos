I have seen several TV/film adaptations of this story, and this is by far the worst. For a start there's the central character, who lacks any of the charisma of Conan Doyle's creation. He shoots up with drugs in public toilets, he beats up and threatens cabbies - it all seems too much like the makers of this new adaption are desperately trying to get an audience, but might have been happier making episodes of Eastenders. Parts of the story are ignored completely. And as for the hound itself - it looks nothing like a dog, even one that's been brutally treated all its life. More like an escapee from 'Walking With Beasts'. It's not a total flop, however. Watson (played by Ian Hart) is at last an intelligent doctor rather than the bumbling idiot he's usually portrayed as, and Richard E.Grant makes for a sly, scheming Stapleton. However, you'd be much better off watching the far superior Basil Rathbone, Peter Cushing and Ian Richardson versions.
