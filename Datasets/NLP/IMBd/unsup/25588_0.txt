The people who knock this movie have no sense of what makes a movie funny. Screwed was indeed funny, much more so than for example, Anchorman. Actually, everyone I know was laughing constantly throughout this terrific comedy! I'm not going to give anything big away, but after Norm McDonald and Dave Chappelle realize they have failed to kidnap Mrs. Crock's dog, Chappelle let's out one of the funniest one-liners that I have ever heard. We are talking non-stop laughs throughout this move. The plot is absurd, but this seriously added to the film's overall hilarity. If you miss this movie due to negative comments made by various users, you have truly done yourself an injustice.
