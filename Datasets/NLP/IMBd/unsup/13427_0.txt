Splash is a fabulous movie that is truly touching to the heart. It is not just about a mermaid who is trying to find her way in a modern world that she does not understand, but it is about true love and the hardships that come along with it. (There's even more hardships because she's a MERMAID!!!) From Bloomingdales to the bottom of the sea, this movie constantly finds ways to make you burst out laughing, while also making you burst out in tears! The leading actors and actresses do a remarkable job; some being Tom Hanks as the man in love and Daryl Hannah as the beautiful and hilarious mermaid. I also must say that Daryl Hannah's tail looks stunningly real, with so many details that every time you watch it you notice something new. That can also be said for the entire film! Splash is a movie that, simply put, reaches above and beyond. It is great for all ages, because I am twelve!
