I have luckily escaped seeing any of the Rugrats movies, and have watched the series now and then with my kids. It's a cute show, but really not much material there for a whole movie. Thankfully, this movie was rather short, and relatively painless. There are a few pop culture references there simply for the parents (and then, some parents are too young to appreciate them...I swear I was the only one in the theater who "got" the Poseidon Adventure reference...perhaps the other parents were still in diapers when that movie came out in the 70s...) but other than that not too thrilling. It would have been nice to have the scratch n sniff cards but they were not made available to us at the theater. My kids told me we needed to go to Burger King and get them (after the fact, of course)...since I don't watch the Nickolodeon ads, I didn't know this. Not a great classic kids movie by any means, but okay to watch. We won't be buying this one.
