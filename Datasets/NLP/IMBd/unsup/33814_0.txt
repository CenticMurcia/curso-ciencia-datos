<br /><br />OK, just saw the movie (rented it, thank god I didn't spend more than 2'50 Euros on this thing) and hey, can't remember the last time I saw something sooooo bad... Oh, and if someone got what the hell is going on, I'll be glad to know it... my sister and I are still discussing our views on what we have just seen... Double crossings? people gone bananas? no one cares for the dead guys? And, is both main characters the same character?<br /><br />Mamma mia...
