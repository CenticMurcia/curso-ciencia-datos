To say the least, Malcolm Lee's "The Best Man" is the most respectable African-American oriented movie to be released since "Soul Food" and "Love Jones." The movie portrays it's characters in such a way that people of all ethnicities can go home with the satisfaction that they may know someone exactly like someone in the film. It is a great movie that leaves viewers with a great feeling, and provides hope that the African-American film genre has risen above sophomoric story-lines of "Boyz in the Hood."
