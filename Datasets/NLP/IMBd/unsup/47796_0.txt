Last year I was at a video store with a few friends when we saw the case for Scream Bloody Murder. It was obvious right away that this would be a rather cheesy and/or bad movie. And seeing as those types of movies always make for entertaining group viewing, we rented it.<br /><br />We were somewhat disappointed when we got to the actual viewing part as the movie was plain bad. Not really even in the entertaining way as it was obvious that they were trying to make a campy movie (and just weren't doing a very good job of it).<br /><br />As the movie reaches the climatic final showdown it suddenly takes a turn for the hilarious. I don't want to spoil anything but you'll know when it happens. The humor up till then has been hit and miss at best but the last 15 minutes or so are pure gold.<br /><br />If you enjoy cheesy movies, and are willing to sit through the first hour or so of not so good viewing, then check it out. Otherwise, pass.
