I watched about 30 minutes of this movie and the acting was just horrible. I looked they were reading off the tree or something. The special effects of that crocodile were so awful. The look as the crocodile ate it's victims didn't look as if they fit together. The CGI is horrible and the guy throwing the eggs is just stupid. Then the other guy says that they are chicken eggs. The eggs are about 20 pounds each! Who wrote these lines in this movie? Obviously this guy has never seen an egg in his whole life. Please, I beg the people out there to never see this movie. Even if you are bored out of your gored there are many more things better to do than watch this movie. Watching the toilet flush is more exciting.
