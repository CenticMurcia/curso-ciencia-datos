I don't usually comment on these so don't mind if I'm not that well versed. For one thing, I truly believe that this film should have gotten more Academy Award nominations besides the one that it got.<br /><br />This film is exquisite and unique by any standards. First take the plot. The movie follows a rare and special 'red violin' over three centuries. It finally ends up in an auction where it is being eyed by the obsessed Charles Morritz [Samuel L. Jackson]. Throughout the movie we follow the journey of the violin and the lives of all who touched it. Upon the climax, we learn all the secrets of the violin. This movie had everything. Beautiful costumes, excellent acting, great visual effects, stunning cinematography, and a suspenseful plot.<br /><br />If you love suspense, drama, and mystery this movie is for you.
