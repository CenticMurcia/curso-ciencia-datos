I am a pure Hanna-Barbera fan and a pure fan in animation also! This was another great and enjoyable series! Yogi Bear was first a segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show and then Yogi got promoted to his own show and Hokey Wolf took Yogi's place on The Huckleberry Hound Show. Yogi Bear's guest stars on his show were Snagglepuss and Yakky Doodle Duck. I remember that before Snagglepuss got his own show he first guest starred on some other Hanna-Barbera cartoons like Quick Draw McGraw and Snooper and Blabber. He guest starred he was orange and then when he got his own cartoon he was pink with cuffs and collar tie which made him look like a brother to the Pink Panther almost. Yakky Doodle is a duck who has a dog friend named Chopper who would always stick up for him. I liked some of the Yakky Doodle cartoons when they have Fibber Fox in them. I remember in every Yogi Bear cartoon, Yogi Bear would always tell his sidekick, Boo-Boo that they are getting a picnic basket and Ranger Smith always catches Yogi red-handed which I thought was funny. This cartoon is smarter than the average, hey hey hey!
