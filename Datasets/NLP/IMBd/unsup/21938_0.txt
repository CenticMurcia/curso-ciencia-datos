I've never heard of this movie on tv or anywhere. I've seen the name somewhere on internet (p2p...) and I've checked here on imdb to know more about it, it sounded interesting. Now I've seen it and I put this movie in the top 3 of all movies I've ever seen ! It's amazing, from the start to the end you'll never get your eyes off of the screen. The actors are wonderful, there's really nothing bad to say about this movie. Go buy/rent it it's fabulous !<br /><br />
