How many times have you heard "based on true events"? Clich√©d, a few scares, attractive young women, blood and a bit of gore...and yes a creature on a killing spree. In a wooded area in Wisconsin people are missing, getting ripped in half and some having their guts devoured. A local sheriff finds himself looking for a creature leaving DNA of both man and wolf. What you get to see of the beast is not all that bad and like a lot of cheesy horror fare...the finale is the best sequence of the movie.<br /><br />Among the cast members: Jeff Denton, Sarah Lieving, Tom Nagel, Tom Downey, Christina Rosenberg, Marija Polsley and with Joel Hebner playing the beast of Bray Road.
