This movie would be a stinker whomever played lead. Would take a change of half the cast and a major rewrite to make this come close to a passable.<br /><br />Too much focus on tidbits about this cult, not enough focus on characters and a story. - And the strange undercover thing. Cant see her getting police funding for that.<br /><br />"Swear you wont tell anyone" - "we are not allowed to swear" "we can promise" what policeman would ask people to swear not to blow their cover ? Just makes it look even more like another silly buildup to another tidbit "fact" about this cult.<br /><br />If you want facts about kabbalah/Judaism you should probably read a book or something. If you want to see drama/crime look elsewhere too.<br /><br />I rate this movie somewhere below mediocre and boring. 4/10
