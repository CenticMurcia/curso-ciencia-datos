This movie was a total surprise from the first scene. Twisted and turned and the loved the handling of the theme of redemption. Caught this at Worldfest Houston, 2005, and have to say that anyone who can write a script like this in 2 weeks blows my mind to pieces. Really appreciated the contrasts and the superb acting. The writer/director stayed true to his characters and story line throughout. There was not one moment that lost my attention. Eric Roberts was the best I have ever seen him. His every word and action completely convinced me he was in the best role of his career. In every male in the movie, I have to say, that I have known many men with the exact characteristics portrayed and punched around in the movie. Sadly, I have met few women that have the devotion and fortitude of Mai Ling (the Chinese mail order bride) character in the movie. I applaud the entire movie: creative idea, screenplay,directing, acting, editing, total, total. I left the theater wanting more.
