Well that's odd, I thought as I picked up the June '98 issue of CMJ monthly. There's this ad in it for a movie called Shooting Fish with Kate Beckinsale in it (I love Kate Beckinsale... well did in the other two movies I'd seen her in before)with a soundtrack that's got music from Dubstar and Space and The Supernaturals and... Dionne Warwick. So anyway to make a long story short, I searched (in vain) for the soundtrack for nigh on a year but to no avail. Anyway, then one day I was at the video store (Major Video, before Blockbuster decided to buy that too) and I saw it and thought "Jaysis, there's something I need to see!" It had that snazzy-looking retro box, too, and I was in a happy mood, so I gladly went home and popped it in.<br /><br />This must have been the cheeriest movie I'd seen in years. It made me think of Bringing Up Baby it was so happy (and that's a good thing, by the way). Kate Beckinsale is absolutely charming, the American guy is lots of fun, and the English guy has the great sense to be charming AND insanely cute in that odd way that the British have. The movie has a plot, sure, but it doesn't matter. You should just watch it and be hap-hap-happy! Revel in the retro-kitsch set design and the goofy dialogue and that English guy's striped t-shirt. It's the best pick-me-up since Bounty (or, you know, whatever). (By the way, I warn you... after I saw it I caught myself singing that Dionne Warwick song for weeks afterwards.)
