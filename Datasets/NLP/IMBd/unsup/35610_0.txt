There really isn't much to say about this movie. It's sickeningly boring and it doesn't make much sense! It even makes "Howling II" look good. And that IS saying a lot. The mother was an insult to women everywhere as she fluttered through this one like a butterfly. The boy was so gut-wrenchingly despicable that you almost want to cry. Twenty minutes into this one, I was asleep. When I woke up, I was wishing that Stirba and her "gang" would "pop out" somewhere. Once again, this film is garbage!
