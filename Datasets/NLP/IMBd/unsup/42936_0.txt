This disaster drama created for TV is based on a novel by a popular New York TV anchorman-turned-author Chuck Scarborough. A massive earthquake shakes 'The Big Apple' and the city is all but held hostage by the devastation. New York City Mayor Bruce Lincoln(Charles S. Dutton)and his political foe Fire Chief Thomas Ahearn(Tom Skerritt)come to grips putting their differences aside to work together digging the city out of the ruble. There seems to be more than enough sub plots stretching this Hallmark presentation to near three hours. There are some good special effects, but nothing we haven't seen before. This earthquake flick is really no great shakes. And not unlike other disaster movies there is vast and varied talent featured in the cast: Sharon Lawrence, Jennifer Garner, Fred Weller, Lisa Nicole Carson, Rachel Ticotin and Cicely Tyson.
