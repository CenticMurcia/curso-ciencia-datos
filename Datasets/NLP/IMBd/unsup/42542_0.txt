I'll agree that the movie is indeed awful, but it nevertheless brought a nostalgic smile when I came across the title as I was looking up some information on Ian McShane now that I have caught up on all the Deadwood episodes but still find myself wanting to see more of him. For the odd reason that a high school coach/health teacher back in the 80's (I'll even confess my real age and tell you I was a grad of '89) somehow thought that Torchlight was an effective cautionary tale to warn us away from the evils of drug use. While I am too mature for such pursuits now that I'm a wise adult and, of course, believe that all youngsters should just say no,I'll observe that the movie has an opposite effect to that the coach intended. Sit through more than fifteen minutes of it, and at the very least you'll require a drinking game tied to Pamela Sue's oh-so-impressive emoting for the cameras to make it through the rest.
