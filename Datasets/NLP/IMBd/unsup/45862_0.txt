Okay,I admit,I do like silly movies.Let's see,I sat and giggled, through "Esupai"(ESPY).I grinned at "Dakaiju Baran".Yes,I also sat smiling throughout "Godzilla vs. Hedora".But "Nostradamus' Fearful Prediction" is Toho's biggest,most fattest folly since "Godzilla's Leverage".<br /><br />Here is why:<br /><br />Most of the warfare scenes are stock footage from other war films.<br /><br />Corny as I will get English dubbing.<br /><br />Characters are "trying" to be actors,but even the decent actors (Tetsoro Tanbah) look like they would love to do anything but star in such a cheeseball.<br /><br />The mutant creature designs are sooooooo goofy.Flesh eating slugs?Giant plants and flowers that swallow anything?Mutant bat props that are thrown onto the scene?Giant Leeches?Two words:GET REAL!!!The mutant humans(which are mostly kids becoming expired from too much pollution),look more like living jelly doughnuts,no thanks to the poor make-up.<br /><br />Toho Studios,Toshio Masuda,Yoshimitsu Banno,and poor Pomoyuki Tanaka.Tsk-tsk.<br /><br />I felt so sorry for you guys when you did this "Turkey of a doomsday movie".
