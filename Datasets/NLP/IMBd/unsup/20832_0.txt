OK, I've just been at the premiere, and I know one of the cast members, and my ticket got me free beer, but this is a great little film. As somebody who came to university in Glasgow and found outlets for my more esoteric habits I found myself nodding and laughing redolently at many points, although I should add that I was never into the fantasy role playing contained herein. I fear this subject matter may put some people off, but the film is about so much more than that- it's a refreshing look at young folk in Glasgow that avoids so many of the usual clich√©s, while it perfectly addresses the myriad people one meets in the city, and the culture shock. I could pick a couple of points in the script which could have done with more development and resolution, but ultimately this is exactly the kind of film Scotland should be producing, and I'm shocked that it hasn't received more media attention here.<br /><br />That said, how can you turn left outside the G.U.U. and find yourself outside the reading room? You'd need to turn right! God, I hate myself.
