This is simply one of the best movies ever made because it's so funny and the creators didn't intend for it to be. It is an instant cult classic along with the Turkish Star Wars and Turkish Star Trek.<br /><br />I remember the first time I saw this movie the year was 1996 and I just couldn't stop laughing at the fake ninja tree fight scene. The next time it aired on TV I had the VCR at the ready. I must have watched it a good 10 times and showed it to all my friends and they pretty much had the same reaction as me. I literally freaked out when my dad taped a football game over it.<br /><br />I needed to find this movie again!! After 10 years of searching I finally found it through the magic of the interweb.<br /><br />I was expecting it to loose some of its luster over the years and all the hype my friends put it through back in the day but it didn't. It still made me laugh just as hard as when I first watched it.
