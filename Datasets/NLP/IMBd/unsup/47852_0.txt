I have rarely seen a movie so bloody stereotypical and offensive towards a group of people. How dare they produce something which is composed of nothing but blatant stereotypes on one group of people alone. It is terrible and I don't care that the movie was good besides that fact, because I do not support pathetic stereotypes like this. They made all Arabs look like women beating, anti-American, stupid terrorists that want to end the world. They portrayed Arabs worse in this movie than they portrayed Nazis in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. I have known many Arab Americans and I am sorry, I'm not such a weak minded fool that I'm going to sit through a movie which degrades them like this. The producers showed NO concern whatsoever about who they offend. Fine, they wanna make a movie that offends everybody that isn't as bad because it isn't a "racist" movie. But when they produce a movie that specifically points at Arabs with the finger and makes every other group of people look fine that's called racism. I do NOT think a movie like this is worth anything more than to spit on. Neither are the scriptwriters and the producers.
