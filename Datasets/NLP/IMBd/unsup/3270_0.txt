...however let's try.<br /><br />I'm not gonna sketch the plot, couz' plenty other people have done it, but:<br /><br />The humor is outstanding, the action is tense, and one can not help getting sucked into this world filled with nutcases, daydreamers, villains, plain goofy looking types, and hopelessly stupid inventions and the characters likewise way of thinking.<br /><br />The music score is absolutely perfect, the dialog is sharp and fun, the scenes are extremely well done. It simply doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />Just my two cents
