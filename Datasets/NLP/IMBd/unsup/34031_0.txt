Remember back in the late 80's there were thesestr8video films about underground fight-clubs that only the rich and powerful had access to and Lorenzo-Lamas had to go under-cover to expose. Now with every neighborhood having a garage fight-club or back-yard wrestling league they seem outdated. Well between Courtney Cox's show dirt and TMZ this movie is sadly outdated and horribly tame. It advertises itself as a look inside the secret drug and cocaine fueled world of Hollywood's blonde haired bronze skinned chosen ones. Who make million dollars deals all-day and go clubbing all-night and Â….Start-off cocaine fueled sex doesn't happen on grammas' old king sized bed. It happens in club bathrooms, fancy restaurants kitchen floors parking lots pools and limos. And it involves a lot more Oral sex. As for the clubbing they go to one club as I remember and they didn't even get into the VIPs room. It s was the main club floor that's it. Characters are introduced by some named older actor playing their handler and screaming at them about their life of excess and how they're going to get themselves in trouble. Thanks mom. One character is chewed out for having sex with a 15 yoa. The show Dirt had an action adventure star caught on a "To catch a predator" type under-cover sting. This movie was supposed to take you inside the secret world tell you something you didn't know. Hell I know more about the secret world of Hollywood VIP's than this writer and director. And there was no suspense or sense of adventure. No-one caught a beating or a dick they didn't want because of a drug debt. Nothing happened nothing happened. Except Mickey Rourke turned in another fine sleazy performance.
