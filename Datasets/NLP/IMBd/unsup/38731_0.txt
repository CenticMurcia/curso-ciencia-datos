I should have known better. But I rented this and soon found myself watching. Everything is utterly wrong in this film - the dialouge, the cast (especially David Johansen) and plots of these little, insignificant stories. Getting back to David Johansen. Why him and why The (new) Misfits? Is this film an ode to long gone punk rock stars? Well, I can tolerate that but I thought this was a little like Creep Show. But it's even more stupid than that. The first two stories are told clumsily and hurried so we can all sit back and watch the final story which takes up far, far too much of the total playing time of an hour and a half. Everything about this is horrible and I didn't even have a laugh like I usually do when a watch things like these. 2 out of 10. And that's only because the cgi effects are so corny that they made me smile for a second or two.
