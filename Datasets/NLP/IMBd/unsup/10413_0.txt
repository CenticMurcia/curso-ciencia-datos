One of my favorites!<br /><br />John McTiernan at his best. I first saw this film back in '88 and it scared the hell out of me. Partly in due to its suspenceful plot and visual effects, and the fact that I was only eight years old in 1988.<br /><br />Recently reviewing the "Special Edition" version released in 2002, on Region 2 DVD format. The two-disc DVD package of "Predator : Special Edition" is the most current up-to-date version of the film. Disc 1 features the theatrical release of the film in 1:85:1 aspect (enhanced for 16x9 screens). A rather dull but interesting commentary by John McTiernan, as well as interesting text commentary. Subtitles in 14 different languages, and an easter egg. Disc 2 features some excellent stuff such as featurettes, trailers, documentaries, etc. Interesting stuff!!<br /><br />"Predator" begins in the fashion of "Aliens", space! But quickly changes to the classic Arnie like war flick (anything before 1987), and even resembles aspects of the second Rambo film. The Plot : Arnold and his team of special forces are hired by CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) to rescue American hostages deep in the Central American jungle. While all seems to go well and is looking good, WE begin to see what something else SEES (which for an eight year old was a little freaky). The team is being watched from the trees by something invisible.<br /><br />The team reaches the village where the hostages are being kept, they quietly blow it to pieces only to find out that they were setup by one of their own. Pissed off, Arnie & team decide to leave without a trace, or should I say a trace of their own words. WE begin to see (through its own infrared heat imaging vision) that something is stalking them.<br /><br />As the team is trying to get to their pick up point they are being killed one by one be something unknown, and unseen.......... I'll leave the rest up to you!!!<br /><br />"Predator" is a classic popcorn film, and one of the best action films of the Twentieth Century. It was the film that turn Arnold into a plausable actor. A fine performance by Kevin Peter Hall (he will be missed). My only wish that didn't come true is for a better sequel, that is a different story.
