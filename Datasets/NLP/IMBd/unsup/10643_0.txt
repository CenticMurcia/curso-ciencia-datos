If Busby Berkley and Orson Wells had made a movie together, this mighta been it. Coppola has tried so hard throughout his career to "reject Hollywood" - and Hollywood has, in turn, often rejected him - yet he makes a truly gorgeous paean to Hollywood production values here. Though it gets SO over the top at times (can you say "Rosebud"...?), Frederick Forrest and Teri Garr keep it pretty real. And the soundtrack is my all-time favorite. Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle - it's a pure gem.<br /><br />"One From The Heart" makes one wonder what kind of musical Orson Welles might have come up with - to be fair, Coppola's talent hasn't soured over the decades as he's had either critical or box office failures. The same can't be said of ol' Orson, who became a caricature of himself in the 60s and never recovered even a whiff of his genius.<br /><br />Definitely give this a viewing if you've enjoyed any other Coppola film. This gives real texture to his body of work.
