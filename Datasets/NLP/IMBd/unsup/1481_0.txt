It has been said before, but I came to the same conclusion so it must be said again: if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. Super-glossy image, decent acting (though I find Sobieski pretty boring as a lead) and a good, minimalist music score can't do much when the clumsy screenplay has so many conveniences (the heroine seems to have a mysterious knack for being in the right place at the right time to see/hear/find everything she needs to piece the truth together). The only well-handled aspect of the film is the subtle sexual tension between Sobieski and Skarsgard, but this sub-plot is soon dropped. (*1/2)
