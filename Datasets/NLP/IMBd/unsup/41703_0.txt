Neither the slick production values, half-decent creature-effects nor the presence of the great Jeffrey Combs (as H.P. Lovecraft) are enough to overcome a basically dull plot, or should I say plots as there are four short stories rolled into one here and all of them are quite forgettable. Plenty of slimy beasts and a few scantily-clad lovelies amount to little more than an uninspired movie that would have been better left unmade.
