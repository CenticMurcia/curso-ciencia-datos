Remake of the dreadful 1970 Jack Lemmon-Sandy Dennis "comedy" about a couple from Ohio who go to NYC (for a job interview for the husband) and have everything go wrong. The original was sick, morbid and had the very annoying Dennis. This one is funny, not hilarious, but funny. It has a better cast (Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are comedians--Lemmon and Dennis weren't), and has John Cleese who is hilarious as a snotty hotel manager--his dead pan delivery of all his lines really worked. Not a masterpiece but not the disaster I heard it was--for instance the previous Hawn-Martin movie "Housesitter" was much worse. This moves quickly, has an excellent music score and the stars are both in top form. Worth seeing.
