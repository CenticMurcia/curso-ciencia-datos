Mysterious Skin captures the effects of sexual abuse in a very truthful way. Only a victim would know this truth. The bed wetting, The nose bleeds, UFO's and alien probing. Asexual adolescence, promiscuity, and self destructiveness. Yet, the most important truth is that our society raises us to fear sex. Instead, it teaches us about Santa Claus. We are raised on illusion and lies as well as fears. This is why these boys fall into isolated roads of growth. Middle and lower class values engulf the two young men keeping them in boxes of destructiveness. One boy forgets the experience whereas the other seems to enjoy the playfulness as he realizes sexual desire at the age of eight.<br /><br />The performances seem real and the film has a personal approach as if Director Araki wanted to show the world an experience of an unfamiliar territory. It is uneasy viewing at times but the film bounces back to compassion and empathy. Joseph Gordon Levitt possesses the screen presence to carry the film. We like him. Yet, like most street kids his youthful rebellion will turn into aged bitter pain and sadness only leading to one outcome...an empty soul that could never love or trust. The question is who is truly at fault. The Coach? The Mother? The American Dream? The film has no conclusion for these young men except: Welcome to Life and join the ranks of all us victims and strive for the pursuit of happiness like everyone else in America.<br /><br />A powerful and painful film. Yet, Mysterious Skin examines a subject we need to pay more attention too as kids are more exposed to sex at early ages with the invention of the internet. We are too distracted by our desires.
