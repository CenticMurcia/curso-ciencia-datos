This IS supposed to be funny, right? Bearing that in mind, where are the jokes? Where are the punchlines? This show has the Carlos Mencia disease: no comedic talent. Don't try to coax me with "It is what it is" and any other self-serving explanation because you want to find brilliance in something you like (which blinds the ability to objectively comment on how good something really is). I don't know the guys who make this show, so I can't say my objection to it is personal. It really is bad. There are many people who have been able to make foolishness, absentmindedness and idiocy very funny (Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd are the best place to start). John C. Reilly couldn't find something else of higher quality with which to occupy his time? While it's novel to use the "I just don't get it" argument, but I know what there is to get. This show doesn't have it. This show is not funny.
