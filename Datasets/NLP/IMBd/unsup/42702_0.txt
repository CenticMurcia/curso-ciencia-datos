Worst Children's' film I have seen to date.<br /><br />I was thoroughly disappointed at this film. Not because of the quality, not the length. But at the material that ended up being this movie.<br /><br />I rented this expecting this to be a beloved "Disney" classic. But instead all I saw was an orchestra and a few snippets of cartoons. I would have no problem with solid cartoons, with classical music accompanying the drawings. But to showcase an orchestra, for almost the entire length of the film, is a bit much.<br /><br />If you are looking for a classic "Disney" movie, with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, etc. Avoid this one.<br /><br />I give it two thumbs down.
