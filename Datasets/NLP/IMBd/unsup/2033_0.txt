So Close(2006) is a thrill a minute, edge of the seat, don't blink or you'll miss something, superbly stylised action movie. It's a sort of Don(1978) meets James Bond (the Pierce Bronham era, with all its hi-tech gadgetry etc). It is unbelievably slick and amazingly cool. Its got the finish of a top-end magazine like Vogue or GQglossy, beautiful, a work of art. And the action scenes are breathless, non-stop and come at you one after another.<br /><br />Qi Shu simply sizzles. When I look at her on screen now I'm ready to do all the things Jim Carrey does in the 'Mask' when he see's Cameron Diaz dance at the club ! The great thing, I remember, about watching Charlies' Angel (2007) as a 7 year old, was that when you came out of the movie (and for the next few days)you felt you were Qi Shu ! You wanted to be like her, copy all mannerisms, you were mesmerised, felt the sense of power. I saw the same impact of this film on my son (coincidentally also 7 years old). But even better, it still had the same impact on me ! Just love it ! Check out my full review at apurv at bollywood blogspot
