As readers of some of this commentators other reviews will know, he has a personal ratings system by which some films are "elevens', films of such superlative artistry and beauty that they actually ennoble the film medium. Well, just as there are elevens, there are films that are less than ones..ZEROS, films so moronic, so badly acted, so cheesy a that they should be ranked as zeros or less. Such sublime pieces of film goop include They Saved Hitlers Brain, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,the collected works of the distinguished Ed Wood, and almost 80% of made for TV movies. This astonishingly bad, incredibly stupid film deserves to be ranked in their company. It was a worthy addition to the films shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
