It says it is a thriller. I'm not sure I agree with it.<br /><br />It's like Big brother but every day the contestants are psychoanalyzed.<br /><br />It's insane. It has a lot of nudity but it's all in a good taste.<br /><br />The whole film has been shot with infra-red cameras except the game show host.<br /><br />The film was originally conceived in 1992. There was a book before that. I saw an interview with the director Nick Peterson/Virtual Alien where he said that the only reason he didn't sue the makers of Big Brother was that George Orwell should first have the copyright on the TV show.<br /><br />Full mark for the music score!
