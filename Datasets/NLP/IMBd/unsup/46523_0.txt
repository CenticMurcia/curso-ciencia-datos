You know, I don't even hate Pauly Shore nearly as much as many other people seem to, and it's still hard to remain objective during the course of this movie and actually judge it for what it's worth. Well, let me get to what I thought it was going to be.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I were cruising the rental place having just returned Team America and Party Monster. I saw it on the shelf and had looked at it before, but never had the guts to rent it. So we did. We returned home, threw it in, and I started it expecting some sort of funny, dark prank where Shore went around getting interviews from famous actors and comedians about their opinions of the 'late' Pauly Shore. That would have been funny. But I can't judge the movie on my own disappointment from that aspect. This is what you actually get.<br /><br />Pauly. Shore. Writing.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it, let it sink in. Absorb it. It's just about as painful as it sounds. There are some decent parts, I'll give him credit for what he wrote that actually did turn out funny, but it's funny for all the wrong reasons. Your reactions might sound like, "holy hell, he actually got Tom Siezmore/Micheal Madsen/Ben Stiller/Carrot Top to do this for him?" Those parts are funny enough, but the parts with the maddened redneck and Shore undercover get just plain embarrassing. Too much of the movie is written and the acting contrasts by being half-assed by everybody but Pauly and his mother Mitzi on the phone.<br /><br />The writing isn't the only bad part, though, the whole thing is done on digital film because (educated guess) it's cheaper. It just looks bad when it's not done right, and he didn't do it right. Most of the movie looks rather like a bunch of giddy little high school girls doing a project for the lit. class. Just bad choices, bad direction, really rough editing, so many things that chop away at the score.<br /><br />Pauly Shore claims to have worked on this for over four years. The man needs to get a life. Buuuuuuuuuuuddy.
