Unless you are easily distracted by Laura Antonelli, I wouldn't say that there is anything particularly noteworthy about this weak Italian comedy. There were a few funny moments, but more often than not, the jokes were misfires. It didn't take all that long for me to start watching the clock with regularity during this film, so I would have to say that it is fairly dull as well. Learn from my mistake, and don't waste your time watching this forgettable film.
