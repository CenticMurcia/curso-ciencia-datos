This may have been the worse movie I've seen. I watched this movie on HBO today thinking that it was going to be an action movie. However, after watching it I'm not sure if it was meant to be an action-comedy like Rush Hour(which I truly think they weren't going for). Everything from the beginning to the end seemed forced in my opinion, including the horrible attempts for a laugh. The whole "rock candy" angle was odd, and didn't make much since and could have been left out. Or when the main villain was trying to get his cable upgraded with a sports package while trying to hide from the cops was just unnecessary. Every movie needs comedy, but these are all childish attempts that just didn't go with the flow of the movie.<br /><br />The "Bad Guys" also are incredibly dumb, reminding me a lot of Marv and Harry from Home Alone. They ended up blowing up everything they left, killing people who they really didn't need to, kidnapping Cenas wife for really no reason, and just doing things real/intelligent criminals wouldn't.<br /><br />If you want to see what I and many others agree to being a horrible film, or are a child 10 years or younger, than I suggest you pick this one up. However, if your looking for a good action flick, you clearly need to skip this one.
