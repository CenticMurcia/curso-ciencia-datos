To enjoy "One From the Heart", it might help to have been brought up on musical re-runs. Coppola takes a cheesy genre, accentuates the fake and unreal and uses the most ordinary "real" actors he can find.<br /><br />This combination of pure fantasy and recognisable characters drives the story. This pretty boring almost middle-aged couple re offered a last shot of romance and glamour - and dive into it headlong. Tom Waits' incredible songs add a brilliant running commentary. <br /><br />And then there is the visual side, a smorgasbord of lush effects and glaring colors. Like so many movies, "One From the Heart" runs best on a movie screen, rather than a TV. The trailers I've seen don't do justice to this oddball combination of corn and touching emotion. <br /><br />So you'll just have to see it and make up your own mind.
