City by the Sea is so full of bad 70's cop tv show melodrama it was might distract the audience from De Niro's disappointing performance or the insanely cliche setups, for a few minutes anyway. With plot holes big enough to drive a formation of tanks through I really wonder if De Niro even read the script.
