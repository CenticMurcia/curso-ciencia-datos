What an achievement - Someone took the time and bother to make a TVM I enjoyed , this is probably down to someone coming up the shattering , radical idea of bringing an interesting involving story and making it into a feature length television movie <br /><br />!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!<br /><br />Aldrich " Rick " Ames decides he`s not getting a big enough slice of pie for working at the CIA for so many long years so decides he`s going to get his own back by selling secrets to the Soviets , and the best thing is that it`s based on fact . I did notice that one of the reviewers takes issue about the accuracy of this tale, I did see a documentary on the Ames case on the history channel and while it didn`t mention he flew to Geneva thinking it was Zurich ( Yeah this was probably invention ) it did state he did have a severe drink problem and turned up for work in brand new cars , something his colleagues at the CIA never ever noticed - You`ve got to worry why it`s called the Central Intelligence Agency ? There is a minor flaw with the screenplay and that is it looks like it`s going to turn into poor old Aldrich only became a traitor because he wanted to give his family the best out of life , but it doesn`t really turn into an excuse , so why do we have to learn about his sick mother in law and his wife wanting to go to university and getting final demands left right and centre ? . But like I said it`s only a minor flaw <br /><br />A good TVM and it`s interesting to note the director was John MacKenzie the same man who brought us the Brit gangster classic THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY and who also directed DEADLY VOYAGE one of the greatest made for television films ever . <br /><br />
