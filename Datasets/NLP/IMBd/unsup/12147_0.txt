Truly a terrible film. I pontificated about my belly button lint while Louis Malle didn't even make up for subjecting me to Wallace Shawn's whine-tastic introduction. What discourse: ''Tell me more'', ''So what happened after that?'', ''Inconceivable!'' are all examples of Shawn's gift of the gab. What an ugly, brown restaurant! What an arrogant old waiter. Sure, Andr√© Gregorie recounts his stories with enthusiasm, but getting to the end of this film took longer than waiting for ice cubes to melt at the antarctic pole. There is a reason why Wallace Shawn's voice was used for the dinosaur in Toy Story, and it's because, like Children during the Victorian age, he is better seen and not heard. Does it matter that Wallace Shawn is in fact not a Dinosaur? Well, to that sir I reply you're only thinking in the literal sense. Everyone involved in this film were obviously stuck in the Triassic period...in their minds...RAWRRRful!
