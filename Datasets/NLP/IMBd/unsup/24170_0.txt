I sat down and watched this the other weekend, and I have to say that it was indeed very enjoyable; and has been permanantly added to our DVD collection.<br /><br />The Water Horse is a very family-friendly movie that is part Sc-Fi, fantasy and adventure. The acting was extremely good, and the writing and plot is very imaginative and original...which is a nice change of pace compared to the many "copycat" movies that abound. The sets were very authentic and the outdoor settings quite spectacular.<br /><br />The SFX/CGI was quite good; on a scale of 1-10 I'd give the EFX a solid 8; not the best I have seen, but very much above average.<br /><br />All-in-all, The Water Hores is a movie that is definitely a suggested viewing for those looking for something a little different and fun.
