Nowhere is an exceptional, wild and trippy ride. Like Terry Gilliam, Araki delivers a fantasy type realm intertwined with our own reality. Yet, just like reality, the movie is chock full of drama, comedy, violence, tenderness, craziness and the unexplained.<br /><br />With great acting and on-the-mark dialogue, as well as wonderful sets, you should enjoy ninety minutes of Dark's life as well as his platoon of friends.<br /><br />The sad thing, however, is that the DVD has not been released in North America. Hopefully, this will change sooner than later. VHS copies are still available and the movie has appeared on IFC.
