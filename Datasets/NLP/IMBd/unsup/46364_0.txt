Wow. I was really surprised when I saw this film tonight. I'd heard so much about it being such a masterpiece and one of the best films of 70s, that I knew I had to see it. Afterwards, I just have to assume that the rest of the films of the 70s were rotten for this to one of the best! Most of the reason I disliked this movie was that it seemed like every second was being created by someone with ADD,...perhaps even ADD as well as crack! That's because there are no quiet moments--only scenes where practically everyone is talking at the same time and it seemed like they were trying to cram 3000 minutes of film into one movie. And because of this, after a while I just wanted it to stop. While some might be amused by this, it just seemed overwhelming and annoying.<br /><br />It's funny--I have never liked Country music, but I really felt sorry for the people of Nashville because the movie seemed to paint them so poorly--like some sort of freak show. It seems that according to the writers, director and actors, the people of Nashville, and perhaps America of the 70s, is made up of dumb hicks.
