I really do not know what this film is about. This is not porn, as there is not as much sex compared to the normal porn movie. The 'story' scenes are interspersed between the sex scenes, which makes it more like a porn movie. However, it is not a conventional film either, as it has almost no story. It appears to be a film about the life of skinheads, but it has so little substance, no character development and there is no emotion in it at all. The scenes seem fragmented and haphazard. There is no flow from one scene to the next.<br /><br />I would recommend not to watch this film, as you are unlikely to get anything out of it.<br /><br />By the way, I find a scene of man & woman sex a turn off in the middle of a gay movie. But that's just me.
