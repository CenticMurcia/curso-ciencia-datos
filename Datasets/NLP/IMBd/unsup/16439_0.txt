The ever-ravishing Lynda Carter of 'Wonder Woman' fame stars with Marjoe Gortner in this bouncy exploitation flick. She plays Bobbie Jo, a carhop with fantasies of being a country-western star. She hooks up with Lyle Wheeler (a very likable and charismatic Gortner), a footloose quick-draw expert who uses Billy the Kid as a role model. In no time, they're joined by Bobbie Jo's sweet friend Essie (Belinda Balaski, lovely and appealing as always) and sister Pearl (Merrie Lynn Ross) & Pearl's boyfriend Slick (Jesse Vint), and embark on a crime spree throughout New Mexico.<br /><br />"Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw" is an engaging movie of its type. It's spirited, breezy and sleazy stuff. Director Mark L. Lester knows his audience, and delivers the enjoyable staples of the genre. The bountiful T & A is a prime visual asset, the action scenes are swift, the pace never lets up much, and the flavorful score by Barry DeVorzon really hits the spot.<br /><br />The cast is quite entertaining right down the line. It also includes appearances by John Durren as Deputy Abel Gance, Peggy Stewart as Bobbie Jo and Pearl's alcoholic mother Hattie, Gerrit Graham as commune leader Magic Ray, James Gammon as a leather salesman, Gene Drew as redneck Sheriff Hicks, Virgil Frye as Joe Grant, who makes the mistake of challenging Lyle on his quick-draw abilities, and future director Chuck Russell (also second assistant director here) as an unnamed deputy. Co-star Ross would work again with director Lester on "Class of 1984".<br /><br />This little picture is a very pleasant diversion.<br /><br />7/10
