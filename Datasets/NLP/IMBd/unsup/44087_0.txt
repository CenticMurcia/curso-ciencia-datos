The Andromeda Clich√©s. Holy moly, just check them off: Govt conspiracy, heroic "journalist", evil military, arrogant humanity, do-gooder environmentalism, blah, blah, blah. This was such a piece of crap it's hard to believe Ridley Scott had anything to do with it. It's such a mishmash of half-assed developed stories, you'd think that it was written in 10 parts, with none of the writers knowing what the others wrote. They must have had some pretty compromising photos of Crichton doing a dead donkey to get him to agree to this abomination. Save your time and dime and just rent the original. It is a straight up presentation of what might actually occur in a "Wildfire" situation, not the sappy, crappy Lifetime special that A&E slapped together.
