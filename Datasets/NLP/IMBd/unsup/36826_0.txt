I have watched this movie and in the first 10 minutes Nina(the lead actress) utters "KALI F*****G Maa" about an Indian Goddess..hows that justified..no1 can address a goddess like that..and most of all not an ABCD like Nina..<br /><br />Have had no idea what Mr.Krutin Patel had in mind while adding that part to the screen play.. I strongly feel that a movie is made for entertainment and enlightenment of the audiences..what does this movie do?? How could the director allow this to happen?? and how could evry1 that watched the movie keep calm and silent..am not a religious activist but am not ready to take any1 swear at a Goddess in that manner..<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />venu
