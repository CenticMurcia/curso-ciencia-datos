This was the greatest science fiction film ever made. It had everything from half naked cave women (who look like strippers) to giant dinosaur puppets that our hero, the brain damaged surfer, must battle to save the planet (only to set off an atomic bomb accidentally at the end of the movie).<br /><br />Star Wars won an academy award for special effects and it only had 1 Darth Vader. Well, this movie has like 50. You know it was a conspiracy at the academy awards. This movie should have cleaned house.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie that is almost as bad as being a virgin. You have really missed something wonderful and unique that all human beings should experience.<br /><br />If everyone watched this movie there would be no famine or war, and the ozone layer would grow back.
