"Radio Days" is an absolute joy. I love remembrances, and Woody's look back at his WWII childhood glows with warmth. It is snuggly and cozy and it made me want to go back to the 1940s, which I never wanted to do before. It is an extremely sentimental movie, but the sentiment is balanced by Woody's light touch and by his humor, and so you can enjoy basking in the bittersweet without feeling like you've been played. All the vignettes are evenly balanced and nothing is given an overt emotional spin, and I think it's the distance that makes the movie work so well. If we had been closer to the characters, it would have risked sappiness. This way, they're closer to relatives that we knew only as very young children - and we can remember certain things in a certain light... I wonder what Woody feels about "Radio Days" because it looks to have been made by a man with a huge heart. And, of course, it is very, very funny throughout. And the old 30s and 40s soundtrack and the amber-tinted cinematography add to the feel.
