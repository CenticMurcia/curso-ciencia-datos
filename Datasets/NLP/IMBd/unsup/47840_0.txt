One of the worst movies ever seen. This one doesn't even deserve to be a B Side movie. A 110 minutes of torture. It supposed to be a comedy movie but you should have the weirdest kind of sense of humor to find this movie funny. It supposed to be a sequel to the original "Dunyayi Kurtaran Adam" but the only thing that reminds you the original one is that the characters keep honoring "Dunyayi Kurtaran Adam (The man who saved the world)" As a sense of irony the first one was way much funnier even it was not cut as a comedy movie. It was a hopeless effort to be a science fiction because of lack of finance, a very bad script, etc. But this guys have no excuse. They have their money to waste. The characters have no ability to act including Mehmet Ali Erbil (who has made movies for twenty years!). The script is simply aaaawful. My comment = Rubbish.
