Very beautiful and original pictures in this movie. You can also enjoy such simple things as the sound of the snow falling or a scissors cutting a wool cloth...<br /><br />In my opinion, the movie is not repetitious. I think the intention of the director is to introduce you in the monks' everyday life, and therefore you have to understand the routine and discipline they are attached to. It is just the silence that illuminates these people.<br /><br />And I didn't know there were such really sweet monks in the catholic church! <br /><br />At the cinema everybody were staying till the very end, although I have to say that someone was sleeping behind me ;-)
