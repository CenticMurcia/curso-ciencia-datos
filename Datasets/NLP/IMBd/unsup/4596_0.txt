Finally, a realistic TV movie that does not irresponsibly trivialize the serious issue of teen parenting. Jacey is 16 and the mother of a 5-month-old little boy, Charlie. Her bitterly divorced mother is raising Charley as if he was her own, in an attempt to give Jacey her "life back". But Jacey can't stand living a lie. The living situation causes constant tension in the household, and Jacey's younger sister Macey is suffering from being in the middle of all of it. In the meantime, they are all adjusting to living in a new community, and the girls are adjusting to attending a new high school, one where teenagers have sexual relations on school grounds during classes. The promiscuity and casual sex is so overexposed in the school, Jacey finds it hard to concentrate. But the main idea, to this story, in my opinion, is that mothers will do anything for their kids. The relationship between Jacey and her mother is rocky, but remains the centerpiece.<br /><br />Acting is first-rate, especially by Mercedes Rheul as the mom, and Danielle Panabaker, as Jacey. Also very emotional and positive.<br /><br />Never before as a TV movie ever actually brought tears to my eyes. This is an enjoyable movie with a deep message.
