I thought that the original Resident Evil was quite good, and have seen what the games have to offer. If the producers, directors etc. had put more of what's in the games into the film then Apocalypse would have been halfway decent. Instead, we get much of what we had in the first - but no where as good. The zombies play a minor part in the film, the Lickers appear for a very, very short time and we have the dogs: again. The film may have been okay if it had included some of the suspense, isolation and gore that the original had but the sequel lacks a lot of this. I would have rather watched a film that had yet another group of hapless victims entering the Hive and getting slaughtered...
