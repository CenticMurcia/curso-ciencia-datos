"The Mysterious Mr. Wong" is a mystery to me. Star Bela Lugosi made some questionable career choices following his success in "Dracula" (1931). This was certainly one of them. He accepted many parts from so-called poverty row studios probably because he needed the money. At this time he was about to embark on a trilogy of films with Boris Karloff (The Black Cat, The Raven , The Invisible Ray) that should have solidified his career. Unfortunately it did not.<br /><br />This mess of a movie casts Lugosi as a Chinese (Chinese?) lord, Fu Wong, who is seeking the 12 coins of Chinese Philosopher, Confuscious. The coins it seems were given by Confuscious on his death bed to 12 of his closest friends. They have been passed down to their descendants. The 12 coins when gathered together are supposed to confer untold power to their owner.<br /><br />The story opens promisingly with three murders by unseen assassins. Each of the victims has one of the fabled coins in his possession. It's all downhill from here. The murderers report back to their boss, Fu Wong (Lugosi, complete with drooping mustache and thick Hungarian accent). He now has 11 of the twelve coins in his possession. He sends his men out in search of the twelfth. Now how in heaven's name did these rare coins all wind up in the same city in the USA?<br /><br />The murders of the Chinese are assigned to fast talking reporter Jay Barton (Wallace Ford) who with bumbling Police Officer McGillicuddy (Robert Emmett O' Connor) investigate the deaths. In between Barton manages to romance the comely young Peg (Arline Judge). A note left by one of the victims leads Barton to Wong. He seeks the aid of good Chinese philosopher Philip Tsang (E. Alyn Warren) to translate the note. The note leads to the 12th coin and.............................<br /><br />Lugosi is laughable as the "Hungarian Chinese" villain. He may have seen Karloff have success with "The Mask of Fu Manchu" and wanted to emulate him, who knows? Wallace Ford was about to escape "B" movies with a memorable role in John Ford's "The Informer" (1935).<br /><br />A dreadful movie.<br /><br />Remember, Confuscious say:<br /><br />Actor with thick Hungarian accent Cast in part of Chinese villain Wind up in "wong" role
