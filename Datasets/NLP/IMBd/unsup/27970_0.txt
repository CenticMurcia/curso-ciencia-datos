This movie has all the intellectual intensity of an Afterschool Special. Poor acting, poor characterization, poor dialog, too much overbearing music, too long. I am sympathetic to the message, but please, treating your audience like idiots with melodramatic drivel is a poor way to get that message across. I did not care about the characters, there was way too much driving-in-the-car filler, I could not believe that such a beautiful, stable woman would love the Walsch character, I did not know or care about either of his children. The only good parts were the ones Grace was in, but we had to wait a long time before she appeared. I feel badly that Twyman uses fictionalizes this very real and blessed condition--by doing so he makes it much less believable. Don't think that kids will like it because it's about Indigo children. Don't waste their time or yours. We need more movies on topics like these, but if films like this become the standard, all of humanity is in trouble!
