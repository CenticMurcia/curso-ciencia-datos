I am a sucker for "indie" films, but recently I've noticed an influx of low-budget crap. As better camcorders get cheaper, everyone with a couple of grand in their pocket is suddenly calling himself a filmmaker. This spate of amateurish horse-pucky had left me disillusioned. Then along came Body/Antibody. A truly indie film, with the kind of quirky, un-Hollywood story that typified everything I had previously grown to love about self produced films. Granted, this is not for everyone. If you have a "World's Greatest Grandma" bumper sticker, you may want to skip this one. But if you, like me, can enjoy a roller coaster ride of a story that goes from goofy romance to creepy thriller with more twists than a pretzel, don't miss this one.<br /><br />I should also mention that the performances of the three main characters were absolutely believable and fun. Their skill added a plausibility to the story that was essential.<br /><br />If you are lucky enough to have this film screen in your town, go see it, you won't be disappointed. This is a truly unique story. An independent film worthy of that title.
