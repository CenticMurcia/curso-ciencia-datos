I was really surprised that only 29 comments were posted for this movie. I rate it at 10, because all of the people in it were at their prime and beautiful....even the men. Backing-up the big stars, you'll see all the familiar faces that made the western movies so watchable. Ward Bond, et al, must have made as much money in residuals (they made SO MANY FILMS) as the headliners.<br /><br />Erroll Flynn gets the job as sheriff (Wade Hatton) and does a good job in his role. The film's color shows-off his manliness, his acting was good. Olivia de Haviland ("Abbie Irving") is pretty-much window-dressing, having little opportunity to display her talents. She, too, was beautiful. Of course, this is one of those films where the leading-man gets his girl.<br /><br />This is one of the early western films to be shot in Technicolor's, and was one of several TCM showed recently in their tribute to films starring Flynn and de Haviland. I guess younger watchers haven't seen this film....I didn't even know it existed.<br /><br />It's importance is that after this film Ms. de Haviland began to let it be known she was very unhappy with the roles the studio was giving her. EVEREYONE was campaigning to appear in "Gone with the Wind" that same year - Ms. de Haviland knew where to go - right up to the boss' wife. She got the role she wanted, "Melanie", and finally got the opportunity to show what a great actress she was.<br /><br />Director Michael Curtiz put scriptor Robert Buckner's story in an easy- to-follow movie - these early films are a joy to watch, simply because they have just this quality. I recommend for everyone.
