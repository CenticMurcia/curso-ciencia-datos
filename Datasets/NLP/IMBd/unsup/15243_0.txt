OK... this show is as perfect as TV gets. As a 1979 HS grad, I can totally relate to both Lindsay and Sam. I was a music nerd back then, but was able to relate with all cliques (one of my best friends was a jock). This series caught my attention when it aired way back when, but upon recent reappraisal, lives up to the highest standard of scrutiny. All the characters are insanely believable yet entertaining. I literally had tears in my eyes at a disturbing number of junctures whilst re-watching this stuff. Not only do I firmly believe that Linda Cardellini was/is maybe the best actress of the current era, but the recurrent themes of fitting in with groups outside one's comfort zone really rang a bell with me. Kim Kelly? Holy crap! I knew her as Donna Hole! And Bill? I pretended at times not to know him, but he proved to be a lifelong friend. The writing and set design on this show are so far beyond the norm as to defy description. I'll always love you Lindsay Weir. Too bad ER sux...
