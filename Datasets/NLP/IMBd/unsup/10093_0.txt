If you're looking for graphic gore, this is not the movie for you. Loaded with wonderful imagery and insinuation that leaves the horror to your imagination. You won't see Leslie's or the private detective's mutilated body, but we all know what happened to them. Richard Lynch's portrayal as a vampire is superb, with a deliciously evil and seductive air. There are no special effects, yet the story is quite riveting.
