This sort of comedy is either something you expect to enjoy as light entertainment or else you are wasting your time analyzing. Although I don't like "dumb" humor I'm glad I stumbled into this one while channel surfing. The finale seems to be removed from the plot, but If you came this far you weren't worried about a spoiler. It is truly one of the greatest movie musical performances in history. Greg Kinnear fronts a mighty tight rendition of "Summertime" that stands above its eminent fore-bearers. I don't know how to engage your interest any further. My opinion of the movie would be lukewarm and shallow (the opinion, that is; OK the movie is no continental chasm.) It's too bad the target fan for this couldn't possibly be suited for this somewhat traditional and historical piece of music.
