TDG is a very, dark entertaining movie with exceptionally talented and beautiful stars. It is engaging and very funny at parts. Jonathan Schaech proves his diversity as an actor, while Rose McGowen sticks with her usual "bitch" character as she has done in many other movies. This movie is very big on symbolism (e.g. red, white, and blue, 666 (which is also the number of times at current this movie has been rated ;), etc.), which adds a twist of things to look for.
