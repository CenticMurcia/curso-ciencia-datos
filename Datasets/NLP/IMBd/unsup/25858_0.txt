I've seen this movie more than one time, which is something I seldom do. It was just good, full of memorable moments and speeches. Being made in the late 70's, commercial porpoises got out of the issue. No, it's not only about escaping from prison, it's not only about freedom, it's about the hole meaning of life, manliness, morality and true friendship. The story is really amazing: the battle for freedom of one man which most people would consider hopeless. If you ever feel aggrieved, or week to face your everyday problems, think of what this guy(Papillon) has been through. The main character may be very well considered a model to follow in life. For some reason, when I recommended this movie to my friends, the boys seemed to like it more. Anyway, it's good to watch when you're in mood for a movie.
