Some time ago, the cable network TRIO aired the pilot for LOOKWELL as part of its "Brilliant But Cancelled" series. I TiVoed it and have watched it many times since.<br /><br />Ty Lookwell is the role Adam West was born to play, which is good as it clearly was written for him. The writing plays to West's strengths as a comedian, particularly his surreal delivery of lines that no one else could say without cracking up.<br /><br />It might have been exhausting to keep this going week after week, but I sure would have liked to see them try.<br /><br />Someone should assemble a "great unsold pilots" DVD series; LOOKWELL could certainly headline the comedy edition.
