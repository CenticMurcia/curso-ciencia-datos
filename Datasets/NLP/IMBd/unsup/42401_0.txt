...but he never really gets here, does he? Seriously, how many films have you seen already that are all about preparing things for Satan to walk the earth? And in the end, what always happens? Some idiot ends up saving the day, and we're only offered a mere glimpse of good old Satan at best, before he's flushed down his infernal toilet again. Guess what this film shows us at the end? We don't even get to see the Devil himself. Instead, we get an image of a shiny Maria. For no reason, really. No, this is not a spoiler. I'm saving you from a major disappointment here. And what's more, the first hour of SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK... FOR MORE isn't even about resurrecting Satan. It simply has no story. And best of all: I actually liked it better that way!<br /><br />What on earth was all this? Like THE THING meets THE SHINING while falling flat on its ass? Either this is a really bad film, or a psychological masterpiece. Honestly, my brain just couldn't fathom the logic of this film. It also has very little to completely nothing to do with the original Stephen King short story (this film was released as a second sequel to SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK, so go figure...). It has ghostly belly-dancers, a mobile unit called "TomCam" (you're looking at a miniature tank with a camera mounted on top here) and has a character making fun of POLTERGEIST. It plays it all dead-serious and has absolutely no clue what it's trying to be, or where it's going. Zombies or ghosts? Demons or evil minions? Demonic possessions? Hauntings? Hallucinations? Too much sniffing gas? Cabin fever? Two immortal brothers? Sons of BeÃ«lzebub? A sacrificial mine-shaft on Antarctica? The coming of Satan? What the hell? Who knows and who cares? <br /><br />You'll have a hard time believing this film, I can tell you that much. In that sense, once you've seen it, you should be able to remember it. So why I forgot all about it, is beyond me. Perhaps it put me to sleep once.
