Finally, we have people trying to make a difference in the entertainment industry!!! This movie was GREAT! I enjoyed not having to worry about what would be showing from scene to scene. Awesome plot, and the actors were great!!! This is the kind of film that I wouldn't mind seeing time and time, again!!! Thank you, Jenkins Entertainment, for producing a film that the whole family can see and enjoy!!!
