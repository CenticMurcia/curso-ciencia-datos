Alright, this movie wasn't great, and I'm going as far to say that it's the weakest of the crow movies. I know i know, everyone calm down, I've got my reason. 1. The movie never adhered to any style/color. The first crow dealt with the color black. The film was very dark. City of angels had the yellow color to it. Salvation kept jumping around like it couldn't decide. 2. It almost seemed that the main character, alex, didn't have a personality of his own. Look, in the crow, brandon cared about his lost love and would go to any lengths to be back with her. In the second one vincent played the crow as insane, like he'd lost his mind. I didn't really get any feel towards the character of alex. 3. Some of the lines were just down right HORRIBLE. The original didn't have any super cheesy lines, the second one was more comic booky so it was alright, this one just let them go. Overall, the worst, i think the one (if they keep the title) with DMX will end up being better than this.
