Overextended, cheaply made and poorly written, with third-rate special effects and point-of-view shots that suggest a low-rent "Predator", this looks like a straight-to-video film product that was released theatrically almost by accident. A few mildly effective scenes (like a murder that occurs in a church) can't really save it from being a bore. (*1/2)
