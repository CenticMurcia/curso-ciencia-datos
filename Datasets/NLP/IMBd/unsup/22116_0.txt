For special effects and make up, this movie is incredible. However, the length of the film causes one to believe that there is a lack of overall substance. Its message is cluttered by a series of life moments that are reminiscent of Forrest Gump without the humor.<br /><br />As advertised the plot of the picture is both simple yet intriguing. The movie traces the life of the main character Benjamin Button born as an 80 year old and growing younger every year and his life's intersection with Miss Daisy first seen as a young lass who recalls the story in flashback form as a dying elderly invalid. The intersection of their lives when both are substantially the same age forms the tension in the movie.<br /><br />The ending is the strongest part of the film. One should try to stay awake for the first hour. I was underwhelmed by Brad Pitt's performance. Given his incredible acting ability as shown in the earlier Burn After Reading movie, Pitt relies on the special effects and make up to carry his role.<br /><br />The elderly Daisy character recollecting her past is reminiscent of the elderly female character in Titanic. The story telling devices used in this flick have been used before in more memorable movies.
