Let's face it, 100 Girls was a bad movie! And we all know that a follow up to a bad movie is usually an even worse one. That's what I had on my mind when I first slipped in the DVD of this movie.<br /><br />Now remember the most annoying things about 100 Girls? The non-stop voice over, the unappealing imagination sequences, the annoying childish background music. Those are the things which ruined 100 girls, and yes, they are once again in this movie, but luckily they are kept to a minimum.<br /><br />The premise to this movie may not be too original and appealing, but I assure you, it's pulled off well. I even laughed a few times (which is something I didn't do once during 100 Girls). The cast do a great job here, and are a real treat compared to the highly annoying characters of 100 Girls. Okay, so this movie has it's flaws. There's a certain revelation which is one of the dumbest ideas ever. But doesn't every movie have it's bad moments!?!<br /><br />For some reason they seem to have changed the title of "100 Women" to "Girl Fever" in the USA. God only know why! It's still called "100 Women" here in Australia, and I don't think I would have bothered to see this if I was unaware of it's connection to 100 Girls.<br /><br />I know I keep referring to 100 Girls, but the truth is, you really have to watch this movie in comparison to it. 100 Girls was a piece of garbage. 100 Women is basically the same movie, but done better this time around (although still not perfect). I didn't completely hate 100 Girls, there was something about it which I try to hold on to, but after seeing 100 Women, I've grown a little faith in Michael Davis.<br /><br />So if you want to see 100 Girls done better, go see this movie. I'm sure you'll enjoy it at least a little.
