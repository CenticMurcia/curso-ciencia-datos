I just saw this film again and I must say, it is amazingly brilliant. This is a film which you can watch again and again. Very clever, sterotypical obviously but its all in good humour. I was looking through the other reviews here and people need to understand that this is a comedy and it should be treated as such.<br /><br />Great acting and great music - works so well. Pure entertainment. 10/10
