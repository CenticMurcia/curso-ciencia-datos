I saw this movie in German club and I thought it was really entertaining. Sure, it wasn't the height of intellectual humor by any stretch of the imagination, but it was still pretty damn funny. I know doing a spoof of a fairy tale isn't the most original or deep idea for a movie, but I think the way they went about it (with the he-dwarf woman haters club in the forest, the usurping nurse who became queen just by putting on the crown, how Schneewittchen ended up with the jester at the end) was a lot better than it could've been. Of course, I was mostly just happy that I could understand the jokes. My favorite part was the whole "Schach" bit, I still giggle when I think about it sometimes. I also liked how they did the brunette/blond jokes, I thought that was actually kind of clever. The cinematography was pretty nice to look at, too, very spoof-y and bright. I loved the music, it was so bubbly and catchy! I wish I could find the soundtrack.
