This is another Masala flick and a third-rate product from Mani Ratnam. Doesn't help that it was a plagiarized film, about the only thing that Bollywood's really good at.<br /><br />Unfortunately, saw this right after enjoying Syriana on a widescreen Multiplex. Needless to say, Yuva looked trashy when pitted against an impressive Hollywood original. Lesson learned. In any case, the movie's musical score by Rahman (who else) gets on your nerves. Maybe thats part of the reason for the dislike. And why on earth is it set in Bengal when none of the characters except Prosenjit Banerjee looks or sounds like a Bengali? What were they thinking?? Maybe Om Puri's parts were filmed earlier and at least attempted a Bengali accent, while the others simply had no clue their characters are Bengali!!! Hilarious.<br /><br />Ratnam, couldn't you have come up with ANYTHING original??? Take a look around. Last time we checked, there are still a few directors honest to their trade who do not copy so brazenly. Seems like Ratnam too lost his way like Maheh Bhatt, etc. Obviously these guys have to pay the bills, put food on the table, like everyone else. Gotta dish out junk just to plain survive. As for the movie, predictable plot. Bad guy (aka ultra-violent freak) tries hard but in the end the good guy wins. What more can one say??<br /><br />Literally there are HUNDREDS of simple (and complex) stories that could become good plots, things happening to everyday folks in their everyday lives. If only the Bollywood bozos would open their eyes, ears, noses, other sensory organs and pay attention.....<br /><br />PS: Giving it a 2 out of pity for the film-maker's family. Ratnam, you need to make movies "Dil Se"....
