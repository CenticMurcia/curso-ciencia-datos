Sadly, this is a less than stellar effort from those involved. As Ernie Reyes Jr. is star and director of the film, putting him front and center, I can only say the film gives the impression that he's one confused individual. This being an older film, he's hopefully recovered from whatever ailed him. Characters and situations are all over the map, there is a very malicious anti-authority and anti-religion tone to the film, and the usually sharp technique Reyes has displayed in the past is missing here.<br /><br />As noted elsewhere, there is little in the way of morality to be found in any of the characters or the film itself. This in and of itself isn't always a problem. But usually we witness an arc of some sort, for example Blood Diamond's mercenary character, the aging gangster in Charlie Valentine, or the cold hit man in The Killer, all undergo a redemption of sorts. Even when there is no apparent arc, for example Lee Marvin in Point Blank, Mel Gibson in Payback, Benicio del Toro and Ryan Phillipe in Way of the Gun, or Warren Oates in Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia, the main characters are of interest and not one dimensional.<br /><br />Of course all of the above are exceptional films so you may not think it fair to compare them to Reyes' film, but I'm not since to do so would be ridiculous, I'm simply citing why the lack of morality fails to work in his film. Which may all be a moot point as sadly, the film pretty much fails on all counts.
