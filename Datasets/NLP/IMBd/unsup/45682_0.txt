Who the hell was Jill Wagner screwing behind the scenes? That's all I want to know. Because that is the ONLY conceivable reason than this series focused so entirely on her character instead of Blade who had absolutely no airtime by comparison.<br /><br />Every time they created a long term villain for Blade, they got rid of it within an episode or two with a combined time of around 10 minutes so they could have more time telling us how confused Krista's character was. When they made vampire ash a drug that gave users a short burst of vampiric powers, the dealer was caught and beaten within the first 5 minutes. How dramatic. They went from acknowledging the drug in the previous episode and with no backstory or character development, they simply demolished the creator and sole pusher of the drug before the opening credits finished rolling on the next episode.<br /><br />PA. THE. TIC.<br /><br />Let's face it, this series was about a morally confused and charismatic vampire with perky tits who was great at throwing the look of worry and confusion around a lot so that she could suck in the Buffy and Angel fans. There were a lot of rumors that said Sticky Fingers couldn't act. Well we can't honestly know, we never got a chance to see the character in action. The only other character that was remotely interesting was Agent Ray Collins who was slowly coming to grips with the reality of vampires when they decided to kill the character needlessly and ultimately granted him no more relevance than an extra.<br /><br />The producers of this series should be embarrassed. Better yet, they should have stakes driven through their hearts. If you can find them. I'm not yet willing to blame the directors of the writers because I can't imagine how or why any writer would intentionally ignore the title character so completely like that for 12 solid episodes.
