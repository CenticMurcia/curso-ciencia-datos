This is a spoiler comment. I enjoyed the first movies, so I assumed I would enjoy this movie. Wrong, Wrong, Wrong. Its a shame that they could destroy such a good movie. It had potential, but somewhere that was lost in the first 10 minutes. The actors in Prince & Me seem to fit and make magic. The only thing this movie did was clash. Having seen the first movie you would know that Paige or Eddie would find themselves being manipulated by someone that is so obvious. I am such a movie buff. I like most any movie made that is a comedy love story or a sappy love story. This is neither. Don't waste time watching, it is a big disappointment. Prince Eddie does show class in the movie, and I will say the only class.
