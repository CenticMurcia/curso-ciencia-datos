After seeing A Walk to Remember, I was confident that Mandy's new film will also be good, but it was rather disappointing. Within the 1.5-or-so-hour film, there were only a few 2-second laughs and nothing more.<br /><br />I also thought that Mandy will be singing in the film, but since she didn't, a prettier, more proportioned actress would have been more fit for the role. Same thing with her leading man.<br /><br />The only thing nice here is the Can We Still Be Friends revival in the soundtrack.<br /><br />4/10
