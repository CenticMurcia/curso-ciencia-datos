"Le Porno Killers" has definitely an awesome title,but fails to deliver both violence and an abundance of sleaze.This tedious bore features two female agents(one of them is Carmen Russo of "Patrick Still Lives" fame)who go after Vassilli Karis.First of all the title is completely misleading,because there are no porno scenes and no killers in this flick.At least beautiful Carmen Russo provides some full-frontal nudity.First we see her sunbathing nude then she gets up to walk across the yard buck-naked.Then she takes a shower with her female co-star and they engage in a truly fantastic lesbian scene.Finally we see her in a menage-a-trois totally nude on the bed then briefly getting up.Still the film is pretty light on sleaze and the action is deadly dull.Only for tolerant fans of Italian smut.4 out of 10.
