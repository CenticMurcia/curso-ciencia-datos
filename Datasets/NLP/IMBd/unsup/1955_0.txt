The action of "A Cold Night's Death" takes place at an isolated research laboratory in Antarctica and involves two scientists played by Eri Wallach and Robert Culp.They have come to replace the last scientist who worked at the outpost who apparently went mad and killed himself by leaving a window open and slowly freezing to death.The more time our inquisitive friends spend in the outpost,the more paranoid and suspicious they become,both of their surroundings and of each other.Something is definitely amiss and each night brings them closer to the truth behind what really happened to their predecessor."The Chill Factor" provides plenty of bleak snowbound atmosphere of dread and severe isolation.The acting by two leads is excellent and the final moment is utterly chilling.A perfect example of brilliant TV-horror that perfectly conveys the fear of unseen.8 out of 10.
