Seeing Izo at the Rotterdam Filmfestival was a memorable experience. Never have I seen so many people leave the movie beforehand. Every scene in which the main character encountered more people on his path to vengeance was good for at least 5 people to get up and leave. And I can imagine that this movie was not for all to enjoy but that was probably not the intention of the director anyway.<br /><br />In his path to maybe liberate himself by finding his nemesis you see the evil completely consume Izo. <br /><br />Great images. Together with the humor and the soundtrack by equally possessed folk singer/screamer Kazuki Tomokawa made it very worthwhile! <br /><br />Still haven't been able to find the soundtrack though...
