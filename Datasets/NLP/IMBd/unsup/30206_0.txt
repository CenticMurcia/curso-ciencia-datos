... This was a awful movie. 1st, the male lead character is reading this god-awful spoken word nonsense. 2nd.. The female lead is a part of a family singing group. They show flashbacks of the singing group in the 70's & 80's. The problem was, they were using a Korg Triton, a keyboard that was manufactured & released in the late 90's.<br /><br />In an episode when they were singing at a party, the mother of the group was singing... but the problem with that was, it was a male's voice used in the over-dub.<br /><br />And if that was not the worst... Why was Venus & Serena's daddy in the movie..? I rented it, because it was a freebie... but I should have known better, because anything that Maverick puts out is gonna be some garbage..!!!
