A pair of hooray henries and their cold wives, who take part in the London to Brighton veteran car rally, decide to race it back to London.<br /><br />Another commentator is right on the button when he says that we the audience do not care who wins because both antagonists are childish. That is exactly the way I felt. Many of these British comedies of the forties and fifties are remembered with fondness. By whom? This is just another example of an idyllic home-counties England run by an elite who can afford to indulge in puerile sports like racing veteran cars. We see it in other films, where things like traction engines are raced.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Larry Adler, you will enjoy the soundtrack, but if you have an IQ higher than your shoe size then I don't think you'll miss this film.
