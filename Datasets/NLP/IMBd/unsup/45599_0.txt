This isn't really a Three Stooges film -- it's a travelogue that happens to feature the Stooges. As such, there isn't really much comedy in it. Nice scenery, but not much of anything funny. Moe's narration doesn't really add much -- it over-explained the jokes at times. And the long stretch focusing on Moose the dog really dragged. The almost stereotypical '60s "light comedy" soundtrack was grating at times.<br /><br />But the sped-up parts were kind of funny at times. Many of the best lines were references to the Stooges now being retired. I've never cared much for Curly-Joe (not in comparison with the Howard brothers he replaced, anyway), but at least here he's no less funny than Moe and Larry get to be.<br /><br />The old black & white footage at the beginning was kind of interesting. I assume this all must come from the Curly-Joe-era theatrical films (most of which I haven't seen); but whatever its origin, they managed to make it look convincingly (and appropriately) really OLD. If one didn't know better, one might think Curly-Joe had been with the Stooges for their entire long career! Which, by the way, was NOT the "50 years" they keep saying. I guess they wanted to use a nice, big, round number. "40" would have served that purpose AND it would have been accurate.
