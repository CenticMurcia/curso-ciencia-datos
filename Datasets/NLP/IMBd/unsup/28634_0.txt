This movie was simply awful. Very poorly acted, generic plot-line, and I wonder what Oil company paid the director of this movie (much like the 'Sector 6' Cigarettes in 'Thank you for Smoking') to produce this crap and put a political 'pro-oil' spin on it. The comments about Iraq (like "we did find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq") were just downright insulting. I think this movie started off the same way as that scene I just mentioned in 'Thank you for Smoking.' Good to know that big corporations are still trying to mold our opinion with subtle physiological conditioning in our movies, television and magazines. The people who made this movie should be ashamed, I would never recommend this title to anyone. Don't waste your time unless you have a need to hear some pro-oil propaganda.
