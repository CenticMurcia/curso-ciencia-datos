Of course, in a made for TV movie, you aren't looking for the professionalism of the genre, but rather at the entertainment value. Well, this is one movie that delivers the entertainment by way of Andrea McArdle. She is a powerhouse and made such an impression on me with her voice as a young girl that I can still recall the lyrics to all of the Judy Garland songs she sang in this film.<br /><br />The relationship portrayed with her father is a touching one and you get a sense of how this little girl was transformed into the media powerhouse that was ultimately her undoing. A must see movie - if it can ever be found released.
