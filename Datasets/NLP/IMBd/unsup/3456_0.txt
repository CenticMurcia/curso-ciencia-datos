A bunch of rednecks take a trip to a lake with their daddy's Firebird & boat to have an outrageous weekend of partying, sex, & fun. Actually, there is no sex, but we do get to see them play quarters for about 15 minutes (maybe someone left the camera on). So to be fair, there is some partying as promised on the box cover.<br /><br />Anyway, some guy with one pant-leg tucked into his boot starts killing them with his yellow survival knife. I did get a laugh out of the knife though. When some of the kids make fun of him, why I don't know, he thrusts his knife in frustration into the boat dock and the compass on the top wiggles wildly. Ohhhh, scary. I also got a laugh out of the amazing camera technique the "filmmakers" used to let us know that the killer was on the prowl. Really, synthesizer noise over a red camera filter is scary no matter who you are.<br /><br />Anyway, he kills almost everyone. The heroine escapes with the help of a water spouting wall fixture. The killer dies. That's it. I have seen this movie 5 times and I still cannot come up with an answer to a question a friend of mine had. In fact, I have the same question myself. Why was this made? Who knows, maybe they will release a special edition DVD and we can find out in the, no doubt, enthralling audio commentary.<br /><br />Please do not rent this movie unless you really like bad horror movies. I, to this day, herald this as the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />4 out of 4 onions
