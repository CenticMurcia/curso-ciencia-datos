With all the great Christmas movies out there's no need to suffer through this one. This movie has cheap production values / special effects. The formula script show what a severe lack of good writers there are in this industry. Winter storm on que, deserted house, gimmie a break! The John Dye character was married , blessed with two children and yet gets a second chance at happiness. His brother-in-law Uncle Johnny is a bum. We know this because the writers have made him chubby and he wears glasses. WHAT STEREOTYPING. He's not worthy of having Kathy Ireland's character fall for him. The script would have been much better if Kristin and Uncle Johnny are the couple. Finally the happy ending managed by Kristin is ripped off from an old Xena episode. Go rent Miracle on 34th St.
