This was a pretty good film, but I did not find it as awesome as apparently most people did. Cary Grant was in fine form, and I was impressed with Rosalind Russell. I haven't seen much of her earlier work, and always thought of her as the Mother Superior in "The Trouble With Angels". She was quite beautiful here, and played her role with the feistiness it required. But the whole thing left me a bit cold, and not for the reasons mentioned by others (overrunning dialog, insensitive plot elements like suicide and execution, politically incorrect references to black folks). Interestingly, I felt the same way when I saw Billy Wilder's version with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matheau. With the cast and directors of both films among my favorites, I'm at a bit of a loss as to why I didn't care all that much for these films. I suppose that I simply wouldn't have cared for the original play, and all dissatisfaction stems from that
