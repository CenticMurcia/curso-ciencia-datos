good action here, the plot involves Snipes (Jack Toliver) as a disgraced ex-Delta Force soldier who has been living as a professional thief for the past couple of years.. living and working in Europe, his latest heist for $20 million in cash goes horribly wrong, as a teammate is killed.. there's a mole on his team, and Jack has to deal with the Romanian criminal underworld to find out just who betrayed him-- meanwhile, a beautiful, blonde, British NATO M.P. is on his case, who is trying to clear her name as an accomplice (she was briefly kidnapped by Toliver during his escape from the botched robbery).. the "macguffin" here is a rare, "lost" Van Gogh painting worth $65 million.. Jack has it stashed, and the villains are trying to find him so they can get it back.. The climax is a little buggy, but the production values are good, and the acting doesn't get hammy, except maybe for the lead villain, who apparently suffers from tremors..<br /><br />Other than there's no 'name' actors here besides Snipes, there's no reason this shouldn't have been released in the States..
