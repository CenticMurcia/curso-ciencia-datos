Although I practically live on IMDb, I've never written a review before. I have good taste but am not afraid to watch a good, tacky, prepubescent T&A flick. However, I feel I owe it to humanity to warn the rest of the world how awful this movie is.<br /><br />I went to the video store to rent the original movie which I caught the last half of on cable not too long ago and loved (which shows I'm not some high-brow snob). Unfortunately, they don't carry it, so I decided to try this POS instead.<br /><br />I'm not going to waste considerable time to write why this movie sucks so badly. Just take my word for it and do yourself a favor, forgo this movie, and rent the original 1984 "Bachelor Party".<br /><br />I think someone should refund my money and pay damages for the pain and suffering I endured watching this movie.
