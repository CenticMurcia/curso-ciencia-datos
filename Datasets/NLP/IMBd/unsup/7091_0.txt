I watched this series on TV as a teenager, and loved it. I saw it on sale, bought the first series, watched it, and loved it. I bought the rest, worked my way through it in a few days, and loved it. And I will watch it again.<br /><br />The the main character's insecurity keep me wanting to know if they will make it, the well-timed one-liners make me laugh, and the mistakes made by the characters make me feel for them. The script is as good as the acting (which, though a bit theatrical, is superb). What the actors don't actually say, we understand from their body language.<br /><br />As a teenager I fell in love with this story and with Mike, the shy little guy who tries to stand up for himself, and who maybe could be a match for dramatic Laura. Again I feel myself wishing to be in Laura's shoes - but then again maybe not...<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying this series, stop thinking and do it! If you are an actor: you probably have a lot to learn from Williams/Dench.
