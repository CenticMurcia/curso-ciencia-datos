Larry Holden's directorial debut shows that he is a true indie maverick. All one needs to do is watch this film to see how little he seems to care about the marketplace, or what Hollywood is jamming down our throats. I simply cannot wait to see what he offers us next. My Father's House is not easily gotten, but I was lucky enough to find a copy being sold by one of his ex- employees on Ebay. But, trust me, folks, if you are lucky enough to get your hands on one of this DVD's, and are willing to suspend the way you usually watch films, you will be rewarded more than you can imagine. Sure, I'm a bit older than most IMDb users, I imagine, but I think this film speaks to anybody who's heart is still beating, and has its own rhythm.
