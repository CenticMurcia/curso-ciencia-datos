Dreams can come true but they don't occur the way you thought they would. That sums this movie up for me. I recently saw this movie "The Road Home," in Vegas and I really enjoyed it. There was a couple of slow scenes but I still will tell my friends to go see it. If you love baseball you have to see this film. My girlfriend cried a couple of times, she got wrapped up in the love story.
