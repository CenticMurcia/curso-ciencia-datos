Perhaps the best film ever made, 'Sunset Blvd' follows the story of lonely and struggling writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) who is thrown into a web of romance and feuds with aging silent actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her creepy butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim) when he accidentally stumbles across Norma's mansion when he uses her garage for his car so it doesn't get taken. Norma will do anything for him, and she also truly believes she is still famous even though people barely remember her and she can make a comeback to Hollywood. But Joe knows all to better and wants to escape her odd, aging and treacherous ways. He meets Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) and begins writing a script with her-and perhaps even falling in love. This sets off Norma who will stop at nothing to be in the limelight, get Joe and make pictures again...even if it means murder. An intelligent look at Hollywood with amazing performances and one of the best scripts. The use of the black and white color makes a grim and eerie look of the film, which helps pull the viewer in. A fascinating thing about the film is that while the story is fictional it somewhat holds true to Gloria Swanson, even at one point viewing a film of hers that ruined her career! A truly haunting and memorable look at the desperate and true side of Hollywood. 10/10
