I've been to ibiza twice and i love movies, so a movie about ibiza sounds perfect. unfortunately, not in this case. this is definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen. they have taken a very beautiful place - ibiza - and made a very disgusting movie out of it. its really sad that a person who is nearly 50 years old, and a woman of nearly the same age impersonate 2, 15 year old horny "mates". for gods sake Kevin looked older than his parents. maybe a little research would have helped these pathetic actors. they're so sad, they even don't know how 15 year old losers behave.<br /><br />very bad movie, and totally unfunny.<br /><br />1 out of 10 (and thats because it was filmed in ibitha only).
