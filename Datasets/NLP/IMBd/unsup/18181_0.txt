I normally don't watch season premiers but then end up loving the show. This time i did watch the season premiere. It was OK a little boring but i thought it would get better. i gave it a shot but it just didn't work for me. This show just got more and more boring by the minute. they overdue the drama when they don't need to and there is no excitement or fun listening to a bunch of kids whining about their sex and love lives. The actors don't even look like their trying they look bored too. Very bad show. The WB has been taking good shows off the air and putting bad shows in. I really tried to like it but i just couldn't watch it. i watched 5 minutes of the season finale and was instantly bored. more drama that just wasn't necessary. don't waste 1 hour of your life watching a show that just isn't worth it.
