I loved this show. I thought this show was creative, unique, very funny, and most amazing of all-clean. Jim Varney was so funny my sides ached for days after watching him. In this age it seems practically every movie I've seen that has tried to produce humour has a scene that involves a toilet and/or shows someone being kicked in the groin( I wouldn't think anyone[especially males]would think that was funny). This movie is an example of filmmakers actually having to think to produce a good, funny, screen play. The plot was turning in many interesting directions making it impossible to figure out the ending (films can get old when producers make movies with the same old plots over and over again). I throughly enjoyed this film and I hope many more people will.
