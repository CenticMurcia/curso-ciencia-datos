I watched this because my wife wanted to see it and the synopsis on the back of the DVD case made it sound interesting. To be honest, if I hadn't read that synopsis I wouldn't have had a clue what the story was supposed to be about - even then I didn't think it was about self discovery as the synopsis claimed.<br /><br />I didn't find Tilda Swinton at all convincing as a man. Yes she looks vaguely androgynous but her voice gives her away as obviously female. There's also the small matter of her being almost the only male character in the Elizabethan scenes who isn't sporting a beard...<br /><br />I found the pace of the film to be dreadfully slow. There seemed to be endless long shots of people walking towards or away from the camera. I eventually reached the conclusion that these were to show off the wonderful cinematography (and some excellent Foley artist work) rather than to advance what there is in the way of plot. The first half of the film probably devotes more time to nothing much happening than it does to dialogue.<br /><br />Not a film that I'll be watching again.
