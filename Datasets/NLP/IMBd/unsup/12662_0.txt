The setting is bleak, white and, of course, isolated. A remote drilling station with company employees waiting things out. Then something starts happening.<br /><br />Another reviewer pegged it nicely as a mix of "The Shining" with a little bit of 'The Thing" and you have a flavor of what this movie is like.<br /><br />What's nice is that there isn't the usual pot boiler about some secret military base, or some evil corporate shenanigans. The characters are the normal sorts of people who actually would work in this kind of remote, exploratory/drilling outpost. And I especially like the music/camera work they did in one segment. . .visually lyrical.<br /><br />And the 'Whatever it is"? I still don't have the darnedest idea!! That's what makes this movie a nice horror treat. Yes, there's a global warming message in there-- but this isn't an environmentalist groupie movie trying to hit you over the head. Global warming is just one of the ingredients.<br /><br />But overall. . .spooky.
