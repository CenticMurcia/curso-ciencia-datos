I must admit I've always liked this one. There are many reasons, but the chief one is the cast, which is brilliant in all parts.<br /><br />Playing a hero, especially a na√Øve goody-two-shoes one, is probably the most difficult job in show business (just ask anyone who's played Batman) but he solves it very well, and sometimes annoyingly so (when he remains faithful to the beautiful, but dull, Rowena (also well-payed by Anthony, who does the best she can with Rowena).<br /><br />From a post modern, jaded opinion, the more interesting characters are the three villains; the egocentric Front de Beuf (Rhys Davies), the amoral Maurice the Bracy (Stuart Wilson) and the cunning Brian de Bois Guilbert (Sam Neill). Also, the wise Rebecca (Olivia Hussey), the bitter Isaac (James Mason) and the stubborn Cedric (Michael Hordern) are good, and even Wamba and Robin Hood. In fact, while the book/film is called "Ivanhoe", the interesting parts are the dynamics between Brian Guilbert and Rebecca, or between James Mason and John Rhys-Davies (classic!).<br /><br />Summing up: The film portrays Medieval England as both civilized and savage, and the castles and costumes are plausible rather than costly. The film has an epic battle scene, as well as really good jousting, intelligent conversation and interesting character development. It's definitely worth watching.
