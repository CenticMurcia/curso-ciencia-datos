Diana Ross gives in my opinion one of the top ten performances on screen in the last 50 years, possibly all time. It is that good. Fresh, daring, inventive, and highly influential her acting hasn't aged a bit. You BELIEVE she is Billie Holiday by the end of the film despite the heavy star persona that Diana Ross and Billie Holiday have respectively in real life. She doesn't go for a mimic, copycat performance but channels the essence of Holiday subtly. The acting is not over intellectualized or self conscious and never once hits a false note. The fact that the movie itself isn't very good and is wildly inaccurate in the portrayal of Holiday's life only seems to benefit Miss Ross. She lost the acadamy award to Minneli in Cabaret which was a charming performance but not even in the same league. Sadly, Miss Ross's promise as an actress did not pan out well due largely to poor role choices. Coming out of the Dark, her made for TV movie comeback owes a debt to this film. She basically rips herself off (yes, its true) as a manic schizophrenic channeling all the better breakdown scenes from Lady.
