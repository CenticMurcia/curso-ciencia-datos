Who knew that material so vile, obscene, and disgusting could be presented so beautifully? Visitor Q is a movie that goes too far, but carries itself wonderfully so that it is able to go the full distance without losing its audience. Visitor Q deals with a lot of risky subjects, including incest, necrophilia, rape, abuse on women, heroin addiction, and a slew of other things that would usually be used to describe fetish pornography.<br /><br />First things first, this movie should not be mentioned in the same vein as other movies that "go to far." This is not your blood and guts (and rape) horror slasher fest. Visitor Q is an emotional, powerful movie that rivals even the most well constructed Academy Award winners. Also, do not get the idea that this is another Eraserhead or Izo or other "strange" movies that it may get compared to. Though Visitor Q is presented in a strange manner, it works well with the odd subject material and Miike is subtle enough in his direction that the viewer will not be confused by the end of the movie.<br /><br />For Takashi Miike fans this is the epitome of all of his work (only rivaled by Audition). Miike's style really shines through and his ability to be shocking, yet appropriate, is very clear. Miike uses excellent imagery and deep characters that will make you go through many emotions. You will laugh, you will be disgusted, you may be offended, and by the end you may be so overwhelmed that you may cry. The last shot of the movie is so beautiful and so fitting. There are very few movies that wrap it up so perfectly in the last frame and Visitor Q happens to be one of them.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful. Everyone plays their part to near perfection. Shungiku Uchida, who plays the mother, is especially great. Her turn towards the end of the movie is felt. Kazushi Watanabe, who plays the visitor, is also great in his mostly quiet role. His silent presence worked very appropriate in enhancing every other character.<br /><br />Visitor Q is not a confusing movie in any manner. Just a very strange one. It is different. Visitor Q introduces you to a dysfunctional family and you find yourself getting put right into the middle of it. The characters embark on huge emotional journeys that eventually lead up to what is one of the happiest endings in any movie that does not get sappy. Visitor Q has everything you need in a great movie.
