Films like these are in vogue - a well thought out plot involving an interesting cast of characters that are connected in some way. Some similar films include Pulp Fiction, The Ice Storm, Happiness and of course, the newly crowned American Beauty. <br /><br />While the style of each one is different, what keeps the viewer in check is the story. In 5 Senses, J. Podeswa manages to weave the representation of each function with a character and how this applies to their work, their friends and so on. There is no basic premise here and like most Art-house productions, there does not appear to be a clear indication of where the film is heading. There is the sub plot of a missing girl, which somehow seems to bind the main cast together. But the film is not really in need of anything like that and in no way does it fall short of maintaining viewer amusement.<br /><br />Well acted, well scripted and well shot. Obviously, Podeswa is a talent to watch.
