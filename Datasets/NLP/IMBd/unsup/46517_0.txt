I too was smiling like the Cheshire cat when I first read the title of this film, wishing it was a doco. I actually want to see the title, "The guy who funds Pauly Shore's movies is DEAD", cos really there are others to blame for this. The fact that the Hilton sisters got a run in this goes to show the quality, and as for disgracing the late Sam Kinisson, Bill Hicks will be waiting for you in hell. I'm sorry, but anyone who tries to tell me anything this guy has ever done is anything near funny really needs to take a good hard look at themselves. I still think one of the best scenes in South Park was when Mrs Crabtree screamed at Pauly Shore and made him pee his pants. "Sit down and shut up!!!"
