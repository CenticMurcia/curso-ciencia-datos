I went in to this film hoping to entertain my children, a few of their friends who came along, and myself for 90 minutes on a weekend afternoon, and what I got was quality old-fashioned family entertainment and a reintroduction to Paul Hogan's fine comic talent. To most kids my children's ages, Hogan is better known as a spokesman for Subaru station wagons than as an actor. However, he is a wonderful comic actor, fully deserving of vehicles such as this. The yokel- among-the-sophisticates plot is timeless, ranging from Buster Keaton's "Elmer" character through the Bowery Boys, Ma and Pa Kettle, Jerry Lewis, Jim Varney, etc. Hogan is working in that classic tradition, and his skills as a physical comedian, his superb comic timing, and his loveable persona will make this film a favorite on cable TV and as a video rental for decades to come. There were no dazzling special effects, nothing shocking, no social or political agenda--just well-performed, funny family comedy. The only flaw, if it can be called that, in the film was that Paul Rodriguez's character was not given enough screen time. I could imagine those two making a great screen pair. Maybe in the next film, Mick Dundee could call on his old friend from the movie business, the character played by Rodriguez, to help him out of some jam. With that large Aussie sidekick who accompanied Dundee in the second half of the film (the name escapes me)playing off both Hogan and Rodriguez, you'd have a great combination! Think about it, Paul Hogan and Lance Hool! I'll pay to bring my family to Crocodile Dundee 4 when it comes out. We had an 8 year old with us viewing the film, and she loved it, so I'd guess that the film should be acceptable to children 6 or over, and there's nothing really offensive in it if you have to take children younger than that. With this and SPY KIDS coming out in the same month, it's been a good season for family films.
