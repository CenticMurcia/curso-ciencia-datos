If, as promised, this movie was restored then the results are simply horrible.<br /><br />A company called National Film Museum gave this film to another company called Hypercube IIc, in New York to digitally restore the film.<br /><br />But, instead of a intelligent restoration what this people did was to tint every scene to red, probably with Photoshop, with disastrous results.<br /><br />Douglas M. Protsik music is as unremarkable as the bad restoration. His accompaniment does not enhance the images at all.<br /><br />In all, the available print shown on TCM is unwatchable and I had to turn off the TV set.
