If you want to see several long scenes of Our Young Hero whining about why he doesn't want to save the world, this is the film for you. Add in every bad low-budget fantasy film clich√© that has ever made you groan and you can pretty much predict the contents of this film.<br /><br />What's really a shame is that the main actors are so very good. What a waste of talent. The special effects were fine but they kept repeating them , so they lost some impact by the last part of the movie.<br /><br />---Possible Spoiler---<br /><br />Don't miss the exciting scene where Our Hero uses his World Saving Powers to make an erect knife dance between two round salt and pepper shakers in the creepiest sexual innuendo ever to grace a children's film. When his unappreciative honey goes off with Our Hero's brother, Our Hero uses his powers to throw the same knife at them as they leave the house. Talk about unsavory symbolism! I think the director may, just possibly, have some unhealthy issues about women.
