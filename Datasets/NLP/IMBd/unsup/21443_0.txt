As we examine the aspects of the lethal videotape in this very good sequel, it is admittedly not as frightening as the first movie.<br /><br />Hideo Nakata resumes his taut direction, and a few shocks abound. Nice to see Nanako Matsushima return as Reiko even if the main star of this story is Miki Nakatani's character Mai Takano, who had a brief appearance in the first film.<br /><br />Ring 2 does retain many of the atmospheric and subdued sounds of the first film, but, unlike Ring, you can watch this sequel without the lights on. However, the conclusion to the film is extremely ominous.<br /><br />Ring 2 is not a horror movie in the true sense of the word, and is certainly not as shocking as its theatrical trailer suggests, but it continues the story admirably, and all the actors involved put in cherished performances. I personally enjoyed it.
