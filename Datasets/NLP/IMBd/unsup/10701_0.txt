If you have read my other reviews of Chaplin's comedy shorts, you may have noticed that I have generally given very poor reviews of films made during his first couple years in Hollywood (1914-1915). In general, they had no script or direction, were never really edited and just weren't particularly funny. In addition, Chaplin had a lot to learn about and develop regarding his Little Tramp character.<br /><br />In light of this, it was so nice to see this film. Unlike most other films of 1914, this film had a strong plot with a definite beginning, middle and end--something often lacking in his other films. Plus, it had some genuine laughs. So, for newcomers to the films of Chaplin, it's an excellent introduction.<br /><br />Charlie and Chester Conklin (a perennial Keystone actor) work in a combination restaurant and bakery. The bakers go out on strike and the two fellas are forced to do duty in the bakery. There is still a lot of punching and kicking and throwing of dough, but the plot becomes a lot more serious when the disgruntled bakers sneak some dynamite into the ovens! A decent film that is head and shoulders above other Chaplin films of the time, though awfully crude when compared to his films just a few years later.
