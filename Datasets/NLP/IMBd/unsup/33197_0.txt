Oh yes, this movie. I noticed this movie on a $2.99 rack in a video store and it looked mind-blowing. The artwork was fantastic and although it reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw I still bought it. I got a refund. This movie was horrible, horrible, horrible. Basically it's about a group of teens driving on a dark highway, their car breaks down, they try to cipher gas from an old farmhouse and they are being killed, one by one, by a killer who lives in that house. This movie was a disaster but the title, it sounded good, almost like a kids book title.<br /><br />The acting was so stale and wooden it was funny. The teens would usually overact or they would not act enough when the time called for it. The movie was a horrible rendition of your classic young-girl-stalked-by-unknown-killer tale. This movie looks like a bad high school movie project. I wish that I had more to say about this title but I forgot a lot about it and I would rather not remember it. So in conclusion this is a movie that should be sent to wheat thrasher.
