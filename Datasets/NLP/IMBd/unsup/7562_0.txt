A passionate tale of heartbreak and love triangles (literally). This movie lifted me to half mast, and kept me there for hours on and off. To say that this movie changed my life is a gross understatement to the testament of its magnitude on the movie experience. Move over Casablanca, this is the new American classic. i could go on and on about this movie. I have seen it multiple times and it has given me multiple orgasms. It is a travesty to try and confine this masterpiece in the parameters of human language. I feel like this movie has filled the void in my heart that was left aching from my disappointment of "Gladiator Maximus Glutius). I love Rob L.
