When a movie opens with an execution style murder the last thing you might expect is that this is going to be a bloodless tease-fest. Sisters of Death is just that. <br /><br />Contrary to some of the reviews here, Liz Clybourn is not killed from a Russian roulette initiation ceremony. That would involve a single bullet loaded into a single chamber of a revolver. Liz is shot when a live round is loaded into a single-shot derringer instead of, one assumes, a blank. The purpose of this ceremony remains a mystery but somehow the sisters are not charged with murder. <br /><br />Fast forward seven years and the remaining five members, Judy, Sylvia, Diana, Francie, and Penny, are invited to a reunion by a mysterious individual somewhere in the southwest. The women meet and are escorted by two men, Paul and Joe, who are hired to transport the ladies to the mystery location. Once they arrive at a private estate the ladies begin to unwind a little and enjoy the pool complete with new bathing suits for each of them. Paul and Joe sneak back into the estate because, well, they're men and that's exactly what I'd do, and soon the seven of them party into the next day. <br /><br />Not is all as it seems as the mystery guest abruptly introduces himself amongst most assuredly many hangovers as Liz's father, Edmond Clybourn. Suffice to say he has not gotten over his daughter's murder and intends to expose her death as not a mistake but rather the evil machinations of one of the sisters. They become trapped inside the estate as it is surround by an activated electric fence. Panic ensues and intelligence drops as the guests are knocked off one by one. <br /><br />How do you cast a playboy playmate, the beautiful Claudia Jennings, and not show off some skin? All of the women are attractive and are constantly clad in either a bikini or negligee. I have to admit that nudity would really have helped me enjoy this movie more since the first forty minutes is boring as hell. Once the women realize that they are each being hunted down by a crazed father bent on revenge they immediately lose any and all common sense like sleeping in separate rooms. Stupid! The deaths are as bland as you would expect of a PG rating. I do give credit to the ending. I liked it and it made perfect sense to me. Too mild for me. I wouldn't be surprised if they showed this on the Disney channel.
