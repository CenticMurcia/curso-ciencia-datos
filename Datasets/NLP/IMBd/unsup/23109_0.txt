Firstly when you see a ghost common sense dictates you get the hell out of the house, why would you stay in the house seriously, this movies suffers terribly from clich√©, it becomes so much of a problem that it actually becomes quite funny.<br /><br />The acting is extremely under par, the story done 100 times before with much better results, and the effects were lacking which also describes the story.<br /><br />The director seems to have taken the scripts from every other done to death horror in this particular type (old house, child, etc, etc) and then kind of mashed it all together hoping for the best and coming up with the worst. To be honest some type of registry with the names of these terrible directors should be posted on the net so that myself and others will no longer have to be tortured by their vile trash that they try to pass off as movies.<br /><br />well to end this, stay away from this movie and thank me later.
