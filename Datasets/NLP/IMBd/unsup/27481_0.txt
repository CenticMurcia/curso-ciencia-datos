The peanuts gang are up to their usual mischief in preparation for Easter Sunday, but no one seems to be listening to Linus. He swears that the Easter Beagle will come and make the celebrations complete. Typically no one listens to him, he is little bit 'Ralph Wiggum' remember.<br /><br />Though Snoopy ends up being that very Beagle, he's far too busy trying to help out Woodstock. The poor little bird is freezing in his cruddy little nest full of cold water. So Snoopy goes off to the mall (already advertising Xmas goodies!) to buy him a bird house. With hilarious results.<br /><br />After much hijinks and endless trips to the mall for eggs (Marcie keeps smashing them as she doesn't know how to do egg-painting) Snoopy saves the day and proves Linus right after all. Sigh! They don't make 'em like this anymore. I'll take Snoopy over Spongebob any day.
