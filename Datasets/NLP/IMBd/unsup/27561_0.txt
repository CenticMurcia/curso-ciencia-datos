i thought the show was downright boring. i found the series premier lacked the outrages costumes and had way too many slow times that contained no substance. the set was way to earthy on mongo, in the movie you felt you were in a alien world, this ming seems much to soft and did not earn the term "the merciless". dale arderns relationship with her fianc√© was almost non-existent and her desire to chase flash around showed a lack of moral character. also in the movie flash was a football hero, in the series he is a aging track athlete sponging off of his mom instead of being a man and earning his own living. i feel this show is much less a visual treat than the movie and the stars are plain than i was expecting.. i hoped for a lot more than this show delivered.
