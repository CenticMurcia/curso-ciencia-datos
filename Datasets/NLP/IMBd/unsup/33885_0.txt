This movie is an absolute must see for all true film fans. A wonderfully entertaining one and a half hour cliche fest. From the ludicrously over the top car chases, to the hackneyed dialogue, wholly predictable plot "twists" and diabolical attempts at comedy there's always something to laugh at (though never with). This film deserves to be a mainstay of drinking games, just go to one of the movie cliche websites, print off a list of the cop movie cliches and drink whenever one appears. If that's not enough to get you completely hammered you could always try downing your drink whenever Brad Davis's character seems to completely forget the fact that his father's just been murdered. Cold Steel is brilliant if enjoyed as a spoof or as a chance to get drunk. As a film, however...<br /><br />0/5
