What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice? was a very good thriller! I mean if you like thrillers. Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon were excellent actresses in this film. Story about a woman who kills people who cross her....like her maids for instance. She started off liking her second housekeeper Mrs Dimmick, even thought she would make a good companion as well as a good housekeeper, but soon found out that Mrs Dimmick was crossing her by trying to find out information about the former maid. You see, the former maid, Mrs Tinsel, used to work for Mrs Dimmick and she was upset with her and left and moved and started working for Mrs Marable. Mrs Dimmick worried and wanted Mrs Tinsel to come back went to find her. Mrs Tinsel had written her a letter so she went there to Mrs Marable"s house and saw that her former housekeeper was no where to be found. Mrs Dimmick asked Mrs Marable about Mrs Tinsel and said "where is she"??? Made Mrs Marable hot!!! Until she did away with poor Mrs Dimmick. Smart as Mrs Marable was, she was caught! A real honest-to- goodness thriller!! An 9 indeed!
