The number one reason i went to see this show was because of the actresses :-) And they.. ahem i mean it didn't disappoint. So Close is in essence Charlie's Angels meets The Matrix in my opinion. The fight scenes are incredible (luv the swordfight) and though lacking in dialogue, there is humour, love, beauty, betrayal and a whole lot of other things to make it a well-rounded movie. I'll end it off here so i won't reveal anymore info, but once again So Close is definitely worth a Saturday afternoon.
