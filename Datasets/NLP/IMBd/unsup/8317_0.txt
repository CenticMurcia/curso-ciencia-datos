I personally loved the movie. You may not figure it all out, in fact I'm<br /><br />sure that you won't figure it all out. It's one of those movies... but it's<br /><br />a GOOD ONE! Besides, Seth Green, Ted Raimi, and Jeffery Combs all rock!<br /><br />As for scariness, I don't rate it very high, although there are plenty<br /><br />of good scenes that are pretty freaky. Of course, not many films scare me much. I highly suggest seeing this movie, if it seems at all like the sort of<br /><br />film you're into.
