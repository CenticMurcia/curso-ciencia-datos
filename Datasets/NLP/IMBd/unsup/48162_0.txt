First,I have to say,this film is not a horror movie.In Turkish movie industry I can say just 'GEN' is a horror movie.'Araf' has a very very bad script,bad acting,bad imaging and especially bad directing.What were they shooting for? The crowd that recklessly spends their money because they don't care? I can only imagine how the creators of this film pitched this and still got some idiot to pick it up. And,I cannot find anything about horror in this film.Not suspenseful,not scary,not creativity,not comic,not dramatic.So what is this movie! The famous movie critics of Turkey have chosen this film the worst Turkish film of the all time.Because its really so so bad and this movie will be the shame of the Turkish cinema history.Finally I will tell you, don't waste your time with 'Araf'
