I am in this film (IMDB, can I have a credit?) You see me run up to the harbour wall and my line, "She's getting away!" is dubbed in a bad Hispanic accent and becomes, "The Condor, she is leaving!" (See, now, I could have done that - bad Hispanic accent and all!) <br /><br />Henry Cele reprises the role of Shaka, Zulu. James Ryan does standard B-movie tough guy, military-type acting but without precision. Cameron Mitchell seems to be bored. Maxine John is gorgeous, but that's about it. <br /><br />There is no sense of story placement or detail about Grenada - but, as it appears to have been filmed exclusively in Cape Town, South Africa, I guess that's not surprising. Basic, low-budget tat. <br /><br />This is, without question, the worst film I have ever seen. It probably beats "Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes". <br /><br />I absolutely loved it.
