I am still reeling from the dizzying marvel of the grand storytelling of this movie. No movie can be like a book. So I discount all who compare it to a book.<br /><br />I cared so much for these people, their stories are topical yet universal. The anguishes, the struggles, the personal demons, stay with me...as reminders of the pain of all mankind.<br /><br />"We are living in the age of deformity" said one of the characters... and so mankind still continues, forming, deforming, renewing itself. When will it end? These are the questions which this film asks of us all. But is the world deformed or - is it we who are deformed? While this movie will not answer such an unanswerable question out loud. We know the truth. But we seldomly face it...Some of us learn our lessons, some do not. But our pasts always come back to haunt us...<br /><br />I know I've not said anything about the acting, nor the unmatched technical gifts of this movie...but they are what crown this magnificent achievement from the first delicate frame until it's bleak uncompromising ending...<br /><br />The cinematography, editing, and music must be praised to the rooftops!<br /><br />***** I recommend this movie to those who are not afraid to see the truth and see it told marvelously.<br /><br />...
