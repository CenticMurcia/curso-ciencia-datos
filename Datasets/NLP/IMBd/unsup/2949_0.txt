Any good review of this film was done by someone that had a stake in the movie. This waste of time is supposed to be an amusing spoof on low budget zombie movies. The rationale given by the makers of this crap fest was "that's why the make-up is so bad, it's funny!" NO IT'S NOT! It's just plain dumb! The DVD cover said "better than Shaun of the dead." NO IT'S NOT! Not even close! Shaun was a spoof and a well done one. Hide and Creep actually justifies censorship and book burning (in this case,script burning if it had a script). I actually got my money back from Hollywood video for this waste of 4 bucks. I would've enjoyed flushing the money down the toilet more than spending it on Hide and Creep...an utterly talentless, stupid and unfunny imposition on my time.
