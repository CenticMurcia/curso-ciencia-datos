Despite a great cast and a terrific book as source material, this movie is simply dreadful. The writing is flat, the characters muted, the direction stilted. Worse, like Mississippi Burning, the role of the Civil Rights Movement in Mississippi is virtually ignored. Some day, someone will make a great movie about the murders of J. E. Chaney, Mickey, Schwerner and Andy Goodman. This isn't it.
