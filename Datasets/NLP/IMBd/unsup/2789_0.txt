It's funny to see the difference between the viewers from foreign countries and Germany. I guess, the problem is, the jokes used in that film are really old and pretty used for us Germans, because Otto Waalkes used them since the beginning of his career. That's why I think this is a completely superfluous film. The only good joke is Helge Schneider as "Gandalf".<br /><br />I'm very sad about this film, because there are a lot of great comedians, but they all played only there Stand-Up-Roles... <br /><br />absolutely disappointing...<br /><br />The only reason I give one star is: I can't give none...
