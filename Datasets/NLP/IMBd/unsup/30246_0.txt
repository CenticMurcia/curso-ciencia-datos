If you ask me, it's the older games that are more fun. In 1990, Ron Gilbert released the first and best of the Monkey Island series, "The Secret of Monkey Island" Being a fan of Ron Gilbert/Lucasfilm Games (Maniac Mansion for example) I found this game extremely fun. Unlike most adventure games of today...you actually understand and find interest in the characters. You are Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who came to melee island anting to become a pirate. When the evil pirate Lechuck kidnaps the governor, Elaine Marley, you must get a crew and ship and sail to Monkey Island to rescue her. Now, form the sound of it this may not seem like a good game. Well believe me, it is. And one of the most important parts of the game is the humor. Just play it yourself. And see if you and Guybrush can discover "The Secret of Monkey Island."
