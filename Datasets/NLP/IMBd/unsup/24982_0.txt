I can't even count how many people I have gotten hooked on this movie because I made them watch it with me once. There are a few movies I have purchased over the years that I can watch over and over and over again, and this is one of them. I have probably seen it 25 times, and even know the whole movie script by heart. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, and if you have already, watch it again. Mike Meyers is one of the funniest guys that ever lived.
