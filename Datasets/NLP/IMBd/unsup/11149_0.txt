How can a preacher make a movie that doesn't offer the Grace of God?? How can he show all that misery, that happens all the time in this town, but not show Who the Answer is? During the sequences of "revival", at no time is the scripture referenced. T.D.Jakes is only about self-help. He has made himself a bishop. He comes off as just another fraud in this movie. Now they want more lines. Michael Boatman was GREAT, as usual. He is one of the finest African-American actors we have today! Loretta Devine is also one of my favorites. I see everything she is in. She did a good job with a horrible role/script in this, hopefully last, attempt at movies by the so-called "bishop" Is this enough lines?
