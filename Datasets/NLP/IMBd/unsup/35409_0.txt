I believe this to be the worse movie I've seen in a long time! I can't speak for others out there who enjoy low budget movies but I do NOT. If you don't crack up when someone says something totally pointless or if you just don't like worthless humor then you'd do best in staying away from this movie. In this movie you'll see situations when they "want" you to laugh. But you simply won't. You'll only end up getting annoyed. I Rate this move 1 of 10. Awful is the word!<br /><br />Don't waste your time, money or anything at all on this piece of "film". It is not worth it. You'll only get disappointed and angry that you wasted those 2hours on this.<br /><br />Why would you want to waste anything on this movie when there are so many other, MUCH better, movies out there?
