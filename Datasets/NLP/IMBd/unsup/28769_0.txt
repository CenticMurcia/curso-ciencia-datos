It really brings me back to when I was growing up. The music, the acting it was all a lot of fun! Scott Baio was and still is a great actor. Appearing in Happy Days, Zapped and many more show, not to mention Charles in charge. I remember growing up, it was a part of my day. I guess I look apon those days with a fondness a more easy time. More about fun and less about serious issues. Everything today is Blood Gore and Violence, I liked the simpler films, the feel good movies once in a while. Zapped is exactly one of those films. Felice Schachter was another of those wholesome actresses that you loved to watch. Cute, Smart and funny. That real "girl next door" vibe. Willie Aames great to watch also, kinda like your buddy who knew how to get things done. I may not be a writer, but I know what I like. This is a very UNDERRATED film and deserves A lot more credit! Zapped RULES!
