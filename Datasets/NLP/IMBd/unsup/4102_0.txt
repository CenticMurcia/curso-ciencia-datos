This episode is the best I've seen of this show!It's so creepy...I love it! When I watched it I was terrified and shaking all over! I was like "Feel his pulse, feel his pulse! Can't you see he's alive?!" And when they brought him to the morgue I was like "Oh my God, they're gonna bury him alive!" It was almost out of my worst nightmare! I was so relieved when he started crying and the people noticed! My brother thought the episode was utterly boring! How could it be boring! My hart still starts thumping when I think about the episode. Hichcock was so good! I haven't seen any of his movies yet except half of Rear Window in school, but I'll watch The Birds this weekend. I'm sure it's great!
