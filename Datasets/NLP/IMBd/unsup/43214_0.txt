I wouldn't say this is the worst movie ever, but I would say it sucks pretty bad. Please don't watch this movie without the help of MST3K. <br /><br />So here's what I guess you'd call the "plot" There are some poachers in a very foggy forest. One of them stumbles upon a cave which came from outer space and crashed nearby. He begins smashing eggs that he found inside the cave. What an idiot. So then an unseen monster comes and kills him. A little kid comes by later and picks up the last un-smashed egg for his animal collection. While all of this is happening the worst pop group I have ever heard is going camping in the woods with their groupie, Laura. The band doesn't like Laura very much, even though she's pretty much the only fan the band will ever have. She ends up dying by falling of a cliff (or maybe the monster pushes her off of the cliff, i don't know.) Anyway, the group ends up going to the house of the little kid. The egg the little kid stole hatches, and here enters Trumpy. Trumpy is a good pod person where as the other monster is a bad pod person. And Trumpy, well he can do magical things. By magical I mean crap. So more people end up dying, and who really cares? In the end Trumpy is abandoned in the woods by the little kid, after the kid pretty much worked his a@@ off to save Trumpy the entire movie. This movie dies short and suckily, just as you would have suspected.<br /><br />I give 2 out of 10 stars for the movie alone and 10 out of 10 stars for the MST3K version. GO MST3K!!!
