I generally try to avoid the cheap new releases at the local discount store, because there's so many bad "horror movies" puked out these days that it's pathetic. But I picked this one up & looked at it several times & finally decided to give it a shot, and hey, I thought it was a keeper.<br /><br />We have a small New Mexico town. We have a bunch of slime-balls running a strip club (with other services available on the side) just outside of town, apparently on a reservation. We have a "new girl in town", Diana, who thinks she got hired to work at some classy place as a dancer (I guess) but who is very wrong with her perceptions of how things should be.<br /><br />And, we have someone, who is a big game hunting enthusiast, who also helps keep the local population of strippers & prostitutes down by taking them out to the wilds in his airplane, stripping them, and giving them a head start while he tracks them down & kills them. Only this time, with the "new girl in town", he was a little unprepared for her to be uncooperative with the scenario.<br /><br />We also have a local sheriff's deputy, one who got a bit mouthy at a previous job that he no longer has, who is champing at the bit to put two and two together and figure out why there are so many missing girls in this town, but the sheriff (Joe Mantegna) doesn't exactly appreciate his efforts. However, Diana's roommate, a hooker & a junkie with a heart of gold (or at least, a minimal sense of decency), seems to think that something bad has happened to Diana & is making quite the fuss about it.<br /><br />Diana, however, when she's not running naked through the wilderness (which is, actually quite often), is fairly adept at fighting back against Mr. Sadistic Big Game Hunter, who seems to be related to Jason, Freddy, & Michael Myers, since he takes a rock in the face, falls off a cliff, and gets run over by a car, only to keep on ticking...well, for a bit, anyway. And Diana comes across some campers who try to help her but the poor suckers are just in the way...etc.<br /><br />Anyway, this does have elements of "The Most Dangerous Game" and "Naked Prey", but it's got a few twists and turns to it to keep it interesting, plus the locales are great for most of the scenes. Overall, I'm pleased to say that for once I don't feel I got ripped off by getting this & having to throw it straight into the trade-in pile. 7 out of 10.
