I picked this up at a car-boot sale on VHS for a Â£1 purely because I remember seeing it advertised in the back of "Famous monsters of film land" in the 1960,s and wondered what it would be like, Well! it,s a lot better than I thought it was going to be.It stands up pretty good when compared to other 50,s shockers like "Tarantula" ."it came from beneath the sea" etc and has some genuine spooky moments .If you like 50,s monster / sci fi films .I recommend you give this one a chance although to my knowledge Universal have not released it on DVD,you may have to check out e bay for a copy or setttle for a VHS version.Well a lost classic in my opinion ,well worth hunting down!
