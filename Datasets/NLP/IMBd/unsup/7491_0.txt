(1)Couldn't watch it for very long. I tried because the cinematography was so wonderful but one doesn't want to walk out of the theater whistling the camera work.<br /><br />(2)Not quite bad enough dialogue to make it unintentionally funny and watchable. (3)Not bad enough acting too: ditto the above. Actually Maria de Medeiros was quite good; the combination of her appearing to be naive while having an erotic mind was very well done. But Uma! Oh poor thing! Was that a Brooklyn accent she was failing to make real? Fred Ward too, wise-guying his way through which made his shallowness the character. A celebrity impersonator.....wonder if he can do Jimmy Cagney or Robert De Niro? 4)Quite often an author is not well served in a movie and in this case the very honest reporter of nitty-gritty life, Henry Miller, was desecrated. Would anyone who had never read him be motivated by this movie to do so? I think not.
