There is not a single redeeming feature for this misguided effort. I don't even want to give it the credit of calling it a movie.<br /><br />The story centres around a plot that would have been turned down by the makers of Knight Rider, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />The acting is appalling, although perhaps some of them could be forgiven as English is apparently not a language they understand. It looks as if they have just learned their lines phonetically without actually understanding how bad the dialogue they are partaking in is.<br /><br />The special effects are definitely not special and only barely qualify as effects.<br /><br />My only saving grace is that it wasn't me who chose this at the video store. Apparently the girl who chose it was impressed by the cover. I haven't yet seen the cover, but looking at it for 90 minutes would be infinitely preferable to having to sit through this loathsome tosh.<br /><br />I only hope that the people rating it 10 out of 10 here are either being ironic or are multiple votes from Judge Reinhold trying desperately to keep this off its deserved place at the bottom of the IMDB charts.<br /><br />Please, for the sake of your own sanity, do not ever give into the temptation to watch this movie. It makes Porky's 3 look like a masterpiece. Yes, it is that bad.
