I see a number of people felt the same way I did about this movie. The $4.88 I paid for this DVD was overpriced by about $4.78. I must have seen worse movies than this - films that were offensive or overly violent. However, for plain embarrassing ineptitude, this one takes the cake. It makes "Attack of the killer tomatoes" look like Ibsen in comparison. I'm reaching for new superlatives of bad, but I fall short. If you have a chance to see this movie, take a walk instead.
