<br /><br />Maybe I'm just a softy but I thought this was a wonderful (and believable!) family film. The expressions on the children's faces when they first see Slappy was priceless -- and the final scene was nothing but laughs. I'm a literature college professor so I've read and seen my share of "stinkers". This one smells good!
