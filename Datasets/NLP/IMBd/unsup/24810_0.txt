I can't get over how great this film is. Of course, it is a bit graphic and over the edge, but at least it can do that while still holding the emotional appeal that makes it so great in the first place. The entire setting of the film gives this kind of atmospheric vibe that immediately pulls you in from the get-go. I feel there is no other actor out there right now that can perform such a flawless role as actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It caught me off surprise...who knew some kid that was in the TV series 3rd Rock From the Sun could show such potential. I would highly recommend this movie to any true fan of great cinematic film. It's one of those "rough around the edges" kind of movie, but once you look past that you really begin to see how well thought out it really is. And the whole alien abduction part of the storyline, what a great twist! More than anything this movie has got me really excited for what these great actors have in store for us in the future...
