It's easy to see how I Know Who Killed Me has garnered so many unfavourable reviews, since it doesn't follow the standard rules of your typical Hollywood horror, and stars Lindsay Lohan, whose popularity has been steadily waning since her much reported 'drunken episodes'. But to label the film as crap is doing it an injustice: had it been made in Italy, it probably would've gone down a storm with fans of Euro-horror.<br /><br />With its preposterous plot laden with totally bonkers moments, a crazy killer who is revealed only in the film's closing moments, and over-stylised direction with a strong use of colour, I Know Who Killed Me shares a lot in common with Italian horror, and, in particular, the 'giallo' genre of movies: horror/thrillers that are often weak on story, but loaded with great visuals.<br /><br />Considering I was expecting this Lindsay Lohan vehicle to be a tame, teen-friendly Hollywood horror, I was actually rather pleasantly surprised by its absurdity (but then I love Argento films, which rarely make sense).<br /><br />In addition to the constantly surprising narrative, viewers are also treated to some surprisingly nasty bits of gore, but, unfortunately, no nekkidness from the star (although there are still a couple of moments in which she does turn up the heat: as a stripper performing a pole dance, and during a sex scene).<br /><br />Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, a pretty teen who becomes the latest victim of a serial killer who has been abducting girls and cutting off their limbs before leaving them to die. Eventually, the girl is discovered, mutilated, but still alive, and is taken to hospital. But when she is interviewed by the FBI, she claims that her name is Dakota, and she has no recollection of her attacker...<br /><br />Things go a little crazy from this moment onwards, and those who prefer their horror to be completely believable need not bother to watch any furtherÂ—any film that features a stigmatic twin who falls apart for no apparent reason isn't going to impress your 'average' cinema-goer. I, however, was in the mood for some silliness and found the film pretty entertaining, despite being a tad overlong.<br /><br />By no means a modern horror classic, but not the complete waste of time that some claim it to be, I Know Who Killed Me is something a little different in a genre currently packed with predictable gore-fests, awful sequels and dodgy remakes. 6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.
