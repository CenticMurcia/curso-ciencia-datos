Oh dear, this is one of the most worst TV shows I've ever seen. Actors are suppose to scare innocent victims while being filmed by hidden cameras. But the whole show is obviously fake. All the so- called "victims" are lame actors without any feeling at all. Can't you tell by the look of them? It obvious that they're all acting, and they're not even good at it. It's so pathetic.<br /><br />The only good thing about this show is the host Shannen Doherty, known for her role as Brenda Walsh in "Beverly Hills 90210". I do love her. I just wish she would have skipped this kind of crap because she is worth so much better.<br /><br />Beware of this show! It's trash! Trust me, I'm a horror fan.
