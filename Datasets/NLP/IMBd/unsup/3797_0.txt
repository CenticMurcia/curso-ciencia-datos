It's too bad that it didn't run longer. I've not seen the original UK cracker, so I probably will have less qualms than those that have. I love this show. I own the DVD collection and while some episodes aren't great or even good most of them are excellent. Episodes like IF, Faustian Fitz and others are extremely well done. Each episode sort of has twist and some of them are expected and some aren't. I say great acting, great writing(in most cases) and overall a great show buy this on DVD if you can find it it's cheap and definitely worth every cent. This show is definitely a precursor to shows like Medium, the Closer, House and many other specialized mystery shows. I am willing to bet however the UK version is way better, but I have not yet seen it. Buy it.
