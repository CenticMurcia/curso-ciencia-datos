This episode might be the worst episode of the series. As others pointed out it was like a bad soap opera. I won't lie I never was a fan of the Starbuck character and hated that they wasted an entire episode on a plot that was going nowhere. I rather watch an episode about a ship full of cylons, at least they are interesting unlike the forced Apollo/Starbuck romantic tension*yawn*.<br /><br />Not to be picky either I hate how the show has Starbuck boxing with males at an equal level. Chances are guys who work out a lot(such as military men) will over power a very strong female, but Starbuck seems to be a Mary Sue in that regard that she is easily defeats Hotdog. How come the other girls on the Battlestar had to fight other girls, but Starbuck gets lifted to this unbelievable level.
