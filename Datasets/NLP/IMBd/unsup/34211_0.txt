Don't even bother with this movie. I can only hope that I'm as lucky as another commenter on here, and get a free rental out of how ridiculously awful this movie was. Just goes to show you: don't judge a book by its cover. The DVD cover made it out to be something relatively enjoyable, and it was the biggest crock of crap I've ever seen. The official website for the movie even mentions the misleading cover... Thanks, guys. How this made it into rental stores, let alone the "horror" section, I'll never know. It's not even bad enough to laugh at. The writer should take some advice from the lead character in his own story, and go out to a bar instead of trying to write film scripts.
