I was in this movie (I was Marisa Berenson's stand-in) and Arthur Miller was on the set almost every day. As was his wife - taking pictures. Talk about a living legend. I regret, to this day, that I did not get his autograph (although I did get Vanessa Redgrave's and a few other's). Just being in the presence of this man was an incredible experience. What a privilege it was for a "small town girl" to experience this. It lives through me to this day - my daughter (born long after my experience on this film) is very interested in the Holocaust because of my experience on this film. My best wishes go out to his family. I don't think - in our lifetime - we will EVER experience a talent such as his. He will be missed!
