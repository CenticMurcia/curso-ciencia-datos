The first of the many serials based on the Zorro character released by Republic during the 30s and 40s.<br /><br />In this one John Carroll (before going on to bigger and better things) plays the hero and his mild-mannered alter ego James Vega. Noah Beery Sr. is wasted as the Marsden, the head bad guy trying to take over the California/Yukatan Railroad. He basically never leaves his office and only appears to radio instructions to his henchman led by Richard Alexander and Robert Kortman.<br /><br />As usual in Republic serials, the stunt work in this one is great. Yakima Canutt visibly doubles the hero and performs some dangerous horse to train transfers among others.<br /><br />All in all it isn't bad. The only problem I had with it was the inclusion of a couple of songs for Zorro to warble as he galloped across the range. A tip of the hat to the singing cowboys of the day, I suppose.
