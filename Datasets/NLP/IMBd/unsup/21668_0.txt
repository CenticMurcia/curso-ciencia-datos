Despite having a thin plot, silly dubbing, disturbing brutality, and unnecessary humour, this film stands as an excellent showcase of Yuen Biao's talents. The plot deals with a lawyer becoming a vigilante while running afoul of Cynthia Rothrock. The action scenes are incredible. Yuen Biao and Cynthia Rothrock are placed in some set pieces that are among HK's finest. My favourite was Yuen Biao facing off against Melvin Wong. It's the kind of fight that makes one wonder why he wasn't as popular as Jackie Chan.
