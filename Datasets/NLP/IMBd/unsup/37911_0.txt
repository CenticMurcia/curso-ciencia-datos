Just when you think Affleck can't get any worse, he, and his movie choices do just that...reliably so.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that someone with an academy award for screen writing (undeserved, boogie nights deserved it)can't select even a halfway decent script when it arrives for him. Or maybe people simply aren't sending him any good scripts because they have realized he cannot act.<br /><br />Regardless, I cannot in good conscience give a full review of this film, since it was so horrid that i turned it off 40 minutes in to watch Meerkat Manor...because it has better acting and a better story.<br /><br />chalk up another disaster for Affleck, a man who has dropped more bombs than the air force.<br /><br />I really do not know what else to say...avoid it if you can...the theaters sure did.
