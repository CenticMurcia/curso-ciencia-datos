Wes Stern plays nerdy college student Colin Slade who loses his scholarship. He blames college president Larry Hagman, and Stern sets out to ruin Hagman's life by seducing his daughter, his wife and his girlfriend..all in that order.<br /><br />Hagman is running for a Senate seat on a platform of decency and righteous living. He doesn't tell the voters that he has a mistress or has a wife who is a bit on the strange side. Mrs. Camber is played by Joan Collins who always finds these odd movies to play the seductress of younger men.<br /><br />Hagman is wonderfully campy in this movie, and his attitude and mannerisms remind you of his Dallas days. "Do as I say and not as I do" mentality. The scenes of a nude film of his on-screen daughter being substituted for "The Sound of Music" was hilarious, If you want a campy movie to watch on a cold Friday night, this is the one. However, don't expect to exercise your brain with trying to figure out any plot twists. There aren't any!
