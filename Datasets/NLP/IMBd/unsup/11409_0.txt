Dirty Harry film that is a n improvement on th enforcer. The company bucked up there ideas probably as the previous film dragged on due to slow plotting and style of filming which was popular in the 70's to try to suggest to mean something. This time the story and pacing are tighter and sharper. A new device is presenting him with a family which shows his character with a more humane side and also gives greater responsibility which makes him more vulnerable to the killer he is pursuing. This vulnerability is a contrast to his usual invincibility as a loner who has nothing to lose if he is killed. With a family to care for his every action must be taken with this responsibility in mind and a killer is able to manipulate this vulnerability. This same vulnerability makes Eastwood's character stronger as he is must take into account this personal duty as well as his police duty.
