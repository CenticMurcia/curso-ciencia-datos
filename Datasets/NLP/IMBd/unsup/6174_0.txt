This show followed the exploits of the Thundercats, a race of human cat people whose planet was destroyed so they were forced to relocate to another planet. Their future leader, Liono is but a child when they leave their planet, but thanks to a pod malfunction he ages to an adult while the others in the group essentially stay the same age. He is given the sword of omens and a cat claw and they start a new life on a planet filled with many perils including mutant men, pirates, and the evil creature Mummra. The cartoon was a pretty action packed, the dialog at times was corny and as the show progressed it got weaker, but that is really a lot of cartoon shows at the time. I have to admit, of all the cartoons there were this was probably the easiest one to collect all the toys for as they really did not add to many characters to the show as it went along. You basically had Liono, Panthro, Cheetara, the tiger dude (can't remember his name), Snarf and the two kid ones. The villains consisted of about three mutants, Mummra and a group of pirates that really did not have all that many episodes. There were another set of super berserker warriors and two or three more Thundercats introduced in later episodes, but I do not ever recall seeing them as toys. So all in all a good show, with the one story arc of Liono having to past these tests facing the other Thundercats as one of the highlight multiple part stories.
