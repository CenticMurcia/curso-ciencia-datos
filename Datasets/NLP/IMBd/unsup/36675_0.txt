Always a joy too watch Lance Henriksen.<br /><br />Crash down, his daughter, now must the director and father(Henriksen) find his little girl.<br /><br />This is "based" on true events. The movie wants to be scarey, but is not.<br /><br />I can not remember when i watched a movie about the "abe" and got touched, or even scared. Probably never.<br /><br />This movie has its moments but it is quickly forgotten.<br /><br />
