If you really feel the need to go to this movie, please leave anyone you know of the male gender at home. This movie is.... terrifying. My friend and I went to this with two other girls, and 1/2 way through the movie, he left, and it was just me and them. This movie was not funny at all. If you have seen the preview, you have seen the movie. They do not do any more 'funny' things to each other than what you see in the preview. The rest is full of bad, bad jokes, and very terrible plot twists, if you can even call it that. Please, do not make any other men see this movie, for the sake of his sanity. I hope you can understand, and I'm pretty sure the 4 1/2 star rating helps you understand my cause here.
