Aap Ki Khatir is a blatant copy of many Hollywood Movies like Wedding Date, French Kiss and Bridget Jones. The only problem is half the time Bollywood Movies manage to entertain the audience even if it has copied a Hollywood Movie. Aap Ki Khatir is a Dull, Boring and practically a pathetic movie. There are only 2 good things about this film. One is obviously the music which is not great, but decent. The Second are the 2 actresses Amisha Patel who usually makes crap movies, but her sexy image keeps you still watching her. Priyanka Chopra looks quite pretty, but her acting seems to get weaker, perhaps she needs to focus on what movies to choose. Akshay Khanna is alright i guess. Dino is unusual, unrealistic and is suppose to be smart/rich, Yeah right. Sunil shetty tries to be funny but bores. The family members are suppose to be modern and all actors try to be funny. The family drama and members is described in one word awful.
