This movie was by far the stupidest comedy I've ever seen in my life. First of all, most of the movies being imitated were NOT horror films, but teen movies like American Pie and Grease. Second, the the entire movie overall seemed to be going nowhere. There really isn't much of a plot--it's as if they thought certain things would be funny to make fun of, but there was really no way to make a story out of them, so they filmed a bunch of random scenes and stuck them together to make a movie. As if that weren't bad enough, it looks like the creators were just trying too hard to make a successful spoof--they overexaggerate certain aspects of high school (they have to show at least 10 doors in the high school labeled "Debate Club," "German Club," etc.) and they tend to make fun of things like teen pregnancy and teen sex, which really has NOTHING to do with making fun of horror films. To say the least, I probably laughed once or twice through the entire 90 minutes, and that was only because I was shocked that a movie could possibly suck so bad.
