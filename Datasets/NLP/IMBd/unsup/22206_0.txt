If this game had been released a little earlier in the United States it most likely would have faired better, but by the year 2000 the 3D graphics were quite dated.<br /><br />That said, this game was one of my most memorable gaming experiences, right up there with the first time I played Zork, Myst, and Half Life.<br /><br />The puzzles are mostly logic based, and while some require inventory items that can be a little non-logical to come by, it didn't takeaway from the experience, but rather enhanced it for the most part.
