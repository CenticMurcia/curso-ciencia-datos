A young couple of 18 years old, Amy and Jordan, in a night club that seems to say "Welcome to Hell". Meet another young man called "X" (Xavier).Drive away of the three people, 'cause X is attacked by imbecilic junkies. Stop at a QuickieMart. Alas, no dough to pay the chow they took. Not happy, the cashier. Riot gun. Intervention of X. BLAM! Cashier's head fly away in the onions(A little like in the video game "Mortal Kombat").<br /><br />New drive away of the trio after X stole some money to the Quickiemart's register. Next stop: a drive restaurant. Misunderstanding with the clerk. Another riot gun. Drive away.Motel. During the night, the clerk shows up, still armed. New intervention of X. BLAM! The clerk's arm is shot off. They rush out again. On the road again... All along the film, they run away and they have sex. Alas, I think their flight will never finish.<br /><br />But why the number 666 always comes back (Motel 666, 6$66)? Are the three young people damned? Why each person they meet asserts that they know Amy, the girl, by a different name (Sunshine, Bambi...)? Why do everybody is always after the three people's poor fate? Why this message, in the clothing shop: "Prepare for apocalypse"? Why are the dialogs so cool? (Heh, heh!) And why so much violence towards the male sex? (See the bar scene, and the hangar scene at the end of the film).<br /><br />I think the French producers of this film would answer:<br /><br />"Why Not?" Anyway, some violence scenes were really too gratuitous. The sex scenes too, but the last scene is very disturbing; It's best to take it at face value. The three actors have really well played thier role, especially Rose McGowan, (see her good performance in "Scream"), the fianc√©e of Marilyn Manson. She's one of the prettiest actress I know.The sceneries were really cool (see the hotel room).I think Gregg Araki is a little like the American Jean-Luc Godard of the 90's.<br /><br />8/10 for this hard road movie.
