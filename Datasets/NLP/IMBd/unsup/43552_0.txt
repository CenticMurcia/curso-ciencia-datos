For someone who has watched a fair amount of foreign films, I am sad to say that I truly am dissatisfied with this picture. I do agree that "La Nina Santa" had many close-up shots; actually, the movie seemed to consist only of close-up and medium close-up shots which seemed to have ruined the film for me. This made it harder for to figure out exactly what was going on, and what the surroundings were. I don't even think I really knew that the convention was being held at a hotel until a conversation was held toward the middle of the movie between Helena and Freddy. I was under the impression it was at an all girl's school especially considering the fact that we witnessed many of the girl's religion classes without really knowing how they ended up there all of sudden. I believe this has a lot to do with the direction of photography because the director obviously wants us to concentrate more on the characters and their interactions involving those around them.<br /><br />After reading many other reviews this film received, I couldn't help but be excited to watch it. However, my excitement slowly started to diminish. I just wish the director could have brought more beauty to the story. When filming did occur outside it was either quite brief or the camera was considerably close to the character and caused the viewer unable to soak up Argentina's splendor. I could also take this in another direction and say that the director wanted me to focus more on the characters, but I wasn't able to form any kind of relationship to them which is why this film wasn't one of my favorites.
