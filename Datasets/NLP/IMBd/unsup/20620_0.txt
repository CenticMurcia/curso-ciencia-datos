Saw this at the Midwest Independent Film Festival. Really enjoyed the ambiguity of the symbolism. Very clever - the symbols work for Christian viewers as well as devotees of modern psychology, myth structure, what-have-you. The question lingers, of course, at the end: was it a dream? Was there even ever a man and a dog? Was this truly a wayfarer or was this the inner struggle made flesh? The case for the wandering man being Christ is strong if you tend toward those lines of thinking (obviously that's my first leaning): he died for the main character's sins. Then in that case what is the dog, but the burden of caretaking, the concept of blind selflessness and charity towards others ("he doesn't have a name"), that Christianity extols? I cannot speak for other worldviews' interpretation of the movie but I am sure there are similar explanations for Freudian, Jungian, etc., paradigms.<br /><br />Conversations with the filmmakers revealed that there intentionally was no one true explanation of the film. A story of redemption and sacrifice, laden with traditional symbolism, that lets the viewer take from it what he wants. Strongly recommended.
