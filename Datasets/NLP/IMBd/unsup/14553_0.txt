my favorite peanuts cartoon with the best music ( me and you, two man crew) and Charlie Brown singing a melancholy tune about Snoopy being gone while putting his head against the wall. The "no dogs allowed" with the voice is great. One of the more sadder animations out there(especially for a Snoopy cartoon) but still very enjoyable. I last saw it on Disney channel many moons ago and wonder why it is not played more often on TV or cable.Great movie and recommended for fans of snoopy and the gang everywhere.<br /><br />watch it with your dog or remember past dogs<br /><br />
