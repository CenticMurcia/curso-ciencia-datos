Robin Williams and Nathan Lane have great "chemistry" as middle aged gay couple faced with a biggie: Their 20 year old son wants to get married and needs his "parents" to put on a phony pretense for the ultra-conservative in-laws coming for a short-notice visit. Gene Hackman is fantastic as the right wing politician desperate to escape a career threatening scandal. Just to see him in drag at the end is worth the price for this DVD.<br /><br />Both the opening scene and the final scene are priceless. Inbetween you'll find a big barrel of laughs. This is a very funny film, and despite the "controversial" subject-matter, a family movie! -- The underlying message that a "non-traditional family" can be more loving and nurturing than a dysfunctional "traditional family" is a bit buried under all of the laughs. Though dealt with through great comedy, it is a serious matter to ponder. It makes us rethink what exactly we mean by "family values".
