Before watching the movie i thought it would be a full length comedy like Benigni's first works or maybe an amusing fantasy like Pinocchio.but,it was more like the film "life is beautiful",a romantic comedy that was not as impressive as that one was . it is very similar to life is beautiful:both telling their romantic story in the background of a war and want to be a happy romance. but what the snow and tiger lacks, is it can't provoke the deep emotions of audiences like life is beautiful.most of the movie is based on the Benigni's improvising one liners and it made the movie more like a one man show that in some moments becomes boring,and Jean Reno as an Arab poet is not as interesting as his roles as gangsters and so. <br /><br />but beside these negative points i've made, the tiger and the snow is not a weak movie at all.it has a good sense of humor and is a drama in respect of post-war Baghdad .I really admire Benigni because of his style that tends to add up comedy and fantasy with human subjects.it's a simple story of a childish love to a woman that strangely begins in Italy and keeps on, in Iraq.but this romantic story can't be a lovely and memorable love story like great romances, because Benigni is very far from the character of a importunate lover, he is much more believable in the role of a kind father in the film like his character in the life is beautiful,his best movie.
