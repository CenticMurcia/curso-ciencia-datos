I believe that every film should be judged according to it's nature. For what this film is, it's almost excellent. I can still remember the first time I saw it as a child in a summer time cinema in my town and not only it left a mark in my subconsciousness about the kind of films I was watching at that time, but the music never left my memory and easily comes back without me ask for it. And I don't mind at all. But enough about me!!! Like so many other Italian western films, it actually is... a political film. Yes! And a very obvious one. The Mexican revolution as pictured here, has little in common with the real stuff. Also the basis of the Mexican food is corn! But that's not important. What matters is the hope that so many Europeans had in that time for some kind of revolution here also. So, Mexico is just an excuse.<br /><br />The movie plays with the sentiments of the viewer, who slowly finds that he wants to be a part of it, even if he is a money loving European like Yolaf Peterson. In the (incredible) end, when everything about this wonderful, crazy song you hear all the time makes sense, you are so captivated that you would never forgive Yolaf for making any other choice than the one that you also would have made given the chance. When can I see this film again?
