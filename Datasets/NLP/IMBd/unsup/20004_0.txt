I'm definitely a die-hard Casper fan. He cracks me up and i quite enjoy his own very unique and personal Casper-style of "acting".<br /><br />But jeez, this movie was difficult even for me to get through. I seriously considered stopping it several times, but i soldiered on all the way to the end credits just because it was a Casper movie.<br /><br />It was just one cliché after another, after another, after another. Even the dialog was all clichés. The production values were alright, but the screenplay seriously needed about a million less clichés.<br /><br />I did like the scene where the witch-doctor guy could turn himself into bees, but the rest of the movie was pretty much meh-h-h.<br /><br />In his own sort of way, Casper can be very entertaining. Every once in a while he does have his shining moments, but usually his thespian abilities aren't very good. And Tarzan he definitely ain't. Not by a very, very, very long shot. For those who have a fetish for bare Casper nipples, this is the movie for you. But i was bored out of my bare equine skull. What makes Casper entertaining is him being his own unique self. And with his own self being buried too much under the Tarzan persona, well, this just wasn't much of a Casper movie.<br /><br />I've watched "Meltdown", one of the most ridiculous sci-fi movies ever made, a bunch of times because he, in some sort of bizarre way, makes it very enjoyable. But i seriously doubt if i'll ever watch this particular movie again. Sorry, Casper, even i have my limits. You're very gifted at being you, but you're terrible at being Tarzan.
