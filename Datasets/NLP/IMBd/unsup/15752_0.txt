A mad scientist turns some small horror toy puppets into his blood-thirsty, living killer brigade to take revenge on his opponents and to conquer world power. That's what this movie called "Blood Dolls" from 1999 is all about, and it's really as bad as its "storyline".<br /><br />There is as many nonsense in it as in all Ed Wood and Spinal Tap movies altogether - a retarded mad scientist, the ridiculously looking killer toys, looking like some old 80's-style he-man puppets on acid and some more bizarre stuff like a strange dominatrix whipping and torturing her masochist slave all the time, a b-movie zombie monster with a carnival mask, a mad clown and gnome and a girlie rock band being captured in a cave and playing sonic-blasting gothic metal rock over and over again...<br /><br />All in all it's rather a freak show like from a fifties' b-movie with a non-plot, some hardcore sex and splatter violence and ridiculous dialogues. Well, at least I haven't seen such a weird waste of time for a long time, so if you need a good party movie for a good laugh after midnight choose "Blood Dolls" and you won't be disappointed!
