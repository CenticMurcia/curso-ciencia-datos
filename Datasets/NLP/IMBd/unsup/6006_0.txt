One of the best comedies of the late 90s. It is a satirical look at the gangsters of Poland and some teens who get into a mess with them. The humour is black, sometimes vulgar, and always hilarious. There are some "inside jokes" here that are not so simple to understand outside of Poland, however most of the humour is universal. Most of the actors belong to the new generation of Polish actors, and all of them are very talented.
