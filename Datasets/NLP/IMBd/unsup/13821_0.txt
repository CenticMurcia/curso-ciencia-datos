This movie left me feeling like I had been taken advantage of. I was expecting a movie about how a chance interaction with an eccentric millionaire, Howard Hughes, can change a persons life or at least have some small effect on a person. This was not the case. ******** SPOILER ******** The movie starts out teasing the audience by showing us a small glimpse of the sad condition of this once great man had ascended to, but then it's over, poof. Nothing profound, or earth shaking takes place in the small time Melvin spends with Howard and then the rest of the movie was all about Melvin. I would not have minded this too much had Melvin's life been at least marginally interesting, but unless average and mundane are what you are into, don't bother watching this con job. I would not recommend this movie if you are a Howard Hughes fan, or even a little bit interested in him. You will be disappointed. I do recommend this movie if you are a fan of Melvin what's his name...<br /><br />Added Note: Howard Hughes left an estate estimated at $2 billion. Four hundred prospective heirs tried to inherit it but it eventually went to twenty-two cousins on both sides of his family.
