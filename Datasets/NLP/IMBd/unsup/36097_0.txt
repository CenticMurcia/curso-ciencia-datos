Oh, those terrible kids. I was their age at the time of this film and I am ashamed that this is the best example of juvenile delinquency Lewis can muster.<br /><br />"Terrorizing" old ladies by burning newspapers in her yard and spraying her with a hose? This is terrible. Give them the chair. Taking a cane from a blind man and crutches from an injured old man. Oh how horrible! Putting a toddler in a trash can while they wreck the stroller. Big men! These were just wimps. tearing up a newspaper. Oh, come on.<br /><br />There were some rapes (not that you would see anything), and ultimately a murder, they were scum, but so is this picture.
