I saw this movie on DVD after it was given away free with the Sunday Times. And it's safe to say it's like all of those freebie CDs the newspapers are giving away these daysone OK song amongst a dozen that aren't worth the cardboard sleeve the disc came in.<br /><br />The premise is a romantic comedy stapleHe gets jilted at the alter. She gets fed up of playing second fiddle to her married boyfriend. The mismatched pair are thrown together for a trip to Donegal, presumably with romance and comedy thrown into the mix. The problem with this film is that it's neither romantic or funny. Yes, it's obviously a low budget film but that's no excuse for the dreadful script. There's no character development whatsoever, some very dodgy acting, zero chemistry between the leads and worse still, very little to like about them.<br /><br />At least I got a free newspaper with the DVD.
