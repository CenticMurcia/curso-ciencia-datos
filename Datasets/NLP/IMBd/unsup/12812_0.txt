There are two ways to get a huge number of A-list faces on the big screen and where the first is usually a biblical or wartime epic, the other is a grand concept comedy such as Cannonball run. Essentially the film seems to have been shot on the fly whilst an actual cross-America car race took place. Hal Needham's picture was the first to use the outtakes in the end credits but sometimes its difficult to distinguish a blooper from the craziness that had gone before.<br /><br />Still, Burt Reynolds' charisma drives (ahem) the film, along with his stooge, the hilariously cranky Dom DeLuise as Victor. Or Captain Chaos. Hmm. The rest of the cast have roles but they're essentially playing themselves - having said that Roger Moore's moniker of Seymour Goldfarb Jr. is a work of art. The fun benefits from money being spent on some inventive stunts and a police department with a sense of humour. 3/10
