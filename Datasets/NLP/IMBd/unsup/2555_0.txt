A man returns from the army to revenge the ill treatment of his brother by a gang of unsavouries.<br /><br />People are often put off British films with reviews which begin with "Gritty" or "Realistic," but people should definitely give this film a try. It can be uncomfortable viewing at times, but thanks to the performances and direction it is a truly gripping piece of work. Special praise should go to Considine, whose performance has been favourably compared to De Niro in Taxi Driver. He is able to play menacing without ever resorting to hammy, OTT gestures or even a raised voice, its one of the most frightening, beautiful and realistic performances i've ever seen. Toby Kebbell is also great as his simple brother, his warm, lovable performance making the final scenes all the more distressing.<br /><br />This is a great film and i would urge everyone who is not afraid to stray from blockbusters once in a while to see it.
