This movie has the best dialouge of any movie I've ever seen. It's a simple portrayal of 2 guys, both having been dumped by their respective girlfreinds, who decide to spend a day at the local mall. While one (Jeremy London) is trying to win his girl back, the other (Jason Lee) is pretending like he is okay about his breakup. The storyline is good, but what makes this movie is the dialouge. Brodie is a smartass and feeds likes like "Most of the time I'm just talking through my ass. Or sticking my hand in it.", while T.S. is a romantic loser who says things like " You should see yourself right now - a grown man with his hand down his pants." And with a great cast (Stan Lee, Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams) this makes the movie so much more awesome than it already is. It really is a treat to see this.
