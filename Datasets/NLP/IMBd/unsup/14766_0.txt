I really enjoyed the movie. Sometimes you want to watch something that is fun and lighthearted with a happy ending. Not every film is a great epic. People tend to be hard on films like these when writing a review because they think every film must be deep and intellectual. This movie can be enjoyed by the whole family, has a lot of funny moments, and won't give you nightmares. Not a waste of time if you like fun!
