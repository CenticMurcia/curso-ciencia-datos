This film is not bad visually. It breaks no new ground, but it pulls off some music-video style imagery in a way that fits nicely into the film. Christian Slater's acting is actually pretty good. But the plot stinks. It's the same tired 'this is all a hallucinatory dream sequence in the moment before death' crap that ruins so many films that almost make a statement, and then, at the last minute, confess to being delusions. If nothing past the first fifteen minutes of a film is 'real', and the main character dies at the end of a film with the realization that the things you just saw were all some literature professor's self-referential wet dream of metaphor and allegory, then what is this film worth? The whole thing is pointless. Would have made a fair enough five page short story for a freshman college English class. At a community college. On film, it's just disappointing.
