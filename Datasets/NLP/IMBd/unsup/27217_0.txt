This TV movie about King David may seem long,but it really shows in a vivid way David's transition from a mere shepherd boy to a great political figure and biblical icon.I liked the way the cast mentioned there faith in Yahweh.Keith Michell's portrayal of King David seemed realistic,especially in the scene where he was condemning Joab's murder of Abner.If we compare this film with the 1997 TV film of David by Lux Vide, both have great depictions of David's life. Anthony Quayle did a impressive performance as Saul.Too bad this film is only available on VHS. Let's hope that soon it can be restored or available on DVD.My hat goes of to Alex Segal and Lowell Rich for there project.
