This movie is an impressive and exciting story about the people,their feelings,love,desperation,anger and hope.Although the scenario is a little bit melodramatic , the film is a must indeed.It is quite different from the blockbusters with happy ends because it is real and outstanding.Several lives and fates are mixed in it.Every character has his own unique personality.They all have to take decisions for their lives and have to fight for happiness.The actors are very nice.The stunning Hayek makes a good performance .Gomes Krus is also convincing as a man who becomes gay after 30 years marriage.The supporting roles are also well-played.Don't think that this is some kind of soap opera- it is something deeper...
