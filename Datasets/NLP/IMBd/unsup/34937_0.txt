This is an awful film: witless, humorless, pointless. It's essentially a chase film, the heroes running constantly from an assortment of wicked Muslim extremists. There are the usual explosions.<br /><br />The low point of the film is a dance scene. The heroes, during one of their many escapes, are captured by wild natives, perhaps pygmies. Then there is a festival featuring topless black dancers--who suddenly turn attractive. Kathleen Turner gets carried away with the drum beats and the nude natives, and she (sort of) joins in, wiggling her behind and making everyone notice that she is much less endowed in the chest area than the dancers.<br /><br />Danny Devito runs around during the chase scenes screaming four letter words. And you have to see Turner and Michael Douglas hanging by their wrists over a bottomless pit while rats gnaw at the ropes suspending them. You'll howl.<br /><br />In short, this is a film for bad movie lovers. The unintentional laughs are many.
