Don't be reserved about liking this movie. I love it! It's one of my favorite movies ever. I hate how comedies can never win awards just for being really really funny. The Oscars that go to comedies are usually won by movies that just aren't hilarious and sometimes have a "plot" that just gets in the way. Anyway, I first saw the movie with a friend years back and whenever we get together we still can't help throwing out a "who's idea was the corn?", "calm yourself! you think I don't know what is a gompet, gomp-let?", or "He's got something in his hands!!!". I know the story sucks but I just like comedies that make me laugh. This one does the trick.
