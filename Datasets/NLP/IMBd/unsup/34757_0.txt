Which is basically what teenage Katy says to her father over and over and over again. AFter lying (again), not only to her family but the rodeo management, Flicka is seriously injured, and Katy is in bed with a fever. The dad doesn't want Flicka to suffer, so he heads off to put her down. Katy comes down the steps, tears streaming down her face. "Finally!" I thought, "She is going to redeem herself and say she's sorry for the incredible mess she's gotten everyone into." But, nooooo, she says 'it's okay, Daddy, you can kill both of us'. OH MY GOODNESS!! My super-favorite part, though, was at the end, when the DAD apologizes to Katy. What?!! Way to go Hollywood, for emasculating another Father and making him appear totally incompetent.
