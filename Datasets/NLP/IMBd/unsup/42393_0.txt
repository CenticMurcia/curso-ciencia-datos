As my summary said, this is bad. The script is bad. The acting is, even though you wouldnt think it's possible, worse then the script. I won't even comment on the directing, nor the whole idea behind the film.<br /><br />This is the problem with Norwegian movies. They suck. Elling was good, note that Elling is the exception. This is nothing like Elling. Not warm, not funny not well made. Not based on a cool book by a cool guy. This stuff was just ridiculous. Soooo many cliches. There where no suspense, no question as of who did what they did nor why they did it. They just did it.<br /><br />Only thing that kept us motivated trough out the film was the violence and the fact that it was so bad we where laughing. So would I recommend it? If you are really drunk or something I'm sure this could've been somewhat fun. Not as a good comedy, at all (see Elling instead) but as a mockery to film in general.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say. It has some blood and gore, but not enough to make it a slasher. It doesn't have the humor of one of those (like bad taste or Evil Ed.. you catch my drift..) nor is it good enough to be one. Bottom line is, it's a bad piece of movie. Sure, it's Norwegian. Wo-ho. It's not good. It's bad. Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad. Not as bad as Diplomatic Siege, but still bad.<br /><br />Stay away.
