Hotel Reserve is an interesting little thriller set before World War 2 and I taped this when BBC2 screened it one afternoon.<br /><br />A medical student on holiday in France is arrested for spying when some photos are developed showing something to do with the Army or Navy. To clear is name, the police release him and he has to find the actual person who took these with his camera. It has to be on of his fellow guests at Hotel Reserve...<br /><br />The cast includes James Mason and Herbert Lom, both of whom went on to play Captain Nemo, Mason in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Lom in Mysterious Island. With Patricia Medina.<br /><br />Hotel Reserve is quite a tense movie and is worth catching.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
