Time Chasers is probably one of the better movies on MST3K, though the competition isn't too tough. There was actually a pretty complex plot, but it had been done before in Back to the Future. The so-called hero wasn't very likeable (couldn't even drive a car), and the bad guys screwed around, making them not very threatening. It didn't have much for special effects and it could have really used them. The MST3K was great, and it was fun to watch the movie because it was filmed in Rutland, Vermont. I give it a 4/10.
