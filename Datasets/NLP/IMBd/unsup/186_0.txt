"Tomorrow is Forever" is a typical example of the type of films that came out of the Hollywood of the 40s. This seems to have been brought to the screen as a vehicle for Claudette Colbert, one of the most admired actresses of that era. Under the direction of Irving Pichel, we get a wonderful account of a woman whose husband is killed during the last days of WWI. The music score by Max Steiner enhances the film, although it feels obtrusive, at times.<br /><br />Claudette Colbert was a prolific star of all the melodramas that were tailor made for her to shine. Her Elizabeth Hamilton in this film is a typical role she, and other actresses, played during that era. "Tomorrow is Forever" is interesting because of Orson Welles' appearance as the supposedly dead husband that returns under a different disguise.<br /><br />Today's audiences don't have patience to deal with what for the movie going public in the early days were able to allow in the reality department. Some negative comments to this forum express that viewpoint, but in spite of them, films like this will always be immensely rewarding for those fans that feel comfortable with the plots created for this type of movies.<br /><br />Claudette Colbert makes a wonderful Elizabeth. Orson Welles was the real surprise in the dramatic role that Ms. Colbert championed for him, at a time of his life that he wasn't recognized for his genius. George Brent, a reliable actor, is seen as one of the decent men he played in films. Lucile Watson, as Aunt Jessie, is an asset. The young Richard Long plays Drew, the eldest son that has no clue who his father really is, but grows up believing the kind Lawrence is his dad. Natalie Wood as the young German girl, Margaret, showed a talent for stealing scenes from much established actors.<br /><br />This is a film to be cherished by people who love the genre.
