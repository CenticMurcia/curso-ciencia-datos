Cecil B. DeMille directed a film with a cast of all time giants of the movie screen, Gary Cooper, Paulette Goddard, Boris Karloff, Ward Bond and even Katherine DeMille. However, these great actors were not able to make this film a success because of the screenplay by Charles Bennett. In 1763 in colonial America, Martin Garth(howard Da Silva), a trader, secretly trades guns to the Indians in order to stop the westward movement of settlers, Garth tries to purchase young Abby Hale (Paulette Goddard), a British servant for his own interests, but a Virginia Capt. Christopher Holden(Gary Cooper), outbids the trader and then frees her. Garth encourages an Indian rebellion on Fort Pitt led by Chief Guyasuta (Boris Karloff). This picture gets very boring and pointless. Karloff acts perfectly as an Indian and you can hardly hear his lisp or British accent!
