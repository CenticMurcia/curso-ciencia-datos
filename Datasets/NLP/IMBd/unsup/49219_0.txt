Not even watching babealiscious Jennifer Aniston makes this movie tolerable. In fact you will probably come away liking her a whole lot less if you see her in this. Never have figured out whatever appeal Vince Vaughn has for some people. He would be a mediocre actor at best if his flat emotionless monotone delivery wasn't so terrible. Think Schwimmer and Romano. This disaster starts off with him laying some ridiculously implausible pickup line on Aniston at a baseball game. Then 30 seconds of photo album shots defines their whole relationship up to the break up. Then your off on apparently an hour and a half of non-stop arguing, and not even believable arguing but stupid crap like Vaughn sticking a pool table in the living room of their condo. I say apparently based on reading other reviews here because I could't stand more than about 40 minutes of it. This movie is the antithesis of funny. Its not romantic, dramatic or clever and (ladies) if you drag some poor schmuck out to see it on your first date it will probably be your last.
