This is my favorite Tom Selleck movie!! Plain and simply, when are they going to put it on DVD?<br /><br />Now the site tells me I have to write more than one line...so...<br /><br />It has been too long since I have seen it! I don't have a working VCR anymore and I wouldn't invest in one, anyway. I remember that Tom Selleck is great in this movie and along with Jane Seymour, they have a great on-screen chemistry. The movie reminds me of the cat-burglary of "To Catch A Thief", but the period is WWII Europe and Tom Selleck must break into an embassy to try to avoid prison, much like Sean Connery did in "The Rock". It has many twists and turns and a surprise ending to equal "The Sting"! <br /><br />This movie has it all!
