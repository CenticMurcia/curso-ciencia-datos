I was looking forward to seeing this movie after seeing Jim Kelly in 'Black Belt Jones' and 'Enter the Dragon' but I was disappointed with the fact that Jim Kelly's voice was dubbed over by someone else. Nonetheless, 'Tattoo Connection' remained entertaining. The fight scenes towards the end were long and tedious at times yet at other times were trying new things by adding weapons and such. Kelly's acting was as bad as ever and shows little facial expression while the plot itself is just awful. This is the kind of movie you can't stop laughing at because it's so bad.
