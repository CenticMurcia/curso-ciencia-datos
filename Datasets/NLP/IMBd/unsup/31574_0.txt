I really enjoyed this movie for the most part. It had some parallels to The Shining in that the son/daughter had a mysterious friend, who apparently can make things haywire. There was another parallel with the dead women in the bathtub in both movies and the father getting crazy and going after an authority figure with an axe. This movie really kept me on the edge of me seat, and thats why I have to give it a seven. However, I had a hunch about 10-15 prior to the end that David Callaway(De Niro) was going to get killed. However, I thought Emily was going to be the one to kill him, not the lady. I figured Emily was going to stab him in the backside in the cave scene.
