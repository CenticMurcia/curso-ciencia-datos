Recap: A mockumentary, or parody of the documentary March of the penguins, if you like. We follow two male penguins on their hike from the sea to their breedingplace, and their discussions about finding love.<br /><br />Comments: Not much to say really. It is kind of slow with all the penguin shots being at such a slow tempo, with crude documentary. Many of the jokes are crude and fart jokes are far too prominent. So on average this is quite a bad movie.<br /><br />However there are a few bright spots. Jokes that actually are quite funny. Jokes that almost but not quite manage to carry the movie. They did make the movie bearable though, kept me going to the next bright spot. But to be a good movie, or average, they are too few and too far between.<br /><br />One of the bright spots are the cast though. Don't know what made so many known actors and actresses contribute to a material like this, but I guess Bob Saget had something to do with it. It is a little of a Full house reunion, with friends.<br /><br />A good idea, which could have been done much better though. An extra plus for the DVD menus though, they were better than the movie and better than most other DVD-menus.<br /><br />4/10
