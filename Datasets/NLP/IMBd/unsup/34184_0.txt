The racism in this disgraceful production amidst breathtaking scenery follows the pattern of similar productions from its source and time. We see hordes of Africans slaughtering innocent whites and are barely spared the scenes of these being fried and eaten. To offset this, we have two official "blacks" whose education, intelligence and kindness beats anything even the best of the latter might have been capable of. We have the heroic, clean, brave Englishman as Captain Curry who in the end kills his crooked and brutal ex-Wehrmacht German subordinate, while the savages mangle the cowardly young French-(Belgian ?) lieutenant. To make the production more acceptable to German audiences, Captain Curry becomes Captain Kr√ºger, barely credible with him being a British stereotype, carrying exclusively equipment of that origin.
