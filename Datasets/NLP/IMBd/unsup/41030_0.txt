I think people should know what to expect. Lets face it the synopsis gives the entire story away. So why watch this thing...<br /><br />Well... its an interesting silent film with some very bad music scored to it (it reminds you of the music from part of Disney's Snow White, just not the good parts).<br /><br />It is in color but quite frankly has the look of a bad home movie.<br /><br />For lack of a better way of saying it... This movie is what you would have expected from National Geographic if they had shot movies in the thirties and wanted to make fun of native tribes.<br /><br />It was interesting only to see the way in which people viewed non-European's... it otherwise has no artistic merit. Very bad... I would have given it a one, but I only give ones to movies so bad that you can enjoy them for being bad. This one is just a waste of film/videotape/DVD.
