I saw this movie and was disappointed greatly, but more importantly I'm here to see if anyone knows the origins of this movie.<br /><br />I wrote a similar script (though much better) and entered it into a screen writing contest...I never heard back from them. Not long after that did I see production began on this movie and there are striking similarities to my script and this movie...though this movie is much lower quality and has less production value. But there are things in this movie that I had created for my script and did not come from the story of the Minotaur which made me suspicious. Of course it is possible that I am not the only person in the world that wrote a script containing these similarities...but any information anyone could give me to ease my suspicions would be appreciated.
