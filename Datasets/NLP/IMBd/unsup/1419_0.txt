`The phone is dead. Do you hear that Vitus? Even the phone is dead.' What a great line!<br /><br />This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff playing chess and fighting it out over old wounds and new ones.<br /><br />The entire supporting cast is splendid as is the direction Edgar G. Ulmer. Yet could we expect less from a story (loosely adapted as it was) by Edgar Allan Poe and this cast? See for yourself and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Many aspects of this film remind me of `Old Dark House' and I like it just as much. If you know me you would realize what a ringing endorsement that truly is.<br /><br />I think you'll be refreshingly surprised at Lugosi playing the sympathetic character, even though it's not entirely clear early on in the movie.<br /><br />One of the scenes that has always stood out in my mind since first watching this film is the one near the end when Lugosi ties up Karloff. There is no blood and yet it is more gruesome than many of today's graphic moments. It goes to show that there is more to great horror than having to show every detail.<br /><br />Keep an eye out for the title of the book Karloff reads in bedÂ….Very creepy stuff.<br /><br />I rate this movie a 9+ in the category of horror classics. To me it's not Frankenstein or Dracula but not that far below.<br /><br />
