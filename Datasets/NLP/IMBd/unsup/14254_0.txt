At 2:00 am the story line would not let me go to bed. Had to stay up and finish till the end. Enjoyed it. If you are movie fan of old movies (and 50's TV) you will know many of the character actors faces (but not the names). Vincent Price was only name that I knew. All the rest have been in a billion movies. The story line was fantastic if it was true.
