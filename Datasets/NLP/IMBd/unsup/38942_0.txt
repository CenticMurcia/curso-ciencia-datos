Well I see another film has made it to the over rated list, however this film is to unknown to be over rated. Other than fill 90 minutes before bed, it offered poor, very dry humor with a whole cast of overacting, underacting with a cherry on top.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being to hash given that this is a low budget film, however a lot of corny dialog and the worst ending I've seen with no thought put into it, I was surprised I finished watching it.<br /><br />It seems to me they director tried to make this movie something like The Matrix, with agents from hell chasing, shooting, slicing, dicing their victims with perfect precision but whenever the main character was shot at they just seemed to....miss (maybe divine intervention I don't know). This seems to be typical step for any action movie these days.<br /><br />Well as I stated in my title, I am very confused how this movie got over a 7, it has been my understanding that this is a pretty high score for IMDb. Maybe I under appreciate this movie or miss understood its greatness but I know what I like and I didn't like this.
