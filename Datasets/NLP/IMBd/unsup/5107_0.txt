Amar Akbar Anthony is a film about three brothers who get separated at a very young age and have their own interests and religions. The three heroines, Parveen babi, shabana azmi and Neetu singh do a good job and get who they want to be with. The three heros, Amitabh bachan,Vinod khanna and Rishi kapoor do their job.<br /><br />This film is good and the producer did a good job of the story and i think if there was to be a remake of this film it woulden't be the same. Nirupa roy and Pran do a good job of their role as Amar Akbar Anthony's mum and dad.<br /><br />Amitabh bachan steals the show by performing the song "My name is anthony gonsalves" but at the end the three heros perform a song together which is "Amar Akbar Anthony" all the songs are good but those two are one of my favourites.<br /><br />over all the film deserves a 10/10 and i'd recommend this film to anyone.
