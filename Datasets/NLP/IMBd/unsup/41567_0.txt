My husband, who has a liking for epic movies, dragged me to this movie (and I'm sick no less) and when it was over I couldn't believe I'd only been sitting there for only 2hours and 15 minutes. It felt like 3 1/2! The guy next to me left 45 minutes before the movie ended and I wish I had done the same thing.<br /><br />This movies was full of the same old predicable cliches and boring slow motion camera work to make it all seem even more dramatic than it was.<br /><br />The only scenes I did like were the ones between Harry and Abou. Those were genuine. The rest was CRAP.<br /><br />I have already lost some respect for the Academy after giving Russel Crowe the Best Leading Actor for Gladiator, but if anyone from this movie wins even a nomination, then the whole organization is full of it.<br /><br />Save it for a bad movie rental night. Don't waste your money or time to see it in the theater.
