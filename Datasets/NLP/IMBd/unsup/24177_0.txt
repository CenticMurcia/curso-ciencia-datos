I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie since the "Loch Ness" subject matter is kind of an overused topic. The fact that people said it was "family friendly" was also a strong turn-off: kiddie characters, themes ... 'nuf said.<br /><br />However, I'm glad I saw this movie! It had a good, interesting story and great characters. The special effects were pretty good too. Even though the lead character is a young kid, it was OK since all of the characters and story were realistic and serious - and not depicted from a kid's point of view.<br /><br />The story is framed around a modern-day pub where an old-timer is telling a couple young hikers/travelers the story of a picture on the wall. The bulk of the story takes place during WWII at Loch Ness and centers around a little boy that discovers and takes home a large egg.<br /><br />I'll pretty much confirm what other's have said. Yes - it's fit for viewing by all members of the family, but don't let that stereotype trap you into thinking it's only for kids. If you're in the mood for something light, this is a good movie and worth checking out.
