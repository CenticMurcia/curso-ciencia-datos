I rather enjoyed watching "Shooting Fish" on a hot, humid summer night, when there was nothing better to do than rent a video. It's a nice film, and has some very funny scenes, but it's also a very light one, and doesn't require too much attention. If you're looking for a light and breezy comedy, you can't go wrong with this one.
