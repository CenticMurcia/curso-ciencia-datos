The Glass House is so wonderful and all the bad reviews are just totally bogus because the movie was good.It was fresh, and highly original which is what a good thriller needs and the Glass House was able to take all the elements a good thriller needs and put it into it.I love how it does not just immediately jump into conclusion or the big climax, but sets up a good story and reasons that the characters might suspect something bad going on.To anyone who has not seen this avoid all the bad things you have heard and sit down and watch this movie you might enjoy it, and you hopefully will so don't let other peoples reviews and a bad box office performance already ruin this movie for you. 9.3 stars out of 10
