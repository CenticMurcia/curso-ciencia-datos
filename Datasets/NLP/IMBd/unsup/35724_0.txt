Gernerally regarded as being one of the worst sequels ever committed to film, this begins with about five minutes of flashbacks to the first film, followed by a cheap shock (guy sneaking into girlfriend's room in a mask) , then more flashbacks. After which a group of dirt-bike racers (using some type of gasoline created by survivor of the first film, for the obligatory cameo) leave for a motor-cross competition in the desert. They stupidly decide to take a shortcut, and when their bus breaks down, they end up in the same area where the first film took place where they're set upon by two survivors of the cannibal family. Bad references to the first film scattered throughout the early scenes don't help, nor does an uneven pacing, but it's well photographed in the desert, capturing the desolation and isolation of it, and the low budget sets (Ha! What sets? It was probably filmed using anything they happened to find in the desert) work well. Also has pretty good foot chase through the rocky cliffs between a couple of the bikers and Pluto, and a couple of other good actions scenes, but that can't hide the fact that, for all its explosions and chases, there's really just not a lot going on here. Personally I don't think this is quite as bad as some people claim, it's no worse than any other mindless sequel (for example: Saw V) but it's no prize winner either, and it pales in comparison to the original Hills Have Eyes. More of a plot, and a better ending (like the first film, it doesn't explain how the hell the last two characters get out of the desert, nor what happens to Ruby) would have helped considerably. <br /><br />*1/2 out of ****
