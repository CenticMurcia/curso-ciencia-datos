I could be wrong but I think I saw the trailer for this when I saw The Swarm back in the 70s.I remember thinking "who is going to see this?" Now I know why adults think so little of teenagers' choices. The part of the film that I didn't like very much was the extended party/fight scene. But now I think the director was making a political statement about good/clean fighting and bad/dirty fighting--such as Vietnam. Well, maybe not. I read one criticism which stated that the third quarter of the movie (Jack's return and Matt's epiphany)was boring and slowed down the plot. I disagree. And in closing, any movie with a character named "Bear," played by the red-headed cop from the "Rookies," can share the beach with me any day. What did he say? I'm just a garbage man. Cowabonga!
