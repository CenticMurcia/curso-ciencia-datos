This version of Williams's beautiful play takes all the magic, memory, and poignancy out of the story. The play is a wispy, fragile thing and the movie takes the story, which remains, and shifts it to a typical film structure, taking the greatest things about the play out and putting all the conventional movie "stuff" in.<br /><br />Add to that a totally misguided change to the ending, where Laura suddenly has a new gentleman caller (!!!) and the sadness and purity of the whole thing falls apart. The play is about a man who leaves his sister to a sad, lonely life and his own emotional confusion and regret about following his personal journey instead of caring for his mother and loving sister. Take that out and you've got... nothing.<br /><br />Very disappointing.
