Excellent watch...... Not sure how anyone could have a close minded outlook on such a powerful documentary. This was a very informative piece and breaking it down into such simple terms just negates the whole purpose of the interviews. You get a first hand account of slave life, it will not be pretty at all though there were some times of joy in their lives. Recommended if a firsthand, true account of slavery as it truly was would interest you. The celebrity list is extensive, full of prominent black actors/actresses reading excerpts of the interviews conducted so many years ago. The rawness of the production along with the photo's of actual slaves being shown whilst the narrator speaks is one of the more appealing aspects of the production.
