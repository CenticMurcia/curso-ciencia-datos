This is one of the sweetest movies I have ever seen. Yes, maybe it sort-of follows the standard plot of this type of film, but there's something about it that makes it stand out...it has heart. And lots of it. The characters are played so perfectly that you think you are actually watching a real group of people.<br /><br />Charlie Talbert is absolutely wonderful as Angus - no one else could have played him better. Chris Owen is hilarious, especially when he finally gets his revenge on Rick at the dance! Ariana Richards is great as Melissa and James Van Der Beek plays the nasty/popular/jock well. And lest I forget George C. Scott and Kathy Bates - they are awesome in all their movies.<br /><br />SEE ANGUS! It rocks. You'll feel so happy and ready to conquer the world when it's over. 10/10! ~ Peace out ~
