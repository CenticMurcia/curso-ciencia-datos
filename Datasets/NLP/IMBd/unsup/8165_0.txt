Disturbia is not a bad movie at all, its just a little too teen-age-ish. And if you ask me it was not very original. The biggest rip off hear was of course "REAR WINDOW" it also took some plot points from "WHEN A STRANGER CALLS"-which if you ask me is a lot better than this film- and also "SAW". But other than that it was very enjoyable and fun. There was plenty of suspense and frightening moments. Humor was also added into the mix which is very nice except the comic relief, Shia's best friend Ronny is a bit annoying at times. <br /><br />The acting was good and the song choices were nice too- loved "LONLY DAY" by System of a down. So folks if you want a good movie with not a lot of adult actors but a whole lot of suspense go out and rent "DISTURBIA".
