-***WARNING*** for those of you who have not seen this movie yet,this comment contains MAJOR SPOILERS.<br /><br />Given the small number of people who have rated this movie, I must conclude that this "mini"-series is not well known at all, but the people who have seen it may be interested in what I am going to point out: I saw it in December 2004, that is to say 6 months before "Lost" was aired on TV in western Europe. Having greatly enjoyed it, I couldn't help thinking that "Lost" reminded me of something, and it did not take me a long time to figure out of what: "Tribe"!!! The similarities between the two series are quite obvious: first of all, in both series. a brutal event (an airplane crash in "Lost", a hijacked boat in"Tribe"), leaves a group of very different people stranded on an island; second, these people, despite their very different personalities, are forced to organize themselves in order to live together, and this cannot be without some conflicts; other elements are also common to the two series: the island on which both "tribes" are stranded on contains some traps and there are also the "bad ones" (the "others" about whom the survivors in "Lost" are warned about by the French woman in Season 1, and the bad encounter that the group of people who leave the island on the raft make are obviously similar to the sea pirates returning to the island in "Tribe", etc... etc...)And the name of one of the major characters in both "Tribe" and "Lost" is... JACK!!!Strange, isn't it? I therefore highly suspect that the creators of "Lost" may have been inspired by "Tribe", even if I cannot prove it at all... However, given the so high number of similarities (there are others that would be too long to enumerate), I cannot believe that all this is pure coincidence...
