There's been a lot of debate about whether this movie is good or bad. I liked it at first, but then I started thinking.<br /><br />This movie really just consists of a problem, there's a solution to this problem, however as a result of that solution another problem occurs, this is fine until about the 6th problem or so, and then you just get a headache. If you don't understand me let me break it down, for example (this does happen in the movie) problem: they realize the Icarus 1 is still orbiting around the sun, there is a distress call and the crew of the Icarus 2 believe there could be someone still there, or they could take the bomb from the Icarus one and use it in case their bomb doesn't work to restart the sun. Solution: they change course towards the Icarus 1. Problem: they changed course but didn't fix the sheids (which were set for the normal journey, couldn't the super-genius computer have done this? or simply warned them), the ship might be destroyed if they don't fix the sheilds, a fir occurs in the ship (etc etc) Solution:they fix the sheilds. Problem: the captain loses his life in the mission and all hell breaks loose on the ship between the crew. As you see its as if one thing leads to another, but thats not necessarily a good thing.<br /><br />The whole movie really consists of that. I would describe all the bad things that don't make any sense in this movie but other people have probably named them all. <br /><br />In some peoples defence to this movie they say things like "you should simply watch it without thinking, don't think about its flaws". OK...<br /><br />1. If you didn't think about a movies 'flaws' every movie would be perfect, and none would be bad.<br /><br />2. The movie its self gets you thinking, so who is to blame?<br /><br />A lot of things are left unanswered, for example the captain dies and one of the crew members is like 'captain...what did you see...what did you see?' this really got my interest for a while, until i realized that the captain didn't see anything, or whatever he did see we would never know. The characters seem to change their personality throughout the movie. For example there is one character who seems to have a fetish for plants, half way through the movie she decides to have a change of heart from treehugger to a "lets kill him, he isn't any use to us" sort of person. In the directors defence he did this to show how people could change in different circumstances...OK?....<br /><br />Another idea, when your making a movie stick to one set genre, OK? don't decide, hm...im getting bored of sci fi i think im going to move to horror/thriller. The director must have though 3/4 of the film in, that he'd like to have a crazy killer in the movie. OK i really don't want to explain it all... Its worth watching ONCE, rent it, don't buy it.<br /><br />If you watch it more then once in (for example) a month, then there's something obviously wrong with you, and you should seek counselling.<br /><br />There's nothing really good about the movie, but its still interesting (for a while).<br /><br />Id give it a 4 (maybe 5 if im generous) out of 10.<br /><br />P.S. if the character is close enough to put his hand into the sun and his hand gets burnt, how come the rest of his body doesn't burn as well? This is one of the many unscientific occurings in this movie.
