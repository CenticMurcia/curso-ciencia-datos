I actually saw this at the theatre 14 years ago. Then I decided it was the worse movie ever, man did watching it on video not disappoint. What can I say, terrible story, mediocre acting, and dialog as bad as something that I would write. Probably the least suspenseful ending I have ever seen. I would not recommend wasting the 90 minutes on it.
