Yep- the point of the movie disappears in its identity trouble, which arrives quite soon- Murder thriller? Courtroom drama? Whimsical comedy/quirky southern character study? None, it tries to juggle them all and holds not enough quality of any for me to care about this film, and, man - it just drags on and on...<br /><br />And what's the point of any movie to introduce potentially interesting supporting characters if they don't develop, hold no relevance or vibrance to the main story at all? The voodoo woman, the fly-man, Chablis the drag queen, and especially the bar-singing florist girl... They're just a passing gallery, and Eastwood could've scraped off half without affecting the story one bit (I haven't read the book, but maybe they're more crucial there.)! Less conventional visuals and camera-work might have helped this lame substance... but, no. Top cast indeed, but it ignites few sparks, except for Lady Chablis. The best bit is the courtroom part. <br /><br />Disappointing? With such talent- You bet. 3 out of 10 from ozjeppe
