Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis don't even seem to be acting, they give such genuine performances. To turn a phrase of Stanislavsky's, "I truly BELIEVED their performances". <br /><br />I had the pleasure of seeing Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara in 'Love Letters' in Beverly Hills some years ago. I loved how seamlessly they worked together. Their chemistry was alive again in HB, though I would have liked more on-screen time for the two of them. I was happy they were rewarded with Emmys.<br /><br />All in all this was a great movie. I'm surprised it didn't win more awards, it certainly deserved more accolades. I give the movie a 9 out of 10, but I tend to be enthusiastic and passionate about films that I like.
