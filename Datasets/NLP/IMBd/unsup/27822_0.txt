Those were the days! The days of great action movies, and cold as ice heroes. John Carpenter had yet to turn sour, and Kurt Russell was in his prime.<br /><br />This is one of my favorites. The characters and story go together perfectly. The cast that was assembled for this movie is one of a kind. Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton and Adrienne Barbeau are all great. There's even Isaac Hayes in there for a little nod to the 70's.<br /><br />Above all, this is one of those rare action features that has a great story to drive it. I won't bother to recount the plot here because I'm assuming most people have already seen this one. For those of you who haven't seen this one before.... Shame on you! Go see it now.<br /><br />8 out of 10
