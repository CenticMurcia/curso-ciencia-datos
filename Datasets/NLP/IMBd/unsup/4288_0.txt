..to watch this movie over and over again!! You can watch it 50 times and u won't get bored so i totally recommend this movie to anyone. It's very versatile, it has funny scenes as well as more serious ones, so that DIl CHAHTA HAI makes you laugh on the one hand and on the other hand you'll start to think about ur life. In my opinion love is a minor point in this movie, the main thing it deals with is friendship... In a way which is completely comprehensible... not like other movies , e.g. "Dosti" , where its totally exaggerated which makes the audience not try to identify with the main characters cause it seems to be so unrealistic. In DIL CHAHTA HAI this is not the case, you're gonna have fun watching Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna when they try to get their beloveds ... and you're gonna laugh! So, absolutely 10 outta 10 !
