I've seen this movie many times and I love it more and more. I guess I'm just a sucker for long lost loves and for Richard Chamberlain. This was a well cast movie with beautiful scenery and it gave you more than the love story to think about. I think this movie reaches many people at different levels & leaves you realizing that everything in life isn't just black & white. I would like to have more movies like this.
