I found this movie under the Comedy section of Blockbusters (God knows why...it should be in Horror) about 10 years ago. It looked interesting so I rented it. It's certainly different. It's about a bunch of elderly people turning into killers to prevent their building from being torn down. The acting is pretty good and the killings are pretty scary (but within a PG rating)...but this is treated as a comedy. I found nothing funny about the situation at all. And when they start killing each other off over nothing the movie went too far. Lousy ending too. Still, it's worth catching if you want to see something different and the acting is quite good from the entire cast.
