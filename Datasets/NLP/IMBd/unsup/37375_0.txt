It has the look and feel of a bad high school play, where basic elements of pacing and plot were unknown to the producer(s). Even the name "Daydreamer" doesn't make sense in the context of the film. It's a confusing story that starts out muddled and gets worse as the movie goes on. There are holes in the story that aren't resolved, despite their apparent attempt to "wrap it up" at the end. The camera work is sophomoric to the point where I believe someone bought their kid a Sony DVW for Hanukkah and they suddenly thought they could make a movie. The actors are like so much of Hollywood today: models that look good on screen but can't act their way out of a grocery bag. This movie made my head hurt; not because it's nonsensical and hard to watch, but because someone actually paid money to make it.
