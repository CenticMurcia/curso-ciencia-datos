Shadow of the Colossus is one of those games where you can just watch someone else play and have a good time. The person playing will have a good time as well.<br /><br />As 'Wander', you ride to a forbidden land (with warnings that it is forbidden) and try to save a pretty, dead, brunette girl who is your love. Now, before you all go and say 'Awwwww' I have to say that the story is dark and very gritty. When he gets the hint that he has to defeat 16 giants (the smallest being about the size of a van) to do this, he sets off on this great adventure to slay the beasts.<br /><br />Seriously, Peter Jackson, we need you to make a movie of this. Itd be awesome.<br /><br />Slaying these beasts is no cakewalk either... they're all distinct and it takes a fair amount of brainpower to figure them out. Climbing them and slaying them is a whole different story than finding them. It takes about 30 minutes sometimes to roam the landscape to find the next Colossi. So, constant action is a nono here.<br /><br />It's not for everyone, but a true gamer would really appreciate it.
