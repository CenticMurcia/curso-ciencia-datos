I have watched this film several times and aided by a gap of a few years between viewings and a bad memory, so i cant remember the twist, it is very enjoyable.<br /><br />I think it is very underrated because there are so many police/romance films- the initial impression is that it follows that well trodden path but the dialogue is v good, the story is good and the characters are great. <br /><br />The Al Pacino character in particular- he is a proper grown up complex person brought to life on screen- doesn't have all the answers, messed up a things but keeps plugging away.
