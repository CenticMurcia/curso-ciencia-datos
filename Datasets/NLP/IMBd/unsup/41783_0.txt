Well, I mean, just look at my name. I knew from the start that I was going to be a bit picky about this movie, considering I'm a huge Monkees fan. But still, I thought it was terrible! The only good thing about it was the casting, which I was pretty surprised with on accuracy. But otherwise... I didn't think it was a keeper. The dialogue didn't hold interest, the seemingly misplaced beginning sequence was utterly confusing, and there seemed to be so many things that the movie left out. But personally, I believe the very worst part of the whole movie was the ending. Several people disagree with me, but if you ask me, it's almost *too* happy. As many know, the Monkees didn't end Monkee-walking off into the horizon, and never truly became happy with their image. I can see why VH1 would want a happy ending, but I still felt it chopped the story off too quickly and differently than real life. If you're a serious Monkee fan, I suggest you do see this movie once, but probably just to see what you can find that's wrong with it...
