The cover picture, shown, isn't that of the 1983 film, as it shows a photo of Patricia Routledge, who played the role of 'Ruth', in a stage version, which was televised in 1980. Angela Lansbury played the same part, in the 1983 film. I understand, from people who have bought this DVD, or a similar version, in the same packaging, that it is a recording of a stage version, which features Kevin Kline, Patricia Routledge, et al, but isn't necessarily the official one. Also, it has Dutch subtitles. The quality isn't good; it's grainy, the colour is insipid and the sound is very low. It's quite probable that it has been recorded from an original NTSC video. I think that IMDb should check this item out, as there's clearly some sort of mix-up, here.
