"Sukiyaki Western Django" is pretty much what you would expect from a Western by Takashi Miike...it's violent, it's funny, and it's just plain weird at times.<br /><br />It looks kind of like the old west, except the buildings are distinctly Japanese. It feels kind of like the old west, except some characters are in cowboy garb while others are in what appears to be feudal Japanese American Indian gang war duds. And the dialog? "Don't you know your Shakespeare?" There are two feuding families, the White & the Red, and caught in between is our hero, whoever he is, and an old woman, her daughter, and a little boy. The daughter, having married outside of her clan, and the boy, of mixed background. The story itself is a bit hard to follow, but the action makes up for it.<br /><br />There's a lot of gun play, a lot of crossbow play, and a lot of fancy shooting from both weapons, along with things like hitting one's target through a hole just blown in one victim. And grandma, well, she's apparently a highly trained martial arts & gunslinger kind of gal, and she learned from the best, Ringo (Quentin Tarrentino) who also taught her how to make sukiyaki that wasn't so sweet.<br /><br />If you've seen all the old Spaghetti Westerns, this is a new twist on them that's well worth seeing. There's an astounding amount of wild and weird action, and there's also some ridiculous comedic bits, like a bunch of men using the sheriff of the town as a shield, and looking exactly like a conga line.<br /><br />Great action, interesting humor, and a decidedly different take on the western theme. Plus, the Japanese have a sense of poetry too, and there's even a bit of room in here for that, before the action kicks in again. If you like Miike & you like westerns that are QUITE a bit out of the ordinary, check this out. 8 out of 10.
