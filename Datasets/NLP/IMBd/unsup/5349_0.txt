...however, I will admit - I WAS warned. I've had the dubious pleasure of having watched several Hallmark movies in my time and I have to say there is a single common thread that seems to bind every one of them. They were absolute c***! Not only do these movies contain some of the worst acting known to man, but they excel in completely spoiling every plot and story they come across - be it good or bad. Of course, Mysterious Island is no exception!<br /><br />The sole exclusion is Patrick Stewart whose rendition of Nemo is tolerable at best. (I KNOW Patrick Stewart can do a lot better, but my guess is even HIS talents can't stand up to such a sub par plot.)<br /><br />The graphics were called more brilliant than those of "Jurassic Park" and "King Kong" by a reviewer which was the ONLY reason I decided to try watching this flick. Thanks A lot! There's 2,5 hours of my life wasted. How can ANYONE call a giant mouse with 'traction problems' (one of the most monumental graphical flaws I've ever seen!) good animation? Not to mention the tragic blending of the CG with the environment and actors...<br /><br />All in all, if you have 2,5 hours to waste and absolutely NO alternative form of entertainment you can watch this... but seriously you'd better be stranded on an Island with only a TV and a DVD-player and this single film for it to even be conceivably worth it.
