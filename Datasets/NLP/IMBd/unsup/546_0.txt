I have never really given much thought to underground civilizations and the like, but this movie definitely gets you thinking!<br /><br />It's a bit slow to getting off the ground, but stick with it, it's well worth the wait!<br /><br />I didn't think the movie would be so good from the beginning, in fact to be honest, there's quite a poor start to it, and I suspect many would switch off before it gets going. I remained open-minded. I think that the idea was very imaginative indeed, and my only complaint was the movie was over too quickly. Would have made a two and half hour movie, no problem. Still, the idea of any great movie, like any great book, is to leave you wanting more.<br /><br />However, it had a very satisfactory end.<br /><br />Don't miss this if you get the opportunity - a gem worth watching.
