"Pet Sematary 2" is a totally unnecessary sequel to the first "Pet Sematary",which has to be one of my favourite horror movies of all time.Instead of suspense it is loaded with gore and repulsive violence.The acting is pretty bad,the characters are one-dimensional and the film is completely idiotic in places(for example how our boys managed to carry the body of Gus through the quagmire?).If you're a gore-hound then you will be able to handle this little flick(there are better gorefests,though),but if you like scary horror movies avoid this trash like the plague.3 out of 10.
