It's a pity this sort of show gets canned so often! It doesn't matter if the Aussies like it cos it will get a bad time slot and probably already be canceled before it gets over here. What some people in Aus want to watch is not always the same as others! This show started screening in Aus from about 11 pm at night. i just happened to see the occasional episode of it. It was great! very much like the matrix but different enough to make it interesting.<br /><br />If they happened to put this show on with star gate it probably would have the an audience to support it because thats the sort of show it was. But i guess fox didn't want it so didn't even bother advertising it!
