I pretty much just saw this one, and it isn't much good. The plot sees annoying foul mouthed psycho Angelina on the run with her creepy, non speaking brother Norbert, and a crazed ventriloquists dummy called, imaginatively enough, Dummy. Its sort of a mockery of psycho family road films, with killing and supposed chuckles, but it lacks any gore and it isn't very funny. There are parts that should be funny, or could potentially be decently twisted, but the film is too weakly written to be funny and not well executed or demented enough (it never goes far enough) to shock. As the non speaking Norbert, Rocky Marqutte does an OK job, but all he has to do is not speak and look creepy, whilst Paydin LoPachin is just irritating as his sweary trollop sister. Katie Cochanas does OK as the girl they kidnap, but she has little to do in the way of acting either, and Bruce Weitz is semi amusing I guess, as the voice of Dummy. I thought the direction was OK, nice use of black and white, some OK shots and an overall suitable feel, and the soundtrack worked as well, a bit repetitive but it sorta suited the film. Unfortunately the nice ambiance couldn't really stop the film from being irritating and a bit tedious. Altogether, though I didn't hate this film as some have, I can't really recommend it, it tries hard but it just doesn't work, and its meagre bright spots and smattering of fun ideas don't really make it worthwhile. Definitely skippable, I'd say.
