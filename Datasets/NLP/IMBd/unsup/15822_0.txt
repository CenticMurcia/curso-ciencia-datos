Right, what to say about the "Drive in Massacre". Well, lets start with bad acting, on which we can go to poor direction and from that we can jump right to terrible soundtrack and we can even lace the whole thing with poorly done script. And that's what I can say about the movie.<br /><br />This is one of those b-films which feel like they don't go anywhere, and this certainly something that is accurate about this one. There's some murders in the drive in, yet nothing is done with them even tough the film supposedly revolves around solving the case, yet it really didn't feel like it. And the film even managed to feel too long.<br /><br />So avoid, if you can. It really wasn't even funny in a purely bad way..
