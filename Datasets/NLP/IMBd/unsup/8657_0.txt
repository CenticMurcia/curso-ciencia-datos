Released at the height of America's nuclear disaster paranoia, "Silkwood" is one of those blue-collar one-against-the-many films that revolve around simple folk fighting corporate power and abuse as best they know how. Meryl Streep plays Karen Silkwood, who unlikely and reluctantly becomes a spokeswoman against lax safety restrictions in place at the nuclear plant at which her and just about everybody else in her tiny town works. Since it's based on a true story, the movie ends the way Silkwood's life ended, and it ain't upbeat. But I found the whole movie to be morbidly fascinating, especially the details about how the plant treated those they suspected of radioactive contamination. Meryl Streep and Cher, who plays Silkwood's best friend, are phenomenal, and even Kurt Russell flexes his acting chops admirably. Mike Nichols might not seem like the obvious choice to direct a gritty, ugly movie like this, but he's able to make it feel authentic.<br /><br />A disturbing but rewarding experience.<br /><br />Grade: A
