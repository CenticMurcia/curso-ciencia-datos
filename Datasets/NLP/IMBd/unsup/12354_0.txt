this is one of the best time travel movies i have seen.it's vaguely similar to the Philadelphia Experiment but on a much larger scale.i also think it's a much better movie.for one thing,there's way more tension and suspense and you really can sense the fear and desperation of the ship's crew.this one will have you on the edge of your seat.the acting here is very strong all around.there's no weak link in the bunch.there no slow spots either.the movie flows at a nice steady pace,and keeps you interested right to the end.i'd highly recommend it as a rental at the very least.i purchased a copy which was more than worth it.for me,The Final Countdown is an 8.7/10
