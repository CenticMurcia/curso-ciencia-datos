I have seen this film and was expecting something quite good, but its the worst film I have seen in a long time, the acting is atrocious and wooden.<br /><br />It seems as if the film was made just for showing gore and forgetting the acting bit.<br /><br />Basically the storyline would have been good if they had picked decent actors and actresses, bringing it as an up to date story of Frankenstein.<br /><br />The blood and gore were over emphasised and didn't look real. Just a complete waste of time and money.
