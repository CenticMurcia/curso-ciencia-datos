Has anyone else noticed how the reporter, Curt Chaplin, is always putting his hands on people to align them with the camera? Why don't they put something on the floor to guide people to? And he says some things that are clearly geared to embarrassing to litigants, too. I hope people get paid enough for it to be worth it, and mean-spirited as you may think I am, I'd really like someone to slap Curt for "glomming" onto them with his hand. I think it is very inappropriate. I also think that Judge Milian has come to be a little bit too much like Judge Judy, haranguing people isn't what I want to see. Still, it's a great court TV show. Curt, if you ever read this, keep your hands off of strangers!
