What is up with WB canceling this show it was the bomb.I liked everything about it if anyone hears if anything has changed about this show please let me know I just watched the pilot on iTunes and you should have seen all the good reviews about Aquaman. W.B. is super retarded for canceling this show. I mean is there a reason at all for canceling this show I mean the story line is so good the actors was good everything about this series was good and they just dropped it it makes no sense to me at all somebody should say something to the company about restarting this series and do something else and maybe the will listen this makes me furious but please contact me at liljc1991@yahoo.com if anyone hears any changes about this show.
