Interesting from the viewpoint of seeing an early De Palma effort and also applauding his courage in making a film so critical of the Vietnam catastrophe, but the film lacks focus and ambles from one scene to another, lacking the incisiveness it needed to make its mark among the several really good anti-Vietnam War movies that came after.<br /><br />There's a sense of improv about the whole effort but much of the intended black humor vaporizes<br /><br />Worthwhile for students of film history and in particular the careers of De Palma and De Niro .One should be thankful that somehow they were encouraged to proceed with their careers. <br /><br />I don't remember reading any reviews at the time, but feel it coiuld have developed a cult following.
