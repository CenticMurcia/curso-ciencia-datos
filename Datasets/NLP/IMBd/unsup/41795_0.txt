OK I understand where everyone is coming from when saying this is incredibly cheesy. But I believe this give a great message to children. Though the violence may be rough but its meant for older children who I hope have learned your not supposed to hit someone with a sword. I also saw a few comments stating that the violence is unbiblical and ungodly. I disagree, being a Christain myself, I see the violence representing more of a spiritual battle rather than physical. Even if it is meant to be physical and I'm just mistaken it's not ungodly. King David in the Bible fought off many enemies, he even cut off a giants head. God also commanded the Isrealites to destroy nation and when they didn't kill everything in sight in the book of I Kings they were punished. I hope I've made my voice herd. You can knock this movie all you want but please don't knock God in the process.
