Overall i thought that this film was very good. Hopkin's character may have many similarities to his character Hannibal Lecter but all in all i found it enjoyable. It is a clever thriller which leaves you guessing till the end. You think Crawford's going to get away with it, which i wanted him to, until the last minutes of the film. This film might not be the greatest ever but it has something that makes you want to watch it again and again. Maybe its the chemistry between Crawford and Beachum. Whatever it is, it is there and it made me watch the film multiple times and it doesn't get boring. Anyone who hasn't seen it yet really should. It is worth a watch at the very least.
