Quite frankly I was really disappointed with this sequel, I mean the creators must of had a tight budget and sent the drawings off to some rain forest where baboons coloured the pictures in. The animation was terrible compared to the first, it looked cheap tacky and rather rubbish.<br /><br />This is the ultimate story with the return of a button down spy like psycho stalking room to room armed with an armour lite semi welded staff pumping spell after spell into colleague and co-worker. He was the person the Salton knew for years.... The story is the empire strikes back of all darkness, i love it,<br /><br />*********Jafar: "The universe is mine to command and CONTROL!!"***********<br /><br />I mean this guy has serious issues, possibly relating to his childhood. You see thats what you get for not hugging your kids!
