What can you say about Die Hard that hasn't been said a million times before? How about 'its crap'? Well, the reason why that hasn't been repeated ad nauseum is because it blatantly isn't true.<br /><br />Die Hard is one of those rare genre defining films. The first time I saw it I was 9 and was totally blown away. I have probably watched it once a year since then and I don't think its lost any impact.<br /><br />You know the drill by now. John McLane is out numbered (but never outgunned) by a group of terrorists in a high tech building. Cue much death and destruction before happy ending. It sounds so simple. Well, actually, it is. Die Hard perfected the formula of the action film, attempted by so many 80's films. Its actually a testament to Die Hard that they 'don't make em like they used to'.<br /><br />
