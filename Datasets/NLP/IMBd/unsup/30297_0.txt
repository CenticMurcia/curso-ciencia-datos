I received a DVD copy of Times Square for review and didn't expect much since I was not much of a fan of the whole punk rock scene when it came about. But I have to say that I really liked this film and Robin Johnson's manic, gutsy, authentic portrayal of Nicky to be best of it. Apparently there was a director's cut that was chopped up for release. Unfortunately the editing is one of the worst aspects of an otherwise good film. Continuity and exposition problems occur in the version I saw and I found from the commentary about the missing scenes that would have filled in the gaps. Despite some poor editing I still have to recommend the film, because of the performances and the gritty feel. Director Allen Moyle would go on to make Pump Up the Volume and I see the roots of that film in this one. I gave it an 8.
