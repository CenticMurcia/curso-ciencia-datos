I originally saw this on TV as a child and thought it was so incredibly sad. Recently, I had the opportunity to see it again and thought it was a bit campy, but it was the 1950s. Robert Stack's character is a bit of a selfish jerk, but, since it is the 50's, everyone knows he'll come around in the end. Lauren Bacall looked absolutely beautiful in this film. As for Evelyn Rudie, I thought she was the perfect old soul in a child's body. It's not such a bad film; it's really rather tender and sweet. Perfect, it isn't, but if you watch it for the simple enjoyment of a movie, it's pretty good. It's a 1/2 a hankie film, and great on a cold winter night, with some cocoa and popcorn.
