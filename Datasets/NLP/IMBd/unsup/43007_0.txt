John Carpenter hit big with: Big Trouble in Little China, Escape from New York, Assault on Precinct 13 and, of course, Halloween. So, when i saw the trailer 'John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars' on TV, i was so excited to see the film. In my mind, i was thinking about the action, horror and thrilling stuff. But i am SO MUCH disappointed about this movie! The cast aren't the better but not the most awful too. Also the story missed some big thrill, missed a sense and the end wasn't a surprise! Too much of flashback, some stupid scenes and they still have a lot of ammunition!<br /><br />John Carpenter messed up on this film. But i don't give up with him! He'll come back with a huge film and i will be in theater to enjoy. Well, i hope...<br /><br />John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars: 4/10.
