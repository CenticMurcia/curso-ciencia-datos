Normally the sight of carriages and bonnets on the screen has me heading for the nearest exit. To my surprise then, I found this to be a well-crafted and entertaining film.<br /><br />True some liberties were taken with the literary source (don't films always), and O'Connor wasn't quite strong enough for the lead role. However this was a film that dared to be different, and was even almost a cutting-edge costume drama.
