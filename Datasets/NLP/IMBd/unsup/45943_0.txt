How did Olivia Hussey get roped into this? For that matter, how did David Warner get roped into TWO roles!?<br /><br />Set SOMEWHERE in Europe during medieval times, it's a pastiche of unidentifiable movie genre. Its saving grace is the inspired casting of Richard Kind, thick New York accent and all, as a klutzy wizard - it's worth the price of admission (if you can find a copy!).<br /><br />This movie is simply much worse than it would have been with a coherent plot and intelligent dialogue. Does it border on being so bad that it's good? Yes!
