This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen in any genre. The acting is absolutely pathetic. Are the cops supposed to be clever? Or dim? We may never care. It's probably just bad acting. The story isn't much of a story to begin with. Guy slashes people in a drive in. And I never even understood who the killer was. The timing is completely off- so the director adds a long scene about a shoot out in a warehouse that has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual case. Directing- non existent. There are one or two interesting scenes but that is about it. The whole film has an air of shabbyness and dirtyness about it. You don't really care about anyone because no one is really interesting. One or two attempts at humour fail abysmally. And the soundtrack sounds like John Carpenter on a bad day- a really bad day.
