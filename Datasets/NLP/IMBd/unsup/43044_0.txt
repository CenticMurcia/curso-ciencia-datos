I wasnt sure what to expect before i watched conspiritors of pleasure except that it was a foreign film which almost always turn out to be sureal and this one did not dissapoint. The film is about a group of people who act out their sexual fantasies which involve things such as fish,bread,dummies and nails. They all are interlinked in some capacity through the film and all are completely bonkers. This was filmed in the Czech republic and the actors are czech. I does not shed them or their country in a very good light. The people come accross as being stark raving and the place looks a depressing as hell. As for the film , the only positive thing i can say is that it is different but that does not make the pain of watching it any better. The best way to describe the film is irritating. Who was working on the sound? a 3 year child? Nearly every movement or action was followed by an over exagerated sound. For an example when the man was glueing the feathers to the chicken's head it sounded like he was walking through a swamp every time he dabbed is brush! I'm sure there is a phsychiatrist somewhere that will tell you this film had a meaning to me it was just plain bad. 2 out of 10
