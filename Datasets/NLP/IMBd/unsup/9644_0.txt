I have to say I was surprised by how great the movie was. The artwork just blew me away, and I was trying to figure out if I could get in touch with the artist to do some illustrations for a book I'm writing. But I digress. The movie really impressed me. They went back to the roots on this one and did their magic with mood and acting as opposed to blasting the audience with monied tricks. It built tension the good old fashioned way, through people and their interactions (by far the most interesting in world).<br /><br />The movie pays attention to story, something that seems lost on Hollywood big budget productions this way. It's the reason film festivals are the place to go for people who love movies. I saw that Little Erin Merryweather won the Woods Hole Film festival, which is an up and coming festival. I can see why. I highly recommend it.
