Saw this at our local film festival. Feels very heavily influenced in terms of style and presentation by Britain's Trainspotting - the main protagonist haircut, cachetic physique, overdose scenes, etc. Still, the lead can give Ewan McGregor a run for his money in the acting department. Of course, the story is completely different from Trainspotting.<br /><br />Well constructed and developed story. One can feel the main character's escalating paranoid and eventual loss of control as circumstances and events got too big for him to handle. Was there really such a character in real life? Poor chap.
