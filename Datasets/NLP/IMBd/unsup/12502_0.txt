The Peoples Court is definitely the best of the TV court shows. Just to clarify a point, the Peoples Court started in 1981 with Judge Joseph Wapner, not with Ed Koch. The reason why this show is the best, is because this show is mostly about the law, not the theatrics of the Judge. In most of the other TV courtroom shows, the judge humiliates the litigants and the decisions are not based on law but based on the entertainment value of the decision. Not only is Marilyn Milian fair, but she treats the litigants with respect. She also explains in full detail why the judgement is made and also explains what type of paperwork and actions should have taken place and accompanied them. She will at times show her wit with the litigants, but without humiliating them.
