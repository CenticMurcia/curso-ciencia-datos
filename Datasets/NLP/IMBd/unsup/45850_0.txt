I saw this on TV and still somehow feel like I'm owed a monetary refund.<br /><br />Of course that may be in part because I'm a fan of the Rambo series and am offended by cheap knock-offs. Actually I'd like to see a Celebrity death match with Rambo and Braddock, though it wouldn't be much of a fight.<br /><br />And then there's good old Chuck Norris, who for some reason a few people find entertaining, but honestly, the greatest entertainment he gives me is the "Chuck Norris Facts".<br /><br />This film is pretty easy to laugh at though, but I don't think it was meant to be funny. If you don't believe me, just try not to bust a gut when you see the last frame of the movie.
