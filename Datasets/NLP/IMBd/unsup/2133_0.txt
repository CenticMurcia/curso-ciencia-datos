this movie, from Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Pictures, is a great achievement in animated movies. It tells a story of biblical proportions (literally!) about slave Mozes' life as The Prince of Egypt, and does it in a great way. The animation is truly stunning, especially the scenes when Mozes splits up the Red Sea, and when he turns the Nile into blood (which was really kind of scary). I can't really recommend the whole family (including 7-year old kids) to go see this, but if you're over 12 years old and you know something about the story of Mozes, you'll definitely appreciate this film. I give it a 9.
