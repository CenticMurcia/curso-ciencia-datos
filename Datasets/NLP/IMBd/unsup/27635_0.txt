This isn't a particularly great Tom and Jerry cartoon, but considering it was made during the absolute best period of animation from MGM (1941-1956), it still is a very, very good cartoon. Tom and Jerry are out West and Tom is apparently a very capable Cowcat (he really can't be a "comboy", can he?). He spends much of his time tormenting Jerry with his rope tricks until a cute female cat shows up (the same one that periodically shows up in their cartoons). So, Tom wants to impress her but ends up being outwitted by Jerry--who then tries to woo the girl cat (that's kind of weird, huh?). Once again, the cartoon has excellent production values and I have no major complaints other than the fact this wasn't a particularly memorable cartoon--just an average Tom and Jerry toon.
