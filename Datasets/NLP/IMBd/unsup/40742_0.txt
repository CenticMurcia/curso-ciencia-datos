Serial Slayer (2003) is a bad movie masquerading as a horror film. This movie is terrible. I have never seen such a blatant attempt to pad out a movie in a while. Scenes stretch out forever and at several points in the film, the pacing stops at a stand still. I don't know why Melanie Lynsky is in this movie, even she looks bored and unmotivated. The cast seems listless and bored. Just like the audience. Maybe this is a concept movie because by the time it was over I was waiting for a serial slayer to come and put me out of my misery.<br /><br />If you're going to make a low budget movie and shoot it on video, at least make it interesting (i.e. witty dialog, kinetically charged action set pieces, gore, good directing). Lame acting, listless directing and long drawn out scenes will get you nowhere.<br /><br />Toss another disc into the dust bin.<br /><br />It's a shame because Melanie Lynsky is a great actress and she deserves better film projects.
