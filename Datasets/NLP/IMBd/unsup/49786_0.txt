At first, I was all hyped up to see this film, mainly because I am a fan of Michelle Rodriguez. I have nothing bad to say about her, Taryn Manning on the other hand, well, let's just say that she must have had sex with all the right people to even have a career in show business because I just don't get it. What the hell is she doing here? The woman just plain sucks! With the exception of Michelle Rodriguez, this entire movie has the worst cast, the worst crew, and the dumbest story ever pulled out of a writer's butt! My advice: All fans of Michelle Rodriguez should watch this movie at home with the sound turned all the way down, because watching her is the only true enjoyment this dud of a movie has to offer, And That's All There Is Too It...
