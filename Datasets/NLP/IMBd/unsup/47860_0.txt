Well, I saw this movie was I was quite little... "family" they categorize it. HA! It made me cry and I made my dad turn it off! So I decided to give it another go some almost 20 years later... and its still one of the most disturbing animations I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few!). Its twisted and depressing, and deals with some rather adult issues (not sex or anything like that, just mature things like loss, death, and infinity) Nevertheless, it is an unusual film with interesting ideas and themes--definitely do NOT recommend for children. If you're looking for something really offbeat, this is it, just be prepared to feel uncomfortable while watching it.
