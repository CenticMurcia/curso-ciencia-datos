Let's start with the way this pile of garbage was shot-VIDEO. They didn't even use digital video or filmlook or anything. They didn't even attempt to make this horrible movie look like film. Second, I wasn't scared for a minute. My 7 year old watched it with me and SHE wasn't scared for a minute! ALL of the three stories sucked! Horrible acting and script. Even worse make up effects. They never showed any of the wounds being inflicted and the stage blood looked REALLY fake. I've seen "goosebumps" episodes that were scarier than this horrid home video footage. About the only good thing in the whole thing is at the end when the credits roll. No I'll take that back, The Misfits (a legendary punk rock group) were in it towards the very un-scary climactic ending. That's about the only good thing in this video. It's a wonder what the hell Jamie Lynn Sigler was doing in this thing when she's on THE SOPRANOS. Trust me, DO NOT RENT THIS GARBAGE OF A VIDEO! If you do, remember this: I TOLD YOU SO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
