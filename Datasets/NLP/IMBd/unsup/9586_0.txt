<br /><br />This piece of art just shocked me.Not by non-sense visual or sound effects,not by its hard,war scenes,not by its too-profound-to-be-understood psycho-socio-sexual comment ,but by its h u m a n i t y. Humanity...Just think about that.Have we all forgotten the sense of this word?In a world that depresses us into our little caves,in a period when no-one is safe and sure about the intentions of his/hers neighbour ,thoughts about giving LOVE and HAPPINESS to the people surrounding you,me,everyone are really really precious. I do not want to speak about the plot,this you have already read in other comments around.I only want to say one thing.If you believe that people can love and give,then just go see this movie right now.You deserve it!<br /><br />P.S:The soundtrack is just "parfait" as well...
