One would expect more from Yashraj films, but all Bunty aur babli is is an insult to your intelligence. it is classified as a comedy..but all that brings laughter is abhishek bachchan's dancing in kajra re. the plot is paper thin - the comic capers bring no comedy and are not interesting. the performances by the cast are disappointing. Rani mukherji has lost all her conviction and displays no sense of comic timing. abhishek gives oodles of evidence for his detractors to use. abmitabh bachchan is surprisingly unconvincing in his role as the detective. the only saving grace is aishwarya rai in "kajra re" and the hit soundtrack. the song picturisations do not impress and the chemistry between mukherji and bachchan is almost non-existent. avoid this rubbish at all costs!
