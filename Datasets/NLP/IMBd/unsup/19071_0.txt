A lot of ''serious'' film critics consider the ''New French Cinema''(with Luc Besson as the biggest exponent)as an artistic prostitution which destroys Godard's,Truffaut's and Rohmer's legacy.I have to say I appreciate a lot that kind of movies because they take the Hollywood's clichés and they give them ''new life''.In other words,films like Dobermann,La Femme Nikita and The Crimson Rivers take the typical clichés but,in the hands of talented directors and screenwriters,they take ''new life'' so the final result is something innovative.L'Empire des Loups is another example of what I just mentioned.This film adapts the North American clichés to the French style and the result is a very entertaining and interesting thriller with a lot of energy.Director Chris Nahon and his screenwriters(Nahon is also one of them)do not stop in giving too much explanations in this movie,so the spectator has to pay a lot of attention.And I really appreciated that as the best element from this movie.I'm tired of the Hollywood movies which explain everything thinking the spectator is stupid.Nahon and his screenwriters trust that the spectator will be enough intelligent for taking out conclusions.This film always keeps the suspense and there are some really unexpected revelations.The fail I found on this movie was that,near the ending of the film,there's an imbalance.I mean,this film has a mysterious noir style and near the ending,the film suddenly becomes in an action film with explosions,chases and shootings.That parts are fun and exciting for themselves but they seem like out of place.In spite of that,L'Empire des Loups is a very entertaining and tense thriller that I totally recommend.
