I don't know if I can convey in words exactly how wonderful this movie is. I was very lucky to see it at the 2007 Newport Beach Film Festival. And from the laugher and tears that the whole audience had, it was fantastic.<br /><br />The stories of all the characters were combined to tell a wonderful story. The story, the direction, the acting, the music, was above par for anything you usually see today.<br /><br />I was laughing so much at times my sides hurt. My eyes got wet at other times. And sometimes you just got an overwhelming since of happiness.<br /><br />When it was over, I turned to the girl setting next to me, and we both agreed we wanted to see it again, right then and there! And the whole audience started clapping.<br /><br />I surely hope to see this on the big screen, where I will drag all my co-workers and friends to. I have not stopped talking about it, and they are all now convinced to go see it, when it hits the big screens. And trust me, I'll be buying it when it comes out on DVD. It is one of those movies, that you can just watch time and time again.
