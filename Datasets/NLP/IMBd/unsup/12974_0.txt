I was able to guess the ending within the first half hour. This was just a very bad movie . The jokes were lame, the characters were not likable at all. The only welcome character in the movie was Vincent Pastore aka Big Pussy from Sopranos. Even the couple of scenes he was in could not save this movie. It was one of those movies where everything goes wrong. Like this has not been done to death . Very juvenile and watchable in the sense that you can not believe how bad a movie you are watching. Just when you think the movie can not get any worse it surprises and it does. In my opinion the best part of movie besides Mr. Pastores scenes were the clips that showed the Vegas strip or downtown Vegas.I did not expect much and thats exactly what I got. Kal Penn already has a slew of these movies with those White Castle flicks. I wonder if this guy has any acting range at all. Than again white castle burgers are small and evidently so is Kal Penns acting range. If you must watch this please watch it on cable already payed for.
