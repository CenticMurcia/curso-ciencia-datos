even that many people didn't like Madonna's message at her last tour, i think it's her pretty damn right to say what she wants! the only sad thing about this doc is, that they re-engineered her voice what shouldn't be. we all know that she has problems to keep the beautiful voice on stage. her original voice would better match to the re-invention title so she could show the world: i am proud of my voice doesn't matter that my voice is not always 100% perfect!!! this doc is not only be recommended for Madonna fans! i had the chance to see the TV version of it. and i must say the f***ing beeps made me crazy.. how stupid to just beep every f**k word i mean in that modern times but anyway will buy the original DVD without beeps hopefully
