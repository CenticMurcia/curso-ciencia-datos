The perfect complement to the current news stories about pedophile priests -Brian Cox as the sympathetic pederast!! Apparently, writer/director Michael Cuesta checked his moral compass at the bath house door. This story of a sexually confused youth, a cartoonishly awful father and assorted teenage dregs neither entertains or enlightens. Of course the cosmopolitan critics loved it! It's not provocative or challenging, just nauseating.
