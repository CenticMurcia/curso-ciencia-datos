I enjoyed watching Kolin Hanks in this movie. I found him quite convincing, what was not easy considering the lousy screenplay. Antonio Banderas was handsome as always. But those two could not help the rest of the movie. It was not funny, not romantic and very unnatural. The movie left me with impression that Meg acts with a thought in her mind "hey! I'm still here!". I believe she does not need this. She just needs to find a right project for her and she'd be great. The citations of "How to Steal a Million" (I believe this was the title of a wonderful movie with Odry Hepbern and Peter O'Toole), on my opinion, was too obvious and banal. I can't believe such good actors have agreed to participate in it.
