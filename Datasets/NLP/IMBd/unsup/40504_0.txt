This film is an attempt to mix an (American) Office style lead character with a watered down Woody Allen writing style. However, this attempt at dry and edgy fails due to uninspired writing and sub standard acting. It is closer to a feature length episode of 'Sex in the City', but somehow managing even less in the way of intuitive observations about relationships. <br /><br />I assume women will find this film ignorant and unrealistic and men will find this incredibly dull and unable to relate to any of the one dimensional male characters, so I'm not sure who will enjoy it (but what do I know about women since I'm just a man). What is most confusing is how none of the characters managed to endear themselves to me. This is similar to any other modern romantic comedy about the difficulty of relationships, but fails to make the viewer care if any of the people end up either alone, happy, sad or dead etc. I could be missing the point, and this might be intended as a hilarious roller-coaster of a film, and not anything to do with realistic characters, but if so, it is even further from the mark the mark than I thought. One major point that only deserves a few simple words: the lead character is absolutely terrible.<br /><br />The good points about this film are that the direction isn't that bad, Stamos is good, the pacing is fine and the plot had potential. This is not a horrible film, its just lacking in the most important areas that this sort of film needs to excel in to be good: believable comedy acting and precise writing. <br /><br />Avoid, but not like the plague, and instead 'When Harry Met Sally' or 'The Break Up' are much better films that do something similar to this film, but better.
