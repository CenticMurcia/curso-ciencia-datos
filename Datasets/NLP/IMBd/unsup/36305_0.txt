Before M. Night Shamaylan started making horribly inadequate movies after the superior "Sixth Sense" Tobe Hooper twenty years earlier was following up his cult masterpiece "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" with the dull and moronic "Eaten Alive". Neville Brand is Judd a mentally unstable owner of one of the most uninviting hotels on Earth. Why anyone of sound mind would want to stay here is beyond me. The soundstage it was filmed on doesn't help with its constant red horizon surrounding the place. None the less wary travelers attempt to brave the night there and are treated to being either skewered with a scythe, witch is a very inefficient murder weapon of choice personally, fed to Judd's pet crocodile or, just for the ladies, beaten and tied up. Why Judd does all this is never addressed as it seems everyone with a pulse draws his ire. I would assume that some of his guests had to live beforehand otherwise he wouldn't be in business very long. It is impossible to watch this without comparing this to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and realizing how woefully inept this is as a follow-up film. The scary thing about Leatherface is the fact that you can tell that this grotesque lifestyle is all he knows and will ever know. Judd comes off as a cranky old man very much in need of a nap. The cast is forgettable as Mel Ferrer stars in his first of two movies titled "Eaten Alive" and Robert Englund makes his film debut as Buck who like to fu......fornicate. I've had scarier nights at a Holiday Inn.
