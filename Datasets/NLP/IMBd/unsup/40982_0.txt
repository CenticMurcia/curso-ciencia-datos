This may be the single most boring "slasher" film of the 80s - containing an alarming lack of gore and nudity, the stuff that this genre survives on. Brad Pitt, in an early and obviously shameful role, plays the former best friend of a guy who spent five years in a mental institution, for the murder of his father, undergoing daily shock treatments. He is released into the general population (though obviously still unbalanced) and becomes the prime suspect in a series disappearances and murders among high school faculty and students. "Cutting Class" definitely wasn't Pitt's breakthrough role since this "horror" movie is littered with dull moments of teen drama and ridiculous, unfunny humor. Not a respectful launch into films, Brad! Not to mention every damn staff member of this particular school seems to weakly withhold perverse temptations among attractive female students, including Roddy McDowell as the creepy principal. Obviously, the body count should have been bigger and the deaths could have been a touch more elaborate (there are literally NO gore effects in this crap!). Terrible film!
