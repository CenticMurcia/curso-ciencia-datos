Why John Landis is still thought of as a great director is beyond me. He made a few good movies, "Animal House," "Coming to America," and one great one, "Trading Places," and a whole bunch of shlock in between and since. "Spies Like Us" is a great example of what's wrong with movies today. It probably looked good on paper, a director who was a proven commodity, an actor fresh off a hit movie (Akyroyd in "Ghostbusters") and another (Chase) considered bankable at least. Unfortunately both actors are in desperate need of a Bill Murray to act as straight man to all their smug mugging. John Landis as a director gets worse with every outing after peaking with "Trading Places" where Akyroyd's patented anal-retentiveness played well off Eddie Murphy's con-man charm. A better script might have helped, but probably not much. Chase would go on to appear in "Three Amigos," another Landis dud, furthering the career of neither.
