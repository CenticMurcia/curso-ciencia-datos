1st watched 4/19/2005 - 4 out of 10(Dir-John Schultz): Sappy formulaic story about an orphan who gets everything he wants and as well gets to be like Mike(Aka. Mister Michael Jordon) when he puts on his magic shoes(that may have been owned by a young MJ) and goes on the basketball court. What I didn't like about this movie was how the bad guys were "really" bad, the good guys were "really" good and everybody smiles up to the end about the poor unfortunate orphan who makes it. I'm not saying that this is a horrible movie but it just follows too many of the same patterns as others like it. The young rapper, Lil Bow Wow, does an OK job with this acting stint but the rest of the cast is kind of just there and playing characters that their used to playing. I really wanted to like this movie as much as I like the game of basketball but it just didn't quite cut it for me.
