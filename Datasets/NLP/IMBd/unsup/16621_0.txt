This movie was excellent. It's about a middle-aged, middle class single mother with two kids who unknowingly breaks the law. She is then arrested, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.<br /><br />She finds out about these stupid laws that can send you to prison even for just answering a phone call or driving someone somewhere. She appeals her case to courts for seven long years. She never gives up. She released from prison and has her sentence commuted.<br /><br />This law The War on Drugs, was made in the '80s. Although, it makes no sense it was passed. Currently they are trying to get these laws abolished.
