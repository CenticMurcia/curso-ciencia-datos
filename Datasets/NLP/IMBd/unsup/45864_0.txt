This is a movie about a Afghan woman seeking asylum in the US before 9/11. The story is about an allegedly brutal legal system that she must navigate to get asylum. In fact, what it shows is a that it is an efficient legal system which prevents abuses of our immigration system which immigrants often abuse to avoid national quotas. The movie has only one purpose and that is to gain sympathy for illegal immigrants. It is an extremely liberal propaganda movie.<br /><br />What the writers have done is take a true story which is atypical of the asylum process in which the Afghan woman is deserving of asylum but she is unable to satisfy the safeguards that have erected to prevent illegals from entering the country. She has no identification. She cannot prove who she is and cannot find anyone to vouch for her. For all the immigration officials know she could be a terrorist attempting to sneak into this country.<br /><br />In each decision the INS makes the right decision based on the facts before it.<br /><br />The Afghan woman, played superbly by Layla Alizada,gets representation by a pro-bono lawyer from a big law firm who mucks through the case. Unfortunately, the lawyer is played by Juliette Harris, who as usual does a miserable job of acting. She is a zany and serious acting is far beyond her capability.<br /><br />This is a movie for dummies and sob sisters. It's only redeeming value is the acting of Layla Alizada.
