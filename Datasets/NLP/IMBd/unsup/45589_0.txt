Another good idea ruined by the TV people. "Exo-Man" is the story of a college professor who is crippled by a spinal injury during a break-in (the bad guy whacks him across the back with a length of pipe). He uses his talents to build an exoskeleton (actually a suit) to enable himself to walk - and to avenge himself on the bad guys.<br /><br />The movie started out OK, but the special effects were poor for 1977 and the script was horrible.<br /><br />If this sounds familiar, the idea was handled a bit better in the short-lived series M.A.N.T.I.S.
