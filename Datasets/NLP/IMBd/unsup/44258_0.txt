The flies are buzzing around the corpse of the 'TMNT' franchise as it enters its third instalment. Writer/director Stuart Gillard is so desperate for something to fill his decrepit movie's 90 minutes that he sends the annoying, jerky-mouthed puppets back to a laughably unconvincing 17th century Japan and rips off 'Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure' while he's at it. Baddie Stuart Wilson seems to be doing an impression of Rik Mayall, but there's more life in his performance than Gillard's lazy direction can dredge up from the rest of the cast. The smiling dead kid and the Japanese woman with an American accent are just two of the inattentive touches in this blandly photographed, unfunny threequel, while Wilson's demise must rank amongst the worst visual effects ever committed to film.
