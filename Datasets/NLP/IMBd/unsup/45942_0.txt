How do studios give the ok for movies like this? I can make a better script on one sheet of paper. Let's cast an annoying kid and so so stars (David Warner and the guy from Spin City) and have a stupid story during the times of knights, but there will be no sword play in the movie, but there is gunplay. The only thing that made this movie watchable was the gal who traveled with the annoying kid and Leonardo. She was a very attractive lass, but her acting was as bad as everyone else.
