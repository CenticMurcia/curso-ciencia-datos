This show deserves to be a hit! It blends the best of reality with the best of comedy. Who knew Tori Spelling had this much talent??? The first time I saw the show, it was just for fun - to see just how bad it was going to be. I was shocked! I laughed out loud at the incredibly well crafted show and Tori's powerful self-deprecating humor. Loni Anderson is a delight, turning in performances that remind us why we fell in love with her years ago in WKRP in Cincinnati. <br /><br />Tori Spelling is showing far more talent and comic genius than anyone could have suspected. She has certainly won my respect. Though it has been reported they were estranged at the time of his death, I have no doubt her daddy is looking down from heaven and is mighty proud of his little princess. So am I.
