Backlash 2003 was all set around Goldberg and The Rock who had had recent brawls 3 weeks before this very PPV.<br /><br />The opening match featured Los Guerrero's looking to capture tag team gold against The Worlds Greatest Tag Team,it was a fantastic Tag Team Match and definitely one of the greatest matches of the night.<br /><br />The next contest featuring Sean O' Haire accompanied with Roddy Piper who had insulted O' Haires opponent Rikishi this was the worst match of the night only lasting 6 minutes with O'Haire using a death valley driver to pick up the impressive yet boring win.<br /><br />The next massive World Tag Team title match featured current champions Rob Van Dam and his partner Kane squaring off against The Dudley Boyz with the odds against RVD and Kane. This match was exciting all the way but not the best of the night.<br /><br />Now to the first title match for the Womens title featuring the Champion Trish Stratus and her opponent Jazz accompanied by Theodore Long.This was a one-on-one rematch from Wrestlemania,not so good though.<br /><br />The Next match featured the much smaller Rey Mysterio facing off against the MUCH larger Big Show,the match quickly took it's pace.Around 4 minutes after the match started it was Big Show who stepped out the winner, after the match was the worst bit Big Show carried a helpless Mysterio who at the time was on a stretcher was slammed straight into the ring post.<br /><br />The next 6 Man Tag Match featured 6 former World Champions the first team of Booker T, Shawn Michaels and Kevin Nash against team 2 Triple H,Ric Flair and Chris Jericho.The match quickly took action as all 6 superstars got involved as fast as they could at the end Triple H (shockingly) pinned Kevin Nash after a pedigree.<br /><br />The last title match of the night featured 2 major rivals going head to head, it was the WWE Champion Brock Lesnar putting his gold on the line against the challenger John Cena.The match went on for around 25 minutes until Brock Lesnar hit the F5 to get the win and retain his covenant title.<br /><br />The main event featured 2 of the most intense superstars to ever set foot in the WWE ring The Rock and his all power opponent.....GOLDBERG!!!! This highly anticipated match took to the action quickly but around 25 minutes later Goldberg hit 2 spears to pick up the win and his WWE debut match.
