While I appreciate the possibility of a zombie film from the zombies' perspective, this is not a skillful execution of that good idea. This is a remarkably anti-female movie. From the opening of a man shooting his girlfriend twice to the continued use of "faggot," "bitch," and other ridiculously disempowering words, this is a piece of garbage. The female characters are either weak (the woman who won't let go of the boyfriend who shot and killed her, then continues to hunt and hurt her after she's dead) or absurdly strong (the character that refers to men needing to grow a pair, prove their manliness by killing, etc). There is much to much gender normative and heterosexism in this movie for it to be any good. The main take aways from this movie are that 1.females are weak. 2. men can and should rule females. 3. women are universally cruel or weak.<br /><br />Terrible.
