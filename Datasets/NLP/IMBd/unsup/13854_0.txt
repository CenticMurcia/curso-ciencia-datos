I am shocked at some of the comments posted here. To me it seems like we have become so jaded as a society that a simple, funny musical that you need a drop of education about is consigned to the trash heap of history.<br /><br />The 1950's was a great time in history, change was on the horizon, and the Cold War hung over everyone's head. The problem is that the change agents of the 1960's decided to destroy the past instead of improve on it. So a simple play that had good satire and music in it became not intense, or sexy, or socially relevant enough for the avant-garde tastes of modern times.<br /><br />It's a funny musical, no more than that, and it aspires to nothing else. enjoy it for what it is, good wholesome fun.
