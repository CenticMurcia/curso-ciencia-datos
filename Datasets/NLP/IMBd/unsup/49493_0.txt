In the commentary it said they filmed this movie in 11 days and it's so bad, it might have been filmed in less. If you have seen the trailer, you've seen everything there is to see about this movie, unless you really want to see the poorly done soft porn scenes. I'm quite serious, the trailer sums up the entire movie without any of the lackluster filler, one is left to drudge through. The move jumps around from one pointless poorly shot scene full of characters one doesn't care about to the next feeling rushed and without focus. Neve is sexy, but I wasn't feeling the "She's the hottest thing on planet Earth" vibe they were trying to get across by showing everyone panting after her like dogs in heat, it just came across as fake. The character of Ford is idiotic tired re-tread, which made me want to skip his half of the movie. Also, I really don't think anyone in real life in the "count's" position would have done what he did in the last part. If it wanted to show a certain sect of New York as vapid, obnoxious, boring and pointless people without even any real explanation of how they became so, then I guess the film succeeded. I think this is the first movie I've ever regretted watching. The film is not erotic or thrilling.<br /><br />*VAGUE SPOILERS*<br /><br />The only really watchable scene, was the scene of her with the count. The dialogue and acting during this scene stepped up a notch. Her scene with her female lover might have been better if there had been a history and some character development there. This movie was a total disappointment, not even worth watching to fall asleep.
