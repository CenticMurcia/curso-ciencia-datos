Of the four short films featured here, the best acting was in the second film entitled "O Beautiful" by Alan Brown, with David Clayton Rogers and Jay Gillespie actors. This film deals with gay bashing and gay teens. A contemporary issue like gay bashing is a subject matter that some would rather not face and will undoubtedly have a bias against this film prior to viewing it, due to the subject matter. "O Beautiful" a complicated high drama poignantly and accurately portrays gay male teenage angst, which is very traumatic and difficult to deal with especially when occurring right after the barbarous heinous act of a gay bashing.<br /><br />Bravo Alan, David, and Jay! This short should be extended into a full-length film and shown in high schools around the country.
