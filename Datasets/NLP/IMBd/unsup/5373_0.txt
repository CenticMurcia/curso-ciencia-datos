**Possible Spoilers** Requiem is probably my personal favorite season finale. Unsure if the production would continue for more seasons, this finale was written in such a way that it could act as the series finale. Facing financial cuts of the department, Mulder and Scully are obligated to go back to square one 7 years from the beginning of the X-Files, to Oregon. Running into familiar faces strange things pick up with a double twist in both their parts. The last 5 minutes are worth the entire list price for the season set. Mark Snow's score for this stands out beautifully and Scully's last words are also worth the time (and money) spent watching every episode from the season one to this instant from start to finish.
