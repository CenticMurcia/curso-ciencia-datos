If I was the cinematographer who worked on this film, I'd be severely depressed. All of that good work in making a colorful, light, and playful world lost in complete ineptitude from everyone else who worked on this movie.<br /><br />The story is actually a good one, despite clich√©s. A young girl (9 years) named Ociee Nash from Mississippi is turning out to be something of a tomboy, which her father worries about because of her lack of a mother (died from measles). He sends her to her prim and proper Tennessee aunt, and along the way she has a cheery and profound effect on everyone she meets, including the Wright brothers and the President of the United States, among others.<br /><br />It's based on a book, and something tells me that book is probably really good. This movie, however, loses everything that was given to it, literally given to it, by being incredibly flat and mispaced. The dramatic effect from the shots is completely lost, the acting is terrible (yeah yeah, I know they're kids... they were still terrible), and it's almost insulting to try to watch an hour and a half of their strained, horrible accents. 1898 Ociee Nash sounds like a California Valley Girl, the adult actors literally sound like they refuse to even try, and it looks like the editor took whichever the first shot they finished was and just threw it together, cutting only sufficiently enough to look like it was planned.<br /><br />Whereas I give this only one star out of then, it earns that one star for its try and its pretty pictures. It wasn't a total loss, but it was a great one.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
