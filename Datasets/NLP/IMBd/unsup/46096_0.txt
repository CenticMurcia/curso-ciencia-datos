Some people still can't believe that anyone expects great acting, etcetera, from low-budget films, and shouldn't criticize anything without a big budget. However..."The Blair Witch Project" (though I'm no fan) was low-budget yet has become a cult phenomenon. "The Red Violin" had no big budget, yet was critically acclaimed. In "The Quest For the Lost City," (a.k.a. "The Final Sacrifice") a kid conveniently stumbles upon a map of some sort that is a key to a "lost city." A cult of guys in ski masks, led by Satoris--decked in a trench coat, suit, and tie while riding around in rusty GMC trucks--want the map and run after the kid. But he finds the company of a drunken loser who helps him fend off the cult, save the day, and restore a "lost city" made of cardboard. This film is feverishly written and features cheezy performances. The only good thing about "The Final Sacrifice" (noted so many times, it is now a cliche`) is that it was humorously torn apart by our trusty friends at "Mystery Science Theater 3000."
