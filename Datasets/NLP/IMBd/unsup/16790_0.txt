Well Soldier Kelly is out and back working as a detective (we have to use our imagination to figure out how)for the first 10 minutes at least. Then of course he is on suspension again and working with an ex-biker PI to bring justice to a raped college student. He gets in the most unbelievable situations but always seems to make you believe them. This time he has a real love interest and she broadens the character nicely. Like us she falls for his line every time but circumstances are beginning to make her question her ability to stay involved with him. Great martial arts scenes(one where he is out matched)and the tongue in cheek humor these movies are noted for. There is only one problem with this movie.Sadly, it was the last.
