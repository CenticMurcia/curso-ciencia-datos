I can't believe some reviewers find this film plausible. Admittedly the book is little better. In fact the plot is nutty. Consider just three points: (a) Medieval churches at the centre of English villages are Anglican, not Roman Catholic, (b) How come the village only has 15 inhabitants? and (c) Why do the British military people continue to drive the fake Churchill to the manor house even when they know there are German paratroopers in the village? Many reviewers have pointed out other ludicrous aspects.<br /><br />The early part of the film also goes way over the top in its laboured efforts to show us that Michael Caine and co are non-Nazi, honourable Germans. (In the event, so honourable that Caine is prepared to shoot Churchill in cold blood, even though he realises that Hitler's regime is evil and the war is lost.) How assassinating Churchill is meant to help matters is more than obscure. Could anybody really think it would lead the Allies to drop the demand for Germany's unconditional surrender and go for a negotiated peace instead? <br /><br />Hokum, pure sloppily constructed hokum.
