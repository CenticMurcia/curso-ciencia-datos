A group of road tripping teens are caught in a car accident while being attacked by an unexpected swarm of insects--right off the bat showing just how much sense this movie makes. They wake up in an academy with run by a cult of dead students who intend to make the teens "one of them". The plot is unbelievably stale with no-talent actors presenting us with some grade-A no-talent acting. The movie has that unsatisfying, cheap digital look that, when combined with the horrible acting and the lousy plot, make the film look like a failed attempt for a high-school project. I must admit though, that the eye puncturing scene was the highlight of the film. There are several other lame death scenes such as a man falling in a wood chipper and a sword through the neck which are.... well, sucky. I must warn you to stay away from this movie, for it is not worthy of being viewed. Crap crap crap!
