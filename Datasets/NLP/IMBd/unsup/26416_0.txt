This movie is hilarious. Although it does have a little bit of cumbersome acting and it obviously didn't have much of a budget, it is a solidly funny movie with some great characters. I loved it the first and only time I saw it years ago on HBO or Showtime of something like that and I laughed my ass off. I spent 5 years as a Graphic Designer and found myself remembering it constantly, with the phrase "Aaaaaadvertising" going through my head with a smile. The only thing is that I can't seem to find it anywhere to buy. Netflix doesn't even have it and they have, like, everything. Before reading the stats on it, I was sure it was a small time Canadian film that only made it to pay cable. At any rate, if anyone knows where I can find this little movie on DVD it would be very helpful. Otherwise, if you haven't seen it and get a chance to, DO check it out. Besedes possibly being one of your only chances to catch it, it's very fun.
