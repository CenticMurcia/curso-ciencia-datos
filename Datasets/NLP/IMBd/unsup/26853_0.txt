"Praise" broadens my appreciation of Australian film and Australians. It is a fascinating departure from the well explored Australian themes of brusque humor and drinking gags. Australians have feelings too. Who knew? The realism of the film is gritty and smells genuine. The story's core is profoundly basic and human. The camera work is wonderful. Fenton and Horler have faces and bodies that are treated like landscapes, initially jarring for their distinctive and atypical attributes and eventually becoming familiar elements of the story itself. Brilliant realism. The supporting cast contributes wonderfully. It is a diverse collection of characters, some outstanding and others quite gray. I will have to see this film again. I know it will bring another enhanced experience. For now, however, it has left me full and still digesting.
