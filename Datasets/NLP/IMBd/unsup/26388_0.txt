As with previous Gibson helmed movies the visuals are stunning. However, where this movie falls short is in 2 very important departments, plot and originality.<br /><br />I won't spoil the plot (or lack thereof) but if you've seen the trailer you've seen the first hour of the movie. After that it becomes as dull and predictable as watching paint dry. You know whats going to happen long before it does, and when it does, it looks good, but it's still not very fulfilling.<br /><br />The hype overstates the violence, which really isn't that graphic nor prolific and what there is fits within the story, nothing is gratuitous, neither does it do anything for the plot.<br /><br />To sum it up, this is a glorified chase movie, unfortunately the chase doesn't begin until over an hour in and even then you know exactly how it will end.<br /><br />If you enjoy cinematography then this is a treat. If you prefer some form of action, plot or meaning to your movies, I suggest you avoid.
