One reason I enjoyed (and still enjoy) Robot Chicken is because it is so damn nostalgic, among other reasons. I thought it pulled both the obvious adult humor and just plain stupid humor, both which I enjoy (and relate too??!!). Anyways, its skits mimic that of MADTv, but more to the point, and more of an open ability to do what ever you want and can humanly do (IE; plastic vs people). The characters in this 'animation' are created primarily from plastic, allowing for an almost 'toy look', which especially reins in when a skit reflects that of a prior toy. Other skits don't touch on much of anything...well to do with anything, humor at that point becomes more personal then ever, as for myself, even those times where I don't quite understand the humor in that specific skit, I can understand what they are trying to relate too which further solidifies their attempt to connect to all audiences in some personal way. Cheers to Seth Green and Matthew Senreich, they know what type of humor some people enjoy and bring it to them non-stop during their brief twelve-minute segment.
