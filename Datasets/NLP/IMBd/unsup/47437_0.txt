Not a particularly auspicious entry in the Philo Vance series. Warren Williams simply does not match the acting of William Powell who had the lead in four of these films, including the excellent Kennel Murder Case. The storyline revolves around guests at a mansion and the deaths of the fianc√©e Montague and perhaps others in the vicinity of the "dragon pool." Mrs. Stamm, the matron of the house warns that a water dragon that has guarded the lives and fortunes of the Stamm family inhabits the pool. Montague was not worthy of joining the family. How a dragon would have ever been in the pool is simply ignored. Shots of swimming in the pool remind one of the Creature From the Black Lagoon. Eugene Pallette is excellent as the detective who is always remarking how his knowledge of criminology leads him to suspect... Etienne Girardot is excellent as the coroner as is Helen Lowell as grandmother Stamm. Love triangle does not lend much to the plot. Much discussion of fish in tanks that does not appear to serve any purpose - although they are interesting to view, especially through the tanks suspended from the ceiling. Perhaps one of them was supposed to evolve into the dragon. Orry-Kelly costumes on Margaret Lindsay. Not recommended.
