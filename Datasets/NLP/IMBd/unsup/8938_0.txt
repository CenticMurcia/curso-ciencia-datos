Clutch is a former boxer who lives in an apartment on Mulberry Street in New York.With his friend Coco they eagerly await for Clutch's daughter Casey to return home from Iraq.We also meet the other tenants in this dilapidated complex Charlie and Frank who are a couple of old timers and a bartender Kay and her teenage son.Unfortunately their place of living becomes hell,when New Yorkers mysteriously turn into bloodthirsty rat creatures."Mulberry Street" is a pleasant surprise.It plays like the cross between "28 Days Later","Feast" and Spanish horror hit "Rec".Mickle uses quick shots,music video style editing and plenty of gore to make a surprisingly memorable and decent horror film.The action is fast paced and the creatures look creepy.8 out of 10.
