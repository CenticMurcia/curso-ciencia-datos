Hellgate started off looking quite promising with an easy-to-follow plot. Three young people are reading stories about a girl who was killed, and her father brings her back to life using a crystal. The story starts to get confusing at this point. It involves the group visiting Hellgate, where the re-animated girl seduces men for her father to kill. I fell asleep at some point during the film (not something I usually do) and woke up near the end. The ending actually wasn't too bad, but nothing to wet yourself over. <br /><br />The scene where the fish grows and bursts out of its tank, and when the tortoise becomes a monster are cool. Watch this if you collect 80's horror films, but be warned: it has nothing going for it and is extremely dull.
