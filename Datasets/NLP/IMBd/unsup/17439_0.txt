I'm an old horror buff. I've seen some of the more notorious stuff around (Salo, Cannibal Holocaust, Caligula,...), but they all more or less about visceral horror.<br /><br />Which doesn't work if you helped slaughter a few pigs.<br /><br />What does work? Psychological horror. Impending doom you cannot prevent. Things you can't see or understand, but that are there right in front of your face. Music that shouldn't be scary, but which lingers anyway.<br /><br />It's a typical, slow moving J-Horror with an atypical idea behind it. That oblivion is actually preferable than immortality. <br /><br />Gore doesn't scare me - but some ideas do. <br /><br />Like i said - it made me squirm... One of the best horror movies ever made - for the patient ones.
