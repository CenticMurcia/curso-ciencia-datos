I've lost a great deal of respect for Robin Williams after seeing this movie. The only thing that saves the movie from a 1/10 is that there were points where Robin Williams and Mandy Moore were off-screen, leaving John Krasinski to do a decent job in their absence.<br /><br />The movie is not only poorly written, but watching it is frustrating. The characters are written as a bunch of self-centered fools that seem oblivious to the reality around them. <br /><br />Rev. Frank's character comes off as a psychopath. Even the child "pastor in training" that accompanies him the entire movie is unbelievably creepy. <br /><br />The plot feels like a Sunday school lesson taken to a morbid extreme. Frank spouts out-dated marriage concepts throughout the movie and subjects the couples in his charge to near-abusive activities. On top of this, Frank pokes fun at one of his pupil's gay parents and seems to delight in embarrassing, harassing and stalking Ben. If he was intentionally trying to come off as a seems-normal-but-secretly-unhinged pastor, I could have handled it. He's handled that role well in previous movies. Instead, I feel like I'm watching Fred Phelps.<br /><br />Mr. Williams, please clear these half-baked comedies off your schedule. You are far, far better than this. I'd rather see you retire than flush the rest of your career down the tubes.
