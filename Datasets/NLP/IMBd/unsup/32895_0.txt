Four bodies are found in New York City. Is there a coincidence? Well, they all died 48 hours after logging into the site FEARDOTCOM.COM....yes, it's feardotcom.COM<br /><br />Sounds like the ring eh, well it is and it isn't, because with the Ring, you get more into the reasoning behind the video tape, in this movie you have some guy filming himself killing people, then people die from their worst fear after going to feardotcom....sorry feardotcom.com. This film falls into the category of "RIPOFF".<br /><br />After seeing the opening scene I know that this movie would be average at best....I was wrong, it was below average. If you have a choice of this or the ring...make the smarter one, and see the ring. Or better yet, go and see Ringu, it's atmosphere and creep factor outshine both of these films. Notice I'm talking about other films, other then FEATDOTCOM, that's how bad it is.<br /><br />Let's judge the similarities shall we? <br /><br />People die after seeing web-site. <br /><br />People die after seeing a video.<br /><br />The lead female discovers a dead body in the water. <br /><br />The lead female discovers a dead body in the water.<br /><br />The dead body is from a little girl that people see before they die.<br /><br />The dead body is from a little girl that people see before they die.<br /><br />After they're dead, they have a terrified look on their face. <br /><br />After they're dead, they have a terrified look on their face. <br /><br />Should I tell you which scenario is from which movie...does it really matter?<br /><br />At least Dorff entertained me for a little while, but please kill everyone else in the damn movie. Even the great Combs was underused and abused.<br /><br />"I think your perfect for the lead role, come with me" <br /><br />"well, I don't know you, and you look kinda freaky, but what the hell, I'll go with you and tell no one, and surely sign my death warrant" <br /><br />Well, maybe that last bit wasn't in the movie but it might as well should have been.<br /><br />PLEASE!!! This movie is really really terrible, I can't stress this enough. I found myself trying really hard to like it, and ended up hating it even more and who the hell at the age of 5 plays at a STEEL MILL??? Let alone a blonde girl with a white ball. The script and directing in this movie really brings it down because it has no idea what's it's doing. It seemed like they watched the Ring and decided to bring it into the new generation of viewers and make it the internet. It has nothing going for it, besides the cool looking box-art, which we see once or twice in the movie.
