The Trouble with Harry, is that he's dead. However this isn't the true problem because nobody seems to care for Harry in particular. What they care about is who did it and how best to deal with it so that nobody gets caught. This involves burying and digging up, re-burying and re-digging up Harry several times. The simplicity of the comedy is perfect. I have always been a Hitchcock fan, but this film is like a breath of fresh air. It shows that their is a fine line between dramatic and comedic movies. This movie is very dark in content yet because there is very little character development the viewer doesn't identify with the plight of the character and the absence of Hitchcock's signature suspense music allows a viewer to laugh at the awkward situation and the ridiculous actions of the characters rather than worry about what terrible outcome could come from them. A delight and if he had been so inclined this film is proof that Hitchcock could have gone into the comedic genre if he had so desired.
