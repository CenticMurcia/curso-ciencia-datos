This film is so intellectual, charming and sentimental. I was in the right place and in the right time when I've seen it. 2 Days in Paris projected my current relationship situation on the screen. It's like a vicious cycle that we fall in love, we have a fight, and then we break up, but we return to in love again in a short period, and so forth. This is a permanent stupidity of mankind. (Anyway, I still hunger to watch Scenes from a Marriage (1973, Ingmar Bergman)) <br /><br />There were two scenes almost break my heart. First, the couples argued about "Can someone be friend with his or her ex?" Double conflicts suddenly emerged in my mind because I always think like Marion (She usually befriended with her ex) but what I have really done is like Jack (He can't do this to his ex.) Another heart-breaking scene is in the edge of the film, Marion and Jack have a big fight and they're nearly climbing to "break-up point". The voice-over (Marion's) in this scene is like those words which run through my head in every thought, every moment for the whole week. Finally, I cried but I don't know anymore, which one I cry forÂ…Marion? Jack? or me? <br /><br />I feel like the ending made a little flaw to the film, but it's still acceptable for me.
