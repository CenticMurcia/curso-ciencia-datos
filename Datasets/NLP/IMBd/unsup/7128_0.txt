The paramedics David Vaughn (Johnny Messner) and Victor (Jon Huertas) receive an emergency call from the girl Libby (Saige Ryan Campbell) in a remote gas station. While trying to save her mother Deborah (Elizabeth Godush), they are abducted by members of the sect Quanta Group, composed by scientists, philosophers and mathematicians that foresee the end of the world after a meteor shower. Their leader The Teacher (Daniel Benzali) converts Vic to his cult, but the reluctant David resists and faces a weird mystery.<br /><br />"Believers" is an above average B-movie with a very intriguing story, but also flawed since there are some points that are not well-explained or developed. The greatest flaw is the lack of a reasonable explanation why David and Vic are kidnapped in the gas station. It would be certainly easier to leave the paramedics inside the firemen's ambulance on the road, the same way they did with their boss. How Deborah was resurrected and how The Teachers knew personal details of the lives of David and Vic is open, but may be well explained with the fire in the sky in the last scene meaning that The Teacher was really a powerful entity. I understand that the formula was the deadly gas, but it is not clear. I am a fan of original and low-budget movies, and in the end I liked this refreshing story. The direction and the acting are great, and I believe there are some unfair reviews in IMDb, probably from users that like commercial and easy to understand movies. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "FÃ³rmula Fatal" ("Fatal Formula")
