After just watching a few minutes of this movie.. they did the usual non indians playing Navajo people. Portraying the Navajo Police as blue jean wearing police force is not correct. This was not researched or set in the proper place. Yuma, where the Las Vegas cop was to be met is over 6 hours from Window Rock, AZ. Window Rock AZ is in the Northwestern part of the state... The Navajo Police wear badges not name tags.<br /><br />I have taken this back to Hastings and demanded refund of the rental fee of fifty two cents.<br /><br />Would have been nice if they filmed NEAR THE REZ.
