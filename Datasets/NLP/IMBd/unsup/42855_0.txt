Sounded interesting, plausible idea, but sadly lacked any merit of an actual Star Wars 'fill in'. You can clearly see that a bunch of star wars conventionists have joined forces to create this farcical 50 minute long drivel. The only thing it has going for it is the CGI, which is on par with the sort of CGI you would expect to see in a PC game dialogue, between levels. The acting is the worst I've seen on the small screen, throw in a few wooden chairs and the film wouldn't have suffered in the least. It was as if the main characters were reading off the Biro marks on the back of their hands with emoticons telling them what sort of expression to pull "Thats. the. bounty. on. my. head. trippled" *Grimmace* Its like a porn style acting but without the porn.. although Cade looks like he should be in one.<br /><br />You cannot warm to any characters in the film, the Emperor looks like he's piled on the pounds after taking over the galaxy, and glued some green weetabix to his eyebrows in his megalomaniac rage. Taryn Anwar's characters about as believable as Jar Jar Bink's becoming an intellectual and winning some sort of Nobel prize in literature "mesa do doo doo on your head!" Declan looks like he should run a video store on Alderan, knowing off heart all the movies in store of by heart, and have the universes largest collection of Gungan comic books. Cade apart from looking like a failed porn-star could out-scowl the most miffed of people. And finally, Zhanna's got some scary chin issues. Even though its free, its still a waste of 50 minutes of your life, So save your bandwidth and avoid this fanfic. If curiosity is still getting the better of you, watch the first 5 minutes and you'll know what I'm talking about.
