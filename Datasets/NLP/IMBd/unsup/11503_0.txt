We're introduced to Quinn Mallory in this pilot for the TV series. He produces a way to slide between infinite alternate worlds, and invites his professor Arturo and co-worker Wade to slide with him on his test run. He makes the power a tad too high and ends up sucking Rembrendt Jones, a singer known as 'the crying man'. They all find themselves in a world where the Commies won the cold war (after a brief slide to a world where a second ice age took over and must find a way back. This was a good, if not excellent start to a good if not excellent series and it suffers from the same problem that would plaque the rest of the series: Being entertaining, but not particularly well researched.<br /><br />My Grade: B-
