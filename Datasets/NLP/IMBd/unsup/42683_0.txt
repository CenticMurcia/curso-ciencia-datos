I normally don't post a comment, because normally it all has been said pretty much. I was so unmoved by the squall that I felt moved to add my two rings worth.. The beginning of the movie starts out to look promising. The middle(longest part by a long shot)is so incredibly lacking in feel and scare factor, I was bored to death. The third part almost started feeling like they were going to leave us with a heart ripping adventure in to Samaras world. Only to be another boring, uninspired, and barely scary rendition of a scare movie. One part that should have brought a jump and a scare made me laugh and shake my head and say to myself, the scare is gone. Such a bummer this film was so poor. The first film was truly scary, and kept you on the edge of your seat, and when the end came it ripped you out of your seat. The Ring 2 makes you want to get out of your seat and leave. Too Bad..
