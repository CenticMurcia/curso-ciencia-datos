I just stumbled across this little gem on an on-line movie web-site and all I can say is WOW! It's been a while since I've seen a film done this well and how refreshing considering the garbage that they consider films nowadays. The acting outstanding, especially the boys, cast wonderful, plot awesome...it has everything and to top that, the heroes are kids. A great adventure for the whole family...adults and kids alike... it's got everything you'd want in a great story, lots of riveting action, drama, a little comedy and lessons to be learned about true friendship, loyalty and courage. The movie was REAL.. I found myself rooting for the two young heroes immediately and readily drawn into their adventure and wondering all the time what was going to happen next as in any good story and at the credits, I wanted to stand up and cheer...great work guys...this one is a WINNER!
