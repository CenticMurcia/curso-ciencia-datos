I hadnt heard of this film at all before i went to see it, so had no preconceptions as to what to expect. Fortunately I was not disappointed - from the initial club scenes right to the very end I was drawn in by the skillful pacing of the script, and the excellent acting by the young cast. Rather than throwing mountains of computer graphics at us, which seems to be the case in most modern horror, the director has allowed us to use our imagination, and also throws enough twists at us to keep us guessing as to the identity of the killer.<br /><br />A film in which there is always something happening, the tension is built up again and again, leaving this viewer on the edge of his seat throughout.<br /><br />An excellent film and the first in many years to actually deserve the title of 'horror movie'
