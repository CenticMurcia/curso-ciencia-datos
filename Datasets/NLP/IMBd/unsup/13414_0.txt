I can't say that Primitif is the worst film in the cannibal genre, because White Cannibal Queen takes the cake, but I can say that it is following the same path. Primitif may be one of the most ridiculous and dull films I have ever seen. This film goes past the "So bad its good" factor, and dives strait into a pile of crap. What makes it even worse it that he creator of this films couldn't even think of original ideas for it. Scenes form such films as Jungle Holocaust and Mountain of the Cannibal God are re-enacted and placed into the heap.<br /><br />We fallow a group of characters that look like they were just pulled out of a Scooby-Doo movie and placed in the jungle. They are doing a study of primitive tribes, and hire guide to take them deep into the jungle. They soon come across and tribe, but find them to "not be primitive enough" and pay their guide to take them deeper into the jungle. They soon are traveling down river, and as you can guess, they crash into some rocks and separate.<br /><br />They are eventually captured by some of the "real natives" that they were looking for and are "abused and tortured" in acts that look like a tropical island party, with having them crawl under peoples lags, and playing piggy back with the native children.<br /><br />As was mentioned before, several scenes in this film were just re-enactments of scenes from previous cannibal films. One seen that I found extremely ridiculous was that they re-enacted the rape scene is Mountain of the Cannibal God, but the actress in the film refused to do a nude scene so she is just humped for a few min with her clothes on.<br /><br />This film tried desperately to be one of the next jungle gore feasts, but just turned into a heaping pile of boredom. I do not suggest this film unless you are a hardcore cannibal fan, or collector of rare films.
