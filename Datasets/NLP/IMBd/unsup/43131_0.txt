Barely watchable, possibly one of the worst films ever made. To the director I would say: get a real job.<br /><br />It's not even funny bad like some old or dated cult flicks, it's just truly awful. Poorly crafted, derivative, unoriginal, amateurishly produced. Also borrows liberally from SBS TV's Pizza. If you are going to appropriate ideas, why not at least rip off something good?<br /><br />I've seen first year film student projects that are far better than this waste of space.<br /><br />One of the worst films I've ever seen by far.<br /><br />You can watch the whole thing on YouTube, but I bet you won't sit through the first minute.
