OK, I have never given a movie a 2, but I will now. I have seen some bad movies, but have rated them higher than this. Fact is that the other movies didn't hide what they were, and you knew what you were going to see. This movie however, from the previews, made you think you were going to see a chick flick,.... a romantic comedy. Not until you are in there watching, do you have a clue that you are actually going to see a dark comedy. A dark romantic comedy..... The bad thing is, this movie didn't really do any aspect of "dark", "romantic", or "comedy" very good at all. I will admit, the idea or a romantic spoof of "A Christmas Carol" is a good idea. And it probably would have worked as a plain old romantic comedy. However what we get here is a ton of crude humor, that actually isn't funny.... just crude. We also get characters that we don't care about. And due to the way this movie was made,... we never care about. There is also no real romance here either. Granted towards the end, they try to put the romance and the sweetness back into the film. But the truth be told,... by this point we don't care. And no matter what our main character has learned by this point, we still don't like him.<br /><br />I don't want to go on about this movie. If you feel that you want to see this anyways. Do yourself a favor and rent it when it comes out, at Redbox for $1.
