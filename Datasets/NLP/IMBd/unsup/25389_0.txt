First off this movie is supposed to be a compelling adventure about a few brave men protecting endangered antelopes from poachers. <br /><br />What they don't tell you is, in the course of shooting this movie they are actually shooting real antelope. Granted these aren't the "endangered" animals they are protecting in the plot but a similar antelope breed with fake antlers glued to it. With 6 views of antelopes being killed consistently and bleeding out made it hard for me to believe there message.<br /><br />Hypocritical doesn't begin to summarize this movie. If I was you I wouldn't waste my time or money.<br /><br />I mean real antelopes being killed in a movie about stopping people from killing them? These writers should feel ashamed.
