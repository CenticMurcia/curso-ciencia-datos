I remember always looking thru the horror sections of severel video store here in melb and seeing the palace video cover of this and thinkin na this looks crap but i then saw the trailer on another horror video and was sold this is an hidden gem i mean if your got john saxon and john morghen in the same movie it has to be good.Check out the region 1 dvd of this with the great doco with interviews with saxon and morghen and antonio margeretti.***1/2 out of 4.
