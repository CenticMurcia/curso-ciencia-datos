I was really looking forward to this. Yes another remake but it's a fabulous story and possibly the greatest detective story ever. It started off mighty fine too, Nettles was superb throughout and although the Watson seemed a little young I grew to like him. I also liked seeing Holmes get the needles out as it's a part so little told on the screen. My first misgivings were at the archaeological dig. As far as I remember in the book Grant's character was a butterfly collector. Then things started going wrong big time when there was a party at Baskerville Hall, mmm this never happened. Oh well I am all for changing stories for the better for screen but this wasn't the case in my opinion. And without giving the end away, what the hell was going on - awful ! And no phosforous (spelling?) on the dog ! Anyway a big thumbs down from me. One to watch once and once only. A superb cast, good acting on the whole and excellently filmed but ruined by a rewrite of a perfect story. Oh and why the Ivor the engine train scene with St.Paul's in the background :)
