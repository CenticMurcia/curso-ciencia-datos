Dances with Wolves (1990), Thunderheart (1992), and Last of the Dogmen (1995), are all movies that made me proud to have been "captured" by the native American spirit when I was born in 1957.<br /><br />No, I am not 1/4 Cheyenne or Cherokee, nor would I ever want to be one of the multitude who claims to be one of them, just because it is fashionable. There are many other Nations that belong to and depend on Mother Earth as a people. I can't speak for them, however, I have ridden horses in Hell's Canyon, have seen elk, deer, big horn sheep, cougars and coyote in my backyard, and they all live in harmony w/ my cocker spaniel.<br /><br />Me, well I am 1/4 French, 1/16 Lakota Sioux, and 1/16 Nez Perce, yet 100% American Purebred Mutt.<br /><br />My ancestors fought in the revolutionary war, and eventually pioneered Washington, the Evergreen State. Bill Gates and Micro$oft may claim it now, but not before I became a WSU graduate, a Washington Apple, a "User Friendly" Macintosh. If I could "roll up the carpet", Micro$oft, WallMart and McDonald's would be the first to go under.<br /><br />They've made the majority of us all lazy and beyond fat, so yes, if there was such a place... I'd go...
