<br /><br /> The reviews had been ravissants. A man in his seventies makes a short film (under fifteen hours) in the French language, a man who was the vrais thing in France and a totem among cinephiles...so we went, as we are Francophiles (and have seen hundreds of French films here and abroad in the last decade) and are ever hopeful (despite towers tumbling, poison powder letters, and Jacques Chirac still in power)that the human imagination and a film budget will lift us. Can I please briefly say that the highlight of this exposition was the vintage Mercedes that had been (so we learned after the show) driven in reverse by an aged Lady from somewhere on the southern coastal region of California, over a barrier, shearing shrubs, and landing inches from the facade of the Edwards cinema which ran the film? Gasoline spilling, the fire department on their way, et cetera. May I? Thank you. As to the film, a 16th century play in contemporary skins. A nice derriere moving from the camera. A blonde with more bum than part, a male lead who was wonderful but could not rise above the silliness. J'adore les films francais. Mais il arrive un point... Silly and about two and a half hours from previews to end, hers excluded.
