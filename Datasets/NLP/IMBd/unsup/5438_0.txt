This kind of exorcism movie makes you realize that anything else than "The Exorcist (1973)" is a crap, not just for the story or the acting, but for the ambiance of the film. Nothing compares to the old 70s horror movies.<br /><br />"The Exorcist" makes any other movie look like a bad remake of it and causes disgust in the eye of the viewer.<br /><br />About Gail's exorcism is nothing much to say. Maybe the fact that she looks to be aware of being possessed and enjoys it every second. She's more like a drunk slut exposing herself to males during blackouts and wakes then up in embarrassment.<br /><br />When possessed Regan MacNeil exposed herself in "The Exorcist" it was anything but attractive, sexy or even obscene. It was probably the most scary part of the movie. I can't remember to have been scared by Gail Bowers putting her hand in her panties.<br /><br />3 out of 10 for the pantie scene.
