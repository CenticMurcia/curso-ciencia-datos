I saw this at the Waterfront Film Festival in Saugatuck, Michigan.<br /><br />Interesting documentary about people that make a career out of being movie extras. It followed ten people around and showed how they handle being another face in the movie crowd. I really enjoyed this film because I'm interested in going into the film business and it would be fun to be an extra in at least one film.<br /><br />It was great seeing how dedicated some of these people are. The documentary covered many of the basics about being an extra. How to get cast in a film, how to dress, how to act around the big stars, and many other things. I also loved how they showed the film clips and pointed out where the stars of the documentary were.<br /><br />This movie will be really helpful to anyone that wants to travel out west and go into the movies.
