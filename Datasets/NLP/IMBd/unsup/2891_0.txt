"The Garage" shows life as it as. The cast talked to each other rather than at each other. The viewer felt that the cast was just as interested in what the other characters in this film had to say as the audience was. This movie wasn't like many of todays' movies are, where the cast just recites lines. The writing resembled Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, it depicted real people in real situations.It showed life as it is, not as many want life to be. Carl Thibault, as the writer and director has raised the bar for future low budget and independent movies. The directing couldn't have been better. There wasn't an unbelievable scene in this movie.The movie flowed just as real life flows,with good and bad times. I personally thought Mr. Thibault was an older gentleman, with more years of personal life experience to draw upon, as he was able to depict in his writing and directing, more realism then most big name writers and directors with "Major credits" show in their movies. The cinematography was also very good, watching the movie one didn't feel that they were in a movie theater, but in the scene with the characters; which is where the cinematography in a movie should take its' audience, but often doesn't. "The Garage" is worthy of a major release, and Mr. Carl Thibault has proved to be deserving of attention by the film industry powers that be, as both a writer and director. I'd give this movie a higher rating but one should always feel that there is room for improvement.
