As a huge fan of the original Indiana Jones movies, I must admit that I did not take to liking the young Indiana Jones Chronicles when i first watched them at the age of 7. I saw them again for the first time since then around two years ago and i have been hooked ever since. I found these stories and tales of Jones as a young man fascinating and extremely enjoyable to behold. The way important characters in history such as Hemingway and even Al Capone are integrated into the plot as the young Indy finds himself in ever more exiting and elaborate situations should be enough to grab the attention of any self respecting Indy fan. Sean Pattrick Flannery did an amazing job as Indy and the many 'future stars' that played important roles in the ever changing plots showed the strength and distinction of these pieces of genius. I was saddened to find out that these mini-films were made over a decade ago and prey that some day, Harrison Ford and Sean Pattrick Flannery may be brought together again (as they did in the Chicago episode) and have another go at yet another piece of the Jones saga, before yet another unfamiliar actor is brought upon to don the cowboy hat once again. LONG LIVE INDY!!!
