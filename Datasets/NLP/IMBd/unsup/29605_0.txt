I have the greatest memories of this show. I agree that it was way before its time. I was 13 when the show aired. It used to come on in my area just after the 11:00 news. I used to stay up to watch it, although my parents set a 10:00 bedtime for me because I had to catch a 6:30 bus to school each morning. To avoid the obvious "scheduling conflict," I would place a towel at the bottom of my door to keep the television's light from spilling into to the hallway. I also used to tack a huge beach towel over my window each night, just in case my parents happened to have to go out at night! I watched the show on an old 13" television. The front of the set was equipped with a jack for an earpiece (not a headphone set, but a single earpiece!). I swiped my brother's earpiece from his transistor radio and used it to listen to the show. I remember laughing into my pillow so that no one would hear me! It never bothered me once to have to go to these lengths to watch the show. I never even gave it a second thought! The mornings were tough, but I was always sure to get up without having to be told because I didn't want my parents asking why I was so tired. It was a small price to pay!<br /><br />I would LOVE to have the complete set of DVDs for this show! Is there any indication that one will ever released?
