Alright, I'll be honest about it, It scared the hell out of me, Why? Because of crap like this, Hollywood is getting a bad name. How in gods name can one make something like this for an actual Hollywood release???<br /><br />The school movies we used to make with a simple video-camera were even better. <br /><br />The story is stupid, it's the return of the undead-movie number billion, but with shitty completion. The actors, hahahahahaha...I'm sorry, thats mean, I mean the amateurs that had roles in this movie obviously haven't been in or considered acting school before accepting parts. You know at one point I thought I saw the price label still hanging on one of the zombie masks, it looked like it was 12 dollars.<br /><br />With a little editing, it could go for a comedy. In a way it is horror, I mean, it's shocking to see what kind of junk makes it to Hollywood. <br /><br />Avoid at all costs, unless you're really really really drunk.
