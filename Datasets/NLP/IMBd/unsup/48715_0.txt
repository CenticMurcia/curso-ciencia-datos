1st watched 5/25/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Peter Hall): Well-intentioned attempt at silly Shakespeare play with some good acting, makeup, and set design, but a muddled mess of a movie. I guess even the masters can make dud's and this sure is one. The central purpose or theme seems to be that human love can last but only with help from a group of god-like fairies who are able to move love from one person to another with the sprinkling of flowers while the human's sleep. What follows is love hopping from one person(or beast) to another but it all gets fixed in the end and the lovers live happily ever after despite their past nights worries due to the constant change in couples. A big piece of fluff from such a serious playwright as Shakespeare just doesn't seem to work and despite some good performances this version I thnk will be forgotten eventually.
