Sankofa is a film that every American should see (no matter what one's ancestry), as it portrays slavery and the middle passage more frankly than any other film to date.<br /><br />The music is brilliant, and the film is beautiful despite the ugliness of slavery. Never have I been moved as much as when I watch this film.<br /><br />Symbolism is rampant throughout this should-be masterpiece... from the importance of color red to the element of flight, the representations made subliminally as well as those made in the forefront are incredible. Because of this, one can view the film several times, and still not see everything it has to offer.<br /><br />I've shown this film in my ENG 101 courses dozens of times. It's that important.<br /><br />Go see it. Now.
