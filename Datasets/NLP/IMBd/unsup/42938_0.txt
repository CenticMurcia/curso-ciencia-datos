But seriously Folks...There were a couple of brief comedic moments, but in general, this was a waste of talent and cellulose. Oscar, someone said? Maybe for the cinematography, but this movie is right up there with Ishtar on my bottom feeder list. Go paint the kitchen, or wash the garage for more stimulation than you will get watching this overwrought piece of cow-pie. That's the extent of emotion that I experienced watching this accident leaving the scene. I kept wishing I had learned how to darn socks for fun and profit when I was younger, so I might have accomplished something constructive while viewing this moo-vie. I did give the movie a good solid 3, but more out of sympathy than anything else.
