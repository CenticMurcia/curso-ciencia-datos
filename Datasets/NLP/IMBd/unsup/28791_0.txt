tell you the truth i don't really know where to start with this 'movie'. i don't know what's worst, the ridiculous acting that makes me wanna cry, the silly so called 'special effects', the worst directing job i've ever seen or the dialogue that made me get the bucket in the middle of the movie.<br /><br />i always thought of rutger hauer movies rather 'campy', but this one's so poor poor poor it's not even worth the tape it was recorded into, and it doesn't even make you laugh with it's poorness, it's just that poor.<br /><br />the only good thing about this movie was it's length, i couldn't have taken another minute of it.<br /><br />there's a better rutger hauer/joan chen movie that proves they CAN act,<br /><br />it's called blood of heroes, watch that instead.
