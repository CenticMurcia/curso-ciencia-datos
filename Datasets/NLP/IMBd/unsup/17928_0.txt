I was amused by American reviews of the "Brat-2".<br /><br />Americans were taken by surprise: how dare those Russians to make a film that depicts Americans as evil gangsters? How dare Danila to shoot Americans? This is not politically correct! It was clearly assumed that Russians are always the bad guys, whose only role in any film is cannon fodder to be shot by American Rambo.<br /><br />Now "Brat-2" arrives, uncovering the horrifying truth: the bad guys are Americans! And it is OK to shoot them.<br /><br />After years of Hollywood films depicting Russians as bad asses (no single Hollywood film showing Russians at least from a neutral point of view), the Russian cinema finally strikes back.<br /><br />This movie delivered a long-awaited entertainment for Russian viewers.<br /><br />It also proved complete lack of sense of humor of American viewers.
