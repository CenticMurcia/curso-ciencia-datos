I enjoyed this movie very much. I got this movie thinking that it would be great just to watch for the scenery. It was.<br /><br />What I was not expecting was the great intellectual content this movie offered.<br /><br />I think you will like it if you enjoy ancient history, especially Greek history. At times it will seem SO MUNDANE and nearly boring, but persevere - it all comes together wonderfully at the end and will leave you thinking.<br /><br />I, too, thought the movie was going off course, no pun intended, for a bit. Everything in the movie is there for a reason.<br /><br />This is a thinking person's movie though. If you don't like history and politics and ancient civilization, you may not like it...however, if you really LOVE these things, then this is one you shouldn't miss.<br /><br />I think the director is brilliant. There's a scene where the ship is seen from a distance, and its midday and it looks so washed out. Then I realized, that is JUST what things look like midday. Its just so mundane, and that is what will eventually strike you hard at the end if you just keep an open mind until you get there. Its worth it.
