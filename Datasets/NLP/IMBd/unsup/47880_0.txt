Being English I watched this film expecting to see one of the best Englsh films in history, but I was wrong. It was so boring I couldn't stick through it to the end. <br /><br />I think this film really shows Its age,the humour is very old fashioned and couldn't really get it, and as for Micheal Caine's acting it isn't as good as everyone says. <br /><br />I preferred the remake which wasn't the best film in the word, but its a better film than this, the action scene's are better executed maybe because it was made 30 odd years after its predecessor, and the way action sequence's are more doable with CGI and other advances in film making. <br /><br />maybe seeing the remake first clouded my judgement a little even so its still crap, over all my rating is 1 out 10 and that is purely cause there is no Zero score.
