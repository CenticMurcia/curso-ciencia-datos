What an impressive film debut for Carter Smith. Based on a short story by Steven Treleaven about a high school loner who is attracted to a mysterious new comer. He follows him to a remote farm with chilling results. This is a scary movie and ominous metaphor for the dangers of sexual experimentation.<br /><br />Smith works wonders in creating foreboding and eroticism in the possibilities of the dark of night. The production values and acting are all uniformly excellent. Carter Smith has a real talent and is to be looked forward to in his upcoming projects. It makes perfect sense that he is developing a screenplay with cult writer, Dennis Cooper. This is no J.T. Leroy, Carter Smith is the genuine thing and in the best of horror, He reminds me too of H.P. Lovecraft, and the best short fiction of Stephen King and the noir-ish writings of Black Cat magazine.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what he does next.
