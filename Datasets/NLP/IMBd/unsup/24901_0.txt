Almost an Old Dark House movie. On the qualifying side, it's a mystery, it has four murders, comic elements, a very serious thunderstorm, stranded motorists, people hiding in the shadows, & a big old dark boarding house. Close enough, I would say, but I didn't see any secret passageways & the film was made a bit late (1945) to qualify. Good dialog, intelligently written for its type, & most (but not all) of the acting is competent. George Zucco is especially good as the owner of the boarding house. 1940s Frankenstein fans, & Gunsmoke (TV) fans will greatly enjoy Glenn Strange's comic role as Zucco's assistant; he's funny & gets to do a little slapstick! Overall, quite an enjoyable film if you like this sort of thing (I do). It's hard to find this one, but it's worth looking for. I rate it 8/10.
