How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days was the perfect Valentine's Day flick to check out. It was better than your average chick flick and topped common titles: Sweet Home Alabama and Maid in Manhattan. How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days was more of a comedy than a romance. It lacked the "mushy-wushy" and was funnier than I imagined it would be. I was laughing out loud during some lines in the theatre and Kate Hudson performed remarkably. Matthew McConnaghey also did well and was just as excellent in The Wedding Planner (with Jennifer Lopez). Therefore, How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days isn't just another chick flick.
