I was on the last hundred pages of 'Lucy Sullivan' and had decided to put the book down - make it last. Then the thought popped into my head "There's a DVD set you can watch, just read it!". So i finished the book that night, really happy and excited about renting out the TV Adaption the next day.<br /><br />Now i wish I'd savored the book, and not wasted my $10 on this crap. Not even Gerard Butler could save it. This is the worst thing i have watched since, and probably before, Gigli. The Characters are completely altered, none of the changes are positive. Too much detail is paid to things that are pointless and/or dull. The acting is awful and the entire feeling of the show leaves you empty.<br /><br />Do not bother. It's an insult to all things Keys!
