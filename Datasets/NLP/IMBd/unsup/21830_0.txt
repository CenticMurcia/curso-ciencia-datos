This movie rings false from beginning to end. There is not one character in the film who resembles a human being. As such, it's impossible to care about what happens. Many of the scenes simply do not make any sense. (A scene in which Ray Allan pulls a gun is both idiotic and offensive.) The classroom scenes are unintentional parodies of philosophy; the idea of a philosophy professor walking around campus arm-in-arm with one her undergraduates is absurd. The acting is bad; and not even bad in a unified way. Each actor is allowed to flounder in his or her own way. After the screening I saw, Toback answered questions. He said that he's bored at most movies, and always wants things to speed up. Perhaps his problem is that he lacks an ear for subtlety. The scenes are (mercifully) short; but they achieve this by taking the most direct (and least interesting) route to conveying information or message.
