OK, so they try to make this like an actual real world show and then it goes Movie on us and sucks. Too bad it wasn't real, because I'd love to watch the Liz character be hot for a whole season. I really don't want to say more than this, but IMDB makes us write four lines. This show totally didn't deserve it.
