All of the characters had a back history. I could see the cause and effect (why the characters were the way they were) in the film. The actors were believable. Each time I watch it (at least twice a week), I see something new. "Jason's Lyric" has inspired me to get on the bus and stop watching it go past. The symbolism in the movie was refreshing. The cinematography was excellent as well, every part of the film enhanced the whole. "Jason" gave me hope that a man can commit in a relationship; he just has to want to do it. He made me dream again of lovely words and warm embraces. "Lyric" assured me that closing up was not the answer but trying to love again is the way to get the magic back....
