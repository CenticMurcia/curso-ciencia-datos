Where to start? This movie is crap. I didn't watch the whole thing but I saw enough to know that this movie makes most low budget films look like masterpieces, OK maybe that is a bit too harsh.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a helicopter flyover that looks like its from the 60's. As it goes on it looks it may have been made in the late 70's or early 80's. But that isn't the worst part.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is simply horrible. Some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The guys wife sees her scientific base blow up and just stays there with a stupid look on her face.<br /><br />Another annoying thing about the movie is its crappy audio that makes the movie look like it was 50% dubbed.There's nothing quite like the refreshingly annoying and destructing movie with dubbed audio that makes you second guess every actors voice.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the choreography. Just take a moment to ponder the wonderful choreography that was in such TV shows as Batman (1960's). Now take even more uncoordinated actors and doubles and add slow motion. That kinda sums up how crappy the fight scenes are.<br /><br />This movie is almost unbearable. Go see it or rent it on DVD (why in the hell would they release it on DVD anyways) if you want to torture yourself or someone you love.
