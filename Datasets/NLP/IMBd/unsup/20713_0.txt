I just got back from the movie not more then 30 minutes ago and I am still in a mood I have not felt since I don't know when.. It was so passionate, exciting, real... Paul Reiser did a excellent job as he always has in this movie.. And I am so happy to see Bruce Willis in movies that show his real talent.. Michelle Pfieffer was amazingly wonderful in the roll of Katie. I don't know how this movie can not be nominated for a Academy Award, let alone win it.. I am looking forward to see this movie over and over again..<br /><br />I truly don't think 10 Stars is high enough for this one..
