This film really is painful to watch. The heroine is a really irritating bitchy college student who constantly pushes her two "best friends" into the line of danger. At some point, this porcupine personality girl meets one of the CIA agents who is hunting her down and they become instant pals and the CIA agent immediately turns against his boss, especially since Ms. Porcupine is the most abrasive leading lady short of Martina Navritolova. The CIA is after Ms. Porcupine and her pals because she and her two friends broke into some Roswell type of secret lab where the Spider was gestating inside a dying Astronaut. The philosophy of this movie is such trash that it is offensive. At one point they find some mummified Astronauts from space missions that were never publicized, and the implication is that the US routinely kills its own Astronauts and puts them into storage. While the X-Files may have covered this ground in a somewhat tactful manner, this film presents its ideas so crudely that it is hard not to gag. Most of it is just totally ripped off from X-Files episodes. The FX are pretty good, which just goes to show how far FX have gone that even a third rate crud movie could put some good FX in. Nothing special, just OK. The ending is total trash nonsense, watch in amazement as Ms. Porcupine literally becomes Rambo versus a Giant Spider. Needless to say, when the entire top of a building blows up, you can expect that Ms. Porcupine did not even get singed even though she was standing about a foot away from the Giant Spider. Let's not even mention the helicopter action, which looked like it was done by an amateur pilot hand-holding a camera and shooting the movie through the windshield of the helicopter. Whatever happened to William Shatner and the Kingdom of Spiders??
