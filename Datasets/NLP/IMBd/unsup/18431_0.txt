The novel is the archetypal bodice ripper but the Fortunes and Misfortunes of Moll Flanders is far more than that. It is a well constructed, well acted, well directed period drama of the type the British TV Industry does so well.<br /><br />Alex Kingston is exceptional in the title roll, her defection to the States from the UK is a real loss and the cast list is like a who's who of British TV. Particularly good is Diana Rigg.<br /><br />All in all my words cannot really do it justice, if you get the opportunity to see it then please do. It is really well worth it.
