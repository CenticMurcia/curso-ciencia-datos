Ok, so the characters were funny in small sketches the Harry Enfield and Chums TV series, but they certainly don't deserve their own movie. It's basically a "How many erection gags can you fit into 100 minutes?" This film should never have been shown at the cinema. It is what the phrase "TV Movie" is for. It's a shame that the British Film industry, which has produced some of the best independent films in recent years, also produces the odd turkey. Save your money - it will probably be shown on BBC1 soon - which is where it should have been shown originally.
