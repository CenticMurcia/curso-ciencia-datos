"From the master of suspense, John Carpenter, comes a chilling new version of the sci-fi classic. Something is terribly wrong in the tiny village of Midwich. After an unseen force invades a quiet coastal town, ten women mysteriously find themselves pregnant. Local physician Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) and government scientist Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) join forces when the women simultaneously give birth," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis, "and the reign of terror begins." <br /><br />Mr. Carpenter doesn't evoke either the other "master of suspense" (Alfred Hitchcock), or even Wolf Rilla; although, he does include examples of his own abilities to startle. Still, this is a curious and uninspired re-make. About the only thing that works is some added characterization for "David" (Thomas Dekker) and the feminization given "Mara" (Lindsey Haun). The original "Village of the Damned" (1960) is the one to see; return to this film for the curiosity, an embarrassed cast, and a few laughs.<br /><br />*** Village of the Damned (4/28/95) John Carpenter ~ Christopher Reeve, Linda Kozlowski, Kirstie Alley, Thomas Dekker
