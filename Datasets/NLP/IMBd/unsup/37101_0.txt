The original 'Village' from 1960 is a wonderful, eerie slice of British sci-fi. This utter nonsense starring superman does not deserve the credit of being seen. Go and rent the original, remove any preconceptions you may have about old movies, put yourself in the mindset of a cinema goer from 1960 and revel in the quiet charm and ultimately chilling experience that this film delivers. Or you could read the book by John Wyndham 'The Midwich Cuckoos', in fact do anything other than watch this contender for 'Worst Remake Ever'. At least IMDb voters seem to agree - 7.5 for the Brits, 5.3 for the Yanks - this time go with public opinion!
