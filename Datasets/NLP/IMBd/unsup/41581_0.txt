Yeah, OK, this may be deliberately cheesy but it's all pretty lousy, and not in a good way. We have a brave "bone hunter" in search of Dinosaur Valley but all the poor guy can find is bad action/adventure movie clich√©s, like people sinking in quicksand, nude natives, plane crashes, Viet Nam vets, and knock-down drag out fights in piranha infested waters while bleeding. I hope this was intended as a parody because if it wasn't it succeeded pretty well, unintentionally, anyway. There are a couple of nice ladies to look at but beyond that it's all pretty far fetched stuff that manages to be somewhat entertaining but wears thin after a while. There's a bit of cannibal & head-hunter stuff, a bit of lesbian stuff, but the rest is pretty much by-the-numbers action adventure stuff and I'm actually truly sorry I wasted my time on this. Not a fine example of 80's film making & certainly not what I'd refer to as a horror film.....3 out of 10.
