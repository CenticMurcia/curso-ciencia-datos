If you really like bizarre, different style stuff, you'll enjoy this film. It has laughs all the way through, with only a few breaks to give everyone watching a chance to redeem themselves and cool off from the humor. To be honest, I think its unwanted silence to cater to character/story buildup, which may or may not really be needed. The film is in your face, strange, hard to categorize.<br /><br />While the story line is nothing Oscar worthy, the dialog and acting keep this film moving at a brisk pace. Tom Kennedy, plays an everyman who hates his life, job, and girlfriend but has no idea what to do about it, a Falling Down of sorts, with a Johnny Knoxville twist. His sidekick(s), Art, played by Alex Harz, brings some comical Rain Man or even Sling Blade behavior into the mix, while the blowup doll, Nancy, takes on the weird role of Dr. Ruth combined with Jonbenet Ramsey and the good old wholesome girl next door. Weird, definitely unique! The supporting cast represents an eclectic and entertaining blend of character actors spanning all race and age brackets.<br /><br />Its not the best movie ever, but easily one of the most different, unique flicks I've ever seen. Rating: 4/5
