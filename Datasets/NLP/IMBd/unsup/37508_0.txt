I've always hated Campion films. They're overrated and tedious beyond belief. This is no exception. She takes an interesting premiss and a talented actress, and makes an awful film. <br /><br />It's attempts at humour were awful. The supporting cast were pointless and dumb beyond belief. No sexual chemistry existed between the leads. And what is it with Keitel, everytime he either strips or acts or Campion he's awful. It's only saving grace is that it's not as bad as "The Avengers".
