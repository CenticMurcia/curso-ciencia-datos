This movie was so dumb I actually walked out of it. I got bored, and kept wondering why the editing was so bad. There was no smooth segway between scenes, it was like *poof* we are here *poof* now here. Ugh The dialog also made no sense for most of it. I don't mean to knock what must have taken forever to make, but jeez. I guess I just hope they don't make a second one. I usually like the actors that were in this. In this case tho...not so much. I also asked people who had also left before it was over what they thought, and they agreed with me. When I walked out there were five other people in the lobby just shaking their heads. Too bad Miami Vice can't do a "do-over"
