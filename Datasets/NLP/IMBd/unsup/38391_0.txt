When I started watching this movie, I was confused. What the hell is this supposed to be? A comedy? A drama? Is this some surreal Bunuel-esquire flick, full of elements which get introduced then dropped just as fast...But no, it turns out it's supposed to be a comedy. Which is too bad. 'Cause this movie could totally work as a bizarre little movie, with random bits of weirdness (Ms. Beef Pageant? This is funny?) and annoying over-the-top accents. In that sense, it would've been great. But no, it's a comedy. A terrible, terrible comedy. With a plot that only begins to reveal itself an HOUR into the movie. Horrible acting by Piper Perabo. Confused genres (you're watching it thinking, is this supposed to be like Mean Girls? Is this supposed to be like Napoleon Dynamite?) on a level not seen since "Cool As Ice". Moreover, every time Piper Perabo was on the screen, I wanted to punch her in the face. She is a terrible actress and should contemplate killing herself. Avoid this movie at all costs...unless you haven't read this review. And know nothing about it. In which case, enjoy the surreality.
