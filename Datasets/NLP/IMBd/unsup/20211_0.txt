This movie follows three generations of some odd men in Hungary. The first is a sexually frustrated soldier in the second world war, who dreams sexually of his comrade's wife and kids. constantly masturbating and fantasizing ends up with a baby being born. The child grows up and ends up being a champion of speed-eating, he marries a woman (wich is also fat) and thus the next generation is born. A taxidermist.<br /><br />This is a movie about the ugliest places and human beings on earth. It plays around and explores this ugliness, and the result is a gross, twisted and extremely dark humorous movie, with a side of some surrealistic plot devices. The cinematography is excellent . Acting is all good, so no mistakes on that. Overall, this is a very well done movie, and the director shows talent. I'm looking forward to see more of his twisted movies.
