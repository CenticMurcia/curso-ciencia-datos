Comedy takes place in 1954 and is based on the TV show "Your Show of Shows" with Sid Cesar. Here it's called Comedy Cavacalde and run by King Kaiser (Joseph Bologna). Star Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole) is set to guest star on the show--but he has a serious drinking problem. Writer Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker) is set to watch him and keep him out of trouble. Naturally everything goes wrong.<br /><br />A huge hit in 1982. I remember loving it back then but, for some reason, I didn't find it that funny this time around. It's badly directed by Richard Benjamin, Jessica Harper is totally wasted in a small role, Bill Macy is TERRIBLE (he seems to equate screaming as acting) and I don't find alcoholism particularly funny. Still this has enough good material in it to recommend it.<br /><br />The 1950s are captured perfectly down to the costumes and settings. Linn-Baker is pretty good as Stone, Lainie Kazan is great in her few scenes and Bologna is good (if a little overly obnoxious) as Kaiser. Some of the jokes are very funny and it's also great to see Gloria Stuart. But this is O'Toole's movie all the way. He has a great role and plays it for all it has. He's just perfect--you can't take your eyes off him. I believe this role was written with him in mind...and it shows. A gentle and amusing comedy. No great shakes but worth seeing. I give it an 8.<br /><br />Best line: "I'm not an actor, I'm a movie star!"
