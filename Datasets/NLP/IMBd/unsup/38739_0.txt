Well, I'm not quite sure if this is the film I watched, I mean, I thought that this movie was done in 1985, but as I clearly see, it wasn't. Even if I was rating the wrong movie, this could be the remake of a terrible movie, imagine that.<br /><br />Well, were to begin, I was changing the channels to see if there was something good on TV. Suddenly I saw a guy tied to a chair that screamed "Hey you, !@#$%^". That got a bit my attention, so I began to watch the movie. I was probably the worst hour with a few minutes of all my life, first, the actors didn't knew how to act, then, the stories were so stupid that I couldn't believe that someone could listen to them, to worse the things, three silly boys were hearing to a drugged ranger, you think that could be a good movie? Obviously not.<br /><br />I began to watch the movie after a guy cuts the head to another one, the next story was of an Indian and three idiots that want to kill him. Well, in the scene were they are in the car, one of those guys was laughing like crazy, then, why would someone like to kill a person that hasn't done nothing to you, and to worse the thing, those guys couldn't act good, not even the Indian when is dying.<br /><br />The other story was of a woman that felt that someone was looking at her, the Ranger of that story couldn't even laugh good, and the story was so stupid that I couldn't believe that I was like 40 minutes watching at that crap.<br /><br />PLEASE, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE, EXCEPT IF YOU WANT TO SLEEP, 'CAUSE IT'S SO BORING THAT YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP JUST WATCHING IT.
