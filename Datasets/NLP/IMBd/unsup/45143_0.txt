Watching an almost exact replica of a brilliant film executed in less than impressive manner is just frustrating... and an insult to the original.<br /><br />Tortilla soup has the right idea, mainly because it was done once before and more successfully for that matter.<br /><br />I realize it's a remake aimed at a more mainstream audience, but it seems like a bland dish compared to the far more satisfying eat drink man woman.<br /><br />I would recommend the original any day. as for tortilla soup, watch it only if you're curious about the interpretation.<br /><br />If there is one thing Tortilla Soup does well, is that it shows the universal themes of eat, drink, man woman, adapatable to any culture.
