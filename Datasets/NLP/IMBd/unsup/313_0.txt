I saw this movie for the first time many years ago. I watched it by chance; after renting a Hollywood box office action film. I had two movies that I wanted to rent, but the 2nd movie was out. So I browsed the movies and picked this one since it had an interesting name & Peter Weller was in it. Screamers was a last choice rental. I'm glad I rented this movie, it was a lot better than the box office movies I rented. True this movie has a very low budget but thats what makes it great. It has the great sorta feel of (John Carpenter's The Thing). Its a desolete kind of movie. The acting in this movie is good, especially by Peter Weller. This movie is about the morality of machines made by man to fight other men, and then all of man fighting evolving machines that want to be like man, that use mans weaknesses against man. The premise is very intelligent, and the amount of action is perfect for the story to unfold. This movie will make you think! Well, It made me think. This movie is quite entertaining and is one of my all time favorites. It could of been improved a little bit but only by the supporting casts acting. If this movie had a large or very large budget, it would have been made for larger group of the masses, and therefore it would have sucked! If you like sci-fi this is a must see! or addiction for any collection.
