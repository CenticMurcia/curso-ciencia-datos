Pod People??? Humnnnnnn. Well, if Pat and Chris from Saturday Night Live-fame had a child, it would resemble Pod People's little femme boy waif, Tommy... a bug collecting, perky little blonde he/she that spends too much time to itself... of whom finds itself more comfortable with circa 1970's shag-carpeted, peanut-snorting, karate chopping aliens, rather than his alcohol-soaked uncle (I think) and his Bonnie Frankin (One Day at a Time TV series) haired mother. And how about that rock band? Let's hear it for the "Loverboy" look of love... leg warmers, headbands, Toni-Perms and snappy dialog. "Hear the Engines Roll Now", their claim to fame sounded to me like... "Idiots in Trona" (If you knew what & where Trona is, you would completely understand). The fog scenes were really well done. I highly recommend that wonderful little movie off that had been passed on as being "written". Definitely... "Must See TV"
