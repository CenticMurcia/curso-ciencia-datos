This is a terrible, terrible film.<br /><br />The first two in the series were fairly simple, fun films, relying mainly on Eddie Murphy's performances but nevertheless with strong backup from the rest of the cast (particularly in the first one), and a certain eighties 'cool' factor that, while obviously dated, still charms.<br /><br />In this one though, it Eddie Murphy wears a bit thin, and the plot reads like a McBain (of Simpsons fame) film, with its horrific cliches and awful script. Even the music was redone so that only once in the films do we here it in its classic version.<br /><br />And what was going on with Judge Reinhold?<br /><br />I guess Axel Foley just doesn't belong in the 90's.
