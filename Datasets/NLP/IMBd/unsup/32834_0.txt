How you can make a movie about such totally unsympathetic and insufferable people is beyond me. Beyond that, the movie makes no sense and the plot has no credibility. Father kidnaps son from mother and then helps mother re-kidnap him from primitive Arab tribe who have managed to place elaborate warning boxes into the, one assumes, well guarded mansions of the two parents in America. Two hired mercenaries somehow manage to obtain crates-full of sophisticated weapons and a caravan of other Arabs to transport them. Mother in business suit insists on joining commandos when her presence at any point could betray and undermine the entire mission. OK, that's enough, I got my ten lines in but will mention that I am a big fan of Rutgar Hauer.
