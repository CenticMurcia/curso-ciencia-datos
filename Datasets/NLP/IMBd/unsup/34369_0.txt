It was in films like Sagebrush Trail that John Wayne learned his craft, but thank the Deity he got out of doing stuff like Sagebrush Trail. <br /><br />The Duke has busted loose from jail, he was in the calaboose for a murder he didn't commit. He eludes a posse chasing him, but gets into the clutches of an outlaw gang headed by Yakima Canutt. It's as good a place as any to look for the man who can clear him. He doesn't realize though how lucky he got.<br /><br />Now granted this was a Lone Star production, not even a B film. But I would have liked to have seen just how Wayne got into the jackpot that landed him jail for murdering the lover of a married woman if he wasn't involved with her. When we do find who the murderer is that's never explained to us. <br /><br />Since this was for the afternoon kiddie matin√©e crowd maybe such things weren't delved into even before the Code came in place. Maybe it was a question of sloppy editing also. <br /><br />I think John Wayne's most devoted fans might like this one, I really wouldn't recommend to others, even other western fans.
