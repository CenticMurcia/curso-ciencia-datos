The guy is obviously sick and I can't believe that he found somebody to fund this self indulgent masturbatory aid. <br /><br />He wants so desperately for you to like him and accept him that it just comes off as slimy and annoying.<br /><br />I got to see this movie for free and I still feel as though I have been cheated. It's no wonder that this film was rejected by Sundance, I'm glad at least one group of people had the chance to tell him how crappy this movie was. <br /><br />p.s. although there are lots of boobies and sex scenes, none of them are even worth fast forwarding to.
