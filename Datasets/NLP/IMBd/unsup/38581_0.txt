Many great artists have composed masterpieces under the heavy influence of hallucinogenic drugs. That is no excuse for Highlander II. This is among the saddest movies ever made. Artificial ozone? Sean Connery back from the dead? The PLANET ZEIST?!?!? This movie is a low point in human history. What surprises me the most is that they actually dared to make a THIRD movie. Don't even bother with The Quickening, just watch the first movie and then skip to the third one (after all, that's what the producers did). Highlander II will be immortalized as one of the true failures of cinema.
