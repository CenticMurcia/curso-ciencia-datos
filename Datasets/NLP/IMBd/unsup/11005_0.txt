Deep in the heart of conservative Utah, there lies the best little film festival in the world. In that little film festival, lies some wonderful movies, one of the best being Get Real, a gay dramedy (drama-comedy) with some BRILLIANT acting and a WONDERFUL theme, it was amazing and so well done. Each deep scene was followed by a light hearted part. Matches the brilliance of BEAUTIFUL THING if not surpasses it, depending on whether or not you want a more comedy or not. Get Real is an amazing piece of work that everyone should see. Based after the play "What's Wrong With Angry?" Get Real is sure to be a major hit!
