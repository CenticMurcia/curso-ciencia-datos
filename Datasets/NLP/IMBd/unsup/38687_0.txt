This didn't work for me. Haneke might be a master of making the audience feel bad during watching. I wouldn't say I only like films with a happy end. But this so cold and without tension. So cold it hurts. And eventually makes you feel sick. The emotions in the film are of the dark side. 'The Piano Teacher' is even stronger, and would be recommended prior to this film. 'The Seventh Continent' gives rise to several questions without answers, and without letting you try to answer them. It's slow and boring; I had a hard time trying to focus on the film instead of thinking of other things. The scenes fit loosely together and it's by far too many close-ups for my taste; the whole film is filmed in a short-range perspective.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone except those interested in the subject. 2/5
