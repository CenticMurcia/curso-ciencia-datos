I am not going to tell you about the plot because there's no plot at all. After the movie ended quite awkwardly, I couldn't help to ask: what the heck is this movie trying to say? It appears like a sex comedy, but the dildo thing is not funny at all, and the cum during the meeting is so old that it becomes quite embarrassing. The affairs between the husband and the student, the wife becomes a slut, and the huge swimming pool of DeVito, all have nothing to do with the main story - wait, actually there's no story at all! Fortunately it runs less than 80 mins.<br /><br />This is a definitely NOT a SEX COMEDY, don't be deceived by the tag lines.
