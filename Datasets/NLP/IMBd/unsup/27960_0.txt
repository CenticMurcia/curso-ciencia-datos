Having appreciated "What the Bleep Do We Know," I had high hopes for this movie. I was sorely disappointed. <br /><br />The acting was so atrocious that when a friend came over, we had to show part of it to her just so we could showcase the idiocy of this film. We laughed and laughed... The acting is so hideous that it could become a great teaching tool (of How-NOT-To) for film/acting courses. The Dialogue was almost as pathetic as the acting, which is pretty bad! <br /><br />Oh, I forgot, there was one redeeming feature - the scenery was nice. Not quite enough to hold the movie together......<br /><br />Others I know who have seen it said they would be scarred for life. Hmm...
