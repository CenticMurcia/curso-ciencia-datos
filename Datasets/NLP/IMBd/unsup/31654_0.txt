I am very overwhelmed to even type out a constructive comment on such a wonderful film. This was not expected, for a Filipino film at least. Never mind the quality of the picture, it's all that we can afford. One will hardly notice it unless he or she is a videophile. This is the type of film that, although it is not heavily marketed (I was in the Philippines in 2003, all year, and never have I seen an ad for it), will spread its magnificence through people. Heck, I'd even say that this can go in par with ANY Fran√ßois Truffaut film. My incoherency is annoying even myself, so let's cut this short. Magnifico is truly a magnificent film, no exceptions.
