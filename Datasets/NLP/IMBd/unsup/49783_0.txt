Considering that this bad episode followed another horrid episode (the one about the crew fighting it out at the OK Corral), it was obvious that the quality of the show was starting to slip. Despite the one very glowing review so far, it must be hard for readers to know what to make of the show since they only two reviews are polar opposites. Read on and decide for yourself.<br /><br />The Enterprise respond to a distress call which turns out to be a trap by some Klingons. Through some odd coincidences that few seem to question, many Klingons are beamed aboard the Enterprise and an all-out war erupts--complete with swords and other ancient weapons. All the phasers magically have disappeared and the decks have been sealed off sort of like an arena. And, when people die, they magically heal themselves and fight on and on and on--all to the delight of a spinning ball of light that looks like it was created by spinning a prism. Eventually, Kirk is able to get himself out of his battle frenzy that was imposed by the spinning ball and convinces everyone to just be pals and laugh the problem away--at which point, brotherhood and the chorus of KUMBAYA drive away the evil force and all is back to normal (okay, the "Kumbaya" thing didn't happen--but it was almost THAT bad!). I feel myself gagging as I type--yecch what a preachy and stupid episode. It sure could have been better if they had kept the plot but given it some decent resolution that wasn't so cloying as well as better special effects to represent the creature. This is probably in the top five of the worst Star Trek episodes.
