I just saw this today.. I must admit, it's not a bad film.. but it needs a bit more action and excitement to it..<br /><br />In this movie, it tells the story of three women from different backgrounds.. You got Felicia (played by KITA SHA) who's a model, Traci (played by ALLISON NURSE) who's a secretary and Cinnamon (played by KENIA BROWN) who's happens to be a sister of a rap star, Nitro (played by real-life rap star JUVENILE).<br /><br />When NITRO gets murdered, her Sister Cinnamon tries to figure out who's responsible.. By doing this, she teams with her friends who she meets as they all first gets sent to prison by kicking some poor soul's ass.<br /><br />As it goes on, it seems that there's more to just Nitro's murder.. but something more sinister. First it leads onto Nitro's manager J (played by LAYON GRAY) and then onto Shayla (played by Erica Goings).. Are you following me..? If not, you have to watch the movie again.. But I'm not gonna say who's really responsible..<br /><br />The film in a whole is OK! But I would've felt like the director, Paul Wynne could do something more better.. Unlike Charlie's Angels (film-wise..) there was a lot of things.. Humour, action, love, etc.. which all makes up the whole film entertaining.. This one was almost hits the mark.. Mind you, the three lead characters were good. They stood out alright.. But this is a black urban version of Charlie's Angels.. The rap music did get me going.. There are musical tracks on there that I was really rocking to.. which made me (the viewer) kept going with the film..<br /><br />For a low budget film like this one.. it was a good effort! So to say.. But if there was more action, more romance, more humour.. It would've been better.. The director Paul Wynne may've done a good job. He casted some really nice black actresses (Brown, Nurse and Sha) for the three leads.. Juvenile..? I don't usually hear from him a lot.. But it was nice to see him on screen. Layon Day's performance was good. But his character J kept his cool..! and so was Erica Goings..<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's a kind of film you would watch on a rainy day.. I did. But as whole I'm giving it 7 out of 10!
