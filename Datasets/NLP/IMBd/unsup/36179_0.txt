you mean most manipulative? misleading? keep in mind Jin's flashbacks served no purpose but to be a red herring they had nothing to do with the story being told, it's bad writing. They can't justify showing that.<br /><br />Try watching the episode again and not getting irritated knowing he's buying a panda for a stranger.<br /><br />And whats with the children's comedy music going on during that slapstick scene with the cell phone?<br /><br />gimme a break ridiculous, waste of LOST-time Hopefully next weeks will be better, and carry us through til April.
