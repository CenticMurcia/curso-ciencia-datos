I don't think Aaja Nachle was meant to be a groundbreaking movie with the coolest screenplay. On a whole its even somewhat uninspired and not entirely original but its a good movie nonetheless. In the context of Bollywood however, it's actually is pretty original. Which was the last big-scale female-fronted Bollywood movie there was? Frankly, I can't think of anything in the past two decades. Nothing from of the large scale, Yash Raj fame.<br /><br />To the critics who think this movie wasn't even worth a watch, I think you've got the point wrong. Well sure it is a bit too polished- a bit too commercial and "safe" but what choice do the producers have? I don't think the Indian film industry is ready for something more experimental and adventurous. There had to be some trade off.<br /><br />Even then, some of that commercialised coat melted with Madhuri's charm. Yes, I think Madhuri played her "magic" well in this movie. She sunk her teeth into the role and exuberanted her charm so well, I think she alone added a lot more colour to the movie. She almost overshadows the second and third lead in the film- Konkona Sen and Kunal Kamar. Both of them played their roles well and did a commendable job at that.<br /><br />To sum it up, I think most critics of this movie expected too much from the comeback of the lady who's been hailed as Bollywood's greatest actress. As it is, she shone brightly in a movie that's decent. Its storyline may be somewhat predictable from the onset but its still an untapped genre in Bollywood.<br /><br />I'd say, sit back, relax, don't think too much and watch it for what its worth.<br /><br />I'd give it 7.5/10
