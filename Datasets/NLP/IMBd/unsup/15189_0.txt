This movie is very, very good. When I read that it was 2 1/2 hrs, I thought, "Oh, no, boooring." But first off, this movie is so interesting that it didn't seem much longer than the typical 90 minute flick. And as many dramas are, this film may be a little slow in some parts, but I never lost interest, not once. Crowe was great, and I was impressed by Pacino's performance, who I've admittedly lost confidence in over the last decade or so. Probably his best in many years. Granted, most "based on a true story" films fictionalize 90% of the film (i.e. Titanic, Perfect Storm), but this movie was still loyal to the basic truths. Very compelling, go rent this one soon.
