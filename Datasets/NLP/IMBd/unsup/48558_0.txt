First of all, I have to tell I mainly watched this movie because the special effects was told to be made by the FX group and the poster was very promising about them. I've seen the uncut version. And if the uncut version is that terrible that it was, how terrible could the "cut" version be? It's not a horror movie, though it's full of gory scenes, and it's not a horror comedy, 'cause there's nothing funny in it. I supposed to see a movie where Virus (with Dustin Hoffman) and the melting scene of senator Kelly from the x-men are combined. Or something like that. But there was nothing like this in the whole movie. From the idea of the three stage (hallucination, organ failure, body melt) a far far better movie could be made by a talent director. I only gave three stars to the three stage, but I only recommend this if you think the gore makes a horror movie. And more gore you can see the better the movie is. But if you think that really good horror movies are like "The Thing", "Alien" or "Prophecy (1979)", avoid!
