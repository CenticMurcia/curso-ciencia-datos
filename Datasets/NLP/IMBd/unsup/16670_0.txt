"Play It Again, Sam" was directed by Herbert Ross (mostly known for chick flicks, such as "Steel Magnolias", "The Turning Point" and "Boys on the Side"), but it's a typical Woody Allen film. Woody wrote this brilliant comedy, based on his own stage play, and starred as Allan Felix, a (neurotic, of course) film critic that, after being dumped by his wife, is constantly visited by the ghost of his idol, Humphrey Bogart (Jerry Lacy). Bogart's ghost (characterized as Rick Blaine, from "Casablanca") gives Allan advice about how to win over beautiful women, but our hero seems too clumsy to find the right lady. The only woman who seems to be ideal for Allan is Linda Christie (Diane Keaton), a close friend and, also, the wife of Allan's best friend, Dick (Tony Roberts).<br /><br />I think "Play It Again, Sam" is easily one of the best comedies ever made, almost in the same level as the classic "Annie Hall". It's so good that I'm looking forward to seeing it again. If you don't laugh watching this, you're very ill. 10 out of 10.
