Nope, still haven't found it after watching this. Most of the budget seems to have gone on the lead bad-guy's attire. This movie is lots of shots of dorkish hero (Troy) in dire need of major dental corrective treatment running away from balaclava-clad thugs who, despite most of them carrying rifles, never think of shooting him. Seems like he's following his father's footsteps of finding a lost civilization in Canada (!). Hopelessly silly plot best summed up when Troy and friend Zap enter a cave. Bag guy follows and captures Zap. Back outside, the dialog is something like: Bad guy: "The boy. He went into the cave with you. Where is he?" Henchmen then go off and start searching the forest. Duh. Naturally, this movie is prime MST3K fodder so best watch that version instead if I were you.
