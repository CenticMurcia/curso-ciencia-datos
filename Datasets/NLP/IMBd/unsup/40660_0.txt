This movie had so much potential, but never quite found its groove. Sandra Bullock character was one she plays well, but one we've seen from her often before, most recently in "Hope Floats." Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the wild child sister bears a remarkable resemblance to Meg Ryan's portrayal of Pamela in "The Doors."
