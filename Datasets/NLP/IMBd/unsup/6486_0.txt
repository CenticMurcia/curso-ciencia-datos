Billy Crystal promised to make a tribute to the golden age of sport. A time when the games were played by athletes, not corporations. A time when the game was more important than the money. His movie concentrates on all the wrong things. He sees only the media, not the men. He should be ashamed to have disgraced the memory he purpots to hold so dear.
