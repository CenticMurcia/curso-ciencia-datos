"Inland Empire" is best enjoyed if you look at it as a summarization of Lynch's career. Everything that is good or bad about Lynch, depending on who you are talking to, can be found in this production. I don't think it is top tier Lynch but it does feel endlessly fascinating because it allows the filmmaker to use every trick he has learned in over three decades of movie-making. I'm not wasting my time with plot points - each viewer has the right to come up with his/her own interpretations. Not unlike Lynch's "Lost Highway," I think it got something to do with repressed anguish and role-playing. But, who knows? I did think it was a bit long. I do want to recommend viewers to watch it either very late at night or early in the morning - it is the kind of movie that feeds on a specific kind of environment. The brilliant sound design need to be appreciated without any distractions.
