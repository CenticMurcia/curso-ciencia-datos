I was so excited when I read a movie was being made of this great book. I really wanted to like this movie. Very little time was spent on Dan's actual Journey. The premonitions of seeing Socrates were missing, so Dan had no reason to be intrigued at the Service station. What happened to the teaching of the importance of humor? And why the gratuitous shower scene? Why did Dan always look angry - especially after his enlightenment - whenever he approached an apparatus? He was supposed to be at Peace (even if his message to his Coach was an 'I'll show you" - which defeats the purpose of releasing the Ego ). Too much screen time of guys with there shirts off. As an after-school TV movie - it was terrific; as a movie of this very special book - a major disappointment.
