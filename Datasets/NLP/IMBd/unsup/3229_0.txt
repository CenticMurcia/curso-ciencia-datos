The lamentably lousy '76 "King Kong" remake fortunately inspired a handful of hilariously horrible low-budget cash-in copies which includes the incredibly awful Korean cheapie "A*P*E*," the groan-inducing idiotic spoof "King Kung Fu," and this simply stupendous Hong Kong howler. Produced by the Shaw Brothers, who usually cranked out extravagant chopsocky costumers by the dozens and shot on a conspicuously paltry budget of what appears to be several rolls worth of quarters, this utterly inept, yet always entertaining and frequently sidesplitting tale of gorgeous jungle honey Samantha (the beautiful, curvaceous, flaxen-tressed Euro minx Evelyn Kraft, giving the viewers am amazing eyeful in a scanty, revealing fur bikini outfit that leaves precious little to the imagination) and the fearsome, village-stomping behemoth ape who's her best friend is not to be missed. <br /><br />Blessed with all the correct so-totally-wrong-it's-paradoxically-right schlock movie stuff -- clueless ham-fisted direction by seasoned journeyman Ho Meng-Hua, a crummy, leave-no-clich√©-unturned cookie cutter script, meager (far from) special effects, laughably poor dubbing, proto-MTV buzzsaw editing which accentuates a manic rapid-fire pace over rhythm and continuity, unspeakably terrible dialogue ("Hey look -- it's Peking Man!"), ramshackle production values, a sappy romance between Kraft and dorky Oriental adventurer Danny Lee (who also portrayed the titular bionic superhero in the equally astounding "Infra-Man" around the same time), a breathlessly frenetic pace, an absurdly melodramatic score, a fantastic mondo destructo monster on the rampage sequence (WARNING: Possible *SPOILER* ahead - in one alternate version Kraft croaks along with the ape at the film's riotously botched conclusion), a few groovy Erutrash disco tunes (one's even sung to a cloying lovey-dovey jungle montage!), and, most importantly, a certain cheerfully off-target, yet still unyielding and unbridled go-for-it hearty gusto which blithely permeates every last fabulously fumbled frame -- this choice chunk of delectably dreadful cinematic cheese rates as essential viewing for hardcore bad film buffs.
