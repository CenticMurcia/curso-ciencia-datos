This was a major disappointment for me. I have always been a fan of Walter Matthau and Robin Williams and director Michael Ritchie, but not even the three of them together could breathe any life into this dry film. Williams' character, Donald, is a neurotic, bumbling idiot who is unforgivably paranoid, and his relentless struggle to make some sense out of his life simply isn't funny nor interesting. Sonny Paluso (Matthau) is a sour old fart who, of course, eventually warms up to Donald (aaaaaaawwwwwwhhhhhh). I went to see this with a friend, and , aside from two other people, we were the only ones in the entire cinema--not a bit surprising. The World According to Garp is a much better representation of Williams' early '80's efforts. As for Matthau and Ritchie, stick with The Bad News Bears.
