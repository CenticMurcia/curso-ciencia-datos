This Two Parter, which is meant to be the story of Blackbeard is an absolute stinker.<br /><br />The plot is paper-thin, the script is awful, the acting densely wooden, it is historically inaccurate, even the ships appear to be from the wrong period.<br /><br />Richard Chamberlain (God help him) tries to act, but fails miserably, the accents of the Pirate crew veer from comically "English Van Dykian" to New York via Devon and all stops in between. <br /><br />It was bad it was not even funny, I have never seen a worse piece of "entertainment" - and I've seen a few. <br /><br />I suspect that the Director has a bright future as a traffic cop.<br /><br />Avoid like scurvy. Unless forced to walk the plank.
