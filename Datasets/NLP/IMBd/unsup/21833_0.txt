I grabbed this movie off the shelf at Blockbuster as I'm a fan of SMG's Buffy character. The other actors listed impressed me as did the blurb that it got a thumbs up from E&R. It opens with sex and gets better from there. That of itself is impressive. The sex is necessary for the story to establish the link with the characters, and it's a mighty link. This definitely isn't a porn movie yet the sex is almost like the fifth character in the movie. SMG's Cindy seems deep until you get to the end of the movie, but I'm wondering now if that was the plan. She did a great job with her character, as did the other players. And just when you think the movie will have a pat ending, a question mark enters the scene in a way you wouldn't expect. You don't hate anyone in this movie. There's no suspension of belief. It's all plausible. DEFINITELY get this movie if you can. It's a good... no, make that it's a GREAT rental! Would be a good one for a DVD library for the thinking person to peruse occasionally too. Not for the non-thinking person and DEFINITELY not for anyone under 18.
