Increasingly there are two kinds of movies: 1. Movies that you see and really enjoy because they offer something new to you and 2. Movies that are hyped so much and reveal so much of the movie in trailers and talk show clips that seeing them is a waste of time.<br /><br />Muse is very definitely in category 2!! I had seen every really funny line and surprise cameo before I ever even walked in the theater. Unless you missed all the trailers and hype, save your money. On second thought, save your money for video. The big screen doesn't do a thing to save this dull, flat effort.<br /><br />Of course, McDowell and Stone are pleasant on the eyes but their considerable talents are wasted here!
