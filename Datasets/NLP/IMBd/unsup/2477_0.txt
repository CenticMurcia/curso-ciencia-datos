Although is is clearly a B movie, I have seen it at least three times and recorded it once but have lost the tape and have many times wished I still had it on nights when TV viewing was exceptionally poor. And I have Sky too.<br /><br />I have just found this title on ebay and placed a bid for it, which if I win in about 3 hours time, will have cost me a phenomenal Â£10 in a time when used VHS tapes can be picked up for 50p.<br /><br />I found the film thought provoking and inspiring. I have long been a sci-fi buff but only when the subject is truly believable. And this film is just that. It actually brings to the surface some of my own thoughts on the subject of whether or not "we are alone". And indeed if our visitors are actually our closest relatives and living here on earth too.<br /><br />I would urge all to see this film.
