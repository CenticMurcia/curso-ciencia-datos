When thinking of this movie, the only word that comes to mind is AMAZING. From start to finish, one of the best gangster movies ever made. All of the key actors; Oldman, Penn, Harris, and Wright, feel as if they were made to play each individual role. Right on the money. These aren't even the best parts of this film. Director Phil Joanou uses such wonderful music throughout the film and blows us over with one of the best filmed endings in the past 25 years. Without a doubt one of my top ten!!! But don't take my word for it, see for yourself. If it would only be released on DVD soon.
