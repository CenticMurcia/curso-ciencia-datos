This film seemed to be going for shock value, but without much sense of reality in the script or in the acting. <br /><br />No addict of any kind would submit to the indignities depicted here unless predisposed to do so. <br /><br />I rated this 2 out of 10, though, because of a pretty cool soundtrack, and because "Dorothy" was kinda cute. ;-)
