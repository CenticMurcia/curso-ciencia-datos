well it's obvious that this movie is not JAWS, but you have to admit, the amount of cheese that's been poured on to this film is just awesome. i watch it almost every day on Google Video, and i just can't help but laugh at the scenes where we see the shark's head. the whole "exploding victims" gimmick is just so humorous, that i just have to replay it over and over again in order to get it out of my system. another thing notable about this film is Vic Morrow, who is playing a character largely similar to Robert Shaw's character in "Jaws". Now, as a die hard "Jaws" fan, i should know, anyone who imitates Qunit must die, but actually Vic Morrow gives that kind of tough guy attitude to the town council that Shaw didn't really do in "Jaws".<br /><br />What's my point? Well, "Great White" isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's still fun to watch. Gives you a good laugh.
