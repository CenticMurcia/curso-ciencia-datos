Al Capp's characters translate to Broadway and then to Hollywood. Capp lost a leg in a trolley accident as a boy. His bitterness wraps itself in satire. The music is forgettable. My interest is Julie Newmar as Stupefyin' Jones. She is a secret weapon created by Available Jones and a metaphor for the atomic bomb. He unleashes her in the Sadie Hawkins Day race to stupefy men so that the women of Dogpatch can catch them. Julie is devastating in seamed nylons. She was the sexiest woman in the history of women---5'11" and 145 pounds. Li'l Abner is steeped in Cold War thinking and regarded as dated although it does turn up on the stage from time to time.
