I saw this movie when it was released. Its a very good movie (I thought) and, the acting was better then your avg. "B" type Movies. <br /><br />Kurt Douglass while showing his years here, plays the street wise detective hot on the trail and his acting is still top notch. <br /><br />I found the story line original and creative which added to the suspense. I gave it high marks because the events in which Eddie finds himself in trouble could happen to any of us.<br /><br />When Eddie discovers that his job is taking a 25% cut for letting him work there he leaves in a huff. Mad, he drives off at a high rate of speed only to be pulled over by the small town cops that seem to enjoy busting Eddies chops. Already upset, Eddie finds himself in a scrap with the cops who bring him in. Now facing the local town judge, he's given a ridiculous jail term for his infraction. Eddie decides he's got to figure a way out of jail. He comes up with a clever way of not only pulling it off but, he's planned out details of his escape route as well
