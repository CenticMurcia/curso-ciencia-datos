Unintentionally funny & painfully dumb. Makes the original Iron Eagle look like Citizen Kane. Why anyone would agree to participate in this is beyond me. They probably could have gotten more money and respect selling Amway. I watched this movie at 3:00 in the morning because nothing else was on TV. I wish I would have watched the Weather Channel. I think this movie was trying to suck out my soul.
