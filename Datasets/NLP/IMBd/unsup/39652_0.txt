Rubber Johnny is conceptually brilliant but fails on several levels. The first problem is that is runs for a minuscule 6 minutes.... take away the credits and you're left with a 4 minute film. That in itself would not be a problem if the narrative was better.<br /><br />With such rich material here, Cunningham really could have stretched this out a lot longer... 30-45 minutes would have been excellent. This would have allowed for us to fully understand Rubby Johnny.... it would then be a feast for the mind as well as a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />Not to mention that there was a big teaser trailer released to promote this film... was it worth the wait? Not particularly. But is good eye candy.
