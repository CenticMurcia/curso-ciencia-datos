"Hook" is hands down one of the best movies ever made. It's got great acting done by Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts, and the others are all good too (although the little girl gets kind of annoying...).<br /><br />This movie should definitely be considered a classic. It's funny, it's cute, it's sweet, and it's very quotable: "Ruf-i-o," "Bangarang..." and more.<br /><br />And I love the man who "lost his marbles," literally. What a cute and clever little plot thing to throw in.<br /><br />This is a great movie for kids to watch, and for everybody else as well.
