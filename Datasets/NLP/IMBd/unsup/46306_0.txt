The fact that people are calling him a 'musical genius' for this is absurd.<br /><br />He uses the SAME MUSIC IN EVERY chapter and just randomly talks over it, with what has to be the most completely retarded thing to ever be recorded.<br /><br />And to the people who are claiming this is R. Kelly 'purposely' knowing that he was making a comedy?<br /><br />NO....he was downright serious and thought he was on the same level as Mozart, Puccini and other opera greats, when he wrote this meandering sack of crap known as "Trapped in the closet"<br /><br />He sat back and thought he wrote the 'Magnum Opus' of RB songs.<br /><br />R. Kelly is full of himself....and we all know what R. Kelly is full of.<br /><br />R. Kelly should be in prison for being a pedophile.<br /><br />I know that if the average Joe got caught doing what he did, he'd be in prison for a long time.
