Go West Young Man is based on a successful Broadway play, Personal Appearance which had a 501 performance run in the 1934-1935 season and made a star of Gladys George. What did Gladys do, but play a Mae West type actress stranded between Scranton and Harrisburg on a personal appearance tour.<br /><br />Of course since Paramount bought the screen right and they had Mae West, why not use the real deal in the lead. So Gladys George got her screen stardom in other roles and Mae West played Marvis Arden, a film star very much like Mae West.<br /><br />Mae's got a contract that says she can't marry, but being Mae she's got a healthy sexual appetite and who knows where that might lead. That's the job of Warren William, press agent assigned by her studio. He busts up all of her potential romances, but he's also got an ulterior motive.<br /><br />In fact he does a very hilarious job in pouring cold water on a romance between her and a rather fatuous politician played by Lyle Talbot. But Mae gets herself stranded out in the Pennsylvania countryside and takes a real liking to young farmhand Randolph Scott.<br /><br />Randy is the only weakness in the cast. I just couldn't quite accept him as the naive young farm boy. He's just played too many tough western types for me to ever buy that.<br /><br />Still this is Mae West's show and she carries it off with a style that only she can employ. No ersatz Maes for the movie going public.
