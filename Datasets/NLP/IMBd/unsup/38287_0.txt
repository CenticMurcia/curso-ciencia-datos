I am not one of the people who hates soaps, I love some American soaps like Sunset Beach and Days of our lives(the way it was in the 90s that is) But this one is terrible !! The story lines are boring and usually about something that has to do with money. The characters are so boring and unoriginal it isn't even funny. Its the same day in and day out at the stupid hotel. <br /><br />The only good thing about this show is Svein, he is the only character that is fun to watch and the actor is brilliant !!(not to mention Hilarious !!) I also liked Ragnar played by Nicolay Lange Nielsen but thats about it. 2 characters aren't enough for me to watch a show.<br /><br />True some of the actors are good but some of them need to show more emotion. For example in one eppies a girl just lost her father and she was talking about her fathers death as if she got a bad math test back !!! I just had to laugh...<br /><br />If you want to see a OK soap from Norway the only one is Syv SÃ¸stre, although it had some really bad actors in it the story lines were far more exciting and actual had original characters. And the good actor in that show were far better than the good ones here.<br /><br />Its a joke that this show have been on for over 10 years!<br /><br />Norway don't fit to make soaps IMO, I prefer real life shows from Scandinavia(where as I prefer unrealistic American soaps). Like Vestavind and Sommer.
