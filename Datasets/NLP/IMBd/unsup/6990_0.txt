Wow! I was really shocked when I have seen this movie.<br /><br />Film is made with Sepia technique, but I didn't realized that it will be so "experimental". Everything in this movie is so fresh, and unpredictable, and new, and fantastic, and there is even a beautiful love story incorporated! :) Delicatessen differs so much from today's Hollywood movies, which all are filmed in similar fashion. I have picked this one from one of the "Best off" SF list, and I am glad I have watched it. I don't have much time to spend, and I tend to preselect movie on which one I will spend two hours of my time.<br /><br />European movies are so interesting and rich in comparison with US films, and I don't get how is possible that people still watch low quality stuff, when there are masterworks like this one.
