Of course Eddie Griffin is funny but no, not worth to rent and see this one, we did do that mistake.. mistake of the year, we did watch it, like 4-5 friends, and one of us was so bored that he did go sleep..and the kid actor.. his "Ow ow" was so bad.. and he was the worst actor i've ever seen, but it's just what i think.. maybe you like it, maybe not, that's just my opinion ;) Hope to see more better movies from Eddie Griffin.. he is a very funny guy, but an action "hero"? no way, he is an comedian, and that's what he only can do.. not action.. no way. the best way to watch this movie is not to watch it, just my opinion.<br /><br />bye.
