A comment was posted suggesting that fans of the book stay away from this movie. I couldn't disagree more!! I absolutely love the book, and I adore this movie. It is not meant to be a recreation of Barrie's brilliant and timeless story... it is, well, sort of a sequel in a way. It's a "what if" scenario, just one option of many. It's very cleverly tied closely to the original story, with many references woven throughout the entire storyline, if not as much in the plot itself. The creativity in every aspect of the film is very impressive, and a better cast could not have been chosen. Any fan of NeverNeverland and the story of Peter Pan is sure to immensely enjoy this movie. It even enforces family values and has a great moral to the story (especially for those who have suddenly surprisingly found themselves grown up!)
