Unique--insightful and humane, never succumbing to the temptation to satirize the failings and fallacies evinced by the almost-too-real people the filmmaker documentarizes. And the viewer learns a surprising amount about William Tecumseh Sherman as well, a Sherman clearly admired by the filmmaker (a Southerner), who identifies with him in some characteristics. See it if you can--nothing like it.
