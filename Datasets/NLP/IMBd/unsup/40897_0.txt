Take Care of My Cat follows the lives of a group of girls who have recently left school in South Korea and are searching for a meaning or a purpose in their life. <br /><br />To say this film was dreadful is a compliment, as it was worse than dreadful. I am not a new comer to far eastern films and I must admit I really was looking forward to seeing this film, which I had read only good things about. This movie felt like 9 hours long and it went nowhere.<br /><br />The only interesting areas of the film were the parts with the girls sending text messages and the text appeared in windows etc. Some of the split screen stuff worked well too, but ultimately the plot went nowhere. Sure I am interested in cultures from the other side of the world but at least attach a story to it. <br /><br />It could have been aptly titled "Take Care of My Plot", as the scriptwriter clearly didn't. <br /><br />Not recommended at all. 2 out of 10 and that is just for the clever graphics.
