"Right at your door" was a movie conceived on the current terrorism format. From the get go, one settles into believing that this will be man against a more sinister toxic annihilation. We open with a relationship in the bedroom, (Brad & Lexi), that oozes devotion. Brad has doted on Lexi, with candle light dinner. Coffee in bed, He even warms the shower up for her. The affection continues until Lexi leaves for her downtown office & working day. When the explosion is announced, Brad is slowly dragged out of his morning torpor with the horrific realization that Lexi is in the middle of it. He is frantic. Numerous attempts to get to her, with no regard to his own safety, fail. An aging Handyman caught out working on a neighbors house frantically seeks refuge & Brad lets him in. The Handyman has to sit through Brads soul destroying anguish at the realization that Lexi was probably a victim of the explosion. We get 20 minutes of grief, anger, frustration, then mental exhaustion, before he is finally convinced to seal the house against the impending toxic pollution. Then out of the blue, Lexi turns up, & Brad says "You can't come in, you might infect me" SAY WHAT!!! Even when the Handyman explains that it's worth the risk that he be with his wife & leaves, Brad is adamant his skin comes first, but concedes to sealing off a room so Lexi can come in out of the cold. How freaking compassionate!!!! The end comes when the disease police gas the self-centered Brad, who finished up infected anyway, in his own "fort", & Lexi gets a 5 minute paramedic treatment & is told she'll survive. Hooray says everyone,, Now the writers can get back to their crayons. I've seen better plots in a 30 second Ad.
