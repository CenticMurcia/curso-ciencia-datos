A distanced, uninvolving movie, apparently regarded by many people as a masterpiece. Well, I have to disagree strongly; as a drama, it never really pulls the viewer into the story (which progresses very ploddingly), and as a thriller it almost never generates any tension. A tedious movie, only for patient people. (*1/2)
