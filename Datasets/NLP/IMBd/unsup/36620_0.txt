This movie is without a doubt, the most creepy thing I've ever seen. If you actually read between th lines you can see it's actually a pro child molestation film-which is to say the least disgusting. Sure it's well directed, but that idea kept running through my head the entire time I saw it. The scene where Jeff Goldblum says "since you've touched me...I've made better love than I have in years" really freaked me out. I'm not sure if anyone realized this, but the actor who played Powder was 30 and the girl who played his love interest was a teenager! YOu can't tell me that wasn't intentional. Based on it's merits as a film I decided not to give it a one, because it's not badly made. However it's truly disturbing that no one at the studio picked this out.
