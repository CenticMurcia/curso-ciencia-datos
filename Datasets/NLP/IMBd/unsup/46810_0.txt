This is an unfortunately terrible documentary. It's boring and tedious, and does very little to tell me much about the instrument or its inventor. It seems like the director didn't really even bother to edit the film at all, presenting a collection of rambling, nonsensical "conversations" between Moog & various musicians, or semi-relevant ramblings with Moog by himself. It really is unfortunate, because he seems like an incredibly intriguing & intelligent person, but is presented in such an uninteresting way that seems to indicate that the director not only doesn't really care about him, but doesn't really care much about music in general. There are scenes where Moog is talking about the sounds the instrument can make, and the musician's options in terms of how they can manipulate the sounds, but the director doesn't bother to insert any "examples" during that scene, making it actually aggravating to watch. I found most of the various performances not really all that interesting to watch, either, as some of them barely showed the artist using the Moog (Stereolab) or focused more on other musicians in the performance (Money Mark's d.j.) I also really didn't learn much about Moog's life, or the real history & development of the instrument. It may have only been 70 minutes long, but i was barely able to sit through the whole thing. It really doesn't do the man justice in the least. If you want to see a great documentary about an inventor of an incredibly influential electronic instrument, watch THEREMIN. Not only is THEREMIN incredibly informative, but also rather touching. Truly a beautiful documentary.
