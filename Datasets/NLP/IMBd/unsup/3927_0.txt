Nowhere is a surrealistic piece of video-art. The story makes little sense if any and is far from real. Like everything in the movie is far from real, but rather close to an LSD-trip.<br /><br />One could say, the lack of message and meaning makes it pretentious and useless, unfortunately some actually did. They came up with different movies and meanings to compare it with, as well as theories. They wonder why the story of the movie has no direction, just as the lives of the main characters. Never considering that 'Nowhere', the pointless movie, was the origin and mother of all those thoughts.<br /><br />The movie lacks any kind of arrogance, and simplifies things. Of course we would expect some message. Of course we want the story to make more sense than our average life does. Nevertheless, I've enjoyed this movie up to its fullest.<br /><br />And for those who are still deaf and are wondering when they see people dancing.... 'Nowhere' is about the direction-less kind of life and thinking, people in general, have. They feel their choices are motivated, and logical, just as any of the characters in Nowhere. But like the story, their lives have no special meaning, no deeper context. Just like us people have the arrogance to assume we are different, better and unique than other animals, most movies and books share this same kind of endo-centric thinking. And 'Nowhere' simply makes fun of it.
