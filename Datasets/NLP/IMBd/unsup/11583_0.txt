A wonderful cast of superb actors playing a wonderful cast of outrageous characters. Exotic locale. Lots of laughs. Great lines. ("If there are two things I hate it's heat and heathens.) Ustinov gives a somewhat harder spin to Christie's Poirot than Suchet but he's just as wonderful. Angela Lansbury should have had the Oscar for best supporting actress that year for her tipsy, dipsy authoress. Maggie Smith is her usual incredible self. The great and always fascinating Bette Davis. And the wonderfully synchophantic "manager" of the steamer. All this with exotic locations, superb camera work and well paced suspense. Not too often I vote a ten. On this one I did. Bravo!
