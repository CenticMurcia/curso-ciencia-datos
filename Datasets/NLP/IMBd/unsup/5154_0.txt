In my opinion, this was a great movie in a comedy aspect, but it also touches on your emotions as parts of the movie are, or can be, very sad. I left this movie very glad that I saw it, and I would see it again. I saw The Full Monty, and I loved it, and I thought this was a great follow-up movie, but I didn't take them into aspects of each other, as I never do any movie, it should be judged upon your own opinion of comedy and movie standards, not upon past movies by the same director. Overall, this is a very good movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Also, watch it till the end of the credits, you won't be disappointed, but maybe sad emotionally.
