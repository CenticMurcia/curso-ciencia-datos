The technical aspects of the movie was flawless. Govind took a storyline that would usually not appeal to many and made it engrossing throughout the whole duration of the movie. The performances were brilliant, it is questionable why no nominations were offered. Kareena was brilliant as a Muslim riot victim, showing particular prowess in the confession scene. Her deglamourised look only emphasized the strength of her performance.Fardeen and Kareena's chemistry was impeccable and they give one of bollywood's memorable kiss sequences. Fardeen Khan was surprisingly good, flitting through all his scenes well. This was one of Amitabh's best performances and given his track record, you know how good it must have been. Om Puri too was excellent in his role as a villain. The songs were nice and did not interrupt the plot. Kareena's singing of "Jab nahin aye the thum" only enhanced the movie. The other songs "Rangdini " and "Allah allah" have the correct emotional nuances in them. Dev was flawless.
