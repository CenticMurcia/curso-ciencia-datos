Where does one start? Well, i'll go with the «smooth» voice throughout the whole film by Grieco, who whether in bed with Susan or shooting people maintains the same «coolness». Kinda reminds me of Jack Scalia or Lorenzo Lamas, but worse!!! The plot is, let's say ridiculous, the main character is just «looking for trouble» from the start, with no need for it. I watched the movie because it looked so bad from the start,i had to go on till the end. Oh and thanks, one needs to laugh at these, sometimes. I'll be watching out for other films starring Grieco, i'm sure i'll laugh some more! What else? Check it out for yourself, if you want a load of misguided film-making.
