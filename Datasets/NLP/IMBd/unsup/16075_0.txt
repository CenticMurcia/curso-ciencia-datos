I saw this movie the other day. My eyes are still recovering from this painful experience. I truly hated it. I read through all the comments and realized that this will be about the first negative comment submitted about Godzilla 2000. Why is that so? People love this movie. I don't understand...<br /><br />I like cheesy b-class horror movies. Any movie with a Troma stamp on it is great. But, this was beyond bad. There was no plot, no effects, nothing to keep even my son's interest, and no refund at the end.<br /><br />I immediately ran to the local video store and gobbled up a copy of the Hollywood version. Ahhhhh ... relief. And that one isn't even that great either.<br /><br />The only part I liked was the last line where our stunning pit-faced hero looked into his heart and proclaimed that Godzilla is in us all. At that point, the big green rubber guy continued to wreak havoc on the Japanese city, theoretically incinerating thousands of people within whose hearts he lives. Touching indeed.
