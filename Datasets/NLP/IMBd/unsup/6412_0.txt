A Clockwork Orange (1971) is by far one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. The characters are all so interesting that I wish the movie wouldn't end! All the actors do a fantastic job in their roles, especially Malcolm McDowell. The film's soundtrack is also quite great; I recommend that everyone should at least listen to it. The story for A Clockwork Orange goes like this:<br /><br />Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is a cheerful young man who enjoys rape, violence, classical music, and just about everything sadistic. With his three droogs, Alex spends the nights terrorizing anyone who he might encounter. One night, after killing a woman with numerous cats, Alex's gang turns on him and leaves him at the hands of the law. Alex next finds himself in prison with the sentence of 14 years for his murder that night. While in prison, he hears about a free ticket out of his sentence. All he has to do is be a guinea pig for a scientific experiment. The experiment is supposed to make Alex "better" and revert him from being bad to good. Alex says yes, jumping at the opportunity to get free faster. After being brainwashed by the scientists, Alex returns to civilization as a free and good man. However, the experiment has some side-effects that were not intended, and Alex is left helpless as his past victims come to gain revenge on him.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the acting (not to mention the soundtrack) is great. With the slew of Hollywood remakes on the rise, I can only hope that they never remake this classic. From the eye-grabbing first shot of the film to the confusing yet fulfilling last shot of the film, A Clockwork Orange remains to be one of my favorite films. Stanley Kubrick remains to this day, even after his death, as one of the best filmmakers of all time. Go and watch this film with an open mind. It truly is a masterpiece. I give A Clockwork Orange (1971) a 10 out of 10.
