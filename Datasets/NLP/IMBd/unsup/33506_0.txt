Oh my goodness.<br /><br />Movies like this, that are more pervasive than rare in Hollywood these days, are the reason why "The Cosby Show" was seen as so 'unbelievable' in the 80s.<br /><br />This film is so FULL of negative, degrading and pitiful stereotypes that I am SURPRISED that John Singleton was responsible for it.<br /><br />The oft-maligned film (at least here on IMDB) "Higher Learning," was FAR superior to this crap. At least there was SOME intelligent dialogue and POSITIVE images. This entire film was like an average black person's nightmare and racists' wet dream.<br /><br />I have a friend who is trying to stake his claim in Hollywood right now, but I'm OH so GLAD that he hasn't sold his soul to appear in utter crap like this.<br /><br />Hollywood makes no more Eve's Bayou's, but plenty of Booty Calls, Undercover Brothers and bile such as this flick. The unfortunate truth is that THESE are the films that sell these days. So as long as people believe and attempt to justify these modern day minstrel shows, decent black cinema won't have a chance.<br /><br />For those of you who find irony in this in the wake of Halle Berry and Denzel Washington's (much deserved) Oscar wins this year, remember what they won them for: A corrupt, evil, immoral black cop, and an ignorant, poor, single black mother.<br /><br />You know- Just like REAL life.<br /><br />Or is it?<br /><br />I say 'no', but then again.. who am I? Just (yet another) disappointed black film goer.<br /><br />
