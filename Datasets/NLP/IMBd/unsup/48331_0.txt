One wonders if this is the same Director/ Darmesh Darshan who made films like "Raja Hindustani" & "Dhadkan".<br /><br />A clich√©d theme with scenes copied from Hollywood movies like "French Kiss", "Bridget Jones Diaries", "The Wedding Date" to name a few.<br /><br />Akshay Khanna is good as usual, while Priyanka Chopra needs a complete makeover with her clothes, make up, acting...she needs lots of improvements. Suniel Shetty should quit movies, he spoils the film even more by trying to be funny. The less said about the others the better.<br /><br />The movie has some melodious tunes by the latest sensation in the Hindi music world Himesh Reshamiya. One wonders what's the purpose of using words like "bullocks" & "get a life dude" in the songs, negative words that spoil music!<br /><br />A large number of Bollywood directors seem to be in desperate need to attend creativity courses.<br /><br />Just think people instead of trying to take your audience for a ride.
