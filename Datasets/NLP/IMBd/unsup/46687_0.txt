This movie was supposed to be one that disperses life lessons. That is very noble and can bring about group discussions amongst Yuppie Set. However, This film failed on many levels . Where do I start? Lets see a Mexican handyman somehow winds up in Brads house to take cover when he could have stayed at the house he was working. Brad can not use the roads to try and find his lovely bride, but somehow from the midst of ground zero, his wife Lexi, manages to make it home. Brad wont let her in and basically that is where the plot revolves. Questions of self survival vs. marital unity and loyalty. OK , nice move by the writers. I just felt the film was too far-fetched. Mexican man leaves and we never know what became of him. Couple people here and there come and go , including young Timmy... Can anyone say PLOT FILLER. Somehow at the end of the film, Brad is contaminated with no signs of illness , while wife is seemingly going to be OK , while coughing through out , like a smoker that smokes 6 packs a day. Yes again , I understand the irony the film wanted to portray sort of like the hunter being the hunted , blah blah blah. It just did not work with all the holes.
