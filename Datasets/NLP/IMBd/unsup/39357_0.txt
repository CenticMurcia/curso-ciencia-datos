The original description I read of this movie made it sound like it might be decent. Unfortunately, this movie is far from decent. In fact, the best part (some flying in the desert/Utah) has very little to with the plot of this film.<br /><br />This is far from the best movie Ice-T was ever in. I haven't seen too many of his movies but there is no doubt that he gives a much better performance in "New Jack City".<br /><br />The special effects are laughable, the military protocol is horrendous, and the acting isn't too hot either despite the fact that this movie features oft-seen actors like Ernie Hudson, William Sadler, and "Tiny" Lister.
