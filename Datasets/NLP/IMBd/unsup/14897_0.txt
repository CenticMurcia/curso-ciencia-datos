I am amazed by this movie - I have never ever seen anything before that touched me this much. Being unable to get the picture out of my head, it has changed my view on fugitives and those who do their out-most to help. <br /><br />First of all, it has changed my perspective on life, thank you for that!!! Secondly it is now perfectly clear to me, why Ms Jolie has chosen to adopt children from Etiophia and Cambodia.<br /><br />I strongly recommend everybody see this movie - when my children are old enough, they will definitely be forced to watch it too.<br /><br />What a great movie and a shining star of an actress!
