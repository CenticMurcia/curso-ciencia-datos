Perfectly acceptable Irwin Allen drama, with some funny special effects - I particularly like it when they put a water tank in front of the lens, trying to simulate a high-water mark for a "dry shot" scene - and some even funnier acting. Culp is most amusing, still acting with more swagger than his career deserves, and Milner seems grouchy. Good location work doesn't always mix well with the stock footage.
