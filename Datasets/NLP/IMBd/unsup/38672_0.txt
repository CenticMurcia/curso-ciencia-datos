The first HOUSE was a decently amusing horror-comedy, but nothing at all great. Wouldn't you know, this sequel couldn't live up to it even half-way. It's almost as if it didn't even try... A husband and wife move into his family-owned mansion and discover photographs of his great-great grandfather; one of which shows him holding a skull made of solid crystal and is said to hold all the powers of the universe. The grandson, along with his buddy, go and dig up his dead relative and find the skull, as well as the old man who is a living corpse (for some reason). They then just hang out with the mummified guy and try to protect the skull from intruders from other worlds as well as dinosaurs and blah blah blah... I didn't even find this movie good in a 'stupid' kind of way. Whoever decided to go through with the production of this must have been severely kicked in the head by an angry mule or something because, otherwise, there was absolutely no reason for this nonsense...
