I auditioned for Mr. Holden in 1999 for the lead female role (Jenna) in "My Father's House," and remember him saying then - after I asked him what he was looking for in regards to the scene I was about to do - "Make me love and hate you at the same time. Or one or the other is fine, too." Then he chuckled.<br /><br />I didn't get it then, but after reading some of these posts about this film, as well as a recent online interview at Rogue Cinema, I do now. Well, I think I do, anyway. <br /><br />Him and his films seem to have their absolute haters and their absolute lovers, nothing in-between, and I have a very strong feeling that that suits him just fine. And I have always thought that was a good sign when it came to works of art. And artists, too.<br /><br />Anyway, I came here today to find out what he's up to now (after running into one of his producers, Kerry Johnston, recently at a restaurant here in Hollywood on La Cienega - who said he was about to begin filming his seventh film at the end of this month in Wyoming - though I suspected she was purposely throwing me off his trail, as she looked at me like I was a stalker), and, remarkably, IMDb only has this, his first time behind the lens, listed. Not sure why, because he has directed five other films. But for some reason, as I was alluding to before, I bet that's just fine with him.<br /><br />Mr. Holden, I'm going to try and email you now (I can't believe your email address is listed here!); but if you by some chance come here and read this first, I'm eight years older now and have thickened my resume substantially, and am ready for my close-up! <br /><br />Oh, and "management1," I went and checked you out, reading some of your previous posts, and know now why you were so confused with Larry's film: It's not Battlestar Galactica, and doesn't star your late heroine, Anna Nicole Smith. Stick to wondering why that steroid riddle pro wrestler Benoit killed his wife and son, and leave space here for people who are serious about film. Also, your post smells of personal vindictiveness. Did you work for him? Or did you also audition for this remarkable film and get shown the door?
