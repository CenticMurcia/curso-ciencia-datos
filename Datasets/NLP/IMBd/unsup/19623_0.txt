This show could actually have good potential. Unfortunately I think it's a bad misfire. Gail Porter does do a good job as a presenter, but I think I would have believed more in Chris Flemmings paranormal abilities if he hadn't gotten information about the places they went beforehand and gotten the some of the stories as he was walking through the places. There are a lot of shows in this paranormal category which I think are much better than this one and I could name the British Most Haunted and A Haunting which is shown on Discovery Channel. The thing about this one is that it seems to present no skeptics to come up with an alternative to the findings of Chris and Gail! The funniest thing about the show is the X-Files rip-off theme, which is so alike the original that it's shameless!
