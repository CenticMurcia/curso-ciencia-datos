This is the biggest piece of crap ever filmed. I know Hungarian history and I didn't crack a smile. Not even grudgingly. The audience in the theater was either running scared or was stunned into silence at this enormity. There is no plot, only a loose set of extremely lame gags tied together by the wandering chieftains, whose main characteristics are mostly expressed by the bodily noises they produce. They go through history for no apparent reason, and meet similarly insipid, one-dimensional characters disguised as historic personalities, which we are expected to find hilarious, God only knows why. I don't know any reason why anyone would want to see this or, for that matter, make this truly tasteless, unimaginative, amorphous, poor imitation of a third rate parody.
