This is an amazing story with a lot of emotion, fun, etc... But the real thing is ... my boyfriend is Greek from Thessaloniki and we leave in different countries. We are together for almost 8,5 months. The DVDs of the episodes are provided weekly with a Greek newspaper in Greece. My boyfriend buys them and brings them to me whenever we meet. We watch them together with the Greek subtitles. The interesting news is that his mother also started watching them (not sure if this good news or not:-)). We find the episodes both entertaining and educating. It really illustrates the similarities between Turkish and Greek societies. Especially after watching them, I personally believe that similarities are more than the differences... There is a lot in it, love, fun, sadness, passion... The soundtrack is really amazing. Acting, directing is really good. I just wish, in our relationship we don't have the same difficulties that they had. I gave it a 9, because it makes me cry sometimes:-)
