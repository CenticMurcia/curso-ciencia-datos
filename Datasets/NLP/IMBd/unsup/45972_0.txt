I always try and write encouraging comments on English films, after all, there are many things they have going against them. But this film is appallingly awful. I can't say anything positive for it. The three stooges, sorry, so-called actors, are not hard at all. Three old women would provide more menace. One of the characters is most absurd. He wears different coloured strange shaped glasses every day, hardly what you'd see a tough gangster doing. The acting is extremely amateur as well. This is just so mediocre and unacceptable. Everything about it stinks to high heaven. Don't waste any money watching this film, you will deeply regret it.
