My husband and I are long time fans of George Carlin. This was a George Carlin that I had never seen in stand-up and I hope I never see again. His non-funny diatribe about human depravity and his crude discussion of human fragility was unsettling and I found it difficult to believe anyone in the audience was laughing. George is certainly one of the brightest comedians around and most of what he discussed resides in truth. But the old George could take that truth and make it funny. We did not find any of this act funny - only dark and depressing. George offered a view of the future without hope and although his view may be correct, I would prefer to hold out for a tab bit of hope. Either George goes back to pot before his next stand-up or I shall have to take it up to tolerate his new very dark attempts at humor. For god sake, lighten up George!
