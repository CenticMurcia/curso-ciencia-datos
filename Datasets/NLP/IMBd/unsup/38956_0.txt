Lame. Shockingly lame. Lame beyond belief.<br /><br />And cynical, too - Hollywood at its most exploitative and greedy.<br /><br />The original cartoons were no great shakes, but this... this really lowers the bar for TV nostalgia cash-ins.<br /><br />And to think that Rowan Atkinson used to be funny.
