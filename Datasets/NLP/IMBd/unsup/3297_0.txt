Is this the most widely theatrically distributed Filipino film in the history of cinema in the U.S. I believe so.<br /><br />This film will be an inspiration to independent filmmakers, showing what you can do with a gripping story, great originality, great field locations, a decent digital cam, no special effects, and (almost) no money, and (almost) no crew.<br /><br />The shaky camera was annoying because it was prominent for the ENTIRE film, except the final scene, where we are back in the States. I was shooting documentary footage for several weeks last October in the Philippines, and this is what your footage looks like when you are shooting from a moving jeepney. I can't stand my footage shot this way and it will end up on the cutting room floor. Here is a whole film shot this way, and it is a bit much. Many independent films have selective scenes shot this way and there is a point to them. I can only figure that they were in too much of a hurry to use a tripod, because the constant blur does't add anything to the dramatic impact of the film after the first few minutes. Too much "AUTHENTICITY" Mahhhhnnnn.<br /><br />Without the terrorism aspect, this is like a travelogue of the Philippines, unfortunately in the case of the squatter areas. I stayed in a barrio outside of Manila with poor people and it was more like the 'hood back in the States, with water rationing and no hot water, but a pile of garbage was not holding up the walls of the home where I stayed, something I noticed in the squatter areas near the Manila Airport. But EVERYWHERE you go in the Philippines, you will travel by tricycles(motorbikes/motorcycles with side cars), jeepneys, and no air con buses. Everywhere you go, if you are male, you will be invited to cockfights held in arenas the size of huge high school gymnasiums as found Stateside. Everywhere you go, there will be vendors wanting to sell you eggs with warm chickens inside waiting to have their heads bit off.<br /><br />I traveled extensively several hours to the North of Manila on Luzon Island, in areas of astonishing scenic beauty, not seen in the film. The terrorists/Muslim extremists are holed up in known spots to the South of Manila. Be careful if you go to those areas. In your first day in the Philippines you will effortlessly be able to experience all of the above, except you will not be dealing with kidnappers.<br /><br />The Philippines is a fantastic place to make a film. I will be back.
