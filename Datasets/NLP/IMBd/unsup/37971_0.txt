The Beast of Bray Road (2005) is another one of those movies that has a very good premise but the final execution is awful. A variation of the "10 little indians" theme here as a mysterious beast of lore is running around the countryside gobbling up people like pac-man scaring everyone witless in the area. The local authorities and a few do-gooders try their best to stop the terror but will it be enough to stop THE BEAST OF BRAY ROAD!!<br /><br />I tried my best to enjoy the movie because I love a good werewolf story. But this one wasn't that enjoyable. The only bright spot is the cute bartender, man she's hot. But other than that don't waste your time unless you really like bad movies.<br /><br />Not recommended
