Most people that see the Kill Bill films (especially Vol. 1) and then see a work that inspired Kill Bill, like Shurayukihime, feel let down some how that they didn't see the same exact film twice.<br /><br />No, you won't hear the main femme fatal talk about cheeseburgers, and she doesn't go to China to be trained by Pai Mei (another lifted character, BTW). But what we do get with this film is pure excitement. Ultra-violent, blood-spurting, sexy lead woman excitement, all set in a period backdrop. We get to see the work from the originators, not the imitators.<br /><br />If you like Samurai/revenge flicks, with authentic flavor, plenty of gore and some beautiful photography, check this one out. Heck, I recommend this to fans of KB Vol. 1 as well. <br /><br />Just don't expect pop culture references.
