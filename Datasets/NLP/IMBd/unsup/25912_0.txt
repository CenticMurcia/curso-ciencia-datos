I was watching TBS a few weeks ago and saw them compare '10 Items or Less' to 'The Office' in one of their advertisements. So I checked the schedule, found out when it was going to be on, set my TV to remind me that it was going to come on and got my snack and my drink all ready to watch what I thought was going to be a great show......<br /><br />Unbelievable disappointment. I sat there thinking "I could have had more fun doing nothing at all....." So I thought maybe it was just one bad episode and gave it a second chance. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />It's an outright tragedy that they can compare this trash to 'The Office' and get away with it. I was honestly appalled.<br /><br />The worst part of this show is that it really isn't funny. Not in the least bit. Some people might like this kind of humor, but I don't.<br /><br />So let me help you all out here. If you enjoy watching a bunch of people acting like idiots on camera, '10 Items or Less' is the show for you. But if you like something clever, a show that doesn't use the typical clich√©s of just about every other TV show known to man, don't even bother. You'll end up wasting your time, just as I did.
