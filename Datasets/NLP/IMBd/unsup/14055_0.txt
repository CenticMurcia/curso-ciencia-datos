The Public Enemy is the movie that made the great Jimmy Cagney a star. A great movie too.<br /><br />In 1909, two boys, Tom Powers and Matt Doyle who are best mates are causing mischief and get up to all sorts of illegal things, including pinching and selling the items onto other parties. As the years progress, so do their crimes and they end up becoming gangsters during the Prohibition Years. This leads to murder. Powers then ends up in hospital but is kidnapped. There is then a knock at the door of the family home...<br /><br />The Public Enemy includes one of the most famous scenes in cinema history when Cagney shoves a grape-fruit into his lover's face. A classic scene that one.<br /><br />Joining Cagney in the cast are blonde bombshell Jean Harlow, Edward Woods and Joan Blondell as Powers's mum.<br /><br />This is a must see for all movie fans. Fantastic.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
