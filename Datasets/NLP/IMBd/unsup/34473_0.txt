than see this film again.<br /><br />Though I did laugh at a few jokes and thought that Martha Plimpton's character was funny and real, the movie was a complete disaster and thoroughly disappointing. Most of the characters were at best wooden and at worst excruciatingly annoying and the acting performances were terrible, even from some of my favorites. For example, Christina Ricci-- normally excellent-- puts on the worst New Jersey accent I've ever heard. Also, I didn't get the feeling that this movie was taking place in the early 80's... if it weren't for the annoyingly omnipresent MTV soundtrack and a few flock-of-seagulls do's, I probably would've completely forgotten the time setting.<br /><br />To get your 1981 fix: rent a bunch of John Hughes movies, get out your old albums and look at your high school yearbook or photo albums from the time. You'll enjoy yourself-- and probably laugh-- much more.
