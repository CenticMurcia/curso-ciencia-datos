Amidst atmosphere Southern plantation swamp (Universal backlot)locations, Count Alucard (Lon Chaney) visits a "morbid" woman (Louise Allbritton). In spite of the title, Chaney is not the focal point here, it's Allbritton, who's also engaged to mortal Robert Paige. The chic blonde beauty, here in a dark wig to contrast her sister, played by lovely Evelyn Ankers, is superb, especially after being transformed into the undead, and disclosing her true plans to Paige, also fine in his tormented portrayal. Chaney is actually quite good, suave and menacing, with great macabre makeup. Special effects include a mesmerizing "gliding" bayou resurrection, bat transformations, and mist apparitions. The picture is well-directed, too, with a great musical score, leading up to a surprising finale. Enjoyable.
