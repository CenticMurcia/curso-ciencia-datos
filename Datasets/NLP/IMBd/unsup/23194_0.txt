Firstly, despite what the whiny comic geeks say, this is an above average TV show. If only more shows had the same potential, instead of executives vomiting at us with cr*ppy reality shows and poor Knight-Rider/A-team wannabe modern shows...<br /><br />The show every once in a while tries to relate to the comics what with the occasional characters like Toyman and Prankster and whatnot, but fortunately it tries to stay fresh and original and give us stories to which we don't know what will happen rather than redo some comic stories.<br /><br />It took a while to adjust to Dean Cain, but the cast was good. My only complaint was Dean Cain played CK and Superman in the same vein and didn't distinguish the two characters enough.<br /><br />What I think are the down sides of the show: Make-up and design; they couldn've done a better job of making Clark Kent and Superman LOOK different, the movies did that quite well. The special effects weren't as outstanding as they should've been; most times after the first season, we barely see Superman take off, he just waves his cape at the camera and literelly jumps two feet left or right side of the camera out of frame.<br /><br />That was kinda lame, but maybe they had a limited budget, but thankfully the writers made up for that with mostly good plots and character development and great supporting cast with the Kents, Jimmy and Perry. (Why DID Michael Landes leave??)<br /><br />The show ended waaaaay too soon for a story that's betterly known than a lot of Biblical stories and epics. Definately could've survived longer and it's a pity they have stuff like Knight Rider and Miami Vice and junk out to buy yet we have nothing to do with this show in our stores.<br /><br />If we're lucky, they'll make a feature-length comeback/on-off TV movie sometime soon. And I'd like to see those McFarlane action figures, that'd be cool... (if Smallville get figures, so should this show!)<br /><br />Great show, better than Smallville, the early cartoons and serials but as always, TV executives don't know gold when they see it.
