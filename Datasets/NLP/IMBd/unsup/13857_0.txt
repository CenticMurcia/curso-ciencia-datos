I believe some of the negative comments on this film may be do to people not familiar with the comic strip. I grew up with this comic strip and enjoyed the film very much. Daisy mae was one of my first screen sweethearts. The singing voice of Daisy Mae was Imogene Lynn, a not well known singer except in the musical crowd. I thought the song about politicians in Washington is still valid today. The plot maybe a little corny but it was able to incorporate the little aspects of the comic strip that us old timers are familiar with. Russ
