Oh yeah, cool(and terribly British) comedy. Basically jokes everywhere of how badly the war was going in 1917.<br /><br />Involving the cunning Captain Edmund Blackadder. The not so cunning Private Baldrick. The silly Leutenant(that's pronounced Leftenant in Briatin, don't ask me why)Geroge. Their commanding officer:General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmany Melchett(what a mouthful). And his second in command:Captain Kevin Darling.<br /><br />Captain Blackadder is simply trying has best to get out of this silly war with the Germans. But the idiot, General Melchett, keeps him there. Captain Darling's name is a great centre for comedy as the characters constantly address him is 'darling'(damn i've given it away) Overall, my favourite comedy. What more can I say.
