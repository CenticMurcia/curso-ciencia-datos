Animated short stories in a goth/science-fiction vein, supplemented by a rock soundtrack featuring such non-metal artists as Journey, Cheap Trick and Stevie Nicks. International product financed through the Canadian Film Development Corporation (which would explain the mostly Canadian-born voice-over talent, including John Candy, Harold Ramis, and Joe Flaherty) and distributed stateside by Columbia. The screenplay by Daniel Goldberg and Len Blum (utilizing original stories from several talented writers, including Dan O'Bannon) may intrigue youthful audiences, yet these plots fail to pop and the thing seems to last a lifetime. Worse, the look of the film is gloppy, with ugly color-schemes and foregrounds which are hardly intriguing. It made a decent (if erratic) record album, but as a movie it fails. * from ****
