The only reason i gave a 3 and not lower is because of the director's efforts to bring out a classic. The reason the 7 is lost is because he used history to his convenience and imagination. If you want to bring out a classic, why not just do that ? Pick a story that doesn't tell the kids that this was what Akbar was like. Why not Sheela-Rizwan or something that doesn't tell the kids stupid false stories about their country's history. It is a known fact that Akbar was a war monger and plunderer. His relatively liberal religious tolerance compared to his predecessors and ancestors does not make him the greatest ruler of India. It was nowhere mentioned about his warrior abilities. He is known for his administrative and political skill. Yet we are made to believe that he was a great warrior. He had 30 some wives in his harem and they are not mentioned anywhere in the film. Jodha(almost all historians agree thats not her real name) was not his first wife nor his last. We don't even have an account that says she was his favorite. Akbar didn't mention her name in his auto-biography, AkbarNama. So now a movie with an attractive star-cast with great music is being thrust down our throats with history lessons embedded. Bollywood's director's may not be the smartest of the lot but these showmen do a disservice to history and reality by painting everything rainbow when India's past is filled with loot and murder by crusaders and "native" Moguls. It is sad that everyone is happy with false history and lies in the nation that was founded by a man who spent his life finding the power of truth.
