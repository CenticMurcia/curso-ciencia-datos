This is an intense work which focuses on the immense amount of strain and stress that professional dancers must undergo on a daily basis. In this case, the three main characters were unable to cope with the pressure and left the company. Seven years later, the company's tyrranical founder has died and the remaining staff recruit the former trio to premier the work which broke their dancing careers. In the process of reviving the dance, each of the three are forced to confront the psychological, interpersonal and intrapersonal issues which have plagued them for the last seven years.Unlike many other "dance" movies in which the casts are actors who have been given a few ballet lessons, the cast of this film are real dancers. The choreography is beautiful ( in fact, I watch the opening sequence multiple times in a row) and the music is absolutely amazing, ranging from classical to neoclassical to rap.
