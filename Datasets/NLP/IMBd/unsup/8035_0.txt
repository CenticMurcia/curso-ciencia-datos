With all the things happening in America today this is a film everyone needs to see. <br /><br />Through the life of Harry Bridges I learned so much about the beginnings of worker rights (longshoremen specifically) and labor history; unionization. The story covers the US depression up to the '70s - including the McCarthy era, and much more. Harry was on the cover of Time Magazine twice, spied on by the FBI, the US spent 21 years trying to deport him without success, and as an Aussie immigrant he spent his life making our Democracy live up to it's promise of equality for every man. <br /><br />Ian Ruskin inhabits Harry as no one else could. I came away inspired by both Harry, who made a difference, and Ian who continues to make a difference by sharing Harry's life with us. <br /><br />Very funny movie with a wicked sense of humor. Great music-and hours of amazing special features-Arlo Guthie, Sarah Lee Guthrie, Jackson Browne, and more.
