This movie was filmed in Selma, Alabama in 1968. Selma still looks very much like it did in this movie - it is a town that takes you back in time... and it was the perfect setting for the film. The last scene in the movie where Mick is at Singer's grave was filmed in the beautiful old Live Oak Cemetery in the heart of the town. I used to work with a lady who had a small part in the movie when she was a preteen.... in the birthday party scene she is wearing the yellow dress. I try to go down to Selma every now and then and I always think about this beautiful story and film - and all of the wonderfully real characters... the story is so touching and melancholy. Alan Arkin and Sondra Locke were perfectly cast... as were all the supporting actors... I'm kind of glad it remains little known... such a gem I can call my own! I rank this one up there with "To Kill A Mockingbird".
