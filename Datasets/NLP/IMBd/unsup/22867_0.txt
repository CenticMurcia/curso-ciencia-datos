I just turned 18 and I've had a rough last two years and I've been kind of depressed. Anyway, i was never much of a reader and one day, about a week ago my mom bought me this old book. It was from when she was a kid from in 1974, a way long time ago, so i really didn't think much of it. It was one of those 50 cents things at the library. She went on to explain how it was such a good book and it was based on a true story and she had many memories of it from when she was about my age. But like everything else i own i tossed it on my bedroom floor, but one night i couldn't sleep, so i picked it up and gave it a shot. OH. MY. GOODNESS!!! This is the best book I've ever read, I'm just about finished it, but I really want to see the movie and I was very upset when i found out they never made a tape of it or anything and you cant find it anywhere, not on ebay, or amazon, or at blockbuster. All I found was reviews and this message thing. This book really touched me, a lot. Also there are so many things in the book which relates to my real life one of them that is less personal is how in the book the girls name is Kate, which is my name, and her daughters name is Jill, which is my moms name. Well anyway if anyone can find out a way to get this movie i would be so grateful to have just seen it once. Please, please let me know if there is a way i can get this movie!!!! Thanks!
