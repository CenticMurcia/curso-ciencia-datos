I saw this movie last night when it opened. I am a musician with 18 years of training and currently still finishing my training on the collegiate level. I thought this movie brought across some of the most wonderful aspects of music. Including the ability to produce music without knowledge of the standard conventions typically used. This is how I broke into music just by improvisation without any knowledge or technical skills yet making what I felt into music. The soundtrack is phenomenal as well and mixes new music with the standards of the classical and romantic music eras. I absolutely agree with Robin William's quote " Music is the harmonic connection between all living beings"
