Am I the only one who thinks this is poorly acted and cheesy for even 1979-80 standards? Why did the great Rock Hudson agree to do this 'space opera'? Ay yi yi! I know this was way before CG animation and special effects, but good lord, the effects on Star Trek TOS 10 years plus earlier looked better than this! The spaceships on martian Chronicles all look like models from the Hobby store!<br /><br />No wonder this mini series was shelved for a year by the producers and network. What a crappy Melodrama!<br /><br />I'd love to see a modern update film for this story. It's such a great Bradbury story.....<br /><br />Ho Hum
