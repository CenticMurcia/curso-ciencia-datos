Now I'm really glad that New Line is coming out with this new trilogy because Return of the King was a farce. At least in LOTR I could laugh at the limping Nazgul, Aragorn in his mini skirt and Boromir the Viking. This movie did not have such niceties. It was one atrocious scene after another. I have to say than when I pictured Orcs, they did not dance and sing a song called, "where there's a whip there's a way". But the new musical sequences were only a minor problem. <br /><br />This movie cut out a huge section from the middle of the book (namely Faramir, Shelob, and Gollum's treachery) which is actually REALLY important. I was also not a fan of the way they reversed Frodo and Sam's characters. Last time I checked Frodo was the doom sayer and Sam tried to be optimistic. They also skipped really quickly over important scenes and yet took ten minutes on the Samwise the Strong scene which, while important should not take up quite that much time, especially since they had to cut the book down so much to fit it into a movie. There are also several events that really didn't happen in the book that they put into the movie (but some of them would ruin the end so I won't say incase any pain seekers actually want to see it). I've heard of artistic license, but...<br /><br />If I wanted to be really picky I could go on about how Gandalf sounded all wrong and how Bilbo looked like old Mother hubbard. But Mainly I need to say that Glen Yarbourgh is the WRONG person to write music for the LOTR. His folk music twang has no place within a hundred miles of this movie. People shouldn't even listen to it when they read the book.<br /><br />Anywho, my advice to everyone is that if you want a good laugh check out the first one (LOTR) and if you seek torture then by all means, see the Return of the King.
