Pretty disappointing clone of Puppet Master with some S & M fetishism thrown in, which is the only thing that stops this getting 1 out of 5.<br /><br />Mad man discovers way to turn humans into evil, killer dolls. Madman has all girl rock band captive in a cage in his cellar, whom he makes play for him by use of electrocution. Madman has head like a pin. Madman isn't happy about most of this and tries to exact revenge upon people that have done him wrong in the business world. <br /><br />Weird, throughout, but entertaining enough to watch. If you like Puppet Master, but thought it needed some female degradation to really liven it up this might just float your boat, otherwise pass it by on the torrent shelves Wouldn't watch it again though.
