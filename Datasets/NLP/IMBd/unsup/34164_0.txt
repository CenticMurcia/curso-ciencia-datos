I can't believe that real actors like Sam Neil and Jeremy Northam got involved with rubbish like this: "The Young and the Restless" in fancy period dress. Little Jonathan, even on steroids, looks more like Justin Timberlake than Henry Tudor. A History lesson for trendy simpletons. There are so many good films of the young virile Henry VIII, as this one touts itself to be, don't waste your time on this inaccurate absurd garbage.<br /><br />Check out Keith Michell in "The Six Wives of Henry VIII", or Robert Shaw as Henry in "A Man for all Seasons"(1966). Both gave fully realized performances of the young robust king in love. Jonathan Rhys Miller seems more like a petulant male stripper than "The Defender of the Faith" - more like "The Defender of the Fey", in spite of all the extra artificial testosterone coursing through his veins.
