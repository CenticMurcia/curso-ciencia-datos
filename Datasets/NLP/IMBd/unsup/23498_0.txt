So last night, me and my roommate decide to watch it. We both liked the first one, so of course we are going to watch the second. Big mistake... Every so often I would see my roommates head just shaking, and he would then laugh or comment about what we just saw- never a good comment.<br /><br />The Graphics were just bad, the crocs just looked so fake- the skin, movement, reactions, explosions. Even the air plane was fake. The acting was below par. At least in the first one they had real choppers and planes and such, and the croc looked a lot better in the first. <br /><br />The only thing I saw hope in was the fact that Cloris Leachman was part of the film (always been great in her past roles), and she did a decent job in this role as well. She could have done a lot better than this film though . The basic story line wasn't too bad; but I have yet to see a great story line on crocs or gators.<br /><br />There are also tech problems in the film. Just things that do not truly add up or that make sense. The killing of the crocs with a knife/blade, the eggs, the explosions, the eating of the people.<br /><br />It feels like they just through this movie together. Not much effort put into it. They could have put a lot more effort into this film, to do it justice. Instead they let it flop... So I would say, spend your time watching something else.<br /><br />Actually now that I think about it, this movie is very similar to Jaws, maybe thats why the story line works. But again they didn't do it justice.<br /><br />It was a good laugh though, some funny moments, and just looking at what happens. You just want to laugh at its stupidity.
