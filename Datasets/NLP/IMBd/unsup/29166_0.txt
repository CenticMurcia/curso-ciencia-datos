This and Talespin are absolutely great, as are the Little Mermaid and Aladdin TV series, but now they are unfairly cancelled. This is one of the few shows with wit, great detailed animation, memorable characters, and truly diabolical villains in a good sense. The pilot episodes were among the best, with the devious and calculating Taurus Bulba (none other than the god of voice acting Tim Curry) but there are other great villains like NegaDuck and Megavolt. If I had a personal favourite villain, I'd go for NegaDuck. The title characters are wonderful, especially Darkwing(brilliantly voiced by Jim Cummings) and his silly catchphrases. Launchpad is hilarious in every episode, and you have got to love Gossalyn. Along with Peter Pan and the Pirates, there should be a petition to bring these shows back!Find this show on YouTube and watch it! 9/10. Bethany Cox PS. The theme tune is amongst the catchiest theme tunes in any show I have seen.
