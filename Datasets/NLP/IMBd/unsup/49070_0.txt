I haven't seen the second one, nor do I plan to since I watched the trailer for it since it was in the "Extras" section for SPM 1. I figured this one would have been good since it seemed that'd it be much like the first one. Not only that, they tried to add some storyline to it, which would have been nice if it was done correctly.<br /><br />The acting is decent compared to other horror slashers, though it was pretty bad in some parts. There is some nice gore as well, which is always a plus. I can't say much here about the movie without spoiling it, but expect A lot of lampshades getting smashed over a psychopaths head and a lot of women running from window to window in an attempt to escape.<br /><br />I would only watch this movie with friends for laughs, other then that avoid at all costs.<br /><br />Dumbest line: "No! You can't kill someone that's just lying there." Why not? He seemed to have a good time doing it to your friends...
