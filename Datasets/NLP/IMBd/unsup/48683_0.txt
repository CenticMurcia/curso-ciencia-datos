The WORST movie ever? Get real. Check out Manos the Hands of Fate. Better yet check out Savage Instinct by Troma Pictures. THEN you will have seen the face of truly awful.<br /><br />Yes The Creature Wasn't Nice is indeed painfully bad, much of the humor is flat and the plot hangs together like cottage cheese. But it also has redeeming features. The irreverent character Rodzinski is good for yucks, as is the insane Doctor Stark is over the top with his goofball lines. "What are they going to call it? The JOHN organism? It's MINE!" I agree parts of the movie are gallingly bad, but get past them, and there are moments of merit here and there. It ain't Shakespeare but there are times when it is just what I need.
