This movie was bad. Really. However, I still enjoy watching it despite the cheap props, lousy story, very horrid acting.<br /><br />Basically, James Best plays Captain Sherman who is stuck in a rut on an island. There he meets the mumbling Dr. Milo who baffles you through the whole film by not being able to say one comprehensible word of English. His great lines include, "Let me fleschen your drink", "Life sucks", and "The shoes got into the barn." He does some experiment and the results are killer shrews (dogs with shaggy wool coats). Add his dimwit daughter Ann who frets around mostly and screams.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, but this cast party must've been a blast! This film could also have been called, "Drink Booze" since almost every other scene involves people drinking. Ken Curtis plays drunk comic relief Jerry who sloshes, mumbles, and stumbles around . Add Steve Allen fan Dr. Radford (Bathroom??) and Mario and Griswold who plays the best Dixieland jazz! <br /><br />Don't miss the exciting Shrew escape scene. Comedy all around in this Jurassic Bark of a film.
