Wow. I've been watching anime now for a while, but I come to Cowboy Bebop late. <br /><br />This was worth waiting for. I will continually judge both live action film/TV by the standards I judge Cowboy Bebop. It is truly that good.<br /><br />Many before me have given reviews that I'm sure I'll duplicate, but this is truly the best anime I have EVER seen. It is a genre all its own. The music complements the show in such a way that is so rare today. The animation is wonderful. As a fan of HK action flicks, this show delivers in spades (especially the movie). It manages to transcend so many genres at once with its characters and its soundtrack.<br /><br />This is true television bliss!
