Have not seen this film in years and enjoyed viewing the youth of all the veteran actors. James Mason,(Sir Brack),"Lolita",'62, played an outstanding role, who did some very fancy sword swinging among King Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. Robert Wagner,(Prince Valiant),"Banning",'67, had great interests with the Vikings and England's King Arthur. Prince Valiant wore bangs as a very young inexperienced man striving to solve some problems his family were placed in and had a difficult time in carrying out this mission. Janet Leigh,(Princes Aleta), "Houdini",'53, looks very young and is attractive to both Prince Valiant and Sir Garwin. Sir Garwin is played by Sterling Hayden,"Crime of Passion",'who takes Prince Valiant under his supervision and plays a great supporting role through out the picture. There is great scenery at an old Castle in Scotland, which adds greatly to the production of this great Classic film from the 50's. Enjoy.
