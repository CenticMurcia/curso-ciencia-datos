I am still shell shocked, after watching this shameful waste of a beautiful island. I watched it from beginning to end as I seriously thought it was a joke, and was waiting for the big 'reveal', but it never came.<br /><br />Looking through the credits and at all of those involved, amazes me how they all got paid for this embarrassment.<br /><br />The acting (and I use that word with hesitation), was non-existent. <br /><br />I can't even try to be witty, as my head is still spinning in disbelief.<br /><br />I wonder what has happened to the cast ? Can't say that I have seen any of them on the big screen. My advice to all of them is to leave this movie off their CV's. It will do nothing for their careers.
