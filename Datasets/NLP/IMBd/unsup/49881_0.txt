My friend is on a quest to watch all things Bruce Boxleitner, and I, being a good friend agreed to watch this with her. Words cannot ex press how poorly this was acted, produced, edited, and written. I understand all the no name actors in it, no shame on them for taking a paying gig. But shame on Bruce for sullying his good name! The worst part was the concept...spoiler alert! that the Egyptians had a trans-Atlantic trade route...to Southern California. I am hoping the writers were forced to change the location due to production costs, but there could have been some sort of compromise that didn't involve stupidity. Bottom line: NEVER RENT THIS MOVIE OR WATCH IT ON TV!!!
