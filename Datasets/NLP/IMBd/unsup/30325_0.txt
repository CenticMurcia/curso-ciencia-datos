I have to say this movie deserves a lot more credit than it gets. It may have been made around the same time as The Craft, but it accomplishes a lot to set itself apart. The basic story is the same, naughty schoolgirls discover witchcraft, but the execution sets them apart. The girls in Little Witches are much more like real girls, unlike the polished cliches we get in The Craft. And while it may not have the special effects budget of a hollywood blockbuster, it does a great job with what it does have, a strong story and compelling characters. Modern, more "progressive" witches may find the views of witchcraft this movie carries to be archaic, but hey, dancing naked in circles is a favorite pasttime of witches. So even if the movie doesn't thrill you, you can at least revel in the nude scenes (if you're into that sort of thing, that is). Hands down a great find in the rental store, and it definitely deserves a dvd release of it's own.
