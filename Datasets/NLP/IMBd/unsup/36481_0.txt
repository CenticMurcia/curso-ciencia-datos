This movie tells the story about a motorcycle gang who terrorizes a filmcrew. They take the crew hostage and perform various disgusting things with them.<br /><br />If you're very interested in the old Hells Angels (pre 60's) and think that smelling bad, looking bad, drinking and driving at the same time is cool then this film is most certainly for you. If not, then you just might as well pass this one by as most other people thankfully will.<br /><br />I think the average grade that this movie(1.0 at this time) has reflects well how good this movie is.
