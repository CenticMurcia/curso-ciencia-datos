JUDY BERLIN was obviously inspired by the many comedies of Woody Allen. Everything from the black and white look (that Allen used in MANHATTAN and STARDUST MEMORIES among others), to the neuroses of it's main character David (a struggling filmmaker) to the girl he tries to win (THE SOPRANOS' great Edie Falco) to the portrayal of the parents (including the late, great Madeline Kahn, in her final performance), all suggests Woody. But the director, Eric Mendelson, making his first film, captures all these people in the same way Allen does in all their humour- but also suggests a level of sadness that Woody hardly ever did. This is a wonderful little film that should be enjoyed by all.
