This is quite possibly the most hideously anti-American anti-patriotic film ever made by a western producer.<br /><br />Persons who support the American war effort in Iraq and who are opposed to terrorism are portrayed as hateful racists who commit an unthinkable crime in the name of patriotism.<br /><br />Then, these persons are brought to justice; not by secular forces, but by the supernatural and presumably infallible forces of the spirit world. It is a feeble attempt to put a supernatural stamp of approval on holier-than-thou liberalism.<br /><br />I recommend that you watch this film just to see how deeply entrenched the forces of skullduggery have become.
