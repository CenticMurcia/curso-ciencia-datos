Although professional in scope and production, this film not only loses it's self portrayal, self review objective, it also never develops any plot line that pulls you in as a viewer. The writing is non existent and the film constantly runs along as though it was made in the same chronological fashion as the diary format it is narrated in. What you are left with is an odyssey of "my perverted world and welcome to it" over and over....and the women in Caveh's relationships almost deteriorate in value during each relationship...only to escape from him which just further tortures him. What his hang ups ensure is that the women in his life may not know what they want, but they know what they don't want....and they don't want Caveh. Why anyone would care about somebody like this or someone who has the deep rooted sexual hang ups like this is curious. Initially, as a viewer you are aligned with Caveh because you are following him as the "narrator"....and he initially connects the viewer in humorous terms....but as his sexual desires and hang ups persist.....you are left feeling sorry and uncaring for Caveh....which is how his existence comes across by movies end. Yes, some of the women in this film are gorgeous....and perhaps they are the "hook" that pulls you in as a viewer...but Caveh's constant mulling over his problems never gives the viewer any belief that Caveh intends to change enough to become the man he needs to be... Call it a fetish lifestyle...but in the end, "I Am a Sex Addict" is all about a very selfish, self centered person...who inspires nobody.
