I thought for the money invested it was a great little film. The plot was clever, without being overdone, and the cinematography was really good considering the budget. The effects were well done also, without looking too cheap (remember - "B" movie). If you want a fun movie for a dark night with a loved one this will do the job. No ... it's not an Oscar contender, but it is far better than most of the big budget horror garbage H-Wood throws our way currently. I love good horror movies and this title delivers - silly, fun, dark and entertaining. I thought the acting was also better than that in several of the most recent H-Wood releases, and a big BOO' shout out to Chuckie Williams - one of the nicest guys in the industry, and not a bad actor as the Dark Walker monster himself. A job well done.
