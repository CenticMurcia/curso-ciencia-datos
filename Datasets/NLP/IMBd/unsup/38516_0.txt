Chuck is back and still after Andy is now placed in a foster home after the tragic events of the first film since his mother was committed. In an attempt to save their reputation, the manufacturers of Chucky reconstruct the killer doll, to prove to the public that nothing was wrong with it in the first place. In doing so, they also bring the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray back to life.<br /><br />Andy soon find out that chucky is back and up to no good, of course he tell in his forester parents that doll is alive, yet again now one believes him, There some deaths scene that not gory and not even little bit scary and two of death scene are off-screen. Everything about this movie is so boring and deaths scene could not even save movie, I would say this is the Worst Child's play movie in the series I would say fast forward to last 7 minutes of movie, as it the only worth watching part of movie to see chucky getting killed off yet again.
