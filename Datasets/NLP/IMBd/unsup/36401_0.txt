The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner. They are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now, it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />This is a far from engaging episode that is, at times, embarrassing to watch. I feel a lot like the old crank in the episode when I say that the sight of a lot of oldsters running about pretending to be children is pretty embarrassing. Plus, the whole thing seemed very preachy and silly if you ask me. My advice is watch the series--just don't expect much from this particular episode.
