As with many of our current 'dramas', and i admit i never watch them much, Neighbours has fallen with age into the decaying modern age, and with it, any hope of remaining a good watch. The life of the families of Ramsay Street is anything but entertaining, and as with all 'soap opera dramas' it is extremely shallow, a character may hate someone one minute and love them the next, etc. Due to this i would hardly even look at it's name on a TV guide. However, because it is Australian... Due to it being set in Australia rather than America or Britain (where incidentally for a long time it was a smashing hit, old chap) it IS more down to earth, and it is more realistic, but the margin is thinning year by year. As with all soap dramas, it's pathetic excuses of cliffhangers and good acting put to waste in unbelievably stupid scenes makes it hardly worth watching, if at all. Seriously, watch the news and do yourself a favor. That's REAL drama!
