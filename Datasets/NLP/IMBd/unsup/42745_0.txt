Myself and my partner decided to give this movie a try we went by the trailer. I wish that we had spent our time doing something more constructive.. Party at my house for a 24 hour paint watching marathon. Getting back on track.. Velvet luv. oh boy. I think I have seen better acting at a school play. 2nd grade I should say.. "you make me hot baby" When we started seeing the scenes with velvet in them my thoughts were you gotta be kidding me, is this a low grade horror movie or some cheesy porn flick. we decided to follow through with the movie to see what exactly happens, unfortunately the plot was too obvious and we ended up guessing what was going to happen. Some reason I felt psychic, now if only I could have predicted the lottery numbers then I would have been set, unfortunately this movie is too predictable. If your thinking of watching this, I would seriously think twice, due to the poor acting, little tips though... when you place a false hand made of silicon or rubber.. make sure that you don't shine a light onto that prop, and for the woman in stockings when you act dead, try not to clasp your hand around the other actors hand and most important of all... ( Don't Blink ) I am not going to spoil it for you guys as thats the type of person I am, so if your going to watch it.. good luck, oh by the way.. This movie should actually carry a government health warning! ( This film can cause serious manic depression for the hour and half of your life )
