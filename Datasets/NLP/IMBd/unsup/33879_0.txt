This Christian Slater vehicle, which follows hard on the heels of "Heathers", is along the same lines as his 1989 hit, but it is nowhere near as good. Slater is smart-mouth D.J. 'Happy Harry Hardon', who broadcasts on his pirate radio station from 10 p.m. nightly. His rebellious attitude is soon adopted by his many teenage listeners, and the once troubled High School is soon in mayhem. 'Mark' ('Happy Harry') never quite does the right thing, as he continues to transmit even though he knows he should stop.<br /><br />Allan Moyle's film only succeeds in being irresponsible. It does not give our youth a message of hope, but a message to stick it up everyone and do whatever they please. Hardly sensible!<br /><br />Sunday, August 16, 1992 - Video
