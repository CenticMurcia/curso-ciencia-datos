This movie is a great portrayal of the Abbott book. The graphics are very well done and shows what can be done today with some determination and a home computer. I think someone who didn't understand the concepts of the universe and how our perception of dimensions controls what we believe will have their eyes opened to the possibilities raised if dimensions we don't know about exist.<br /><br />The weaknesses I see in this film were in the one-dimensional voices. There was little emotion and passion. It sounded like something I would hear in an elementary school production. Some of the transitions between scenes seemed awkward and occasionally it was unclear exactly what was supposed to be happening, though I find many films based on books have this problem.<br /><br />All in all the movie is a success. I highly recommend it as an entertaining and educational experience and a nice change from the standard Hollywood fare.
