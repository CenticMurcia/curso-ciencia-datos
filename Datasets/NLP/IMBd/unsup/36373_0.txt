wow...since Batman started this whole "re-boot" thing a few years back, everyone's going "re-boot" crazy if not "re-make" crazy...<br /><br />Short and sweet, it's another slasher film...nothing is elaborated on in reference to the previous canon, which is probably the biggest disappointment. Pam V. only gets a whopping 1 or 2 min of screen time. I guess with that in tow, we'll never meet his dad, how he was conceived (what kind of man does Mrs. Voorhees let in her bed anyways?), we'll never know his emotional significance of growing up in the wilderness alone, did he try to connect/rebel, etc. Tom Foolery's review on here probably puts it best so read his for more detail on the film's drawbacks.<br /><br />On the positive side there were some nice boobs and nudity in the film, and it was at least better executed (no pun intended) than parts 6 thru 10 (though 10 story wise is probably more entertaining).<br /><br />In summary: Like TCM, not anywhere as good or creepy as the original (or in the case parts 1 thru 4) BUT better than latter day sequels. My Bloody Valentine's re-make was far more entertaining however, and if you have to choose, go see that instead (especially if you're an old time like myself).
