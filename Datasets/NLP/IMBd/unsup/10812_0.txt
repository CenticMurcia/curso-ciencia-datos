I am always pleasantly surprised when a movie comes along that I have no expectations about and then it turns out to be a lot better than many other, well-known releases. This was one such movie.<br /><br />The story is very simple (in a nutshell: people attacked by werewolf at remote cabin and surviving teens decide to put an end to the beats), I kept waiting for some twist that didn't appear so don't make that mistake, and the execution isn't going to provide any masterclass for film-makers.<br /><br />But, and it's a big but here, there are some really neat ideas contained within and some great gore moments that will satisfy the horror fans who like their movies awash with blood. This movie is not a non-stop gore-fest but it does sprinkle enough claret around when the action gets hairy. I don't want to spoil anything for newcomers so will just say that I was also greatly surprised by the actual werewolf (some decent makeup used there, shame about the few bad CGI shots that interfere with what could have been some great transformation sequences) and how he behaved, I may be mistaken but there were a few things here that felt pretty original and unique and that's no bad thing.<br /><br />As for the cast, we have the usual collection of disposable teens with two young leads who don't do too badly at all and there are some solid scowls provided by Richard "best known as the baddie from Kindergarten Cop" Tyson as he brilliantly menaces those around him and struggles with his own problems. Everyone else is dependable enough though it is a shame that we get the usual "dumb victim behaviour" from some characters who should have really known better.<br /><br />Throw in some nice in-jokes for genre fans and a couple of fun cameos, including David "American Werewolf" Naughton, and you have quite a treat for fans of the fur 'n' fangs sub-genre. I gave a lot of internal debate to my final score of 7/10 but, what the heck, it's worth it despite it being not much more than disposable fun.<br /><br />See this if you like: The Howling, Ginger Snaps, Werewolf: The Devil's Hound.
