Man, is this different! This is a "Biblical" account as seen through the eyes of black people during the earlier days of the 20th century. I put "Biblical" in quotes because, if you HAVE read the Bible you know that most of the stuff in this film is hardly an accurate account of the Bible.....but it's more of a parable, I think, than any literal translations.<br /><br />No, they did NOT wear suits and ties and carry guns around in Old Testament days. Trust me. Better yet, look it up! And God is portrayed near the end of the film as a confused, almost stupid Being. That part disturbed me, but most of this is very good entertainment and meant to be that, period.<br /><br />I just enjoyed it for the musical comedy it was, nothing more. The grammar in here is so bad, and the story so ludicrous.....you just have to laugh out loud. A few decades ago, the word "camp"" came out to describe certain overly-corny things. This movie is camp: it's so bad, it's good.
