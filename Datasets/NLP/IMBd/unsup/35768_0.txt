The straight to video sequel is pretty good in the story department, it is just some of the script that could have been a bit better. Simba (Matthew Broderick, again) is now The Lion King and has wife Nala and a new daughter Kiara to be Queen, she is voiced by Scream's Neve Campbell when she is older. Basically while exploring the kingdom with Timon (Nathan Lane, again) and Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella, again) she meets Kovu, a lion from the bad part of the kingdom. Unfortunately they fall in love, this is bad for both Simba and the villain who has taken over from Scar, Zira (Suzanne Pleshette). Also starring James Earl Jones as Mufasa, again. The people missing are Rowan Atkinson as Zazu and Whoopi Goldberg as the female hyena. Adequate!
