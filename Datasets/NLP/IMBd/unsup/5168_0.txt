This film is terrible. What makes this all the more unfortunate is that the film has a solid idea and a great cast. The idea was used to much better advantage in Abbott and Costello's 1942 comedy for Universal "Ride 'em Cowboy". Coincidentally Dick Foran also appears in that film although as a character similar to Dick Powell's, the phony cowboy. Pat O'Brien plays his standard fast talking promoter to perfection but adds very little to the proceedings. It's hard to believe that this was the same year that he did both "Boy Meets Girl" and "Angels With Dirty Faces", both co-starring James Cagney. The songs are less than memorable. It's great fun to see a very young Ronald Reagan in a supporting role.
