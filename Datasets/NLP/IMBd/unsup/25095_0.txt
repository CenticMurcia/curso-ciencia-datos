A small, uplifting film that has a surprisingly full body. Very strong performances by Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey. They just seem to fit together naturally. I suppose that their naturalness on-screen in this film can be credited largely to their considerable talents. But, bless whoever cast them together for seeing their possibilities.<br /><br />The film's premise was very engaging. The action was well paced. Most of the characters actions and reactions rang true. There was some good humor, particularly regarding the dog.<br /><br />The dab of history laid out in the storyline was tantalizing. I suspect that there is some grain of truth to Lillian's recounting of pertinent historical events.<br /><br />I think that Wilford Brimley contributed greatly to the success of the story. Having his narration start things off was a stoke of genius. He brings such gravitas and authenticity to everything he does that the viewer encounters absolutely no difficulty suspending disbelief as necessary to embrace fully the storyline.<br /><br />The locations were fantastic and the cinematography was inspiring. After first seeing the theatrical release, I rushed home and scoured my trusty atlas to locate the Oxbow Quadrangle in northwestern Montana. I just knew that it was a place that I would love to explore someday with my kids. When that search proved fruitless, I went online to the State of Montana's website, only to be frustrated once again. It was not until the movie first hit TV (HBO, I think) that I endured the credits to learn that it had been filmed in Alberta, Canada and Mexico.<br /><br />I also loved the theme music.<br /><br />I have seen this film about 15 times in the past 10 years. It never disappoints me.
