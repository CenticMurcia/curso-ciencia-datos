Oh My Goddess is very addicting and it is a great gift for girlfriends. A must see! I was addicted to the movie set and I gave this to a friend and she likes it! This should be the top 10 best-animated films. This movie set (5) has comedy and romance that any other movie I have seen. I see how the main characters, Keiichi and Belldandy, really captured your heart. I really like how it started yet the ending can't be forgotten. With other characters, such as Skuld and Urd, makes the saga more interesting. I would also say that it captures the same style from the Manga (comic books) that is very funny and romantic. Just look at the intro and you get into it. I can't wait for the movie.
