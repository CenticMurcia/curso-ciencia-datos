This is one of the most unintentionally funny movies I've ever seen. I think that while Richard Grieco might be good looking, he's still pretty much a cheese-puff! The movie is about a man who is dying of a genetic illness, and a doctor (Jackie) who randomly falls in love with him and in order to save him decides to mix cat DNA with his. How this actually works I don't know, maybe they explained it, but honestly you won't find yourself hanging on the edge of your seat to find out.<br /><br />Anyway, like all unneutered male cats he goes off in search of another cat in heat, which is how we meet Imogene, a half woman/ half bird dancer. This leads to the worst dance scene in any movie ever.<br /><br />Eventually it all becomes a game of cat and mouse (or cat and bird woman), which leads to an ending that makes no sense whatsoever! If you get a chance to see it, please do. It's well worth the time to watch the horrible acting and terrible storyline! Enjoy!
