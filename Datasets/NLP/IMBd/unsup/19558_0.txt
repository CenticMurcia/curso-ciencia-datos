HSM 1 was really good. I guess they didn't expect it to be such a such a success and didn't really mind that much how it turned out. That's why it all went wrong with HSM 2, Disney tried so hard not to make it the exact same things as the first movie, that they made it in too something worse. Don't get me wrong though, it was a good thing that they didn't make it in to the same thing, but the songs were bad and it just doesn't seem to live up to the first movie. So here's my opinion; I'm going to tell you the good things about the movie, and I'm going to tell you exactly what's wrong with it.<br /><br />Let's start with the characters: Sharpay Evans turned into a squeaky voiced, annoying girl. Her crush on Troy was a good thing for the movie, though. And in the end, she turned out pretty nice. Troy Bolton was selfish and didn't care much for his friends during the movie. Gabriella Montez was OK, but way better in HSM.<br /><br />next...<br /><br />The idea of Summer was nice, and good for a change... but the talent contest thing was exactly the same thing as the musical at East High.<br /><br />Also, I love the fact that they focused more on Ryan Evans, who has to take a lot of crap from his sister Sharpay. He was very deserving of the award, and I'm glad his sister finally realized that her brother works way harder than she does.<br /><br />So, I'm glad I watched HSM 2, for Ryan's sake. But, HSM 2 will never live up to HSM, and I doubt there will be an HSM 3. High School Musical was a movie meant to have no sequel. It ended great, and Disney should have kept it at that. I'm sorry to say this, but I find HSM 2 a very bad movie and by all means do not watch it... unless you care for Ryan Evans, who's clearly more talented then all of East High.
