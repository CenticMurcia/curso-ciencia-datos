"WEST" is an honest and confident film that made me sit up and pay attention. To Daniel Krige's credit he has written and directed highly complex characters true to people who have experienced their youth in the western suburbs of Sydney. This film does not judge the characters it presents, but rather reveals people who are trying to do their best to "break the mould" with limited options for advancement. "WEST" explores the durability of bonds forged in youth (between Pete and Jerry) via the introduction of a catalyst (Cheryl) and unapologetically portrays the potency of unbridled sexual love for another in a young mind. In this film such all-consuming passion accompanied by the bitterness of complete betrayal has the power to destroy everything in the end. I was extremely moved and impressed after watching this film, which is a rare experience in the current climate of Australian films, which tend to stereotype real people with comedic intent. The cinematography and soundtrack of "WEST" adds to a dark and almost pulsating atmosphere, which matches the struggle behind every hefty decision these characters make. Solid acting and great direction also make this film a must see.
