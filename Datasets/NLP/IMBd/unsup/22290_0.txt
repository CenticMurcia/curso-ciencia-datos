--that this was intended as a hoax when it was made. Its "story" is so disjointed and its "effects " are so laughably shoddy that I can't really believe that the filmmakers were serious about this. I think a good indicator that this was intended as a laugh is the drawing of a UFO on a piece of lined notebook paper that is clearly being held up so the cameraman can shoot it. Apparently they didn't have an easel, good paper or a competent artist! Where the film truly goes off the rails is when the host begins blathering about the aliens being from planet Ummo. Nothing really leads up to it-- they just introduce it without so much as a how do you do! This is one that will have you laughing for real!
