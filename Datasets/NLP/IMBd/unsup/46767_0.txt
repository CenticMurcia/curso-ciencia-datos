Because of the warning of gratuitous violence with the provision that "no one under 17 will be admitted", I found myself stumbling into this movie on the Classic Television Showbiz site. It concerns a struggling painter (director Abel Ferrara) who lives with two women-one his lover who left her husband and another a druggie who's the other woman's lover and hangs with a punk band that just moved in another apartment room-as he tries to fight his demons by drilling holes into many homeless men that live below. There's some details I've left out but while there's some interesting developments later in the narrative, especially at the end, it's mostly pretty repetitious concerning the killings though there's also a sexy shower scene with the female roommates and some pretty entertaining guitar licks during the punk band scenes as well as one amusing scene at a bus stop with one derelict constantly bothering other patrons. Knowing this director later made the cult movie Ms. 45, which I have yet to watch, I approached this movie with some interest but I'd only recommend The Driller Killer if you're interested in anything Mr. Ferrara made and not if you want to watch a slasher flick (though those drill scenes can be fascinating to watch).
