I first saw this movie late at night on TBS. I read the info. of it and wanted to check it out just because Alicia Silverstone and Christopher Walken was in it. Once it started I instantly thought it would come out OK, the plot was great. It was hilarious when Alicia tied herself up then locking herself in the trunk. All of a sudden this actor comes along, I assumed it was Benicio Del Toro cause thats what the info said. Anyway I knew I'd seen him somewhere and thought this would be interesting. The acting responses he gave were great and at first I thought he couldn't speak English cause he doesen't say a word till he goes to the diner for coffee, waiting for the telephone. Anyway the fight scene with them is great, I love how as they stick together they gradually become friends, then well you can probably guess but I wont say. Anyway I too gradually came to really liking Del Toro till he became one of my favorite actors!!!:) This was such a movie worth staying up for!! the acting and chemistry between Alicia and Benicio I think it's great, you see for yourself and if you don't agree than poor you!!! love it!!!! First Benicio movie I'd ever seen!!!
