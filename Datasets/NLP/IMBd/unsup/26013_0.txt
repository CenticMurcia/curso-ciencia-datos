Well as the heading explains it, its another sci-fi horror-o-suspense mix-up. As if the first movie was not painful enough to watch, we have another one (yawn!). And yes, they don't get the chemo formula right this time either, and thats for the second time (Someone needs to take these scientists out of the lab and fire them.. twice!). Another bad blend of damsel in distress, ex special forces and a big bad corp out to get you, there you have a movie..... Its suffers from bad direction to bad acting and a worn down script. You can guess whats gonna happen next, so not much of a suspense either. In case your GF has dumped you and you having nothing better to do in life. Go ahead and watch this one....<br /><br />Now I wished I could have disappeared after seeing such crap.<br /><br />NM.
