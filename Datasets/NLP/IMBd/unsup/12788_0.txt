Oh man,"Hausu" is an extremely weird and grotesque horror parody.It is also supremely stylish and visually mindblowing.The plot of "House" is quite easy to describe:seven schoolgirls travel to visit grandmother at her spooky old house.It's not clear whose grandmother she is,as every character in the movie is referred to by a nickname and they all call the old woman Ojii.The house turns out to be a demon that wants to eat them and grandmother is apparently a cat.Words can't describe how positively bizarre this movie is.It plays like the cross between "Suspiria" and "Beetlejuice".There are plenty scenes of kitschy humour plus some scares for example when one of the girls tries to sneak the watermelon out,she finds a human head down the well instead.One girl is even eaten by a piano in a very gory fashion and the dead victim's fingers are still playing the piano after being bitten off.9 out of 10.
