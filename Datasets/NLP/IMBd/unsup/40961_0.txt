The fans are so embarrassingly credulous. They have bought the whole package, hook, line and sinker. There's absolutely no doubt in their minds that cavemen from Afghanistan organised a successful attack on the world's most expensive air force. They certainly believe the official line that Iraq was involved, too. The government told them so enough times --- in fact certain tenacious hardliners still do. I wonder how they explain their appointed President losing interest so rapidly in capturing Osama Bin Laden? <br /><br />They watch a film (this one) that shows a hijacker wearing a bomb-belt, when he was earlier shown going through X-ray security at Newark airport. Now either Argenbright Security was bent, United was in on the deal, or there was no bomb-belt, because otherwise the relatives would be going berserk with lawsuits. The film is an utter fake.<br /><br />The cellphone calls could never have happened. The airlines are only now installing the pica-cell technology to make them work. How come none of the other 200 passengers on the other three airliners were reported making cellphone calls? The cellphone calls were vital on Flight 93 to get the details of the "hero" legend across, which would then be used by the Pentagon as a recruiting campaign for invading Iraq. Because they were impossible, there would be no billing paperchase in the case of an independent inquiry, but enough people believed they could work to start a war. Now they make a movie to persuade people it was all possible.<br /><br />That Todd Beamer phone call, the one where he is supposed to have said "Let's Roll" -- that was not made to his pregnant wife. That call was reported by the enormous Verizon corporation, which just happened at the time to have a $1.5 billion contract with the US government and the Pentagon for high-level communications systems. Even his wife was stunned that he was supposed to have recited the Lord's Prayer and Psalm 23 --- read her ghost-written book, where she admits just that. They only called to tell her about her husband's call after a full working week had elapsed --- Monday morning to Friday night.<br /><br />And the cockpit voice recording that was miraculously found, it was totally useless for establishing what happened. Read Gere Longman's Among the Heroes, even he admits the recording was useless.<br /><br />This film is for little pudding babies in kiddy-chairs gaping at the screen, sucking it all in with no brain operating at all. The state of American viewers is truly desperate...
