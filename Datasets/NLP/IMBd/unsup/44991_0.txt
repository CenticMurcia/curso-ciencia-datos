(Possible spoilers)<br /><br />I've just watched this film for the first time. On dvd in a nice widescreen presentation, oh dear i wasted my money on this one. The problem with this film is that there are so many great actors involved that they only get a small amount of screen time each, making it very hard for the audience to really care what happens. This is a shame as the story is a noble one. Also this film is one of the most boring to sit through, as nothing really happens, even in the last few minutes. Only a brief scene with Faye Dunaway in black leather knee length boots piqued my interest, an inappropriate scene for such a film, but much needed, wow what a beautiful woman. The whole film feels flat, from the direction to the non-existent pacing, at no time is there any sense of tension or intrigue, atmosphere or excitement. The dialogue should have been far stronger for a film of this kind, with real emotions firing off aboard the ship. Instead there is a general feeling of going through the motions with little regard for any prospective audience. No one is bad, but as i say no single actor except for maybe Max Von Sydow has enough onscreen time to develop their respective character beyond more than an outline. At best you'll be playing ActorSpotting and thinking about having too much of a good thing for too little time. My score 4 / 10
