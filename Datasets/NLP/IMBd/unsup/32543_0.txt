I was actually excited to see this film especially since I loved the original. What can I say about this movie except horrible. I feel bad because there are people out there who wait tables work in restaurant cleaning just to get an acting gig. They go through schooling and acting classes. YET they manage to get the worst actors of all time. They all sounded as if they were reading the script. The dialog was horrible. The script was horrible which made it even more difficult for the actors to make it seem real so it's not 100% their fault. The ending was completely predictable and obvious as opposed the the classic what the hell ending of the original that still makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand. The killings were basic repeats of the original primarily the first killing. The only reason I would give it a 1 is because of the murder scene in the woods (you know what I'm talking about) and the broom stick scene. The annoying fat guy was just horrible, I felt no sympathy for him whatsoever since he was a pain in the @$$ to others as well not mention the worst actor of them all. If you're a fan of the series, give it a look because everyone has their own opinion but don't say I didn't warn you.
