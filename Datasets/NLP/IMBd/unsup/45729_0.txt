Ticker has so much wrong with it, I am at a loss at where to begin. Really, this film has it all: bad acting, everyone from extras to lead actors seems to be in a daze as they offer up their lines. Bad accents, even Dennis Hopper's. It comes and goes as if half of the movie was filmed before they decided that his character should have an Irish (?) accent. Poor production, including but not limited to, sacrificial police vehicles, at least a decade and a half old and dressed up just enough to appear as a working car before being blown up. Several rent-a-helicopters that don't even get a generic "Police Department" sticker slapped on the side. Or, how about a hand grenade that, when detonated, erupts as a fireball instead of a shower of fragmented metal. My personal favorite though, is the late model BMW convertible that, just before exploding, turns into a not so late model BMW 4-door sedan. Also, are we really expected to believe that after so many police officers and civilians have been killed, and so many buildings in the city have been blown up, that the only person making any decisions as to how the whole situation is handled, is Joe Spano's beleaguered captain. I ended up giving this film a "2" for two reasons. The first being that after a while, it was almost entertaining watching for the next goof. Secondly, I gave it a "2" because, no matter how unlikely it seems, there is probably at least one movie that is worse, and I'll need to have the "1" available for that.
