Okay, this is a rather bad movie. I'm sorry, it just is. However, it's hilarious in that way! Anyways, on with the plot/summary. The big action hero "John Blade" is a cop, and he's one of those "mean" cops but does it to be nice (you know). And then there's the evil corporation, SiNtech. Which, apparently no one thinks they are evil... Even though they are called SIN and they operate out of a GIANT EVIL looking black TOWER. So it turns out SiN is making crazy monsters to take over the world, and of course Blade is the only one who can stop them. Also, all the other cops are apparently on SiNtechs side, so there. ANYWAYS, this movie is worth watching for the lines "cut him off!" (sounds hilarious) and my all time favorite dialog exchange that goes something like this... "Your hand's cold... Why is it like that" "Well you know what they say." What do they say? They don't tell you, the next line does not allude to it at all. I personally know of no such phrase... Any help is appreciated. One last little observation, all the cars/planes/what-have-you belonging to the cops are all marked 66. Probably making it hard for them to contact each other...<br /><br />I personally have not played much of the game this is "based" on, but I'm sure it is not as bad as this was. Good for a laugh if you have a few friends and are REALLY tired (seriously). This movie is just over-the-top, but in a ludicrous way, things happen that don't make sense, and not in the "smart" or "scary" or "cool" way, in the "what the f... HAHAHA!" way.
