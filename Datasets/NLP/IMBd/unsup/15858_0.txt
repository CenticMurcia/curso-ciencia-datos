18 year old fatherless Tina (Jessica Pare) is a Canadian female hockey player who rises to stardom as a model when a small time sports photographer snaps her pic. One would think that a mockumentary about the superficiality of the entertainment/ modeling industry would have some bite behind it. But sadly this is far from the case with this film which paints it's humor in extremely broad strokes and is often as superficial as the industry that it's supposedly parodying. The fact that the film comes from the usually quite dependable Deny Arcand only pours salt in an already gaping wound. When you get down to it, the sad fact is that we've seen this same plot done MUCH better in the past and more than likely we will again in the future.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Jessica Pare gives glimpses of her ass & a VERY nice shot of her magnificent natural melons(but you have to struggle with the film for a tad more than an hour to get to this, so just skip this and watch her in "Lost and Delirious" instead) <br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Where i saw it: @ Max
