I like bad movies as much as the next guy but this one is just BORING. When i first started watching it I was under the impression it was about 70 minutes. I got up to the part where he was about to turn into "BLACKENSTEIN" and looked at the box again to read the time. I saw that it was about two hours long and i decided that 45 minutes of torture is enough for me. It's just so BORING the gag of the title wears off quick when you see what it actually looks like on screen.
