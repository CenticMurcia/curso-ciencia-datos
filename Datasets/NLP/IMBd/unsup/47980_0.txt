So, who else noticed that Jennifer has had a nose job? She actually looked Greek when she was younger! "Leprechaun" dances on the screen, a courageously terrible little horror jig that could have only come out in 1993, when movies this bad actually got halfway decent actors.<br /><br />The movie starts out with some promise as an elderly couple is tortured by a fiesty lil leprechaun who has been robbed of his pot of gold. We are treated to an old lady falling down some stairs and an angry husband who proceeds to lock the lil fella inside of a crate in his basement. Fast forward ten years and a young Jennifer Aniston and her father happen to move into the house. A half-wit accidentally releases the leprechaun from the crate and all hell breaks loose. By all hell breaking loose, I mean not much really breaks loose at all.<br /><br />The highlight of this film for me was seeing the leprechaun rip a dude's face to shreds and snap a guy's neck then ride a go-cart.<br /><br />Watch for the 'retarded' guy who played Francis in "Pee Wee's Big Adeventure." Boy, whatever happened to that fine actor? 3 out of 10, kids.
