I have loved the book series since it came out in '79. it is, in fact, my very favorite novel Ever! my advice: if you've never read the books, you'll like the movie. if, instead, you have read and loved the series, stay far, far, far away from the film. you will be disappointed, don't go there! I had, admittedly, high hopes Before the flick premiered. my best friend and I walked out, at the end, muttering:" why in the name of God, would TPTB do That?!?!?!?!" <br /><br />it's not a bad film, per say, it's just not my cup of tea. does, I suspect, work as a thriller or horror story. the acting is okay by most involved. music's not bad. FYI: does not show, in my opinion, or hint at the incestuous relationship between Cathy and Chris. which, as we all know, is the cornerstone to the book mythology. ending is also markedly different than the novel.
