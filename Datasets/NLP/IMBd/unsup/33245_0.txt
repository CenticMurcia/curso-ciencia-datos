This is a film that is loosely derived from the Greek myth of Theseus. Here the hero Theo also goes to join a contingent of youths taken to be sacrificed to the minotaur. He is also helped by a woman - the consort of the evil Bad Guy. Bad Guy incidentally is a cross between Morpheus from The Matrix (and thinking about that, Theo is a bit like Neo) and the evil person in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Lastly it is set in some bygone classical age as well.<br /><br />However it has a dark moody backdrop throughout, strange jarring cinematography, and alternating pseudo-philosophical dialogue and clich√©s. The characters are all trite and very annoying. It is amazing how dull the film is for the first 3/4. Even the labyrinth is not creepy, just a boring excursion looking for lost girlfriends, random vagabond dwellers, and exits. It does get slightly better once most people die though.
