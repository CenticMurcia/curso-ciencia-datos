A mystery in two eras? Unfortunately, after about 15 minutes I couldn't give damn what happened. The premise -- an 19th century author who is a mysogenist and also writes about love and dedication (say what?) might be revealed to have had a secret lover. Just say it isn't so! No, that would be just incredible. What's the big deal? It's not like it was the search for the Pope's secret lover, just some poet. If that ridiculous plot doesn't intrigue you, neither will the ridiculous, unbelievable lines that are uttered throughout this boring movie as they move to a predictable ending. Really, you wont care. The "love story" of the modern day is predictable and has no chemistry. The love story of generations is ridiculous. The "clues" that are discovered in various places are preposterous. This is a movie that overstates its importance every minute and ends up as the farce that it is, which might explain why it was out of theaters almost instantly.
