I suppose I could rate this Indie flick differently in different areas and perhaps, its technical merit is as good as any million dollar drama.<br /><br />On an entertainment level, there are some people who will be depressed by it. Why not, people of little culture, education and finance. Perhaps this is a type or urban hell we middle classes have denied?<br /><br />When contrasting the life of the characters here with the Queen, one becomes angry. Could all these obese and sad people have been left behind by the selective educational tracking of the U.K.?<br /><br />People such as my self watch and take from it as low as one is, there always appears a tier beneath.<br /><br />The characters may be real to life, but hopeless and sad. Generally, for a good flick we need a bit more I fear.<br /><br />Yes, there probably is no real message here, at least one I could easily see.<br /><br />Generally speaking the flick is depressing so please kids don't watch it with a gun in the house.
