Can someone please tell me what the "heck" this movie is about? I am a HUGE blood and gore fan but this was thoroughly a disappointment. It had no "real" plot....no story line.........it wasn't even worth the DVD rental of $4.00! HUGE, HUGE disappointment. I noticed that it had some "names" associated with it like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Did these guys even bother to read the script? and if they did...they should have just taken the money they invested in this and burned it....at least they would have gotten more from it. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone! In fact it was so bad I actually took it back to my video rental place and requested my money back. Horror fans...stay far away from this one. It's just a waste of time.
