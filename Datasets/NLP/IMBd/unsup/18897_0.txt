People who don't make even the slightest effort to understand a film, should at least refrain from commenting on it as they only reveal their complete ignorance.<br /><br />I don't know what kind of a zombie one must be to concentrate on the accents, the cast, the car or whatever and not be able to feel the slightest bit of emotional involvement with the characters and the story?<br /><br />I'm not even going into what makes the film great and why one should see it. Experiences of grief, sorrow and hopelessness cannot be put easily into words.<br /><br />But the film offers much more deeper insights than those alone and also a lot of hope for the future.<br /><br />It asks the right questions about where we the common unimportant people stand in the "World Wide War on Terror" and even has the courage to answer them correctly.<br /><br />Go and watch it and try to put yourself into the story, because weather you like it or not, you ARE part of it.
