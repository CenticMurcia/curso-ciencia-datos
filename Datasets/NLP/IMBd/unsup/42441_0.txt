Bond for the mindless set: no class, no elegance, no humor, a Bond who looks extremely ill at ease in a dinner jacket, violence for violence's sake, endless explosions and fights... in fact, just another car-chases-explosions-and-guns film of the kind that Hollywood cranks out by the dozen, even if this one wasn't made in Hollywood. I yawned through it and left before the end. <br /><br />This movie has been clearly aimed at a different market, at a public that consumes tons of popcorn and chats on mobiles (cellphones) while watching a movie. It is, you might say, a "chav" Bond. Daniel Craig would be more believable as a truck driver than as a classy character such as the real Bond we all knew and loved.<br /><br />If you are a Bond fan, stay away from this garbage.
