A very short comment really, the title kinda sums it up. How the hell did this concept for a 'film' get past the numerous vetting stages of production? Why was money spent on it when people in the world are going hungry? How could they try to pass off a guy in the worst monkey suit in the world as an actual monkey? It is the most appaling, un-funny, dull, predictable piece of crap that I have ever seen in my entire life. Urgh.
