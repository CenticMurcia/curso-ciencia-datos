This anime show was entertaining and fun for the most part that kept me watching and even getting the entire series. HOWEVER, like all good anime shows, there were characters that made it painful, as well as drag the show to it's not so wonderful ending...<br /><br />WARNING, THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER(S). YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.<br /><br />For those who know the show or don't, here's a quick recap: Teenage girl stumbles onto magical well. Teenage girl gets dragged into well by evil demon. Teenage girl gets dragged into feudal japan and thus begins her adventure with a half demon/half human, a demon slayer, a monk and a demon child in gathering a sacred jewel shard scattered across the land. This is so it doesn't fall into evil hands like the ever bothering and never dying demon Naraku.<br /><br />It's pretty cool and very entertaining. But as i mentioned before there were characters that made the show often times not fun and just annoying where you wanted it to end.<br /><br />So there's the character Kikyo that made it to the top of the, 'i-hate-this-character-why-won't-he/she-die-already!?', list. The problem with kikyo is that she's a dead priestess who, in the past life, loved the half human/half demon and now wants him dead yet still claims she loves him. ...not the kind of character that makes sense, since she's always switching sides and constantly disrupts the flow of an episode she's in. There's also Kagome, the teenage girl who stumbles in the well. i mean, she is the reincarnation of kikyo in the present life, with all the powers of a priestess....yet she doesn't have the 'stamina' to be headstrong. always the damsel-in-distress, and can i say she might have a slight amnesia problem cause folks, she constantly screams/shouts 'INUYASHA'!!! i mean either she needs his help or wants attention that makes the viewer get a headache. I can go on and on about other characters but the main characters i felt that made the show drag to it's not so great finish were these two. Though in the manga kikyo dies, the director/creator felt it necessary to keep the dead priestess alive in this show for some unknown reason...and kagome? come on, you'd at least think she'd grow up.<br /><br />NOW, by now you're probably not thrilled to watch the show. BUT WATCH IT!! it's very fun with it's other characters that put the well-earned effort into making this show fun. Sesshomaru, Miroku, Sango, Koga, even Inuyasha make the series and the films worth the annoyance of two characters. My opinion, the show gets 8/10 cause of the two characters that made it miss out 10/10. But hey, maybe you'd find the characters i don't like enjoyable. it's all up 2u in the end, so watch and judge for yourself.
