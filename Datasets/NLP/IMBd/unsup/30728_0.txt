I first saw this film just after I left the Navy in '73. Back then, it seemed like an interesting film. I'd been a long-time fan of Rock Hudson, especially his film roles in "Man's Favorite Sport" and "Ice Station Zebra." And, I was a faithful watcher of his popular television series, "McMillan and Wife." But, I guess I'm just an old fuddy-duddy now.<br /><br />After re-watching it, I honestly can't see the appeal of a film that even impliedly champions teacher pedophilia, murder to cover up the pedophilia, and a supportive spouse who flies off with her sick husband to South America at the end of the film ... allowing him to get away with all his crimes scot-free.<br /><br />I will not be watching it again ... ever.
