Eklavya is a visual fest that is ruined by two things - a really shoddy plot and the Amitabh playing the goat. The film runs 105 minutes and yet you wonder why it took them so long to tell this thin thin tale.<br /><br />The beginning was repetitious and dark - why do people think dark = art? However, the mystery did build up well and the final twist was quite unexpected. But as if to make up for this unexpected twist, Mr. Chopra gave us the expected and clich√©d land donation to the poor in the end.<br /><br />The film was obviously seen as a vehicle for Mr. Bachchan but he probably performed the worst of the lot. He had a hang dog expression the entire time and with his in-character beard looked more like an octogenarian goat than a man who commands respect. Boman Irani, Jacki Shroff, Jimmy Shergill had not much to do and were wasted. Sanjay Dutt got into his role and was fun to watch. Saif did his best with a role that was not written seriously or had much depth. Vidya was a mere decoration.<br /><br />The film was beautifully shot and the locales were stunning. There was much abstraction and unusual camera angles, lots of color, and a few nice special effects. But can all this make up for a very thin plot and absence of a decent logical story? Not in my book. It took Mr. Chopra 5-7 years to think this one up. Next time why not go for a classic adaptation - at least the story will be good and the you can let your imagination fly.
