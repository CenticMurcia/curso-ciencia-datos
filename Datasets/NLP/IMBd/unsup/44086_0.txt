If I could vote 0 out of 10 I would. I saw the original movie years and years ago, then read Chriton's book. This remake of the movie is so far away from the book I agree with another commenter that Chriton should have sued before he died for Trademark infringement on the title. Remakes are rarely even close to the originals in quality but this is so far at the opposite range quality it falls off the scale.<br /><br />As much as I was looking forward to a modernization to the book and the original film, I could not have been more disappointed.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Chriton but the screen writing of this movie misses not only the atmosphere of the book but is detached entirely from the "Technology vs. Man" theme of Chriton's original.
