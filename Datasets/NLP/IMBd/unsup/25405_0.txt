I tried to watch this piece of trash late one night, and even though I have a profound phobia about alien abduction (no, I'm not lying) I didn't think this was scary and I didn't think it was suspenseful. The 'special' effects were absolutely idiotic. I can't believe that anyone would think that those blue creatures were aliens. I'm getting sleepy just thinking of it.<br /><br />I'm not sure that they weren't trying to make a spoof. It was _that_ bad. A ridiculous waste of film.<br /><br />1/10
