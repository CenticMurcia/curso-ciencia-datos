Recently I saw this piece of crap on the Polish TV and phew! what a stinker,I can't believe the good reviews people give it here.Michael Rooker,who gave us an incredible performance as Henry Lee Lucas in "Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer" is totally wasted as a well-armed priest,yeah right!!!While a few effective sequences do exist(notably the beginning of the movie)the overall effect is lame.The film resembles me a TV movie and lacks any scares,gore and violence.The acting is alright,I suppose,but these CGI-effects are terrible and the plot is boring.So if you're looking for a good horror movie,then try to avoid this one at all costs.
