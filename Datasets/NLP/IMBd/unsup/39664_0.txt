Clearly, this video is not to be judged the same way a legitimate film would. It is aimed at young children. Still, I have over twenty younger cousins and spend many evenings growing up babysitting them and watching countless kids videos. This one was hands-down the corniest and most awful. Again, no one is going to expect great performances here, but this cast reeks of small town community theatre amateurism. The songs will get stuck in your head and make you want to run head first, at full speed, into a brick wall. Sure, little kids might be amused (although my cousins- even at very young ages- found it lame). But for anyone over the age of six, stay away from this garbage!
