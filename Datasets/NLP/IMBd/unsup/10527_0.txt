Savior is one of the most intriguing movies that I have ever seen.The story deals with a man's journey in a foreign land where he meets a woman and plays a bigger role in her life than he'd expected. He joins the foreign legion to overcome the grief caused by the loss of his family.Under special circumstances he meets Vera, a victim of the war who is pregnant at the time.He saves her and her baby from the hands of a cruel mercenary.The main character is surrounded by death and the atrocities of the war. He seeks hope in the eyes of Vera's child.The seemingly hard-hearted guy shares a unique bond with the child.<br /><br />It is one movie that you should not miss. The horrible face of war is vividly displayed. This movie will leave you thinking about the lives of those living in the war-torn areas.
