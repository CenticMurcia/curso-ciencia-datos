I didn't dislike this film, but also found it to be very slight and very forgettable. In many ways, this film is highly reminiscent of the earlier film, THE GREAT RACE. Both are set in a similar time period, both feature a lot of over-the-top performances and both have a silly musical style about them (though the music in THE ASSASSINATION BUREAU was a lot more annoying--particularly the singing). The film does not take itself very seriously and as comedy, it almost hits the mark. I wonder, though, if this might have been a much more interesting film if it had been done as serious drama instead of kitsch. The basic plot of an international murder for hire organization is pretty intriguing. The problem is, this topic really had very little depth in the film as it was mostly played for laughs. I appreciate the effort, but it just didn't do much for me.
