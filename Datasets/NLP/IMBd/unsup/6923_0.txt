This is awfulness. This is hideous. I have wasted 2 good hours of my life with this madness. The filmmakers (and actors) should be fined for this. What did I just sit through? Complete stupidity. There should be a warning before every showing of this film that you will experience deep anger, regret, fury, malice and a strong desire to harm the nearest person to you when you finish viewing this film. Why, God, why? I guess the lesson you take from this is, once you know just how bad it can get, you appreciate the merely "not good" ones. I am offended, appalled, disgusted and dismayed. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever.
