What exactly is the point of making a sequel when you don't actually retain anything that was good about the original? The thing about the first 'Bambi' was that there was very little dialogue, letting the drama (or humour or whatever) in the animation speak for itself. And it was frankly the better for it. Now, no one shuts up.<br /><br />That said, it could have been a lot worse. This is because one of the characters that doesn't shut up is the Great Prince, and he's voiced by Patrick Stewart. Not only does Patrick Stewart have a wonderful voice, but I swear this man is actually incapable of giving a bad performance.<br /><br />And on the other hand there is Alexander Gould (Bambi). He's not a bad actor per se - he hits all the inflections and emphasises the right words, but that's just it. He's a paint-by-numbers actor who manages to say everything so that, no matter what he says, it bores me to tears. He could be reading a literary masterpiece like 'The Call of the Wild' and I wouldn't be able to keep my eyes open. I'd frankly have preferred a ham.<br /><br />On top of that, Bambi is suddenly a precocious little twerp. Sure, I know it's 2006 and peoples' expectations of children is radically different from what it was in 1942, but is this a sequel to 'Bambi' or not? Seriously, it would have been nice if the filmmakers had taken a few hints from the film they were supposedly honouring with this brazen cash-cow milker.<br /><br />And finally, the fact that 'Bambi II' is set _during_ the first film doesn't do anything to help the drama, as we know that Bambi must survive any danger he faces, which is more than a little cheapening. Oh, sure, even in a proper sequel the chances of Bambi actually dying are 99.99% against, but at least you'd have that all-important 0.01% to add to the suspense. This is just, well, nothing.<br /><br />In the end, Patrick Stewart is, as always, a joy to behear. But as Yoda once said, "Patrick Stewart alone does not a good film make." Or at least he would have if he'd seen 'Bambi II'. Because even Patrick Stewart can't save this frankly lame film.<br /><br />And on top of that, Flower isn't nearly as effeminate this time around. Is Disney _trying_ to crap all over their classics?
