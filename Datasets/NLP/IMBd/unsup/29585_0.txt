A great film. I think everything was good about it, the acting,the songs and the storyline. You PROBABLY THINK THAT I'M always saying good stuff about all the films i comment on because the truth is I don't really have anything bad to say about these films because their just so good.In the film Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherji are like sisters and they both like Salman Khan but Salman Khan likes Preity Zinta. Salman Khan and Rani Mukherji get married and Salman Khan just can,t refuse. Preity Zinta acts as she does not like Salman Khan. Near the end Rani Mukherji finds out that Salman Khan and Preity Zinta like each other she sacrifices her love and stops from Preity Zinta sacrificing her love for her sister and Salman Khan and Preity Zinta get together at the end of the film.
