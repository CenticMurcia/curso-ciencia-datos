This comment contains nothing that may spoil any point of the movie for it is really a movie that should not be spoiled for anyone.I'm glad it wasn't spoiled for me. For even though it is not a fancy movie and may not be put on a list of the 100 best movies of all time ( even though it'll go on mine)It is a heartfelt and a heart warming movie till the end. But i will say this. It WILL make you laugh and it WILL make you cry, As any good movie should have the power to do. But.... It will also make you do 2 more very important things.<br /><br />For it will make you wonder, not quite knowing is this man or machine and which should i feel for, and should i feel anything. Most importantly it will make you thank GOD for the gift of life and humanity that he has bestowed on us all, for forever nothing can be compared to human life. Enjoy :o)
