This is the most awful film I have ever seen in my life...and I'm not exaggerating. <br /><br />First off, the direction is horrible; there is zero suspense where there is supposed to be. Pat Morita's character is not developed at all, and the rest of the cast were mediocre. Lots of the dialogue is cheesy and robotic.<br /><br />The kids find the Japanese sailor in their hide-out place and from there, nothing really happens for a while...it just lags on and on and on...<br /><br />The Japanese sailor acts all goofy and is not convincing at all!!!<br /><br />The ending is both flat and very un-realistic and you're left with a feeling like..THATS IT???!!!<br /><br />Falls flat on its face, even for kids...it's a total waste of your time. It might start off looking good but it turns into a jungle of crap scenes.<br /><br />WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!!!
