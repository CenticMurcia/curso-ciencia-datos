From the trailer, this looked like a very promising horror/comedy. Sadly, when it came to viewing the whole thing, the horror aspect was played more prominently than the comedy. This a the major tragedy because the so called 'horror' was so very lame and the scope for physical comedy was barely tapped.<br /><br />So, despite some sublime moments of black and/or physical humour (most of which was seen in the trailer), this was just another gormless collage of tiresome in-your-face 'scares' & body count, lame dialogue, and juvenile innuendo.<br /><br />For tasteless teens only -- 3/10
