When you initially watch the DVD it's looks very quick.<br /><br />I'm actually a racing driver, so i know what 150mph looks like and when he's on the Champs Elysee he's certainly close to that speed - 5 gear and max revs. <br /><br />But the maths only add up to an average speed of just 44mph over the 6.5mile course. Which still isn't bad but not as quick as you initially think !<br /><br />It's still something people talk about and I regularly pop the DVD into the player to show friends. It's still the same open jawed reaction !<br /><br />The recently re released, re mastered DVD is far better quality than the poor private video's that had been knocking around for ages.
