do not watch unless under the influence of strong alcohol......just kidding.....an awful movie worthy of cult classic/torture status. The special effects, were not so special. Smoke bombs in the snow, visible strings on the flying saucers. The dialog was capable of inducing a coma in the unsuspecting. Usuually in this kind of budget flick there is at least some gratuitous nudity. Not in this one. The mysterious aliens, were just a backdrop for bad flannel shirts and cheesy actors trying to look Canadian, but failing miserably. Besides.. Canadians, don't look any certain way, unless they are the mounties. (i guess)I may have missed some of the finer points of the plot, due to lapsing in and out of a stupor-us coma, and scaring my family in the process. If a structureless plot and cruddy cheesball acting are your thing.....give it a go!!!
