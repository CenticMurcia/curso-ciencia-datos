A brief summary of the show: 18 castaways are taken to a tropical island in the middle of nowhere and are left there with little more than the clothes on their backs. They are then divided into 2 tribes which compete against each other for "immunity." The losing team has to go to "tribal council" and vote one of their tribe members off the game. When the 2 tribes are downgraded to a combined amount of 10 people, the 2 tribes merge together and they become one new tribe. They then compete for "individual immunity." The person who wins the individual immunity is safe from that night's tribal council. The whole tribe then goes to tribal council and must vote off one of their members. When the tribe only has 2 people left, the "jury" (the tribe members who have been voted off) must choose a member they want to win the $1 million. The one with the most votes wins the $1 million.<br /><br />Survivor is by far, the best show ever to be created for TV!! At first, I was a little bit reluctant about watching this show. I thought it was just another fake reality show. Man, was I wrong!! This show is now my favorite show on TV right now!! It is exciting, funny at times, and FULL of surprises!! It is a very enjoyable show to watch and I know everyone that will start to watch it will become hooked after a few episodes. That is how it worked for me. I am so glad that I decided to watch it and that I should just try it and see if I liked it or not!! You should too. Just try it!! In summary, Survivor is by far the best reality TV show ever created!! I definitely recommend it!!
