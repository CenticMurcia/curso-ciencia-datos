First of all I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Each time I've watched it has brought tears to my eyes. I have a lot of experience with thoroughbred horses and could relate to things that they were experiencing. It says that it's based on a true story and in the credits it mentions a trainers name that it's been dedicated to. I was wondering if anyone has more information on the real people that the movie was based on? And the only other thing that I have is that I was checking the goofs that were noticed by people. I'm an expert rider and have ridden races and I can tell you there's a handful of goofs in the race at the end of the movie. Any response would be appreciated. I've been to Keenland, worked there and would like to know more about the people that the story was about. Thanks,<br /><br />John
