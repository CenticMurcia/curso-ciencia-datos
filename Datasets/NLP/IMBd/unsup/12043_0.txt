In the era when Shahrukh khan's over-acting is considered 'thrilling' and rated as top-notch by the Karan Johar circus... this movie proves that this new actor has the acting skill and confidence to make these over-hyped Khans run for their money.<br /><br />This movie respects audience's intelligence and does not pursue the lowest common denominator by adding stupidly choreographed 'balle balle' songs.<br /><br />This movie is about reality, it is about death and it is about the brutal war for survival. It is imaginative enough that doesn't bore the audience with obvious and unnecessary dialogue and director's clever use of music focuses on character's emotions and the underlying fear that governs everyone's behavior.<br /><br />See this movie and compare it with the more 'mainstream' family oriented movies and you will see why RGV is one of the best director in the industry. Here the hero does-not cry, he is sober and mature enough to think and act. This the Khans will never be able to do.<br /><br />10/10
