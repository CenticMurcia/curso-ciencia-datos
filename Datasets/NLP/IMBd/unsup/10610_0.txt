This film is overrated, yes. The actors do properly their work, it's true, but the script and the realization are poor. The most of the times the story becomes unbelievable, and I miss dramatism. An example is the suicide of Cecilia Roth, I can't believe a suicide like that, so cold and nor impulsive. And the dialogues are pedant, in situations like the related ones no one can't talk like that. I'm not agree with people that blame Juan Diego Botto, in my humble opinion is the best actor in the film, but his labour and the labour of the rest of the crew is not enough to get a good film. I can only rate 2 over 10.
