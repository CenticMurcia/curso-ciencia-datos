Its hard to find a movie that is both so much fun to watch while being so terrible. The best part about Blood Dolls is that it sets out to be terrible and hilariously terrible at that. Our hero in this story is Virgil who, when you look past his racist dolls, desire to take over the world and utter hatred for all other beings, is just a guy like the rest of us. Lonly and looking for someone to share his time with. This movie has two things going for it, above about a million other things granted but two really important things. One, it has a cage full of Goth Rock chicks that have to play on command, urged to do so by Phil Fondacaro (Vonhkar from willow). The second thing this movie has is Mr. Mascaro. I swear to god this character is about the coolest thing that has graced the silver screen since Herbert West. If i were to go into why Mascaro was so cool i'd definitely go over the 1000 word max. The most important thing about this movie is that it tries to be part of the killer doll genre of horror movies and yet the killer dolls in this film take a back seat to every other amazing character that steps on screen. Not that the dolls aren't cool but trust me, you'll couldn't possibly care less about them or who they are killing at the moment because all you'll be thinking about is What insane thing Virgil or Mascaro is about to say next.
