My husband & I watched a couple episodes of Blade: The Series. We just kept hoping that it would get better, but it just seems to get worse each week. Absolute rubbish from start to finish. This series had vampires roaring like lions! It was so unrealistic, that it utterly diminished the authenticity of the original story line. Plus the actor they replaced Snipes with, lacked Wesley's sophistication ...if you get my drift.<br /><br />We don't know about other people, but when we watch a movie/ series, we want to be lost in the moment. We want to find ourselves wondering if what we just watched was real or not. However, the script writing, directing, and producing of this series all negate any remote possibility of getting lost in the moment. The Blade series has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt to be a real disappointment. Watch it is you like, but be prepared for a real disappointment.
