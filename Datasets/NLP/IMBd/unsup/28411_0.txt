"Shivers" of 1975 is a nasty and highly entertaining exploitation flick and furthermore the first feature film directed by cult filmmaker David Cronenberg. Although this does not yet reach the greatness of Cronenberg movies such as "Scanners", "The Dead Zone" or "The Fly", "Shivers" is definitely an atmospheric and creepy film that delivers gore, shocks and sleaze and, in spite of resemblances to films like "Night Of The Living Dead", quite some originality. This movie of many aka. titles (such as "They Came From Within" and "The Parasite Murders") is furthermore recommended as it features the great Barbara Steele (my all-time favorite actress) in a supporting role, as a lesbian.<br /><br />Scientists have developed a certain form of parasites that are supposed to replace organs. What the scientists have not thought of, however, are the side-effects. Their disgustingly looking little parasites are not only anything but healthy, they also turn people into braindead and murderous sex maniacs...<br /><br />This movie's wicked story and atmosphere as well as the nasty sleaze and gore make "Shivers" a real treat for a fan of exploitation. Barbara Steele is, as always, great in her supporting role. Apart from Steele, the performances are not too memorable, bu that doesn't lower the movie's quality as a highly entertaining little classic of weird exploitation cinema. Fans of David Cronenberg should definitely not miss "Shivers", a film that I highly recommend to any lover of bizarre Horror and exploitation cinema!
