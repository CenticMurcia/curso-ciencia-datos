Just finish watching this film, i had to admit that this film is the worst slasher movie i have ever seen in my whole life.9(As a slasher movie savvy, i watched almost 200 slasher movies total, this is definitely is the worst one, even worse than "don't go in the woods alone". The plot is stupid, the dialogue is silly and the acting is horrible, the actress is ugly and the male lead is total a jerk.i am wondering why this kind of movie could be released in the first place. Vote 1 just because there is no zero, slasher fans stay away from this junk, i warned you, or you will waste 90 minus of your life, and you won't miss anything here.
