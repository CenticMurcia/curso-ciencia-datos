Watch just the pilot was a shocking experience because: this was the first time in my life couldn't watch more than the first 5 minutes of movie or Tv show. The reason the horrible acting of every cast member (a bad acting can be resistible but a horrible acting...), the brainless script so childish as every power ranger episode. I love every robocop movie, but this bad copy of of the saga it could only serve as a lesson of what can be do to destroy an action hero. The most funny thing is: the lesson finally was learned and the other TV movies were so good as the first movies.
