My mom and I saw this movie today and we both thought it was great. I'm a ten-year old and I think this movie teaches kids that life isn't all fun and games. I learned something from this. People need to learn how to make a living by themselves. The story teaches a lesson all by itself. I also learned that you can't always have what you want. I liked this movie because it teaches people that its better to work for what you have, and not just asking other people for it. I think everyone should see this movie. I also learned that you are rewarded for being charitable. This movie is appropriate for anyone, although there is this one bad part involving violence.
