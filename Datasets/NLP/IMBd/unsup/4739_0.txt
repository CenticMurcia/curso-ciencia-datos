This schlock of a screenplay should have been a Showtime or HBO Original movie or to be more exact it would be better suited for Lifetime or Oxygen Channels. What are the chances that two conievers would both be trying to deceive each other over the same 10 day period. And they just so coincidentally meet at a nightclub and agree to start a dating relationship (of course each character is agreeing to date under false pretenses!). LOL! They must really think the audiences are stupid! But a fashion turnaround pose by Kate Hudson in a backless slitted dress (more suitable for airing on the new Star Search) and plenty of bare chested shots of Matthew McConaughey are sure to send the teenie boppers swooning and screaming. But do it at home people please and let the rest of us who got suckered into this flop of a movie based on Hudson's performance in Almost Famous enjoy our consolation popcorn quota in peace. See it at Blockbuster before the Summer Blockbusters open, better yet rent it if you were given a gift card from a friend.
