After months of speculation, we now know what the Demon was looking for in Sam- a leader of his demon army. Sam wakes up in a mysterious ghost town- nothing is there. He meets up with fellow psychics Ava and Andy and they try to work out why they are here. They also find new special children, Lily- who stops peoples hearts when she touches people and Jake- who seems to have super strength. Sam explains to them about the Demon and they all are trying to figure out how to get out of the ghost town.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dean is with Bobby and they are trying to work out where Sam is. Dean gets a phone call from Ash at the roadhouse saying that he has some important information. They travel to the roadhouse, but something unexpected has happened.<br /><br />Im not going to give too much more away, but this episode was one of the best of the season. We get to learn a bit more about the boy's mother Mary and the question we all have is- how is she involved in all this?<br /><br />With twists and turns and unexpected occurrences, this episode is not to be missed and if you love the boys as much as i do, you are going to need a tissue for the last part of the episode- it's heart warming.
