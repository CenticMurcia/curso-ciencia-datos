Khwaish Picked up this movie at Atlantic Video, frankly attracted by the steamy cover starring Mallika Sherawat and a guy I really did not care about.<br /><br />What's new? Mallika Sherawat got introduced through this movie. I have seen Murder before, so her physique was kind of a disappointment here, but I'll catch the glimpse nonetheless! Noticeable: Almost every bit of Mallika is up for a view! Her acting comes as a real surprise. Now, here is a quality actress who does not mind exposure at all.. in fact she wants it! The actor was a real dud and a third class aadi aal.. nothing else! Verdict: The movie was nothing if there was no Mallika. She alone is the star in the movie. Mallika's 'acting' gets an A. The story, technicians, music and pretty much everything else was way below average! I guess you cannot blame them. How could they have concentrated on their work?
