I'm a sucker for midget movies. When I heard about this all midget western I had to run out and rent it. Don't make the same mistake! This movie is TERRIBLE. Who would think that a movie with such a ridiculous premise could be so boring. I can sit through just about anything, but this film is unwatchable. The 100% midget gag wears pretty thin after the first couple of minutes. The sound quality (on the copy I rented) was the worst I have ever heard. The only reason to watch this movie is to impress your buddies at parties with your knowledge of the obscure or bizzare. I recommend watching the first two minutes and then fast forwarding through the rest. Better yet, just skip the movie entirely and TELL people you've seen it. They won't know the difference and you won't be missing anything. If you want to see a movie with a heavy accent on midgets, do yourself a favor and go watch "Time Bandits" instead.
