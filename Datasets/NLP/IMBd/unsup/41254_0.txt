I honestly can't see what is even vaguely entertaining about this show.<br /><br />Sure, I've tuned in out of the same morbid curiosity which causes you to stick your finger in an electric outlet once in your life. <br /><br />One has to wonder "just what IS this"; yet what compels one to continue watching? I really see nothing amusing here. Merely pathetic. There's no clever satire or scathing commentary. It's merely mental depravity and an attempt to make the poor feel superior. I doubt even these ditzes are quite as stupid as they portray themselves. Yet what stupidity is real and what is scripted becomes a moot point; it's stupidity without redemption.<br /><br />Crud like this is an indicator of how poor American society has become.
