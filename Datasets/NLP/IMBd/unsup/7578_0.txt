Saw "Captain Invincible" last week at a Bad Movie Night event and it was the worst -- and funniest -- musical I have ever seen. This movie makes "Plan 9 from Outer Space" look like "Citizen Kane"! It's meant to be a spoof and is purposefully bad, but I don't think the makers of this film intended it to be quite as awful as it really is. The musical numbers are completely lame, plenty of gratuitous nudity a la Benny Hill, there are evil punk rockers with half-mohawks, bondage clad new wave hooker chicks, attack vacuum cleaners, crazed Nazis with Yoda-like sidekicks in bad prosthetic makeup. What more could you want? Oh, yeah, a discernible plot might be nice and actors who could sing and dance would be a real bonus.<br /><br />If you want to throw a boffo Bad Movie Night, I highly recommend "Captain Invincible" -- it will have your guests in stitches and explains why we're glad the 80s are long past.
