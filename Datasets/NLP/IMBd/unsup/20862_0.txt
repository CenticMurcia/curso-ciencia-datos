I watched these episodes on NetFlix and there are moments that are funny, but the comedy gets a little old after a while because of the limited number of characters. Not that this problem is all that unusual for a lot of sketch comedy.<br /><br />It reminds me a bit of MadTV or SNL with the repeating characters; with some of the vulgarity of South Park; and some absurdity as in Monty Python. It has much higher production values than the usual sketch comedy (which usually has an obvious look of being filmed on a set with cheap costumes and a "studio audience"). They make it look much more like a normal TV show.<br /><br />Some touches are outstanding--including some very funny characters, good voice-over and interesting ending vignettes.<br /><br />While it's undeniably entertaining, it has all the same problems that most sketch comedy has: some characters start becoming more annoying than funny after a while, especially if they were a little annoying to begin with. Give it time for shock-value to wear off or the line to be said one-too-many-times, or the main joke of a sketch becomes routine, and you'll start feeling a little weary of it. This is especially true if you watch episodes without giving some time in between.<br /><br />Examples: Dame Sally Markham was funny at first, but finding more ways for her to pad out her romance novels starts to get a little boring. Lou and Andy are also funny at first, but after a while I get tired of the 3 minute set-up for him to predictably change his mind about what he wants.<br /><br />Other characters are a little more funny such as Marjorie Dawes of FatFighters (the ultimate hypocrite who lectures everyone else and tries to act superior). It's a bit Church Lady-ish from SNL. Yet at least they put her in some different situations and give her more material. I find Vicky funny despite the repetitiveness.<br /><br />I'm sure the characters people get annoyed with depend on the personality and how often you see them.<br /><br />It's probably worth checking out the series if you haven't seen it, but don't watch too many in a row or you'll blow through the series and feel a little sick and annoyed in the process.
