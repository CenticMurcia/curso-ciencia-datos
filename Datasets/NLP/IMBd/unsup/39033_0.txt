I don't like this film for it's really boring,story of a father who wants to satisfy her bride after the death of his son.like every Hindi movie the boy comes from big cities like New York or whatever & just after the entrance,he meets a typical Indian girl,they marry each other during one man still loves the girl & has dined his love to see her happy... You can watch this film which takes a lot of time of you & after it ends you are totally board.Amitabh Bachchan does the better job.as a satisfying father to do the right move whenever necessary.Salman Khan is a bit old to play a young man comes from abroad to fall in love in India.he doesn't play like he should.Rani Mukherjee is my sort of favorite actress in Bollywod,but i got to confess that she isn't prepared for such a role,Hema Malini is unused.she walks in the stage to prove she is there. See,nothing for John Abraham or Om Puri & so many people who are struggling to fix such a boring time consuming picture. Ravi Chopra has made Baghban before 3 years earlier than Baabul.they have the same problem at all.BORING BORING BORING BORING ... Do i recommend Salman Khan to accept himself as a 41 years old man.he is not Prem Choudhary of Maine Pyar Kiya no more.maybe he is Aditya Sekhri at Lucky: No Time for Love,that's all with the film.boring fast food.
