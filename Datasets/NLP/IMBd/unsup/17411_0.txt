I had an excellent time watching this movie. It's a great lighthearted Dutch comedy about mostly the second generation of Maroccan immigrants in The Netherlands. It deals with multiple prejudices about both the Dutch and Marrocan immigrants. Maybe far in the inside "Shouf shouf habibi!" is a serious movie but all the layers around it make it a very fun one that is filled with some good laughs. Finally a Dutch movie that dares to handle the subject of immigrants, in a fun and yet also critic way.<br /><br />Granted that not every element and plot line in the movie works out fine and in some ways the movie goes over-the-top with its story but mostly "Shouf shouf habibi!" remains a perfectly good and watchable movie throughout. It handles some delicate matters and prejudices in a good and subtle way without making the movie ever 'heavy' to watch.<br /><br />The movie has a great fact pace, which makes this movie perfectly watchable for its targeted audience; Teenagers. It's very direct in its storytelling and it also doesn't hold back. This movie will certainly appeal to most Dutch-teenagers, as well as the second generation of Marrocan immigrants and immigrants of different descents of course. Everybody will recognize some of the situations and story lines that are present in this movie. Will persons outside of The Netherlands appreciate this movie as well? Hard to say. It's a fun movie to watch but I'm not to sure if anyone without any knowledge of the situation in The Netherlands will find this movie as fun and entertaining to watch.<br /><br />The acting is above average, although it's quite obvious that the Maroccan actors in this movie aren't very experienced yet, with the exception of Touriya Haoud maybe. The movie is filled with some well known actors but yet all of the Marrocan characters are played by unknown actors. The reason for this is of course very simple, there aren't really that many Marrocan actors around in the business. It does give the movie a sort of natural feeling at times but also at times the weak acting worked distracting.<br /><br />Simply a must-see for the youngsters here in The Netherlands. Also certainly watchable to those who don't live in The Netherlands and aren't familiar with the culture and situation here but those persons will probably experience this movie differently as it was intended to.<br /><br />A surprising good comedy about a serious subject.<br /><br />8/10
