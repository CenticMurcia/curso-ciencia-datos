Ordinarily I try to avoid gratuitous obscenity, but in this movie it is a necessary and integral part of the story.<br /><br />Between laughing, I must admit to watching in frequent open-mouthed admiration at some of the brilliant ideas.<br /><br />This cartoon presents several levels of ideas, including, as strange as it might seem to anyone turned off by the language, some rather profound philosophical notions.<br /><br />Having once resided in North (brrrr) Dakota, I always get a kick out of jokes about Canada (it's not really a country, you know) and Canadians, who seem to love their socialized medicine but come south to the States to buy their groceries and liquor and tobacco so as to avoid the obscenely high taxes that pay for all the "free" "services" from the Canadian government. (And frequently they come for the more readily available medical care.) <br /><br />In fact, one of my favorite jokes came from a waitress in a restaurant in Grand Forks, N.D.: What is the difference between a Canadian and a canoe? A canoe might tip. (It's a joke very popular in Florida, too.)<br /><br />All of which might seem to have nothing to do with this movie, but deep down ... it seems to have nothing to do with this movie.<br /><br />Anyway, I loved "South Park," and try to catch the nightly replays of the TV show.<br /><br />Not every show is a gem, but often enough there is a spark of brilliance that I must express my admiration and respect for its creators, and especially for this longer, uncut, and uncensored movie.<br /><br />Not for the squeamish, as the clich√© goes, and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is for anyone who can appreciate an inventive story and some really exceptional music.
