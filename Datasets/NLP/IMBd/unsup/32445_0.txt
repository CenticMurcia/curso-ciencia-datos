This is a horrible, terrible, and lousy (and more) movie. In the 50s, there seemed to be this attempt to moralize through movies and TV shows.<br /><br />If I could rate this movie a 0 I would. Was it really possible for man rape to occur? I mean seriously, would it even be possible for four young attractive women to rape a man? Yeah, you know women have always had to work really hard to get sex if they wanted it.<br /><br />It's a journey of 4 troubled teens that ends up in the destruction of them all after I guess the climax, which was a shoot out at a school. All the time the parents are oblivious to these the nature of the devious teens. Be warned, chalk boards are erased, literally.<br /><br />Just avoid this at all cost, the MSTed version isn't even really watchable. I'd love to understand why or how this steaming pile actually has a 3.4 rating? The acting sucks and is totally flat and the plot is ridiculous. The story is poorly written and very uninteresting. The dialog isn't believable and it doesn't appear that there's one actor who isn't reading directly from a transcript while on screen.<br /><br />I don't care what the message is or whatever, avoid this movie at all cost. 1/10, 0/10 if I could.
