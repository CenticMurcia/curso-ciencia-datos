This movie greatest problem, is its presentation. The movie is not about Lavoe, it is about how Lavoe's wife viewed him; this, in my opinion, ruined the movie, as it became about Lavoe's wife. I did not want to see a movie about her, and her recollections and/or feelings; I wanted to see a movie where we would learn about Lavoe's successes and failures. There are also problems with accuracy of detail and chronology, which do not spoil the movie but they are errors. Marc Anthony captured Lavoe's on stage mannerisms perfectly, and even though I would have preferred to hear actual Lavoe recordings, he did sing well.
