This movie is about a radical skateboarding monkey who can skate a half-pipe, I guess? Sounds cool, but did you know that this monkey went on tour? My friend told me this story, but I am sure there were enough people in the audience this day to validate it.<br /><br />One day my pal went to see the MVP at our local skate park. He was supposed to drop into the half-pipe. I guess they loaded him out of the truck, and he was looking pretty sad, wearing this diaper. He stood on the edge of the pipe for a while, and then just FELL in! When he bailed, he crapped his pants. His trainers grabbed him out of the pipe, hauled him back into the truck, and drove away. Poor dirty monkey.<br /><br />People shouldn't use monkeys as hilarious gags. It's funnier when humans are doing/saying idiotic things.
