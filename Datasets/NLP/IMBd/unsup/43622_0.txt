This show is appalling. It features sub par animation, as well as sub par writing. Now I know this show probably equates its self to a modern day Pythagorean Z, but at least Pythagorean held the audience in thrall with Rick Bakers stunning dialogue. This show is a disfigurement on the cartoon network as a whole, not just Adult Swim. The chance of seeing an advertisement for "Tom goes to the Mayor" was a risk I was willing to take to view other programs, but eventually I was forced to change the channel every time the show came on. Unfortunately it has gotten so bad now I do not even bother to watch Adult Swim on Sundays anymore so there is no chance of me being subjected to the travesty.
