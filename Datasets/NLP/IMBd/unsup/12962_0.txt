This movie made me waste 1hour and something. It is a lousy movie and my opinion is that you shouldn't even be thinking of watching it. The screenplay sucks, the plot is like a big pile, adding stupid adventures. The movie tries to imitate the British action very sophisticated films like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels by an unexpected ending and by the plot twist in favor of the main characters, but they obviously fail.The actors aren't real and they don't do a very convincing interpretation. If you really don't have anything to do at home, don't watch this movie, go see Pirates of the Carribbean 2 for the second time.
