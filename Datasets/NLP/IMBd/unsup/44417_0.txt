This films suffers lack of budget and talent. Still GHOST LAKE is worth watching...especially on a rainy night. After the death of her parents, Rebecca(Tatum Adair) tries to escape her misery by taking off to the hopeful solace of their old lake house. Instead, she stumbles upon a curse that puts her own sanity to the test. Over a hundred years ago the local residents were drowned when a dam was built to create Rushford Lake. It seems that about every thirteen years a tragic accident occurs on or near the lake and the victims are never found. It seems now that those lost souls are restless and rise from the lake to bring more company to the bottom of "Ghost Lake". Written and directed by Jay Woelfel, GHOST LAKE is mildly eerie...especially when fog covers the lake. There is brief nudity that will get your attention. Also in the cast are: Timothy Prindle, Gregory Lee Kenyon and Azure Skye Decker.
