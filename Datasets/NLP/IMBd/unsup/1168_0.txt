Got the DVD today - hilarious! We were absolutely so impressed and have already shared it with friends. The Book of Caleb is a successful, wildly entertaining coming of age film. Everything is topnotch - acting, directing, camera-work, editing, narration. Almost forgot the most important part, the concept and the writing. Great storyline that I feel many people can relate to on some level. <br /><br />I'm a pretty anal artist and this movie really measures up. Loved the scene when "Scar" got his scar - beautifully shot, great use of combining black and white with color. The ONLY thing that bothered me a little was the use of people talking without hearing their words. The idea is good but I feel it could have been executed in such a way that it would feel more intentional. <br /><br />Casting was right on. Best of luck & and I'll promote it without any reservations.<br /><br />J. Sherman
