OK, wait, bad isn't what I was looking for........awful, there we go. The shaky camera stuff was annoying and the acting was horrible. As soon as I saw Lou Diamond Phillips' name in the info, I knew it was going to be bad. He hasn't been in a good film since.....oh yeah, he hasn't been in a good film EVER. The whole plot line of "Route 666" was dumb and the supporting cast for the "greatest actor in the world"(<-sarcastic remark) was almost worse than any supporting cast I have ever seen. If I were to pick the top 5 bad movies ever, this would definitely be at the top of my list of candidates. Do NOT watch this movie, because it will be a waste of your money and your time.
