This is a movie with a nice story, but I've never seen De Niro's wonderful acting totally wasted as in this movie; his performance is good, if he acts to render a shy, dumb, introvert cop/detective that is somewhat involved in a small-mafia situation, but , to be honest, people want to see him cool, outgoing, self-confident..<br /><br />It's not the role for him, definitely.<br /><br />Bill Murray fits a little bit better, but it appears unpleasant, most of the time ...<br /><br />Uma Thurman has the best character, and as a whole, I'd say that the movie is worth a view, but it will seldom make you laugh ...
