This programme, in my opinion, encourages domestic violence against women. I saw an episode a few years ago, which was so disturbing, i still can't get it out of my mind. It was called David stockwell's ghost where a husband violently beat his wife and then afterwards it was like as if it didn't happen. She was supposed to cause bruises on their son, but butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, wife-beating husband does nothing wrong. I think that this series tells you that it is alright for men to beat up their wives which may lead to the wives beating their children, or they could be forced to admit they do by their animal husbands, but the wives should still be punished, even though they're being led to believe this is the way to treat people. And recently they showed an episode where domestic violence was not okay. But can you explain the domestic violence in the episode entitled David stockwell's ghost? In my opinion don't watch this series because it can put ideas into peoples heads about how to physically abuse women in one episode, but then confuse you by saying it's wrong in another episode. This series should be examined closely.
