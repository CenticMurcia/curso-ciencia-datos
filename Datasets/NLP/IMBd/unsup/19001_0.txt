As soon as I started to view this film, I knew I was going to enjoy every minute of the entire story. It reminded me of "The Bodysnatcher", 1945, starring Boris Karloff & Bela Lugosi, where Karloff tells the story of Burke & Hare and sings a song to Bela Lugosi and asks him if he would like to be BURKED??. In this film, Peter Cushing,(Doctor Robert Knox), Monster Island",'81 plays the surgeon who teaches and desires fresh bodies to experiment with and Donald Pleasence (William Hare),"Safe Haven",'95, does everything he can to help Dr. Knox with his experiments and at the same time earn schillings and pounds for his assistance. George Rose, (William Burke),"The Tree",'69, works hand in hand with his buddy Bill Hare, and even goes to a great deal of trouble arranging for these many experiments to become possible. This is a great Classic from the late 1950's, just sit back and have Burke & Hare do a number on YOU ! !
