Why they made this sequel is anyone's guess, the first one was not exactly a huge hit or anything. By today's standards it may have warranted a direct to DVD sequel, but an actual movie release would have been out of the question. Quite frankly this movie should have been out of the question. Or at least maybe they could have worked on it a bit more before its release as it definitely has a rushed feel to it. The story has Alan Quartermane and his new wife (both of which played by the same actors) going in search of Alan's brother who had set out looking for the lost city of gold. Well they go in pursuit and go through some jungle adventures and some traps and the movie has the same fast pace as the first movie. It looks like it is going to be a cheap action movie, but one packed with enough thrills to keep one entertained, and then they make it to the city of gold and the movie just stops being entertaining. The story and everything about the movie bogs down in the city of gold as does the whole Richard Chamberline as Alan Quartermane series. Though one has to wonder how did such obviously low budget movies get their hands on some rather respectable actors and actresses. Granted, Stone is a rather newcomer at this point, but Chamberline and James Earl Jones are not.
