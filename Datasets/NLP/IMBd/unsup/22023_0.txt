Betsy (the wonderful writer of this amazing film) personally asked me to write something because I had such great things to say about this film to her on Myspace. I could definitely not refuse her because I want everyone to know what I think of this film. I just want to say I came all the way from Florida to Los Angeles California to see this film. I was originally going to come to the Newport Beach one but I hadn't been able to because the airline ticket prices went up way too high at the last minute for me to go and I was so disappointed I couldn't go. Especially when I found out Danneel, Jensen, and Elizabeth were there, also and I adore all 3 of them.<br /><br />On to the film itself what a wonderful plot, it was so touching and heartwarming. It really made me go through so many emotions while watching, I laughed, I almost cried (which is a hard feat to conquer in and of itself), and I left with that warm and fuzzy feeling, and wanting to see it again right after.<br /><br />This is something that doesn't happen for me much anymore when I go to the movie. I find myself usually critiquing it to death, and realizing how unrealistic it is but this one I really could identify with, and I believe anyone at any age can.<br /><br />Those feelings of insecurities that everyone goes through sometime in their life, and feeling that their not good enough, but having loved ones be there for you when you need them the most and telling you that you are. I think that's something that everyone goes through, and that's what the heart of this film really is about.<br /><br />I can't really write enough words saying how absolutely amazing and awesome the cast is for this film. You could really feel the camaraderie that all of them had with each other, from what I've heard and seen it is on and off camera. I saw Elizabeth, Danneel, and Clea in the audience and they all got along wonderfully and then saw Elizabeth and Jensen at Comic Con and they also seemed to be very close. The way they hugged each other and laughed and talked to each other is something I can't say you see or hear about with most casts in films. Once they leave that set they probably won't interact again, but I don't think this is the case with them and that makes me love the film even more than I already could.<br /><br />I also have to say this really shows off the casts acting skills. Priestly was a great lovable character and was definitely a role that was different for Ackles and he easily brought across that seamlessly to the screen. Everyone around me genuinely laughed and clapped and cheered something I also don't see much in movies and a lot of that was when the Priestly character was on screen.<br /><br />I also want to say I didn't know that much about Elizabeth Harnois previously. I had seen her briefly on One Tree Hill and liked her on there, and also found out she was Alice whom I really loved as a little girl when I watched the Disney Channel but didn't really know exactly what to expect until the movie. Let me tell you she definitely exceeded my expectations as Piper. That storyline really touched me with her looking for her daughter, and coming to the shop and everyone taking her in and befriending her so easily. It was so nice to see, and I definitely want to see Elizabeth in more things to come, not to mention she is an incredibly beautiful actress.<br /><br />I also feel the same way about Danneel Harris I thought she definitely played the character of Tish wonderfully, especially considering I had a good 5 min chat with her and she is absolutely nothing like that. Such a humble, sweet, nice individual. These are the kind of people I like to see making it in Hollywood and I really want to see them go far in their film careers and hopefully they will get noticed for this film. It would be an absolute shame that not everyone can see this movie! It needs to be released in theaters. I would probably go see it at least 2 or 3 times more just in the theater and of course buy it on DVD.<br /><br />I hope by my writing this some production company will see this and take notice. I know so many people who want to see this movie and are desperate for it to be released. I've told some of them to come by and make that known too because there is definitely a market for this movie.<br /><br />Best Regards, Liz Bodie Florida USA
