I have to say this is the worst movie ever. However, there are some cool parts. First, the guy in the window, the door slamming shut by itself and of course the flashing by the girls nice boobs!!! Therefore, I gave it a 3 but if you are desperate in looking at this film then either borrow it for free!!! or rent it on your unlimited rental plan at your nearby video store. Don't pay money to watch this!!! I wonder if they will take a return if I say the disc don't work ?<br /><br />Basically the story line is 4 college students get recruited to work on an independent film. During the filming process, things get crazy. A local legend of a dead homeowner returns to claim back his house as well as scare to "death" the trespassers.
