I don't think I have ever seen such a terrible movie in my life. Every bit of this movie is horribly acted and well predictable. Who ever gave this movie higher than 2* is an ignorant child, there is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie, except for the gore of course. I don't think that even the most die harder than hard gore fan would be too keen on this waste of film. Mr.Dogg is an ignoramus that does not deserve to be given the privilege of directing, writing, casting etc. If you are smart, you will avoid this movie completely. Save your money, don't rent, buy, or even watch online.<br /><br />May god help us, thank the lord this movie was made in 2001, and our taste in horror has increased, if you are truly dying to watch a popcorn movie on a late Friday night with the friends, then do yourself a favor and rent 'Valentine', the acting is less bad and the storyline can be accepted. But if you do rent this, I guarantee your wonderful Friday night with your friends and popcorn will go to hell, and they'll leave blaming you.<br /><br />Good day.
