Who ever wrote the last comments about Kieth Olbermann, obviously doesn't know what he is writing about. <br /><br />Olbermann is intelligent, fair minded, and straightens out those ignorant saps that watch Fox. It's about time that another side of the news is presented. His programs are well thought out, and done with class, unlike his counterparts on other news channels. His factual analysis of other so called "news cable news" stands to his credit. MSNBC has great and fair talent. Olbermann's guests are not "staged" to back up one story or another. It's time we had real "fair and honest" news people on the air.
