Oh No... Why was this film made? I've seen some bad films in my time, but this is by far the worst!<br /><br />The acting is terrible, and even though the film is only 1hr 15 mins long they keep reminding you with awful pieces of dialogue about what happened a few minutes ago. There certainly aren't any subliminal messages in this film!<br /><br />The morality is fantastic - the cops just allow them to get away with murder and drug dealing because its "the Yakuza way"!!<br /><br />Oh well, I suppose it gave some actors a little work for a while...<br /><br />If you do watch it (and it's worth a laugh at least!) Check out the shoulder pads on the main character, and the shadow of the sound boom visible after the "yakuza" is given a necklace by his sister. Brilliant!! ....and I thought Robin Hood, Men in Tights was bad!
