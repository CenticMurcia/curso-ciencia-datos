That sums up the whole movie. The movie is clearly made just to entertain few friends. The plot is absolutely stupid, "acting" is simply terrible and the dialog sounds like it had been improvised during shooting. The special-fx though are pretty good for a no-budget film like this. There's few pretty good jokes like the occult library of a mad scientist which includes necronomicon, and kama-sutra. The use of Finnish V-word (equivalent for English F-word) gets to your nerves. I mean it's said about 200 times and enough is enough. If you like very bad movies this one's for you. The DVD release includes lots of extras, like the short movie "El' Pok Erimas Sacre" which is actually much better than Frankenstr√∂m.
