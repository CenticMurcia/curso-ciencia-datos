Yasuhara Hasebe's violent Nikkatsu pinker Assault! Jack The Ripper is a sleaze classic that's about as rough as you're gonna find 'em--and it's easily better than the XXX Forced Entry and its ilk. At different turns, it dips into humor, eroticism, sadistic violence, misogyny, and drama and it plays out perfectly.<br /><br />What we got here is the story of a cake decorator and a waitress who work together and kill women to get off. The twist on this one is that the oversexed gal is the one who encourages the limp-dicked guy's spree of pastry-knife-in-vagina stabbings after an accidental killing gets him excited enough in the sack to please her. Great play between characters and straight up smuttyness make Assault! a real winner.<br /><br />Assault! Jack The Ripper is a new favorite of mine. Not as graphic in the vag-stabbing department as I would've liked but God bless the Nipponese and Hasebe in particular for consistently bringing the best sleazy rape films to the table. You already know if you need to see this one--9.5/10.
