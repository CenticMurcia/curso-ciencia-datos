Unfortunately taking all of the best action movie clich√©'s and putting them end to end in one totally plot less film does not make a good movie. The way that the hero (played by Christian Slater) narrowly escapes death from everything that comes his way is laughable to the point that by halfway through the movie I was hoping he would be killed so that the film would end. Nothing in the movie comes even close to being plausible - every plot detail is riddled with holes and demonstrates the producers had a complete lack of understanding of how things work in the real world. By the end of the movie I was left wondering why I had bothered to waste my time and money to see it through to the end, had I seen the movie thinking it was intended as a comical parody of the action movie genre I might have enjoyed it a lot more.<br /><br />This is the worst film I have ever seen, ever! If this is the first action movie you have ever seen then you *might* love it, otherwise it should be avoided at all cost. Utterly dreadful 1/10.
