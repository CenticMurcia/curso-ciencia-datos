I am one of the most unlucky person in the world. I first watch this movie 'fool N final' and the watch the original movie 'Snatch'. That is why I was not able to enjoy the movie Snatch as I was knowing what is going to happen. I must say that 'Fool n Final' is one of the badly failed copy cat movies. Not that all the copy cat movies fails. We have good examples of Aitraaz, Bheja Fry, and not so bad examples of Murder, Kaante. This movie fails in copying the fun of the original plot for Indian audience.<br /><br />If you are reading this to decide whether to watch the movie or not, I will suggest you to watch movie Snatch rather. If you can not get Snatch then may be go on and watch this one. But spend as little money as possible. There are few scenes in the movie which are funny, but they the rest are utter garbage. The changed story line doesn't suit the Indian climate. Music is not so good, acting is not up to mark. I wont say anything much about this.<br /><br />Watch on your risk, or to be safe watch original movie 'Snatch'.
