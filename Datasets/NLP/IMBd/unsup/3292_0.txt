While the entire movie was o.k. the major premise of the need to use bomber whose family have no interests in the bombing or terrorist act is an overkill. The whole charade can be simplified, if the terrorist take the money from him after closing the bank account. What the terrorist should do is just simply place the bombs themselves. I don't see any complexity in that do you? Because the plausibility of the whole movie is in question, it throws into question that the movie is somewhat contrived. Another movie of Paradise Now is much more straightforward and simple as well as low budget and was much better done.
