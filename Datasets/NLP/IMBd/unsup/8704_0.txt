The Red Violin is a fantastic, passionate, romantic journey across time and space. It is a must see for anyone who appreciates music. The film is easily one of my favorites, it features incredibly beautiful scenery, a passionate story, and fantastic performances by all actors. The story is quite dismal throughout, but is one of the best modern day tragedies I have seen in a long time. I applaud Monsieur Girard for his creativity and skill in this film, and I highly suggest any other production of M. Girard (Specifically 'Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould', a film about an eccentric Canadian pianist, definitely one of the greatest genius' of our time).
