This non-masterpiece follows in the footsteps of several other pathetic attempts at turning a successful videogame franchise into a successful movie franchise. This one pales in comparison to the original Mortal Kombat(which was actually pretty good....surprisingly enough). It seems as though the filmmakers were too busy adding as many special effects shot and characters as possible from the videogame, rather than worrying about any type of story or character development. The characters came off as overly stereotypical and two-dimensional. This movie might have been more enjoyable sans dialogue, as at least the action sequences were intense and well choreographed. I really wish that the producers of this stinker would have put a little bit more thought into the actual plot rather than just money into the special effects budget. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you liked the first movie....... then steer clear of this one..... I mean.... why bother?
