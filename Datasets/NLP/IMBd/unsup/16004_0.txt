something gripped me about this movie. I felt as if I was somehow drawn into it in some way or other.The loft, the terminal bar and tom,s flat on Spring street, all seemed to capture my innermost feelings as if I somehow needed to belong there.I feel strongly that I MUST visit those places, especially,the Terminal bar and Marci's loft.I have watched this movie on video over and over again, several times a week magnetically. Am I going crazy or something ? I cannot name the magic phenomena which appears to surround it.I first saw it on British TV about four years ago when it first made its impression upon me since which time I have been drawn to it like a magnet for some unexplainable reason.
