This was incredible! Incredibly stupid that is! This is not worth watching. Quicksilver highway does not do any good for the reputation of two of the most admired horror writers, namely Stephen King and Clive Barker! If IMDB had had an option of 0/10 points it would've got just that. I'm hugely disappointed.
