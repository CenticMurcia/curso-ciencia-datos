Wanna see a movie that will make you think about the meaning of war? See Flags of Our Fathers.<br /><br />You may very well feel like I did after watching this movie. I felt like I was assaulted as much as the enemy. I saw more war and blood than I expected. As movies go, this part of the movie was done as any good war movie should be done. You see the enemy, you kill while spilling blood all over the place, get killed while spilling blood all over the place, and then you make people cry.<br /><br />In Flags, you have more to deal with than blood and tears. You have to deal with the sweat and cold heartedness from both sides. Hmmm, both sides...? Maybe not for people like Ira Hayes. There was definitely more than 2 sides for Ira and maybe even for you.<br /><br />No matter who you are or what you are, there is something in Flags of Our Fathers that should make you notice the reality of war. Yes, I am saying this is a thoughtful movie. If you want war and blood and nothing else, you need a slasher movie. You will see how war is fought by people at all levels of life in more dimensions than are normally obvious. War sucks, people can suck, but this movie does not suck.<br /><br />To everyone involved, thanks for the reality check. Hopefully everyone who sees this movie can read between the lines - on all sides of all lines.<br /><br />The story is GOOD, the cold-hearted bast**ds are BAD and the war is UGLY. But you don't see Clint Eastwood. However, you do feel his million dollar touch and he will not go unforgiven.<br /><br />8 out of 10
