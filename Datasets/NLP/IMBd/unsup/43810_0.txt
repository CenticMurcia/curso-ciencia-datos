Richard Gere in this kind of movie? Na-ah not good. The acting of the movie isn't really that good, although Connery is okay. There is so many movies about Arhtur, Lancelot etc and of those I've seen this is probably the worse. Gere ruins it all. He doesn't fit to this movie. Gross! Not a very interesting movie at all...<br /><br />The music was okay, but that was about it. Movie got boring quickly. Camelot looked like the Disney castle thing. The ending where Arthur is dead on a float against the sunset is beautiful, but that's about it.<br /><br />It could be better cast choices because as said, Gere is too... what can I say? Modern! His face is totally wrong for Lancelot...
