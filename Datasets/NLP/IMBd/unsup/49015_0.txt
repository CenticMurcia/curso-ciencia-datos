I curled up with this one last night and felt like i was "looking for love in all the wrong places". What did Tim Roth think he was doing? Actually, I watched it because i expected the bellboy character to evolve through the four episodes. The first episode didn't turn me off. In fact, the incantatory rhymes of Eva the all-girl witch were one of the few good laughs in the whole four-part joint. The next bit of absurdity, Room 404, has been done so much better elsewhere. Jennifer Beals' acting kept me involved here, believing some actual content might emerge -- like a plot? Her eyes promised so much! The dialogue gave so little! From time to time the art direction was notably okay. Charming. Meanwhile, wincing at every other facial maneuver Roth tries. So, by the time we get to Rodriguez's great kids, the big ones and the little ones, a parallel of adult/child misbehaviors, Roth is hardening, yes? He calls into the (cliche) pad of his boss, firm, resolute, quitting. Now I'm yawning. Yes! Yes! get this thing over with. Just one more room (oh, dang!). Is that Bruce Willis? Will he punch Quentin Tarantino in the jaw and shut him up? The bellboy, the twitching Candide, does come through in the end. But i was asleep, and had to rewind to see what happened. Quentin Tarantino is apparently some kind of loser that people talk about with excitement. The shock value of being "bad" is something a lot of us worked through when we were pre-adolescent. Some took it to advanced stages. Some are still working out their anger issues. Some are doing hard time. Some are dead. The writer/director has to be very sharp to make this funny. QT should pay me to watch his work.
