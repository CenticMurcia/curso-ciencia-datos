What a mess! Tim in Pheonix is right- this is like a community college film project, but by someone who flunked out of community college. My only favorable comment is to the publicist who created the misleading VHS box to make this sound like an intriguing "alternate history" exploration. My hats off to you, buddy - you sure duped me! What I expected to be Oliver Stone meets Jules Verne was more like Oliver Hardy meets the "Hey, Vern!" guy. Too bad all the loose ends in this film weren't a little longer- I could have fashioned a noose and hung myself.<br /><br />Also includes the worst Kennedy impersonations you will ever hear, and actors supposedly portraying Lyndon Johnson, J Edgar Hoover, Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather who look and sound absolutely nothing like them. Didn't even try. To call the characters two-dimensional is to add a dimension.
