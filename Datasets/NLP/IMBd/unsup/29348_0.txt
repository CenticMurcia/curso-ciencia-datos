A bunch of kids are found murdered on a remote island. Only one is alive and totally insane. It's determined that she killed everyone else. Another group travels out to the island to see what happened and find out that she didn't do it. Something is loose on the island and starts to hunt them down...<br /><br />A pretty dull horror film. All the characters are unpleasant (you WANT them all dead), the acting is bad, there are horrible 1970s fashions and the killings are (for the most part) pretty mild. Also you see a bunch of British actors all trying (badly) to fake American accents (the kids who are killed first). Heck, one guy had to be dubbed in! There is plenty of nudity--the girls show their chests, the boys only their butts. What really kills this film though is the confused script which has the characters doing incredibly stupid things.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!!! They all know a killer is with them on the island so they immediately separate leaving the women alone; a woman stands and just screams endlessly as her boyfriend gets hacked up in front of her (this happens TWICE!) and a woman tries to escape from the killer by running upstairs. Also these people seem to get over the deaths of their companions very quickly. Look how Dan gets over his wife's death and how they all react to Bron's dead body. SPOILERS END!!!<br /><br />The DVD transfer from Elite is great--widescreen, good print and in strong color...but the movie just isn't good. I heard this helped kill the British film industry--it's easy to see why! I give it a 4.
