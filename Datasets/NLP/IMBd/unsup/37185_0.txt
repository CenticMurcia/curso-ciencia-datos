Well, I have to say i wasn't expecting much from the movie when I saw the trailer. I wasn't wrong. People should beware when movies of the same genre appear in big numbers; it will mean that at least 3 of 4 will be mediocre,bad or no redeeming value,whatever.<br /><br />***Spoilers..maybe*** While the "adventure" focus the most part on the "growing" and "surprinsing"(because nobody can actually explain how many powers Will has or how did he get them)of Will Treston, it also points the relationship of him, with his family(BIG family, by the way), and maybe love-wise. Yet, the prophecy from which he was unaware, suddenly takes part over his life, when he mets "The Raider";he pursues Will,with some dogs you wont see again, he babbles something like "Give me the signs" and runs away scared of some people that calls themselves "Old Ones".<br /><br />Probably, its seems like the "normal" Fantasy-Adventure plot. Boy.Prophecy.Hero.Mission.Some Help.Dangers.Perils.Plot Twist.Final Battle.End...Wow that sounded Like Ocarina of Time. But i was not satisfied by the plot...Will finds the signs...for example,on a Tomb(on the local Church),on her sister birthday present,OK totally unexpected and the SUPER predicted and most obvious sign(The Soul)...but for that, Will didn't even had to walk a mile from his home. His powers...Angered Explosions, "Super Strength"(Sometimes he was a pussy, actually), and Telekinesis( which he didn't care to use it, more than once). But, since all those powers were shitty, many characters actually didn't care to react at them(Will's Sister,Brother) or he was willing to keep them has a secret(Let me tell you a Secret...I have Super Powers). All this...i could easily forget it...but what destroyed me completely...was the "Disco Battle"(Final Fight Between the Old Ones and the Raider)or the Final Fight Between Will and the Raider( The effects of the Light and Dark Energies looked so crappy, a White and Dark Blankets, would have worked better) ************************************ So, Ill give it a 3, because it was not the worst movie i have seen yet...but because of the many plot holes and ...why to put Maggie and Stephen on the promotional poster if they barely acted on the film? Bad advertising
