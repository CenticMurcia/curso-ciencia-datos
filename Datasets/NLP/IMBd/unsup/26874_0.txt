This show is to be commended for addressing real issues and the dedicated ASPCA workers and officers who rescue these animals. Some of the situations witnessed on this program are upsetting, but as one officer mentioned, it helps her to tell herself that they are making a difference, one animal at a time, and the animals cannot speak for themselves.<br /><br />There are outright cases of abuse, but it is also hard to believe people may be unaware they are abusing an animal; for example if they are elderly, and have too many dogs in the apartment. The officers educate the person and the audience about what is best for the dog, or cat. Sometimes people cannot afford medical care, but that doesn't mean they should abandon the dog in the streets. Call the ASPCA and they will help. Everyone should watch this show.<br /><br />This series is one (rare) example where reality TV has done some good. It is not mindless games, or meaningless competitions set out to degrade the participants. It also educates those in the audience who may be considering buying a cat or dog, and not aware of the responsibility. Especially in the city, caring for a dog is a major commitment. Dogs are like children, and need attention and love. They should never be chained outside a junkyard, or anywhere. Thanks to the creators of this show for presenting a viewpoint in defense of animals. 10/10.
