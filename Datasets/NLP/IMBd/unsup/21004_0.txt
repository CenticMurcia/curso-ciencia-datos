Though Aladdin was a GREAT movie, I think Return of Jafar won my approval over it by .5. I love the tension in the movie and the power. Jafar possesses is like his own ultimatum. There's enough tension in there that you feel like you're being squeezed. It's awesome. And I love Jafar so his 'winning' is like a plus. Abis Mal is so stupid though that there's enough comedy relief too; it's good. And all the characters are already introduced. My favorite part in the movie is when Abis Mal wishes for things that Jafar takes literally (and on purpose, which what makes it so hilarious) and finally Abis Mal realizes he'll never get what he wants until Jafar gets what HE wants. I think it's just a great movie and anyone who liked Aladdin will like it's sequel.
