This is by far one of the best Filipino films since, I believe, Mike de Leon's Bayaning Third World.<br /><br />Directing - Maryo J is very proud of this movie and why shouldn't he be? It captures the Filipino heart and character fully.<br /><br />Script - Surprising to find out that a young person like Yamamoto wrote this. It makes you realize that the best works aren't the big production movies but the movies that come from the heart.<br /><br />Acting - What do you get when you put Lorna Tolentino, Albert Martinez, Gloria Romero, Celia Rodriguez, Mark Gil and (now) Jiro Manio in one great movie? A great movie with great actors. You can't get anything better than that.<br /><br />It's such a shame this movie wasn't well-appreciated in our land. But I'm glad this movie is still getting the appreciation it deserves.
