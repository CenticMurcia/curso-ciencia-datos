I really enjoy watching the show, but that's probably because I don't have expectations of the show because I've never read the comic books. I enjoy watching the episodes, they make me laugh at some points, and by the end of the episode I want to watch the next one to see what happens!! I suppose I like it so much because I didn't start watching the show having a standard of what it should be like fixed in my mind, so I wasn't disappointed. I hope at least it manages a whole first season rather than just about 13 episodes or what not. I'm up to episode 12 which was left on a slight cliffhanger about what was going on in my opinion and id be gutted if it ended like that!!
