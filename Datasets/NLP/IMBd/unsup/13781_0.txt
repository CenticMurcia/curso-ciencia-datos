Being from Rhode Island and working on Federal Hill, I feel that this movie truly captured the essence of the Italian American young adult in it's day and age. Believe me, the characters are soooooo close to home.. Corrente really was able to portray the "spacone" better than a lot of other directors were able to do.. Definitely watch this movie.... and if your from Rhode Island and haven't seen it yet.... rent it.. buy it.. watch it.. get some haven brothers and watch it.... I had a lot of laughs watching these guys run around the state to places that I can relate to... everything from food spots to night clubs.. I love the scene when Nicky cooks for his girlfriend.. really funny.. it reminds me of myself..
