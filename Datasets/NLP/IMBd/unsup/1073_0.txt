I can't believe people actually attempted to take this film seriously -- none of the actors involved seemed to! Especially the always dapper Donald Sutherland, who devours lines like "I can fly a helicopter!" with campy relish. If you're a hardcore Heinlein freak, don't bother with "Puppet Masters" -- it'll only break your heart -- but if you're a fan of extremely goofy, preposterous sci-fi nonsense, run out and rent it today, grab a couple of your more cheese-tolerant buddies and a couple of six packs, and settle in for a couple of hours of goo, ACTING!!, clumsily depicted paranoia, and some gut-busting laughs.
