I watched SINGLE ROOM FURNISHED as part of BCI Eclipse' Drive-in Cult Classics (featuring Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. This one stands out for its dullness.<br /><br />Johnnie's (Joanne) young husband (no doubt a latent-homosexual) abandons her to go to sea with a pal that joined the Navy four months earlier.<br /><br />After changing her name to Mae (and, dying her hair), she is pregnant. Desperate, she throws herself at the dysfunctionally shy, overweight salesman, who lives downstairs.<br /><br />After proposing (he feels sorry for her), he realizes his true love for the plain fisherman's daughter; and, proposes to her in a bid for matrimonial happiness. He dumps Mae over the phone from the bar.<br /><br />She then changes her name to Eileen; and, is left with a string of 'suitors' who become so numerous that even she has to regard herself as a prostitute. The only men in her life are emotionally unstable boys willing to kill themselves over her, or crass traveling salesmen out for a good time!<br /><br />That may not sound too bad, but SINGLE ROOM FURNISHED is one very unattractive, badly acted, badly written movie.<br /><br />Jayne Mansfield does have acting ability, but her choice of material is rotten, and the wordy and florid soliloquies here make everyone come off like idiots.<br /><br />The scenes are far too long; the production values are so poor that the very good image and color quality of this disc just makes the sets and scenery look like what they are, almost-entirely undecorated flats. The costumes are no better.
