I saw this here in my home town last night, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I hadn't been expecting much, to be honest (the trailer does the film a disservice), but I was really taken with what they did, considering they had to make it on a smaller-than-intended budget (no WETA Digital/Industrial Light & Magic, folks). The story was very compelling and it had some great performances, including Jim Caviezel as the hero. Mr. Caviezel was excellent, and I wish we saw more of him, he's like a rock in this picture. But the rest of the cast are every bit as good: Sophia Myles, John Hurt, Jack Huston Â– brilliant! The trailer did something of an injustice to the cinematographer Pierre Gill, with it looking rougher than the badger's proverbial. This bears no relation to the finished product, which is so beautiful as to be jaw-dropping, and then some. And, while SPIN VFX is no WETA or ILM, their work was great enough that I didn't miss them (although the baby Moorwen wasn't as good as the big one). All told, it was a great film that is much better than the crummy marketing and support would suggest. Give it a go and, on this score, I can't wait to see what all you guys do next!
