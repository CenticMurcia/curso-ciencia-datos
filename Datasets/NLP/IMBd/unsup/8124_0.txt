This is the most awful movie of all time. No movie surpasses this movie in horrible horrible badness. Nothing can even come close to the story of Vudd discovering I-ron. I will call this "I-RON". From a superheated volcanic eruption... minutes later giant metal shard... hiding underneath rocks. He touches it and its hot so he hits it with a rock and its cool. Cmon, really. Then he kills the national geographic lion and when he stabs it is paper mache. I'm not even going to get into the monkey men and the katanas he forges near the end of the movie. Where did he get the knowledge on how to forge master crafted samurai swords? And the cover has NOTHING to do with movie at all.<br /><br />THE END
