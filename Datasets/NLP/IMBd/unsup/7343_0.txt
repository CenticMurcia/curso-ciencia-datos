This is a sloppy piece of whatever it's supposed to be. It's terrible in so many ways it's embarrassing to all involved. The script is utter nonsense that won't make a lick of sense either. I don't know who OK'd this script or how exactly it was even sold. I can see the pitch saying, here is the script I doesn't make sense now but we will work on it in post. Yeah it didn't happen. Please do not bother this terrible drivel. Worse than anything is that it actually looks pretty decent, but it just goes to show if you don't have a decent script that makes at least A LITTLE bit of sense it won't matter. That acting is wooden & somebody thought they were making something good, because it seems like there was some care in the making of it. I understand just about all movies, but you won't have a clue what is actually happening until at least 45 minutes to an hour in, if you even make that far which most of you won't.
