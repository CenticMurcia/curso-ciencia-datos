This movie was my choice for the kid's afternoon but the both of us regretted it afterward. I admit that I have dozed off watching it, which is maybe the first time it happens for me in a theater! This isn't a bad movie because you could find worse. Surely, the design is outstanding and the characters show their feelings as never before but they can't make a movie by themselves. Nevertheless, it's dull because it lacks a story. After a good start, it becomes a wrestle event with endless fights! With robots becoming berserk, it reminds me of the much-criticized Robocop 2, which offers a better script and thoughts than this one.
