Often hilarious and nearly always sumptuous, this is a solid Daffy Duck cartoon. The animation is in general very nice, with crisp colourful backgrounds, and smooth character movements. Though there was once or twice where objects such as the tree were a tad static. The music though was fantastic, very rousing. While not perhaps the most rollicking take on the Robin Hood story, I would say the Errol Flynn film takes that title, it is entertaining, with some good visual gags and a fun script. Whereas in cartoons like The Ducksters, Porky is the butt of the joke, but here, it is Daffy and he seems to be taking it well as he makes a rollicking Robin Hood figure, and Porky is an effective Friar Tuck. I would also like to praise Mel Blanc for his brilliant voice characterisations. All in all, not the absolute best Daffy cartoon, but solid enough. 9/10 Bethany Cox
