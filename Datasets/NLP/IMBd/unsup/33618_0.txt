This movie is bad, it is so bad. It is a cheap (and I mean cheap) rip-off with no special effects and no Amityville house. Instead, a group of friends live in a house in Amityville (as a fix-it-upper) and find themselves in deep do-do. FIRST; the entire point of this series is location. The group lives in another haunted house in Amityville, where a priests confessional was places 12 years previously (at a time around the "real" horror). NO REAL house equals bomb of a movie. (At least 1992, A New Generation, and Dollhouse make some sort of reference to the real-house (like timepieces, mirrors, and small replicas), but this movie feels like a Halloween movie without Michael Myers. SECOND; Get a story-line. (they stop by the house because it is the first right not the second, huh?) The mundane plot they came up with is stupid. Instead of picking up on the 1978/earlier date tie in, the plot follows strange behavior in the group (where all of them, predictably die and I don't remember seeing the ghoul). One of them is supposedly the murderer of the priest 12 years ago. But is this another flashback or some-person you see who is not really there? Urgh. Third; Stop pretending. The haunted house is only filmed from one side. So half the time I cannot tell if it is the real house.
