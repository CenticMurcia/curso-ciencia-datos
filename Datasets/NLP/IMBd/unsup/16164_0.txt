The third movie of the once promising Candyman myth. <br /><br />Candyman comes back to haunt his last descent a girl named Caroline. She tries her best not to believe in his curse so he starts killing people to prove it to her. Then she starts telling everybody he's back but no one believes her of course. And she's also the prime suspect ya-da ya-da ya-da. What else is new?<br /><br />So on to the juicy stuff. <br /><br />Death count on screen: four definitely not enough. Off screen old Candy slashes some punks but by some unknown (STUPID) reason we don't see it. Good call there... NOT<br /><br />Gore: plenty but still not enough.<br /><br />Nudity: quick breasts flash from two unknown girls. Could be better.<br /><br />Sex: you wish you sick bastard.<br /><br />Cheese Factor: Medium. There's this old lady that looks just like Yoda and keeps repeating the same phrases that was too funny. And Donna D'Errico's acting is pretty amusing too. <br /><br />So what is there to see? Not much. Yes Donna D'Errico runs around bouncing her fun bags but don't expect to see the goods. How could they? A curse on you all! Turi Meyer whoever you are how could you direct this and not give us a good long shot of Donna's only talent? <br /><br />Tony Todd is still cool and he's not overused as in the previous sequel but with such awful material it's hard to shine.<br /><br />This is actually quite boring and galaxies away from the quality of the original,<br /><br />If you have nothing to do and everybody's out having fun and you're home alone on a Friday night and eating cold pizza and thinking how the hell did your best friend got your girl well then this might be for you if you want to feel REALLY BAD.<br /><br />If not save your time.
