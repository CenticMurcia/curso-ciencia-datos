"Cast in Gray" is like the best of French cinema in lyricism and pacing. It addresses larger issues, however, than the usual French fare. The subjects of existential angst and "faith" or lack thereof are treated with a light touch in combination with masterful patience. The lush photography and the sound of the rain make the film a sensual pleasure without even considering the script. I might guess that there is something Eastern European and slightly dark in conception which is lightened by Michael Toth's sense of the magical. The script is spare. The acting is superb. The use of the dog is a brilliant and comic touch. This is a rare gem. I hope to see more of this filmmaker's work. It is just a beautiful film.
