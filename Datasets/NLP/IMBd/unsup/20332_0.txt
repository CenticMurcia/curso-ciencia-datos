I'm absolutely in love. This movie was the best there ever was, the music was the coolest and the best, and the story was really hot too.<br /><br />The Gundams are really cool and the Tallgesse III. My favorite Gundam custom was Deathscythe Hell Custom, it was really awesome and really cool like the Heavyarms. Wing Zero Custom I didn't like it very much because of the angel wings, some people said it looked great but it wasn't too great.<br /><br />The characters are the best, but the saddest thing they've ever done in the ending was to detonate their gundams, Duo still the funniest there is, Heero the silent guy, Trowa the smart guy, Wufei the strongest and Quatre well you know.<br /><br />But I couldn't believe that Relena slapped someone. That's right Relena 'all violence is wrong' Darlian, had slapped someone because of the cause of peace. Great movie I give this movie a 10/10
