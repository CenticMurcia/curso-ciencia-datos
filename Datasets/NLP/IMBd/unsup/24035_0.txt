Sly looked cool and tough in the trailer and the poster and the cover of the video box. He's a little girlie man in the movie. This is one of the worst "action" movies ever made. The director didn't know how to move it along. It reminded me of a cheap movie called "the swap" which was called something else and had footage of a young Robert DeNiro in it. You know the movie I'm talking about, you saw it at Suncoast for $6.99 and almost bought it because it had a big picture of Robert DeNiro on it. THAT movie is better than this.<br /><br />Really, I'm not kidding. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. <br /><br />
