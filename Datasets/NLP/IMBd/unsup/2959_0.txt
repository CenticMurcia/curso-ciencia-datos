I can forgive a couple of guys trying to cash in and ride on the coattails of a "funny" zombie movie like Shaun of the Dead and the Hartsells were heading in the right direction, but lack of money, lack of writing talent, and lack of any real directorial ability dooms them from the start. HIDE AND CREEP takes place in a Southern redneck town, where a zombie plague has suddenly sprung up. And when I mean "sprung up" I mean "sprung up" because zombies appear almost out of thin air - in the church, in the video store and in a living room (where one zombie comes right through the door without any of the five people in the house seeing it and one zombie comes up from the basement where one man had said was empty not five seconds before). The ultimate reason why the zombies have started appearing (aliens) is stupid, the makeup is poor and the acting is dismal. But I'll tell you what - put some more money into the project, some better writers for the dialogue, and a new director and an idea like HIDE AND CREEP has real funny possibilities.
