Just saw this one. Although I was really expecting a bad movie, in the beginning I thought I was wrong. Some very well done fx fooled me for a few minutes... It's a shame too. The acting was OK most of the time, the photography is good, the special effects are really decent, and the only thing lacking was a coherent plot that would make sense. The end is *really* incomprehensible and it looks as though it's a pilot movie for a series or something. Not worth watching unless you're really into this stuff.
