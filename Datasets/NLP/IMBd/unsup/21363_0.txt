How dare Pang brothers make out such a stupid movie!!!!!!!!!!! I am disappointed !!<br /><br />The first The Eye of the series was very creative and all the cast and crews did very good work. The second one was not as good as the first one. But Shu Qi's acting and the whole story is at least a horror film. But the third one....how to say, I think they can stop making the series. <br /><br />Stupid lines, dull acting, dated horrors, the film contains all the bad parts of a awful hong kong horror film. I don't know Pang brothers want to make the film a horror or a comedy. <br /><br />I guess the Pang brothers may have been affected by some stupid company bosses. The whole film is not their type. If you love the Eye series,don't watch this one.
