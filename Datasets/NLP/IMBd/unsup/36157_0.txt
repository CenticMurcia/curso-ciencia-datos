This was the first episode that I not only didn't like, but actually hated. I thought about deleting it halfway through, and it was an effort to watch. I can't say too much without "spoiling" this useless episode, but let's say that the same information we learned could've been presented in five minutes, instead of an entire program. And I watch this show for drama, politics, sci-fi, and, usually, good scripts and plots - NOT to watch boxing matches. What a complete waste of time! And why is there a ten-line minimum for writing comments here? OK, here's another thing - NONE of the Cylons were on this episode. And by inserting this episode in the middle of the escape from New Caprica, and the dying Cylons, the momentum of the series was completely lost. NOW do I have enough lines for this comment? What do YOU think of the episode?
