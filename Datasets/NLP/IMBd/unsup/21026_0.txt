Hopefully no young people will ever see this horribly bad movie. My friends and I could hardly stop laughing throughout this dim-witted movie. This is a movie that appeals to disgusting bottom-feeders. You can tell that the person who wrote it never graduated high school.<br /><br />The acting is sooo bad. Willem Defoe, listening to music, while walking around the crime scene, at the beginning of the movie, was almost worth seeing this garbage: You will laugh so hard your stomach will hurt. Actually, there's another crime scene investigation, almost as funny as the first: Defoe gets so worked up that he sweats, tears his shirt and fires his gun in the air- AT A CRIME SCENE! My friends and I laughed so hard we were all crying. It was so bad.<br /><br />Even the action scenes are so ridiculous that people stand in plain view, 15 feet away of each other, shoot for 30 seconds straight and no one gets shot! Also the 'saints/nazis' walk in to a courthouse with guns by throwing the bag that's carrying them over a metal detector! It's so stupid that it's hilarious!<br /><br />The writing is horrible! You can tell that troy duffy isn't a very intelligent person. He believes...get this (LOL!): that having people go around killing drug dealers, etc, is a good thing! He obviously has never read any books on poverty or crime. As I mentioned earlier, there's a scene where they walk into a courthouse... Well, this movie is so dumb that the 'saints/nazis' kill the accused BEFORE the verdict is even read!! I'm laughing even as I write this!<br /><br />Ok, on the theme: I'll get serious for a second and say that this movie would be supported by neo-nazis. They'd love the message in this film.<br /><br />That's one of the main reasons why I think this is one of the worst movies ever made. Don't let anyone tell you that this movie is anything like Pulp Fiction- IT ISN'T.<br /><br />I'll state again that is movie is FASCIST. It is targeted for bottom-feeding low-lives.
