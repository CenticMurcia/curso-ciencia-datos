From time to time and in order to remember older better times, it is good to watch again those films that the European aristocracy and especially this German count likes most. Such is the case with "The Student Prince In Old Heidelberg", film directed by Herr Ernst Lubitsch during his Amerikan career.<br /><br />And this German count especially likes this silent film not only because in the oeuvre can be seen Teutonic aristocrats and even crowned kings, not to mention stiff laws about etiquette, uniforms with plenty of medals, tradition, obligation and, last but not least, royal duties. Another reason is because the film has style and classic elegance, primal emotions in motion, beautiful scenery and almost real decors, an impossible but idealistic true love story and memorable and skillful direction. There are a lot of superb silent moments, as for example, the first and unseen kiss in the garden, the night meadow scene, each and every shot starring the heartbreaking Dame Norma Shearer and a charming Herr Ramon Novarro. Besides those indispensable and unforgettable supporting silent actors, there is finally a magnificent, cruel, real and sorrowful ending.<br /><br />"The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg" is a film about youthful dreams, the first painful love and the greatness and illness of falling in love. It's about the passing of time and those glorious memories of loves past that nobody can take away in spite, after all, of those unbearable and unjust social actions of people in high places against working class folk.<br /><br />Obviously this German count is talking about a classical, universal, wonderful masterpiece, a joy to the eye of a serious Teutonic aristocrat.<br /><br />Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
