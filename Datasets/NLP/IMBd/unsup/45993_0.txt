Yes this is something of the grossest films I have ever seen. Already in the beginning it starts full out with blood, sperm, guts, noodles and everything else that's made Miike famous. I didn't quite get what it was all about because the whole movie just seem's like an endless montage of violence, one scene more violence than the other and of course there is also a lot of sex scenes. Know with the sex it's not elegant or anything no it's blow jobs, gay butt-f-ing, dog sex between woman and dog. There's a lot of those things and somethings that's so gross I don't even wan't to write them but I can't say that everything is bad. The music is absolutely superb but it doesn't fit in with the things happening on the screen, but there is one good thing and that is some of the actors who act really good.<br /><br />If you are a hardcore Takashi Miike fan this film might suit you, if you're a psycho it might be fun for you but all other viewers will just feel sick, I sure did.
