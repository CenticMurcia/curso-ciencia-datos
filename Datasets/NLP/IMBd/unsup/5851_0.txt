The Apostle is a wonderfully constructed work that deals with a few intense issues including faith and the Christian's relationship with God. The director uses small scenes and sequences to illustrate how Sonny lives out his faith and to help the viewer experience Sonny's life more fully. For instance, on his way to Louisiana Sonny walks past a bar to catch a bus. Without hesitation he enters the bar and emerges moments later with a slightly inebriated man, telling him that he does not have to go in there anymore. When on his journey, Sonny relies so completely on faith that he actually stops in the middle of a crossroads and kneels to pray, asking God to direct him. God does not disappoint. Though The Apostle is a work of fiction, it does a great job of presenting faith that is shunned by the world and continuously proved by God. When Sonny stops to pray at a car-crash, it appears that the wife is probably dead and the husband is in fairly critical condition. Sonny prays with them despite an officer's orders and drives away. As Sonny is leaving, the viewer sees the wife's hand grip her husbands, presumably showing God's work in the situation; Sonny's reply: "Momma, we made news in heaven today." Duvall's film also deals greatly with the humanity of Christians. Though Sonny is a murderer and a womanizer, God still chooses to use him. One cannot help but to think of Abraham being called and leaving his idols behind. Some say that art imitates life, while others argue that life imitates art. Whichever is true in the end, the Apostle paints a picture of beautifully honest and flawed faith; a picture that everyone can learn from, no matter where they walk.
