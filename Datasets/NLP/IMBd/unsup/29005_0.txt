I really love this show - mainly due to the brilliant acting of Anthony Andrews who I believe was cast perfectly for this role. He played the role of the charming William perfectly... in my opinion his performance really makes Jewels a success. I liked Annette O'Toole also, but found her performance a little grating - especially in the labour scene which I thought was a little over the top. I preferred the first half of the series to the second half. I think that it turned into a bit of a soap opera to me with all their wayward children and their love lives :) I could watch the first half where William and Sarah first meet over and over though. Anthony's performance makes Jewels worth watching.
