This is a movie I will never want to see again, but am extremely fortunate and better for having seen. Despite its exquisite illustration of the gloom, depravity, barbarity, and hatefulness harbored by the Taliban regime, possibly the most fundamentally misogynistic political government to have ever existed, I am unable to look away from how beautiful and talented the lead actress Marina Golbahari is, and how she exquisitely and tragically portrays her character, and how heartbreakingly beautiful it would be if, unlike last year with Keisha Castle-Hughes incredible oscar-nominated but not oscar-winning performance, Marina was nominated and actually won. Because folks, if you watch this movie, she deserves it. From a beggar girl on the streets of Afghanistan to portraying the horror of her country's regime to winning America's most prestigious acting award- wouldn't that be an amazing story we could help create?
