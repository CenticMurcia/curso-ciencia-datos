Mad Bad was flat. The story wasn't interesting in any way. It never seemed to click. The silver lining to his poor movie was Vincent Riverside. He was awesome! He did his best to save this movie. You can't ask for any more than he gave. Vincent Riverside has a screen presence that is commanding. This was a copy cat of the Nic Cage movie with Jolie where he is a car thief. I was disappointed that the movie tried to be slick instead of have any story. It was a car commerical that tried to be a movie. Vincent Riverside reminded me of Christian Slater. This actor should be in a studio movie soon. He has too much talent to not rise above low budget movies.
