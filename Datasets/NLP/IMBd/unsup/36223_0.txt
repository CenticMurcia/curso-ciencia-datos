"The Bat" is indeed a very silly low budget mystery film. There are very few male characters, therefore it is not difficult to guess who "The Bat" is. Vincent Price, in the role of Dr. Malcolm Wells, has a good performance and a well developed character. The banker John Fleming has a minor but also very important participation in the plot. However, the motives of the behavior and double-identity of Lt. Andy Anderson are not explained; Cornelia van Gorder, played by Agnes Moorehead, unsuccessfully tries to be an Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, resolving the murders, but her character is simply awful. The cold reaction of the women in the mansion when their close friend Judy Hollander dies due to the insistence of Dale Bailey to leave their locked room is a shame. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Mans√£o do Morcego" ("The Mansion of the Bat")
