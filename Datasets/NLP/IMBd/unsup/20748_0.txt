If you are from Columbus you would understand things a little better like Bizzy Bone's beef with the Detroit boys. Columbus Gang members use to war with the Detroit boys. it wasn't nice<br /><br />a great story that could have been true. <br /><br />We thought that it was true story until we ran into the people that made it and they said it wasn't.<br /><br />for the record. the guys thought that house was a suburban house obvious haven't been here in the Ceo. that was the straight hood on the east side. some of the folks there just keep their house up.<br /><br />I could see how some people not from here could miss some parts of the movie
