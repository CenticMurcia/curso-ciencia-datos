It is a shame that after a brilliant first two films, full of cameraderie and a great comedy element as well as a plausible plot, this one just ruins it all. There will not be a sequal to this botch up, which sees a greying Eddie Murphy running around a theme park with little support from 'Taggart' or 'Rosewood'. I don't think Eddie will put this on his C.V.
