The USS Nimitz and her crew find themselves flung for no apparent reason whatsoever into the past, D-Day to be precise. It's good for what it is, which is a pure escapist popcorn B-movie. Martin Sheen can't help but pale in comparsion to REAL men like Kirk Douglas and especially Charles Durning. Furthermore Martin shouldn't be able to be in any movie that the military is involved with, but that's just my opinion. Anyway, the movie is enjoyable enough, the ending was so very disappointing though.<br /><br />Blue Underground Limited Edition DVD Extras: Disk 1)Audio commentary with cinematographer Victor J.
