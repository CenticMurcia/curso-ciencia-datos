Wow, I saw this movie last night and it was amazing! I have always had a love for horses and have been around them for over seven years, but that's not the only reason why I loved "Dreamer" as much as I did.<br /><br />All the actors and actresses did such a great job in this movie. I have been a fan of Dakota Fanning for a while now, and I think she does well in almost everything she does, but I don't think it would be possible for her to do any better than she did in this movie. She played her character Cale Crane, perfectly. It was obvious throughout the movie that she loved her horse, Sonador, with all of her heart. She would even sneak out at night to feed her Popsicles! In real life, Dakota has her own horse named Goldie, so she was already used to being around horses before she started filming this movie.<br /><br />Kurt Russel also did an amazing job in this movie. Honestly, I don't think there is any other actor out there that deserved that part more than he did. I've seen Elisabeth Shue (Lily Crane) in another one of her most recent movies, "Hide and Seek," which is a completely different genre of movie, but I thought she did a great job in it, and "Dreamer" as well. Dakota Fanning was also in "Hide and Seek," and did a great job too, as usual.<br /><br />I didn't even notice one single thing in this movie that I would have changed. It was just so good, and I think there should be more movies like this to be made in the future. Everyone in the theater clapped and cheered when Cale's horse Sonador, crossed the finish line in first place at the Breeder's Cup. "Dreamer" is a movie that anyone can enjoy, so if you are looking for a really, really good, inspirational movie, I highly suggest you go see this one. 10/10.
