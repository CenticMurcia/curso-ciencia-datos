Actually, this is an excellent, character driven horror movie made by the creators of Hill Street Blues, which aired 2 years later. Suffice it to say, you have Jason Miller ("The Exorcist")creating another of his too little seen angst ridden characters and E.G. Marshall as an old cop playing Van Helsing, teaming up in search of a vampire uprooted when a construction crew unwittingly release him. It has brains, style and a surprisingly literate script for a change. Again, you get character over MTV videos like those found in the almost unwatchable and campy Lost Boys.<br /><br />Thank God for 1970's movie-making! True, you have a ham of the grind house, Richard Lynch (good in "Scarecrows"), but he is better here as the vampire than you'd expect. At least it was not Henry Silva! For more of this quality, see "The Night Stalker" (a true classic, Dan Curtis' "Dracula" with a fine Jack Palance, and Bob Clark's "Death Dream". Oh yes--- throw in Soprano's creator David Chase's strange drive in flick "Grave of the Vampire" for good measure (not nearly as good though).<br /><br />Sadly, the only as yet released version of this film is a 12 year old VHS tape put out at SLP speed to boot! The above films are all on DVD---let's get this one out there already, huh? Shame on whoever has the rights and has been sitting on it.
