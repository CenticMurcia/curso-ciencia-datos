What do you get when you cross legendary action choreographer Yuen Woo-ping (here directing rather than choreographing) with the plot of Speed 2, a bland leading man, an immensely irritating leading lady, an obnoxious and untalented child actress and some tired and uninspired action scenes? Unfortunately, the answer is a complete waste of time. Probably a career low for all concerned, it's a real slog getting through to the end of this surprisingly cheap-looking and occasionally amateurish mess, all hope that it will get better being continually thwarted as it staggers from tired action scene to tired action scene. And how can you root for a hero who is so inept that, despite being head of security on a liner, fails to prevent the villains killing every single one of the passengers and crew except the aforementioned irritating females - probably the two people most audience members will want out of the picture and fast?<br /><br />Worse than Speed 2 - yes, you read that right: even worse than Speed 2. Not worth the time of day.
