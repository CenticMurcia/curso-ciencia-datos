I found this movie interesting not so much for the story, but for the unique look at the Canadian inferiority complex laid bare. Every country has it's myths but rarely is a country so invested in a fantasy surrounding obsolete hardware. That said, the movie is chock-full of inaccuracies that feed this strange need to proclaim the Avro Arrow the most amazing machine ever conceived by humanity. Anybody could make a machine, destroy it, blame his neighbor for making him destroy it and then go into a 40 year rage about how it was the best invention since the beginning of time and they were robbed...but people would think he's a fool. This movie makes Canada look foolish. Message to my Northern neighbors: CANADA IS A GREAT COUNTRY! ANY country would pale next to the US at this point in history. We're bigger than Rome at their height for glory. Take heart! What goes up must come down, we won't be this way forever. My suggestion would be to just sit back and enjoy the ride, incredible market access and free defense.
