Vegas Vampires (2003) is a low budget film directed and co-starring Fred Williamson. A vampire is running around Las Vegas creating problems for the local police, especially two of them (Tiny Lister and Glenn Plummer). During this time, a P.I. and his buddy (Fred Williamson and Richard Roundtree) decide to have some fun in Vegas. An outbreak of vampires starts to slowly spread about the city and our heroes and a lot of innocent people are about to get caught up in a vampire holocaust. Entertaining and funny, it was great to see Richard Roundtree and Fred Williamson kicking arse and taking names.<br /><br />Two problems I had with this movie, one was blurring of name brand t-shirts and jerseys. That was a big problem, it was such an eye sore. The second one was the lead role given to Tiny Lister. He's good as a secondary character, but the man's not a lead actor. He wasn't that good. Otehr wise I enjoyed the movie. It was a big shock. I would rather watch this than have to suffer through another viewing of UNderworld.<br /><br />cheers,
