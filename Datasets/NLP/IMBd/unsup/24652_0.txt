My God that's probably the 1st time anyone has ever asked that question. The main problem with this this movie is that it's too long. With commercials its running time is about 2 hours. It's about 1 hour and 58 minutes too long. Were sleeping tablets issued to the cast before filming? The real turkey on Thanksgiving was the film.
