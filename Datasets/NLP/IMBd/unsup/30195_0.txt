As a Univeristy student, studying the Narratives of the Black Atlantic, I was asked to view "Sankofa" during lecture time to further get an understanding of the topic. The film was fantastic in the portrayal of the characters, the lighting and sounds were authentic to the plights of the slaves and how some of the overcame their injustices at the hands of the slave holders.<br /><br />A film that definitely changed my view and made me think. I would recommend it to anyone thinking of studying the Black Atlantic although it is hard to watch, as some of the scenes depict the raping and the whipping of the slaves, all of which did happen on the plantations in the West Indies.
