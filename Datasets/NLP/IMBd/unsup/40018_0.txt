Lief Garrett? This movie blows. It makes you go "what the heck? that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" It really does! Quite a few times. It's so predictable and none of the characters have any originality. That one weasely looking guy looks like Dennis Christopher's annoying brother. The office scenes, the sex scenes, the demon scenes, it's all been done before. It's very stereotyped and very lame and very boring. And balding Leif Garrett can hardly keep his eyes open the whole time anyway.<br /><br />The hyper high school girl says to Lief, who is about 30 years old, "Would you like to fu*k me?" very clearly, then he says "excuse me?" and she says, "I said, would you like a cup of tea?" and I said out loud, "what the heck? whatever!" and rewound it and it's so stupid that anyone could ever think those two sentences sound the same and it has nothing to do with the girl's personality. Why did she say that? I don't get it. LAME LAME LAME STUFF
