Okay, this ain't amazing..... But look, for every "Close encounters...." there has to be a "Plan 9 from outerspace"!<br /><br />I'll happily admit that this is bubblegum cinema at it's best, pure and unadulterated candy floss. But I can live with it.<br /><br />Okay, saw the poster and thought: "YES!! Independence day in england, with Dragons! Burn London, Burn!" Safe to say I was disappointed. But what I did get was a "mad max" style fight for survival.<br /><br />The dragons looked good and the acting was acceptable, if not sterotyping with Bale's 'pie-n-mash' cockney and mathew mc's 'Texan-gas-station-attendent'.<br /><br />A more than acceptable film if you're not looking for an oscar winner. Oh, and the starwars story was more than worth the admission fee alone!
