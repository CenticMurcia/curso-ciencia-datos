I had heard about the movie from my local newspaper and the critique was "a nice movie to watch with friends after work". This is exactly what we did.<br /><br />After about 3 minutes I regretted watching wasting time and money on these 90 minutes of absolutely horrible "stuff". This was the first movie I was inclined to leave since "Hoffa" (I fell asleep in that one).<br /><br />None of the characters are funny, the plot is terribly weak and way to easy to follow, the "east German" is horrible - I've heard better on B-Radio Shows and references to Matrix and Silence of the Lambs are futile attempts to make the movie funny.<br /><br />The Butler Adolph Hatler, a weak impersonation of Hitler is funny the first time he shows up... and that's that.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this.
