This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life and I am sorry I paid money to buy the DVD that I will throw in the trash. Erotic - NO Female nudity - Technically yes about 1 minute in total Sex - NO For practical purposes this was NOT based on the novel by the Marquis de Sade; in fact in the interview the writer admits he rewrote the story to accommodate Tyrone Power's daughter who could not act. So there is no Black Mass or anything of the original book except the two sisters originally being taught by nuns in a convent. This was a shear waste of money on the part of Franco that could have been his masterpiece with the expensive sets and costumes that were absolutely splendid. Jack Palance was totally miscast, even if he were sober it would have made little difference. The same was true with Klaus Kinski because his performance was too remote and did not narrate the story all the way through. Franco said he asked Orson Wells to play the part of the Marquis de Sade, again totally wrong if you are going to make a porno movie. I have no idea what he was thinking. The story was so confused that it failed to make real sense because it deviated from the original novel so much. This movie was not a porno or anything else, it was just a big nothing.
