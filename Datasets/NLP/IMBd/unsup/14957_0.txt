It's easy to understand why Airforce One was such a big hit. The President saves the country. America has an honorable man as their leader and he's saving them from those no good filthy Reds again. Audiences walked out with pride in their hearts (fuelled by Jerry Goldsmith's rousing score) and they forgot about the LewinskyGate scandal that was going down with the REAL President.<br /><br />But the film is very good in it's own right too. Wolfgang Peterson creates a heavy feeling of tension, Ford a likable hero and Oldman a hissable villain who was actually quite scary. The film is also very well put together technically. The editing and sound is top-notch.<br /><br />But there are flaws. And one BIG flaw. Some of the dialogue really sucks. And Wendy Crewson is VERY bad as the First Lady. The only reason her character is even in it is because every President has a First Lady. Her role is totally useless. I predicted her EVERY line of dialogue before she even said it. I am not kidding. Even Oldman at one point tells her to 'SHUT UP!' I never thought I would find myself agreeing with a Russian terrorist but now I have.<br /><br />If you can overlook this minor, although highly irritating, glitch you will totally enjoy a high-octane action film with many, increasingly exciting, set-pieces. Very cool.
