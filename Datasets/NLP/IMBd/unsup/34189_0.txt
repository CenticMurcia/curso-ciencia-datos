Somewhat entertaining. The movie is essentially plot -driven. The plot is incredulous at best but when it has holes in it there isn't much left. The bit with the birds is a major flaw. Homing pigeons "home" to one location only. They will not fly back & forth. In my mind the romance at the end is also totally unbelievable. 4/10
