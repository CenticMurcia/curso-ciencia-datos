I can't imagine what would have possessed Carrie Fisher to be in this movie. Maybe she had a big house payment looming...I can't say. But I can't think of one good reason to watch this movie, so don't ask me why I did.<br /><br />It opens with Melissa (Laura Prepon from That 70's Show) waking up next to Carlos (Matt Cedeño) the day before her wedding. There's just one problem...Carlos isn't Melissa's intended groom. She's hung over and doesn't remember anything from the previous evening, not even marrying a total stranger.<br /><br />What follows is your typical meant-for-each-other-but-they-don't-know-it comedy of errors that won't provide any surprises. The few laughs (and I'm talking 1 or 2) come from Carrie Fisher as Melissa's headstrong mother. The only good thing I can say is Matt Cedeño is quite easy on the eyes, and the scenery is breathtaking. So unless you're a bride-to-be scouting locations for your honeymoon like the previous reviewer (I mean really...ever heard of a vacation planner?) you should avoid this movie.
