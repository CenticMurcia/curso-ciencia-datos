I rented this movie hoping the cover art would have some influence on the movie itself. But what i got was one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. The only gore was a very short decapitation, but that was'nt enough for me to like this movie. Since it is an Italian horror movie, one would have good reason to expect more gore than average, but noooooooooooooooooooooooo, it just drags on & on & beats it self into the ground. When I was on my way home to watch it, I noticed that someone wrote on the video's sleeve :" do not watch this movie" in pen. Maybe i should have listened to them. It is some kind of murder/cult/mystery thingy, so if you are a zombie/gore fan, don't even bother. If you are a HUGE fan of Italian horror, you might like it. I sure did'nt.
