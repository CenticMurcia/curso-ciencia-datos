Being a Disney film, the outcome is predictable, but Walt Disney always wanted to turn out "wholesome" family entertainment. He said that he would never produce any movie which you would be embarrassed to watch with your children in the room.<br /><br />Cow Belles, as the IMDb plot summary indicates, is about 2 spoiled rich girls, who have absolutely NO concept about how working people live their lives and manage to survive.<br /><br />When their Dad makes them go to work in the company business, to repay someone for a major problem they caused, they learn a lot about "the real world".<br /><br />It actually reminds me a little of Paris Hilton & Nicole Ritchie on "Simple Life", except the 2 girls in the movie actually LEARN something, where Paris & Nicole don't seem to learn anything - they just get grossed out & can't wait to return to their pampered lifestyles.
