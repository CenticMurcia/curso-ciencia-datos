Doesn't rate even the 2 1/2 stars given by "Maltin", except that he is correct when he says "talk, talk, talk". I had never really known until this picture the true meaning of "talky" as applied to a movie - the dialogue goes on continually, unceasingly, confusingly, and often superfluously. After a while you wish everyone would just shut up. Dramatic tension is nonexistent, as is true suspense. Gregory Peck, with his feeble attempt at a British accent, is horribly miscast. The strained marital relationship between Charles Laughton and Ethel Barrymore is perplexing as portrayed. Evidently Hitchcock neglected this production as he was preoccupied with breaking away from Selznick and establishing an independent production company. Things were not helped by Selznick's daily revisions of the script. This movie must be regarded as one of Hitch's outright failures.
