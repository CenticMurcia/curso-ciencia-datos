very rarely do I go into a movie expecting total crap and I get disappointed cause it was shittier than expected. This is one of those rare occasions. My biggest question has to be, when the hell did the turtles get herpes pock marks all over their body. The set designs were incredibly accurate. No longer do I have the urge to travel back in time to feudal Japan thanks to this film. It is easily the most accurate picture of the era painted. Last Samurai needs to give a shout out to this film, as it clearly stole stock footage from this movie and just added Tom Cruise with special effects. The best part had to have been Cory Feldman voicing Donatello. His smooth voice put me to sleep.
