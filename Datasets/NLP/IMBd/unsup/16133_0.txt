Scream talked about the rules if you are going to survive a horror movie. Well there's nothing out there is the pretext to that and have other rules of surviving a horror movie in the woods which includes no skinny dipping. I love the Mike character, reminds me allot of me. He is the best written character in this whole movie. The others are good too but he has to be my favorite. The brilliant writing and subtext. The acting is better then some serious horror movies and the effects are incredible. This has got to be the best movie that you never heard of. All and all a great movie worth watching over and over again. 9 STARS.
