She's cute, she's funny, she's sassy, and she's getting better every day! She has 1000 expressions and they're all cute. Scripted TV cannot beat her natural talent. I love it when she gets mad. Just let it all out and be yourself, Marilyn!<br /><br />I will agree that sometimes she doesn't hear the arguments and sometimes she seems to make judgments based on her own prejudices. But ... it's small claims court, so what can you do? She's not perfect, but she's great.<br /><br />I learned a lot about basic law from watching Joseph Wapner back in the 80's. Get it in writing. Preponderance of evidence. Making you whole. Who's the liar? Get three bids. Dogs must be leashed. Etc. etc. etc. <br /><br />Marilyn is just as informative as Joe and a LOT hotter!<br /><br />I would love to see a "Best of People's Court". It would rock! I'm compiling a few myself. If you ever saw the case with Alana Sheridan trying to date the wanna-be wise guy -- it was a scream!!! Or the guy who wanted his garage demo'd, so he hired the job to a guy who sold it to get rid of it. Or the woman who set her apartment on fire, then sued her landlord. Fantastic! <br /><br />I wish the show would come back to southern California. New York people are interesting but I want to see MY PEEPS in court again!
