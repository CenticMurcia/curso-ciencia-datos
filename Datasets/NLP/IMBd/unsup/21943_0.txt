I had never seen any trailers or read any reviews of 'Frequency' so when it was there to be watched on a Saturday evening on a satellite movie channel, the synopsis sounded interesting so I settled down to watch 'another movie'.<br /><br />Boy, did I get a surprise. My wife was working in the other room and half way through the film came in to see why I was standing up shouting at the screen! "SATCH! LOOK AT THE BASEBALL GAME ON THE TV FOR THE SHOE POLISH BALL... NOW!!", I shouted! I have never got so wrapped up in a film before that has caused me to react in such a way.<br /><br />A month later it was repeated and my wife and eldest child sat and watched it with me to see what all the fuss was about. Like I had been (and was again) they were completely engrossed and openly declared 'frequency' to be a massive hit and 'one of the best they had ever seen'.<br /><br />After scanning some reviews on IMDB I cannot understand what some people expect from a movie. If I want to be factually informed, I watch a documentary or read a book. If I want to want to watch something that accurately reflects reality, I watch a 'fly on the wall', or read a biography. If I want to be entertained, I watch a movie. One thing for sure is that 'Frequency' entertained me thoroughly and moved me too and, unlike the grizzlers of this world, I am not ashamed to say it.<br /><br />It has suspense, emotion, plot twists, characters you like and an enjoyable ending. What more could you ask for. Its a sad reflection on our society that some people actually wanted a different ending.<br /><br />Its an excellent movie that will be in my DVD collection by lunchtime Monday. Amongst my top three ever, I will watch it again and again.
