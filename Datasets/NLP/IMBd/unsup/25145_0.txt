genocide genocide is that the only word in thousands years old Armenian language... do you know what the genocide is just look to the people i turkey from Caucasus, Balkans and Crimea no need to say something else about genocide.<br /><br />massacres inflicted by Armenians to hamshins, Kurds, turks and Tatars (azeris of today) why its always found out only Muslim graves in eastern Anatolia rather than so called genocided Armenians?? where are their graves if such big population were wiped out there must be a proof left where are those, under black sea as Caucasians? or inside the village wells of east Anatolia, if you are blaming someone or a society you must prove it else you are liar, turks have many proofs from late 19th century to 1991 hocalÄ± where are Armenian proofs. Turks can prove that Armenians are terrorists just you prove that turks are genosiders. Wake up from your long tailed tale if turks wanted to genocide Armenians what made them wait 900 years who could resist against that will of 3 super powers ruled the region. and where did the Armenians reproduce so much again all over the world. if 1.5 million of less than 2 million of them are killed in the first quarter of century how come they are now 10 million across the world 1-to-20(if all beings are at a reproductive age)in only 3-4 generations and in such poverty what a fast reproduction rate...
