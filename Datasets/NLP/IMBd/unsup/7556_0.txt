Yes, I remember this show.<br /><br />After growing up enjoying Emergency with Mantooth and Tighe, we were given this return to rescue stunts.<br /><br />But it failed to measure up.<br /><br />Essentially what 240 Robert did was bring Mark Harmon to the limelight.<br /><br />Other than that, the show was awful.<br /><br />And pray tell, what did the numbers mean? I asked my brother, named Robert.<br /><br />"Two wheels, four wheels and no wheels," he replied, as rescues were done on motorcycles (yes, a la CHiPs), four wheeled vehicles and the helicopter.<br /><br />"But why use the name 'Robert'?" I asked further.<br /><br />"Because it is a wonderful name," Robert replied.
