I like to think that after shooting this drek Hitchcock left for the USA one jump ahead of a mob of discerning movie-goers handicapped by the huge amounts of tar and feathers they were carrying. It's the Romantic in me. Of course the truth is vastly different if unconvincing; Hitch went on to become the idol of those who worship mediocrity and managed to dazzle Truffaut (and if ever two over-inflated filmmakers deserved each other ...). So, what of this, his last effort on British soil for a couple of decades. The glib answer is that Hitch had no gift for 'period' pieces - witness Under Capricorn, the biggest turkey since the one Scrooge bought for Tiny Tim - but that implies that he had a gift for SOMETHING. Lots of folks out there think so but it's always proved elusive to these hard-to-please eyes. Charles Laughton hams his way through the lion's share and grudgingly allows the likes of Leslie Banks, Maureen O'Hara and the best actor in the movie, Bobby Newton, to get a look in. Oh, yes, it's about smugglers and set in a papier-mache Cornwall. Easily Pleased Enjoy.
