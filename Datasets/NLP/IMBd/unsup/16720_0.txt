I don't see what everyone sees in Yakkity Yak because it is the worst Nick show I have ever seen and it's an insult to Happy tree Friends. I mean it, it's WAY overrated and I Will tell you why: 1) Highpant. Need I say more? I will anyway, Mr. Highpants is the worst Yakkity character who has ever been created. He's just really annoying and he ruins the show.<br /><br />2) The voice acting. The VA in this show is horrible, especially Highpant's VA. He sounds like he has absolutely no personality what so ever. Rondo sounds like a dead elephant, Lemony voice is just high-pitched and annoying, The Robot mime sounds too sexy (which is stupid), and so on and so foreth. This bugs me in CatDog too. Why would Satain the Bunny (I refuse to call him Rancid Rabbit) change his voice when he yells at a person (Cat)that he hates most? LAME!!! CatDog just got stupidder<br /><br />3) I hear that in one episode, Lemony made fun of Yakkity at school.<br /><br />4) How is it that Yakkity goes to school? pelswick was a great Nicktoon show but this one is just terrible and I don't recommend it to anyone. Sorry CatDog, but I can't give it to ya this time.
