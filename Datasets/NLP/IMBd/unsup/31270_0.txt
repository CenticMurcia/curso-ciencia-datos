There's a lot more to add to this movie, than just saying that it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen! It's offensive and abuses the human ears, but that's ironically part of its charm. The outstanding use of vulgar humor is projected to the point of numbing morality for the near 2 hours spent watching it. But, if you look beneath the language and edgy material, this movie is SO DEEP! <br /><br />Like other really good comedians, the Directors of '?' are able to tell you the depressing truth while making you laugh so hard you can hardly breathe. Beyond the comic genius and well delivered jokes, the political and social satire is brilliant, and the plot in no way suffers for all the other antics of the film. The seemingly simple, but actually complex story line shows how well-written and thought out the film was. I loved all the subtleties and symbolism, while the main characters, Art, West & Nancy make for quite a fascinating dynamic trio.<br /><br />If you're not easily offended or disgusted, you should definitely give this film a look.
