I went into the theater with an open mind, as a friend claimed to have enjoyed this movie (that's the last time I take advice from him). After the first 10 minutes it become obvious that the entire movie would be nothing but massively overused, immature jokes that were never funny in the first place, along with very poorly written dialogue and the most predictable storyline since a cop eating a donut. There was not one moment throughout the entire film where I even chuckled once. The only people I would even consider recommending this film to are those with an IQ below 75 who have never once heard a joke in their life. Actually, no, I wouldn't even want them to suffer through it.
