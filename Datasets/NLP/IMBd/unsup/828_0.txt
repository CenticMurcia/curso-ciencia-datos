Marc decides, before he and his wife Agnes go to dinner at friends, to shave his mustache. He says nothing about it, expecting Agnes to comment on it, but she doesn't seem to notice. And neither do their friends. And neither do his co-workers. And Marc is quietly freaking out. Finally, he breaks down & says something to Agnes, who says he never HAD a mustache, and every one else that he's expected to notice tells him the same thing. Marc, however, becomes somewhat obsessed with proving that he DID have a mustache, which worries those around him until he's asked to seek help. He's even produced pictures of them on vacation with him with his mustache, but Agnes never really looks at them & later they've disappeared to, and Agnes denies they ever vacationed in that place to begin with.<br /><br />But things get even stranger as Marc is to have lunch with Agnes at his parents the next day, & his father has called to remind him, only to have Agnes tell him that his father's been dead for some time. And their friends that they had dinner with recently? Where'd they go? Did they never exist? Marc, of course, is getting more & more agitated & Agnes drugs him when he goes to lie down for a while...Marc comes to just in time to hear Agnes & his boss, Bruno, talking about "the men in the white coats" that are coming to take Marc away, and using all his conscience strength to dress himself & make ready, he manages to bolt & impulsively takes a flight to Hong Kong, where he rides the ferries and wanders, eventually taking a room.<br /><br />And the film gets weirder from there. I don't quite know how to categorize this film...a dark comedy/psychological thriller? Maybe..it is very interesting and pretty darn good though, even though you never really know what you've just witnessed. Is it a conspiracy? Is Marc losing his mind? Or is it just a strange dream? Can't tell you, don't know, but it's well worth seeing. 7 out of 10.
