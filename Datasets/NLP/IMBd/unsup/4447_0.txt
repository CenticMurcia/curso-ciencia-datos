I used to love the TV series as a kid, I almost never missed it, so I decided to see this film both to see if there was any resemblance, and why the critics hate it, from director Britt Allcroft (who created the show). Basically the supply of gold dust, for travel between Shining Time and the island of Sodor, is running out for Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin). It doesn't help when Thomas the Tank Engine (Edward Glen) and friends are being attacked by the nasty Diesel 10 (Neil Crone), who also wants to find the missing train Lady (Allcroft) and the Magic Railroad it runs on. Trying to help the situation are Mr. C's slacker cousin (Michael E. Rodgers), new friend Lily (slightly deeper voiced Mara Wilson), and her grandpa Burnett Stone (Peter Fonda), who has lost his belief in the magic of Lady. That's about it. Also starring Cody McMains as Patch, Grease's Didi Conn as Stacy Jones, Crone as Gordon, Colm Feore as Toby, Linda Ballantyne as Percy, Kevin Frank as Bertie the Bus, Harold the Helicopter and Henry, Susan Roman as James and Shelley Skinner as Annie and Clarabel. No Fat Controller!? Maybe if Ringo Starr or Michael Angelis had returned to do all the characters voice, it could have improved it the tiniest bit. Then again, nothing can improve the ridiculous story, the stupid acting, the dreadful songs, and the feel that it is nothing like the TV series, even if it looks the same, it's just one of the worst TV adaptations ever. Very poor!
