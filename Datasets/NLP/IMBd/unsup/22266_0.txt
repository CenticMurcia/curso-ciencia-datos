Skyhawks was one of my favorite cartoons, though it was on all too briefly. The producers really knew their stuff, as it was quite accurate and informative for young viewers. Being an aviation nut when this show was on, I couldn't get enough of it. I really hope this show turns up on DVD soon.<br /><br />Does anyone know where I can get a recording of the theme song? It really ROCKED and to this day I love it. I have a recording of the closing version of the song which I made with a cheap cassette recorder off of the even cheaper three-inch TV speaker. I'd like to find a higher fidelity version, and the version of the opening theme (which included lyrics -- the closing theme was instrumental). Can anyone help me? Thanks.
