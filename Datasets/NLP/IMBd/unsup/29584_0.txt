If you hear reviews for this movie, you hear that this movie is really good or terrible. I however thought it was satisfactory. The movie is fun to watch, and a must see for Salman, Rani and Preity fans. The movie is such where a person with expectations would have them fulfilled. But the movie isn't anything too special where one can call it memorable. It is a version of While You Were Sleeping and this version works just as well. The movie has slight plot holes but overall it's a good movie. This is the second of three comedy movies I saw of Salman in 2000 with others being DHLJ (1st) and KPNHJ (3rd). He acts not as good as the former but better than the latter. His jokes here are stupid and an embarrassment for him. Despite the comedy scenes, he is still good in the emotional scenes. This is the first of two films with the same trio. In CCCC Preity Zinta overshadowed Rani. Here Rani completely overshadows Preity. Rani looks beautiful and is given a stronger role. Rani has the right amount of emotion and makes Preity look bad. Preity by no means bad. But here I found here to be a little annoying. She does do good acting, but was overshadowed by Rani in looks and acting. The supporting cast was good, but I didn't understand the whole KKHH spoof. Shahrukh Khan's character is confusing, but he is okay I suppose. Now besides Rani, the other best part of the movie was the songs. My favorite song, Piya Piya is nicely shot and puts a perfect smile on your face. The title song is another nice song and nicely shot (Rani looks extremely beautiful). Dil Dil Deewana is fun to watch. Aate Jaate, despite being a wonderful song, was a bit boring. Aisa Pehli Baar Hua Hai was nicely danced, but the song was quite overrated. Being a good movie, the songs do help in the mood of the movie. So for people looking for a good time, watch this movie.
