this show is show hilarious! after one episode (i watched it on accident once after that 70's show, which is still the very best show on tv), i was hooked. My personal favorite episode is the one where steven and lizzie each have a respective night out with their gender, where steven, lloyd (my fav character), ron, and marshall (my 2nd fav character)go to a party and marshall gets lloyd's overflow. lizzie, rachel, and a bunch of extras go to a bar and have a good time also. hilarious episode. the most underrated show on tv, and while th andy richter show looks really good, i hope it doesn't replace the best attempt at a new show since malcolm in the middle (fox works wonders by going against convention...look at it, simpsons is a cartoon, 70's show is a period piece, malcolm introduced a new style, undeclared is breaking new ground, grounded for life is flashbacked, titus is hardcore...man i love fox)watch it, you won't be disappointed
