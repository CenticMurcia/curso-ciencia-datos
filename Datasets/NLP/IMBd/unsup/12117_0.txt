Why this film has recieved an average of 6.5 is a total mystery! I can only agree with some of the other commentators: see it, as if it was a parody! Just wait for the finishing line: "Come on girls, Daddy is here - itÂ´s time to go home!" Rip your hair out, cry - or laugh your brains out... your choice!
