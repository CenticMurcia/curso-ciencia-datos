I love the police-type of TV shows and 240-Robert is one of my favorites! Mark Harmon, John Bennett Perry and Joanna Cassidy made a GREAT team! The characters sense of humor and professionalism made this show very believable. I remember seeing this show as a kid and thinking how proud it must be to serve as a Deputy Sheriff. I hope to visit the old 240-Robert station in California some day. I hear that it is a lifeguard station located off Pacific Coast Highway.<br /><br />Perhaps 240-Robert will show up in reruns someday? That would truly be an AWESOME day indeed!
