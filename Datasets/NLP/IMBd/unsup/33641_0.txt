Not in sum, but every part seems familiar. It plays like a montage of previous rom coms.<br /><br />There's nothing objectionable about it, but then again there's nothing memorable either. It's blurb, a schedule filler, one in the bank.<br /><br />Pegg and Moran just sleepwalk through the same parts that they always play, not expanding their range on iota. Pegg's cringing everyman is getting quite tired now. Thandie Newton just has to stand in doorways and look pretty. Her character is a prize, not a person. The bit parts are played by the usual assortment of jobbing British actors, also on autopilot. Azaria is the strongest actor, but isn't given much of a part. His character development goes: good, good, good... evil, with no reason given for the sudden transition.<br /><br />Everything about it, Schwimmer's direction included, is just... adequate. There's no snap, no pizazz, and no chemistry between any of the actors, something that becomes painfully obvious when listening to the awkward stilted commentary track. Film making by box ticking. <br /><br />The whole is instantly forgettable, and dreadfully disappointing given the collection of talent working on it.
