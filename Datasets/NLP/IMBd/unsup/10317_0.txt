I'm not going to talk about the actors. Everyone here has already done that and the problem I have with this film doesn't involve the acting at all. It is very well done. However, it is sad and depressing. Not many people will want to watch Marie struggle to accept the fact that her husband is 'gone' and that she is now alone. Her husband has been gone for 3 months and she talks about him as if he never disappeared. The husband's mother, who is in a nursing home, makes a comment to Marie telling her that she's probably crazy and boring too. Maybe that is why her son disappeared-because he was bored with his life & his wife. Why anyone would make such a comment to someone suffering is beyond me. But for some reason, there it is, this pathetic scene hinting that Marie might be insane. She isn't. She's grief stricken and unable to accept the fact that her husband may be dead, perhaps by suicide. If this all sounds dismal, be prepared. This is NOT an uplifting film at all. I enjoyed "Swimming Pool" much better and wouldn't want to sit through this again. Try something else.
