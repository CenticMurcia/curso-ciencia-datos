Peter Jackson and Costa Boeates decided to make this great mockumentary about a man called Colin McKenzie, a man who invented such things as color film, audio film and above all, made the first full length feature movie.<br /><br />Apparently it was quite a successful hoax in New Zealand, people really did buy it. And I really can't blame them, as most of the fabricated film material really looks like almost hundred years old, almost destroyed film.<br /><br />And there are some very convincing famous film people, like Sam Neil, telling their knowledge of this McKenzie.<br /><br />Even the tone of the film isn't actually very funny, even thought there are some things in it that are so absurd, that they make you laugh.<br /><br />Over all well made mockumentary.
