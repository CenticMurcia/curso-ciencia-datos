I saw Keane at the New York Film Festival. I was so awe struck that I returned the following night to see it again. Damian Lewis becomes Keane and you are oblivious to the fact that it is an actor portraying a character. Your emotions follow William Keane through his schizophrenic world and the movie takes you in on several levels.<br /><br />You begin to feel Keane's pain and anguish. You begin to see a man that lives literally day to day. And you begin to hope that Keane will in the end begin to redeem himself.<br /><br />Although I have not seen much of Damian Lewis' work in the US, the next time I see his name connect with any movie or TV program, I will be sure to watch. A triumph for both director, Lodge Kerrigan and actor Damian Lewis.
