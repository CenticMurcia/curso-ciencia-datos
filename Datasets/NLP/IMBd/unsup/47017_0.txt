Even if the stars do a great job, the action is definitely the biggest star in this film, as in the others in the series, and therefore the story has it faults. But if you go for a rollercoaster ride, do you expect subtlety? I hope not, and with that in mind, a lot can be forgiven in this kind of movie, but some things just plain bug me. Like how ** SPOILER WARNING** Anck-su-namun would leave her beloved because she is afraid of a little raining stone! This girl killed a god (or at least a man perceived as one) for Imhotep, and she has already been brought back to life, still she freezes in fear while our brave (and beautiful) Rachel Weizs races to the rescue. **SPOILER END** And most times we are going directly from the one big action scene to the other, without any pause or development of plot. Mostly because of the lack of it. Still, the film could be really good for what it is attempting, cut the brakes and full gas and all that stuff, but then at least they should have gotten the special-effects right so the scorpion king didn`t look like a plastic doll. Back to the rollercoaster example. It is often the slow ride before you plunge, where you hold the breath and wait in excitement that makes the moment, but here you just keep on going downwards from the cool beginning to the more and more excruciating ending.
