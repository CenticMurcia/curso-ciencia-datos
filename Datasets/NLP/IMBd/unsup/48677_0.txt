This is a prime candidate for worst 'comedy' film ever made.<br /><br />They came close to screwing up; there were a couple moments where I almost cracked a smileÂ…almost. I have a friend who loves this film. His wife and I are considering having him committed to a sanitarium for just that reason. Neither of us can see what makes this film so amusing to him. At the same time, he can't see the entertainment value of "The Beyond" or "Dellamorte Dellamore" (aka Cemetery Man), two popular cult films. <br /><br />What's wrong with "Naked Space"? It's not funny; it's uproariously unfunny. The attempts at jokes all fall flat. They even attempt an ill-advised musical number. They say that 'drama is easy, comedy is hard'. This is a textbook example of how badly a comedy film can fail.<br /><br />The DVD I saw this on was where it was re-titled and called "Naked Space" in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Leslie Nielsen in the entertaining movie parody series "The Naked Gun" (based on the old "Police Squad!" TV series). The idea of this film was to parody old B grade sci-fi creature movies on obviously cheaply made sets. Even "The Seventh Planet", in all its awfulness, did a better job of that while probably attempting to be somewhat serious sci-fi.<br /><br />Bruce Kimmel has never directed a good movie and probably never will. He helped write the story for Robert Rodriguez's "The Faculty", but it was simply a B grade sci-fi horror film idea that was made into a good film by Rodriguez's direction and a decent cast.<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen can be very funny in parodies of a variety of film genres. This is not one of those movies. I rate this film only slightly higher than complete failures like such bad Z grade zombie films as "Day of the Dead 2: Contagium" and "Dead Life". The only reason to watch this film is because you lost a bet (and that should put anyone off of gambling). One could be excused for thinking that the cast members appear in this film because they lost a bet with Kimmel.<br /><br />Run, do not walk, away from your nearest video store to avoid this movie!
