I thought that this show was a blatant rip-off of intense and profoundly tormenting 'reality news' turned to fiction. The offense here is not that the cast is at least, admirable, but rather that the writer and the writing steals from the pain of others. This is a script lacking in ethics with an abundance of lowest common denominator morality. Perhaps a third season was too much. Nonetheless, I feel sorry for the real victims in the schools of America. The second half of the first season and the second season were going somewhere prior to this stall.<br /><br />All-in-all, where are some new ideas that are fresh and original?
