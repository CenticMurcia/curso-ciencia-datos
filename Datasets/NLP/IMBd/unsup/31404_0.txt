Araki has Gen X irony/detachment down to a T. His characters are so apathetic that they say, "whatev", instead of "whatever." That one bit of dialogue alone I believe makes him a genius. I can't claim to understand the whole movie in a unified sense--it's as jarring, overwhelming, prolific, fast-paced, and difficult to digest as pop culture. But particular scenes seem very deliberate and well-crafted. For instance, the three main characters go through a drive-through, which resembles a nuclear power plant, terribly unnatural. One of the characters orders "deep-fried cheese chunks... and an evian." The utter absurdity of the evian is simply delicious in this scene. Consumer culture is hypocritical, foolish, and deluded. Araki's films say, we've created such irreversible urban decay that we've reached the existential state in which nothing we do could make it worse and so let's embrace pointless violence. 10/10
