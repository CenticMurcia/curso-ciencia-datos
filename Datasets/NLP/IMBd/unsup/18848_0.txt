OK, I first saw this video with my b/f, who was a huge Jennifer fan. I admit, I was taken by Jennifer's beauty, and each time we viewed it, I found myself tied, re-enacting the video for my b/f. The story is pretty basic, but Jennifer brings a sexuality to being helpless that makes it hard not to love. You find yourself rooting for the villain in the video, hoping he'll make her suffer in new ways. I even went as Kelly for Halloween one year just to keep my b/f happy. I taped my hair down over my breasts, wore not top, and only a pair of small white, silk panties. It made everyone else happy too. LOL This video is a must see. I have since dumped the b/f, and changed teams, and am now a huge Jennifer fan. This video is great!!! Watch it, act it out, it is great!!!!
