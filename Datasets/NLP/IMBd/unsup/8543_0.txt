For me, "Blood Simple", "Fargo" and "No Country..." live in a special Coen stratosphere. Then "Barton Fink", "Raising Arizona", "the Big Lebowski" and "the Man Who Wasn't There" belong in the next class. I'd have to put "Burn After Reading" somewhere in the lower to mid second-class group, but above "Intolerable Cruelty" and "Oh Brother".<br /><br />I think that after making a such a serious and dramatic effort last year, they're just goofing off this year, and that's fine, they're allowed to do that. They've earned it. But it's not like this movie is really that good or anything. It's screwy and fun, sometimes works, sometimes doesn't quite. I especially liked Brad Pitt, probably because he's the only one showing some new colors here. It's like he started from scratch and built this guy from experiences he once had in high school.<br /><br />"Burn After Reading" passes the time, but don't build this up too much, because it's mostly just a whole lot of goofing around that just holds itself together because of the talents of the Coens.
