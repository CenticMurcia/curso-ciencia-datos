Why is Disney wasting their time with these unoriginal sequels to classic movies? I can hardly fathom another movie studio rehashing their movies as much as Disney does. And I doubt the viewing audience is what they have in mind.<br /><br />Cinderalla III is a 'what if?' movie. What if the stepmother was able to stop Cinderella from being the woman who fits the glass slipper. And so we see a spell and a trick, yet Cinderella still gets her man. That was never in doubt. Yet one of her sisters also turns good.<br /><br />I followed the story, but never gave it much credit. The ending seemed all to perfect. Nothing dramatic happens - like the originals. But instead, it is small things. Wish Disney would do better sequels, but I guess they can only do that with Pirates of the Caribbean. "D"
