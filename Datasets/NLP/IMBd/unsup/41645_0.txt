This is one of those shows that deserves it's own drinking game. Every time the host shrieks or cries, take a drink. Every time Derek says "Slaughter", take a drink. Every time they say that a place isn't haunted, drink a whole fifth of Everclear.<br /><br />Where does one begin to unravel how stupid this show is? Yes, they go to interesting places. Yes, the UK is filled with spooky places to investigate, but it's amazing that EVERY site they travel to is chock full o' ghosts.<br /><br />Yvette Fielding is about as scientifically minded as a carnival barker at the freakshow. She flips out as soon as the light are off, and every bump or cobweb is a sign that someone is trying to contact her.<br /><br />Derek Accora is ridiculously cheesy, especially when he goes into trances that supposedly lead to him "channeling" an evil spirit. And his "spirit guide" Sam, Derek's imaginary friend whom he thanks profusely throughout the show always manages to give him half-correct clues that lead them to another room where Yvette will nearly pee her pants.<br /><br />Be sure to take a drink whenever the disclaimer at the bottom of the screen suggests that there's no proof to back up whatever Derek says. It happens often, so you'll probably be toasted after one full episode.
