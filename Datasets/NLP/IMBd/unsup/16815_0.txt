A noteworthy member of the post-nuclear apocalypse genre of film that adds admirably to the body of opinion of what the world would be like after an all out nuclear war. More sensible than the fantasy treatment of movies such as "Road Warrior" or "A Boy and His Dog", but not so dismal as "The Day After", this movie gives a bit more feel of what really might happen after a Nuclear confrontation, but has enough action and adventure to make for a good film. The movie is somewhat unpolished, but pleasingly gruesome (as a movie dealing with nuclear war must be). I gave it a 7 of 10.
