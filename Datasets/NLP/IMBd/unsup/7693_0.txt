<br /><br />This is a very hard-to-find 'old house film'....but SEE IT if you get a chance! The plot synopsis was given earlier, but i'd like to give my personal comments on it.<br /><br />At first, the "Andrews Sisters clones" get on your nerves, but you grow to like 'em after a bit! Anne Gwynn is lovely, as always....<br /><br />It's kind of a mish-mosh of musical, mystery, drama, but it WORKS!<br /><br />See it if u can! MOST enjoyable!
