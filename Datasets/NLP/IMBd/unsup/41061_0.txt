This sequel kept my attention for about the first hour before taking a sharp left turn into sheer nonsense territory. Unlike the original, "White Noise 2" has very little to do with "communicating" with the dead, instead coming off more as a "Final Destination" sequel/super hero/"Exorcist" type of combination that jumbled the entire thing into pure ineptitude. A man's family is brutally slain in an apparently random shooting in a diner. Three months after the incident, he attempts suicide and is revived just before fully ascending into the "white light". Following his near death experience, he has seemingly acquired an ability to see disfigured ghosts, hear ghosts through technology, and foresee people's untimely death through a luminescent glow. It's when the movie delves into some kind of Satanic "twist" that completely took me out of the movie. I dug a few of the jolt scenes and suspenseful "race to save a life" moments, yet the conclusion is very confusing as it attempts to come together and put the pieces in place... So my point is: the final "explanation" and multiple twists ruined the movie. Don't bother with this...
