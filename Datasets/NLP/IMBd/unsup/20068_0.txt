The film is just a documentary of the TV show. I have seen the TV show and it was awesome. I worried about myself because I can admit having seen this show. It's like watching some animals in a cage.<br /><br />But the animals are being tortured or they are forced to do their own torture.<br /><br />It's scary. I'm not sure what the guy or who ever got the idea for this show wanted to do. It's hard to see what the difference is between the "Est" TV Show and the film. It's the most insane show that I have ever seen. Nothing seems to make sense. Some of the clips I have seen online are much more crazy and extreme than on the film. The contestants are agonizing. One of them is lying down on the floor in its excrement. I don't know for how long the clip went on for only 3 minutes. <br /><br />At the end someone came in (in the dark with special glasses) and helped but the contestant must have been left for a long time in that state. Was it all real? Was it part of the TV show?
