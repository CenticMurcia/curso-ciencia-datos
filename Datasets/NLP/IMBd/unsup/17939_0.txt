This movie is so god-awful! There are literally only four scenes! One scene: the unseen murderer killing strippers with a plastic bag over the head. None of the victims even seems to attempt to tear a hole in the flimsy little plastic bag. They just die. Then it's on to scene two: unattractive women with huge fake knockers dancing topless to a seemingly endless array of pop tunes which were never popular or indeed heard outside of this movie, as far a I can tell. The third scene is the "suspense" scene at the club as the new stripper (ex-penthouse pet Kimberley Kelley) who, you see, isn't actually a stripper at all, but is actually undercover investigating the smothering death of her sister, another stripper (these events presumably took place in Midnight Tease 1, which I haven't seen) snoops around for clues. The fourth scene is the scene where the Macguffin character, and artist (played by Paul Douglas) who likes to go to the strip club to find his muses for his paintings (P.S. Unintentional laughs abound when his work is shown, and is of a very low quality.) Take these four scenes and repeat them over and over again until you dash in a dramatic conclusion. Very boring, bottom of the barrel sleaze from Jim Wynorski and his buddies. Absolutely nothing to recommend.
