Ben Oren is a literary Genius when it comes to this movie. I am surprised he is not famous yet. and i am serious. though ghost games is not the scariest movie it is one of the smartest indie movies i have seen and has a smart sense of humor. Though many people may not get the movie i believe the plot is funny and there are so many key quotes from the movie that i share with my friends. all in all i would love to see a Ben Oren movie on the big screen. I believe that he will succeed and though many people did not love this movie on the budget it was made i think it is wonderful. I can not wait to see what else this up and coming writer has to offer. If huge studios are putting out movies like Grandma's Boy and She's the Man i believe this educated young writer will do big things.
