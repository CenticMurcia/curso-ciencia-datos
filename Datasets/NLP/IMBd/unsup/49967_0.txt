Ah, another one of those thrillers where you're supposed to wonder about the killer's identity, suspecting everyone in turns. Well, I guessed the killer *in the video rental*, after I looked at the cover! And I was right, of course. Now that's a "quality" script! As for the rest - boy, where to start... The acting is either hammy (McGregor) or wooden (Arquette) and the worst thing is that this flick is so *dull* and *boring* that it makes eating tomato soup and potato chips The Great Adventure! This is a remake of the Danish original which I might choose to see one day (for free - if it's anything like this remake, it's not worth paying a penny). I doubt it can be any better, though, with the same director and writer. One star, and even that is being too generous!
