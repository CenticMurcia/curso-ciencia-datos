This short freebie movie is terrible. It is meant to induce seizures. Instead of releasing good movies available for instant streaming, Amazon.com is making preachy "original" films that just make me want to vomit. Movies shouldn't be a headache inducing experience. This one in particular is bad because it is an endless cycle of quick edits of a hellish experience. This movie is 100% devoid of entertainment value and is annoying as hell to boot.<br /><br />If you want the message of the movie it is "life is a hellish cycle of rushing from one appointment to the next so be sure to stop and talk to the crazy homeless people". Maybe Amazon should go back to the drawing board on offering free movies to visitors.
