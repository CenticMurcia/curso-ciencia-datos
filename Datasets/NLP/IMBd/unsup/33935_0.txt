Can a movie get worse? ever? I bought this movie, not hoping to find great directing or acting. Just nudes and erotica, yet, the BAD acting, BAD directing and lack of anything that shows someone put some effort into making this piece of.. film, was Very annoying. The only, ONLY, good thing about this film is Martine Stedil. Sorry, but Lina Romay just doesn't do it for me. Martine is a Beauty. And you get to see close ups of her 'private' parts! Other than that, the film is Awful. The lack of respect to the viewer shows in every scene. It was like watching a film made for the mentally retarded. Films for children would still be more clever. I'm saying this, and I didn't expect to watch something intellectual or artsy.. just beautiful nude girls being canned, raped, abused, etc. Yet I just couldn't swallow the amount of sh** in this 'film'. 2/10 for the presence of Martine Stedil.
