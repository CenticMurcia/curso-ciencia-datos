I loved this film, and can't believe the low score it has on this website.<br /><br />You don't need to be a Kath and Kim fan to enjoy this film, which has a few of the funniest scenes in it that I can remember from an Australian film since 'The Castle'. I saw it with a bunch of people recently, and we were all laughing hysterically.<br /><br />See it, and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The scene with Sean Micallef as a soldier is worth seeing the film for all on its own.
