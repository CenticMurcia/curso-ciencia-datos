Very controversial, "?" may meet with many objections from parents groups, activists and the MPAA for its graphic content. Ranging from pedophilia, rape, masturbation, deep depression, to the spiting of the mentally handicapped, amongst other subjects. Completely off the wall real! "?" deals with the material raw, because that's how it shows it. <br /><br />It's honest and it's brutal, and the Directors want the audience to understand the picture, but not without thinking about it or watching it numerous times.<br /><br />Absolutely the most disturbing film that has been released this year, "?" pulls all the punches, and it's material, while uncompromising, is brilliant. There's nothing more engrossing than watching West & Art suffer breakdowns, after being pushed to the brink, or witnessing the demise of a seemingly innocent blow-up doll, after winning over our hearts and minds.
