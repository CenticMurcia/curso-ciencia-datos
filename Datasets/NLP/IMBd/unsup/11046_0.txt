One of the worst movies I've ever seen. No idea what to write about it to fill in the (minimum) required ten lines... Don't ever watch it, don't try to understand it - there is no plot, no action, so sense... Compared to this, B movies deserve an award.<br /><br />Yes, there is a remote idea from Excalibur and some poor, unfortunate resemblance to Highlander, but... they should better use those ideas in an episode of South park or Family Guy, I bet we can have a lot of fun. Somehow I got hooked, I had to see it 'till the end... Bad, bad mistake, it was a waste of time and it ruined my evening. Next time I want to kill my time, I'll switch to Cartoon Network.<br /><br />Again - don't bother watching, there is no movie.
