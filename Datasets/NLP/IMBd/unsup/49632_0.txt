I loved the first Dragonheart.<br /><br />I threw a party last weekend, and saw this movie for sale in Wal-Marts "$5 and under movie" bin. I regret I ever took it out.<br /><br />The story goes that after Draco. "Last of the Dragons" died, he reveals a gift to Bowen before he dies, a dragon egg. If Draco was last of the Dragons, where the H*** did the egg come from? So the young Dragon, named Drake grows up in Brother Gilberts monastery basement/dungeon area thing. A young boy, Geoffery, goes down into the dungeon, where he befriends Drake.<br /><br />enter the generic bad guy who toys with he boy's dreams and convinces him to become a knight. Enter the two stereotypical Chinese old Kung-Fu master and apprentice who turns out to be a girl sent to kill the last evil dragon, who is in the form of a man.<br /><br />Guess what, the bad guy IS the Dragon! SHOCKER! He and Drake fight i the air, despite the above-average special effects for its time, it was rather boring. the evil Dragon, Griffin, breaths fire. Yhen, out o nowhere, Drake masters the ability to breath ice and freezes Griffin, who shatters into a million pieces when he drops 30 feet from the air. One of the ice shards hits Geoffery.<br /><br />Huess what, he gets half of Drakes heart, they become heroes, and everyone is happy.<br /><br />WAY TOO HAPPY! The first Dragonheart was an action-fantasy epic, this movie is just a dull kids version. 2/10<br /><br />Three people left he party during the movie because it was so horrible. Let your younger siblings see it, you just wont love it
