Back in my fast disappearing youth I was heavily involved with Left Wing politics, and one of my heroes was, of course, Che Guavara, but I never really knew the man behind the legend. The recent films about Che - this, and the excellent 'Motorcycle Diaries' - have helped me to understand the man better, and has lead to a great appreciation of him.<br /><br />This film starts with Che embarking on his quest, alongside Castro and others, to free Cuba from the American Sponsored dictator Batista. The events in Cuba are shown alongside the later events when Che travelled to New York to address the UN, and through this we see Che beginning to emerge both as a tough jungle/street fighter and political orator with intelligence and feeling, finally transforming himself from a doctor with political leanings to a fully fledged revolutionary.<br /><br />The New York scenes also illustrate the opposition to Che, both within the UN and out on the streets, which give the film an added depth politically and socially.<br /><br />Del Toro is outstanding as Che, and he is backed up by a superb supporting cast. The film is also helped by Soderbergh's wonderful visuals - the forests look amazing, and the streets gritty etc, and the careful use of music. Yes, some of the battle scenes do tend towards the "Hollywood", but generally are within keeping of the gritty realism of the rest of the film.<br /><br />This may not be everyone's cup of poison, but if you like your biopics done with depth and intelligence then this is the film for you. Personally I can not wait for mid March when I will have the chance to see part two!
