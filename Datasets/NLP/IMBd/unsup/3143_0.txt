I own the VHS copy of this movie and would like to see it released to DVD perhaps with some commentary and bonus features. I own all the Basil Rathbone movies on VHS (he is still the epitome of S.H. as far as I'm concerned) but I must admit that the first time I saw this view of the character I was a fan right away.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of a young Dr. Watson who meets S.H. for the first time at the boarding school where both are students was a great idea. The plot has the two discovering each other and working together to solve a series of murders that are occurring - great special effects - did not overwhelm the story as many current movies do. You may remember Earl Rhodes in a previous role of (the Chief) an obnoxious<br /><br />prepubescent psycho in THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA and he was cast perfectly in the role of Dudley - the antagonist to young Sherlock.<br /><br />A great film to watch with a big bowl of popcorn and a soda.
