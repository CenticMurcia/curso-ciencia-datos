A wild, mock-documentary, a la Ken Burn's "The Civil War". The emphasis here is on "wild" - a wild, scatter-shot, liberal-biased attempt to swipe at every tired, pathetic Southern stereotype. While well-produced and full of (uncomfortable) novelty, the simultaneously laughable, queasy, and historically and culturally na√Øve experiment to imagine a modern "history" of the Confederate States of America is a palpably unsubtle insult - not only to Southerners, to Black Americans, and to modern conservatives but, ultimately, to all Americans. As a Northern Liberal, even I have to wonder: to what type of Troglodytic audience is this film pitched?
