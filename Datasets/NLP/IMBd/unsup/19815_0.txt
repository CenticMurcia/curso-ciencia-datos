I am an avid fan of both Anthony Hopkins and Matthew Broderick. Why they chose to do this film is beyond me. While both turn out stellar performances they are wasted in a disjoint story which bounces between multiple subplots -- and it isn't clear which plot is the 'main' plot -- and dubious flashbacks. While sex is an integral component to some of the subplots, its depiction is gratuitous.<br /><br />The story wanders aimlessly and in the end comes crashing down in flames leaving this viewer burned out and wasted.
