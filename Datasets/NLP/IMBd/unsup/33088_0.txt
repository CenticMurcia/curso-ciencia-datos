I saw this film at the Cinequest Film Festival. It was terrible. They obviously learned a lot of things. They learned a lot of camera swivels and such but it didn't work. It was trying too hard. I felt disconnected from the film. I didn't care about the characters. It wasn't funny. I didn't feel the drama. No one really had a moment. I didn't feel for anyone. The filmmakers enthusiasm was there, but the choices didn't work for the story. These people are going to get better, they seem to have observed a lot of films. But I don't want to notice the camera so much. I want to be moved and so absorbed in the story that I don't think about how they are trying to manipulate my senses and feelings. The highlight of the whole screening was nothing. Because, as I said and will continue to keep saying, with this film, You Got Nothin'. Good luck filmmakers--hope to see a better movie next time -- but I doubt it'll happen.
