If there was one PERFECT anime, it would be none other than GitS:SAC, even words like 'Exceptional' or 'Brillaint' are understatement considering the kind of gem this show is. The Year is 2030, The story revolves around 'Section-9' Basically a Elite Squad where each member is a expert in one thing or another, Sectio-9 deals with special Cyber Crimes. Everything in GitS SAC is exceptional to say the least, the animation is crisp, fluid and has some amazing CG Effects while the Sound Effects as well as the voice acting is top notch. Put simply, GitS SAC makes most mainstream sci-fi adoptions look like a fluke (The Matrix included)If you're the kind who likes cheeky humor and silly big eyed characters then GitS SAC then you're barking at the wrong tree. however if you care for Plausibilty and Realism while watching and, want your Anime to be serious, then Your humble Quest has ended. GitS SAC is the candy for you! Kudos to Kenji Kamiyama for making, what is quite possibly the greatest anime ever.
