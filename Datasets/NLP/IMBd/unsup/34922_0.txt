This is not a great movie. It was never nominated for an Oscar. But that wasn't the intent. It is amusement, clear and simple.<br /><br />The interactions among the three main characters is typical of many dramas and sci-fi movies. The alien invaders are phony looking, to say the least. But this movie is part of a genre that endeared itself to Americans for nearly a decade. Lump it in with Earth vs. the Flying Saucers and Them. None of the movies of that genre were ever headed for Oscar fame. They were there for pure amusement. And this is what Robert Horton, Richard Jaekel, and Luciana Paluzzi provided.<br /><br />It's a fun movie, but professional critics would argue otherwise.
