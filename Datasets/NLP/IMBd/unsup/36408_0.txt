This is a B-movie, in all its glory, a ripoff of both Indiana Jones AND The Mummy. The dialogue? Horrible. The plot? Even more so. The special effects? Not to be believed. But that's what made it fun to watch. Just for the sake of a good laugh. It's obvious where the characterizations were pulled from (the studly archaeologist/treasure hunter, the studious librarian, etc) and the storyline was clich√© as they come. The opening lines between the hero and the villain were cheesy to the max. And of course, the history- well, it wasn't. It was whatever the film makers picked up from other action/adventure stories, or just thought would be cool to throw in. The only people who'd claim this was an actually good film would be eight-year-olds going through a "Indiana Jones" phase. So if you're in the mood for some light entertainment (or want to get your kids out of your hair for a few hours) rent this.
