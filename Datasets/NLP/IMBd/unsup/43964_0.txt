Actually, I finally broke down and watched this film the other night after passing it by for years on the rental shelf. I have to be honest and say the movie was pretty bad. Despite that, there was one good reason to see this movie. JIM CARREY. You really see what a sweet, soulful person he really must be. Rent this to see (in my opinion) another deeper side of the real Jim Carrey. But hold on to your remote. This movie will bore you to tears if you try to watch the whole thing (even though it's relatively short...it's THAT bad). I recommend fast forwarding through most of it, excluding his scenes. The people who made this movie really missed out on using his talent more adeptly in their film. You can see only brief glimpses into the depth of his talent. Oh, random comment...renaming the movie Rubberface? Stick to your vision people! I give this flick two stars. I give Jim Carrey in this film 6 stars.
