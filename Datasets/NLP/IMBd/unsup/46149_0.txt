This movie is BAD. There is no getting around the fact that this movie is grossly inaccurate, inconsistent and generally poorly made. The plot is contrived, overused and generic. A group of young hackers create some trouble until they find out about an evil plot. Then it becomes a bad action, romance hybrid... with outdated computers... that never existed.<br /><br />Indeed, the movie hackers breaks at least two dozen fundamental pieces of computer knowledge that anybody even moderately trained could catch. Most of these somehow involve over the top dramatic camera angles and cut-away. The script moves in a kind of jumpy staccato shuffle, with the occasional inconsistency or absurdity making you jump for a moment. For instance, while finding the infamous hosts of the show "hack the planet" (which manages to crack into the TV station every week at a predictable time and stay on air for half an hour with a live feed) They are held at gun-point by a robotic arm! Once the hosts (Annoying twins) find out that they are allies, they show their secret, it was a squirt gun! Oh you hackers, what a waste of two hours that was!
