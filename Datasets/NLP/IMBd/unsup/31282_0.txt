I have to disagree with the posters who didn't like the film because it "isn't believable". My question to them is... Who would believe that a pregnant woman could live in a Wal-Mart or that a movie ticket can bring an action star out of the silver screen. It's a delightful little movie that I would watch over and over and over again either by myself or with the kids. It says something about the perseverance of and dedication of siblings, I only hope that my own children feel like that about their siblings... I haven't read the book yet, but am going to now that I know there is one. I have to be honest here... I was a preteen when I first saw this movie and I can remember going into my mother's medicine cabinet and taking some of her Alka Seltzer just to try it with chocolate sauce... After growing and having kids of my own... I STILL have one every once in a while! Still trying to find this move on DVD or VHS so we can have a copy here at home.
