The beginning scenes of "The Entrance" had me optimistic that the film was heading in an unique and frightening direction. Talk about a teasing let down! The flick opens with a terrified man (Michael Eklund, an Ethan Hawk look alike) fleeing from a demon in a deserted parking garage. He escapes and the next thing we know he's yacking with the cops unraveling some ado about being kidnapped and taken to a dark room where he and others sharing his plight are forced to play games. The losers of these games are subjected to 8mm black and white memories of egregious sins they have committed. Then, one by one, each is violently vanquished from the company of the others. The cop conducting the interrogation (Sarah-Jane Redmond) doesn't buy into it. Once she leaves the room to grab him a drink of water he vanishes. She calls it a night and takes off in her car only to get accosted by the guy at knife point who then demands she drive him back to the parking garage claiming, "They took something from me and you are going to help me get it back!" Excited to check this one out? Don't be, 'cuz the film goes absolutely nowhere ending abruptly at 80 minutes in length and useless. Throughout the tale, some attempt at drawing a correlation between the above and the exorcism of a 17th century nun fails to explain itself and what we are left with is a "WTF-There's an hour and twenty minutes of my life I will never get back!" Seriously, the film had tremendous potential and some unnerving visuals. I suspect finances fell short and creativity was sacrificed for a deadline. Disappointing.
