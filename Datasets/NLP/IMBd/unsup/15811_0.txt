This flick honestly looks as if it was made on $1.98 budget! The acting is so far sub-par it makes Keanu Reeves seem like Robert DeNero...The lighting (which is amazingly annoying once you get 5 minutes into the film) looks as if it was done with a few Bic lighters...The "special effects" look as if they may have been done in a 4th grade art class...The ending will not only leave the viewer scratching his drunken (hopefully) head, but come up with at least 10 alternate endings that would have been soooo much better! Why would One not only own (as I do) or rent this flick? It's honestly so, so bad - it borders on being good! If you're a fan of very, very, very low budget 70's horror flicks or the Drive-In Theater, this baby is for you! If not, you will find yourself losing more brain cells by the minute then Cheech & Chong did during the entire decade of the 70's! Final note: This movie was co-written by George "Buck" Flower, whom unfortunately I just found out passed away in 2004...Rest in Peace George, and please, don't let this be the movie that you'll be remembered for...
