Urban crime drama doesn't get much better and tighter than this. This is absolutely one of the best, if not the best crime movie from the seventies I have seen. And I have not seen too many of them done after that, which can pass the test of time quite as strongly. After having seen this one now several times it still hits hard every time and probably keeps doing it. The tension and drama is such, it does not let go easily.<br /><br />It is also a crime movie with some social commentary. Some of the characters and situations are a little exaggerated of course, but that does not take anything away from the otherwise realistic mood and style. Presenting things from the view of the world of crime allows them to be seen culminated and be observed from the relationships of different people and groups starting to clash and finally boiling over to a state of war. Here it is 300.000 dollars of stolen mob money that gets everyone on their toes and against each other. It is a cynical view on who uses who, who gets the biggest part of the cake and survives at the end. The ways of the world squeezed into a metropolis underworld.<br /><br />The director has used a lot of close low angle shots, hand-held camera and a minimum of lighting, which creates a very realistic look and an almost claustrophobic feeling of things and the whole city closing in on people. The viewer is either closed in too in the middle of the happening or variably blocked out to stay further by spectators, traffic etc. and both ways are adding heavily to drama and tension. Strong role works, specially from Quinn and Kotto add even more. Excellent!
