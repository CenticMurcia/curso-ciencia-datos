I disagree with Bill. I thought this documentary was moving and did exactly what it set out to do, which was show the American public that inmates are not evil or mistakes or whatever else it is that we make them out to be. We watched this documentary in one of my classes for school, and by the end, you could see that these students were moved. This is an excellent documentary and it puts inmates in a light that is not usually shown in the media. While the subject matter is intense, I think it is a worthwhile documentary to watch. Unfortunately it is difficult to find or rent without buying it off the PBS website. I know that there are women out there who are in prison and are considered "a danger to society" but I also think that there are women who deserve another chance. These women helped show me this, they helped to open my eyes.
