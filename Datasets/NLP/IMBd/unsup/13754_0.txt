I saw this at Screamfest where it was playing as the opening night movie. Having not heard anything about it before, I was surprised by how cool it was. Totally unpredictable from start to finish. The crowd went crazy from laughing, to gasping, to yelling at the screen. I told some friends about it who are way into Ed Furlong. He was awesome. Scary fun. A total trip. Let's face it, reality television is totally played out. I recommend it for anyone who loves to hate reality TV! I'm a girl, but have to admit that Jaime Pressly looked hot ;) I'm trying to find out who did the music at the end, because it sounded like someone famous. No spoilers, but the ending made me wonder if they're gonna do part two.
