Excellent portrayal of two couples as best friends - you can notice the comfortable interaction between the couples in the present vs their interaction and awkwardness when they were getting to know each other. I found the lessons in the movie to be quite thought provoking. If you are married with kids, this movie is for you - it is not only for people who have been around a divorce.
