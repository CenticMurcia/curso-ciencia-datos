I use to think 'Godzilla's Revenge' was the worst of the worst, I've just been proven wrong. This movie is tripped out. There are four or five cartoon animations that do nothing to continue the story. They just sum up what's already happened in the previous encounters, and seem to be drawn School House Rock style. The fight scenes between Godzilla and Hedora are bizarre to say the least. Time goes by where you just see Godzilla and Hedora standing around doing nothing but funky hand movements. This movie drags on and on and on.<br /><br />But it's interesting because the entire feel of this movie is very different. It's much darker and more sinister. You also see dead bodies lying around. Something not often seen in most other Godzilla movies. Symbolism is tossed around a bit, but it seems as if this director was drunk while doing some of these scenes. Another amazing feature is the typical little kid is really not all that annoying. That's a marvel to behold in and of itself.<br /><br />So, although this is most likely the worst Godzilla, it's also the most creative. There's not much Godzilla action untill the very end, and features a 007 intro along with many other 60's spoofs. I suggest seeing this movie at least once or twice. You'll be pleasantly surprise and dumb founded.
