Donkey Punch has a very interesting (although fu*ked up) premise in which seven people have a party on a yacht out in the Mediterranean sea, only to have one of them try the infamous "donkey punch" during sex with one of the women...and accidentally kills her.<br /><br />Now, what they could have done with the paranoia between the surviving characters would have been interesting, but they degraded the plot even more from it's fu*ked up premise into a stupid slasher film. Not only that, but it's also hard to tell what's happening on screen for most of the time. Stupid and unbelievable situations continue to unravel themselves.<br /><br />But, I have to be honest. I actually liked the film up until the actual donkey punch. After that happened the film just got lazy. But, hey, it had some good music though.
