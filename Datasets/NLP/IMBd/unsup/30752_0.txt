Watching "The Last Seduction' you will see that Bridget Gregory is one tough woman. Not one to cross! In "The Last Seduction 2" Joan Severance picks up where Linda Fiorantino left off. "The Last Seduction 2" is set in Europe and is not up to the tech standards of the original. You can tell which movie had the most money spent on production. But with the faults "The Last Seduction 2" pulls it off. Joan Severance is a delight in the evil persona of Bridget Gregory.<br /><br />Beth Goddard who plays Murphy is almost as tough as Bridget and out to get her. Beth does a great job and I hope to see more of her in the future. Overall "The Last Seduction 2" is not the same as the original but it is worth the watch. If there is a "The Last Seduction 3" keep Joan Severance as Bridget Gregory, Beth Goddard as Murphy and spend more money on the production. It will be a winner.
