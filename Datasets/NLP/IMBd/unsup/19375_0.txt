One of his least known, but definitely one of his best, Charlie Chaplin's The Circus is a moving and very funny film about the famous Tramp who joins a circus and brings love and joy to all around him. Of course, it is much more than that as we witness some incredible stunts by the versatile Chaplin, as well as some great camera work that was undoubtedly way ahead of its time.<br /><br />Perhaps simply because it is in black and white, or it is without dialog it is a sad truth that great auteurs such as Chaplin and Buster Keaton have been mostly forgotten by today's moviegoers. For this reason, I find it very important to continue to support their work and look for further and deeper truths. What can be gleaned from this is astonishing. There is so much sadness, joy, anger, and fear lurking at the surface it takes multiple views to catch it all. What Chaplin does with this simple story, his incredible array of stunts and comedic situations, and that memorable little Tramp make for one of the greatest of all silent films; one worthy enough to be mentioned with City Lights, The Gold Rush and the other Chaplin classics. Even more than that, it is a memorable event to watch this unfold; one to always think of and cherish for always.
