GODAWFUL! <br /><br />Not sure how they though any part of this would be scary e.g. the God of Death intro.<br /><br />The Anime was alright and I heard that this was even better. <br /><br />I have since removed such so called creditable witnesses to movies from my friends list.<br /><br />Don't ever ever ever ever see this movie, unless being disappointed is what you're looking for.<br /><br />I don't get how so many people thought this was a masterpiece. I mean everything was bad about it special effects, acting, dubbing, and there were many goofs that are unthinkable.
