This highly entertaining movie is about an assortment of odd ball characters who hang around an ordinary bar. There is no need for scripting the characters. They come as they are. There is a woman who hides a sordid past by claiming to have been a burlesque dancer for royalty. There is a mysterious professor who hangs around the bar all day reading the paper. There is the dancer/comedian. There is a guy who plays a marble/pinball game all day in hopes of reaching the stage where the machine lights up and spits out flags and sparklers. There is a not too bright, but lovable man who hopes to have enough money to marry the burlesque dancer.<br /><br />All in all this is very entertaining movie. The two most gripping characters are a former cowboy who spins tall tales. At one point, he claims to be 59, but then tells about his experiences across the U.S. that happened over 70 years ago. There is also one of the scariest, meanest mobsters ever portrayed. He looks so purely mean and plain that it is scary. I recommend this movie. It has all the appearances of being the original "Cheers".
