I guess this movie was alright. I have always been a fan of the Scream series and I enjoyed this one. The writers put way too much humor into the movie though. They didn't keep a dark enough tone like they did in the first and second. Despite this it was still a good movie, entertaining, scary, creative, etc. It is a great way to end the wonderful horror series.
