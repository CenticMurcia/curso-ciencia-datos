There's not much I can say about this work of art, but I admire the depth and complexity of the film. There's so much information and logic throughout, I almost felt as though I had gained knowledge by watching it.<br /><br />I'll put it simply.<br /><br />It's about a character, known simply as A Square, who lives in a 2 Dimensional world known only as Flatland. Why? Well, because it's flat of course. All the people are squares, circles, hexagons, etc... but all of them are equally as flat as the other. They have no idea of 3 Dimensional space. That is, until A Sphere appears from Spaceland and takes A Square on a whirlwind journey of discovery and intrigue where he learns all about the 3rd dimension and his own purpose in life.<br /><br />It's all rather confusing and irregular in it's general presentation, but it's also one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time. I'm left with a distinct feeling of wonder and deep thought that I've not experienced in years. It feels amazing. So overall, it's an excellent film that I highly recommend.
