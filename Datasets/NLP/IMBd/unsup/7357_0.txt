This movie, starring Michelle Burke of "Little Men" TV series, is about a journalist with connections to the mob who falls for a stripper with a dark past. His best friend then drags him to L.A. with the intent of becoming actors. <br /><br />The movie sounds like an interesting story, but the plot just drags on and on and on with no ending it sight. There is lack of emotion, suspense and intrigue-no surprises and no twists. What is strange about this movie is that we have big stars like Cybill Shepherd, Richard Dreyfuss and Jimmy Smits appear as extras in the movie, next to lesser known actors who are the leads. Plus, the movie poster depicts Dreyfuss's picture as the largest, yet, he only has about 4 min of screen time. <br /><br />I was bored one night and decided to watch this film, as I enjoy watching some TV works by Michelle Burke and Roma Downey of "Touched by an Angel" TV series; they both appear in this movie. But, this movie sure hits rock bottom. Just plain mediocre and boring. <br /><br />So, if you want to watch this movie, drink lots of coffee. This movie nearly put me to sleep.<br /><br />Grade F
