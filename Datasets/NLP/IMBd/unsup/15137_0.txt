Keep in mind that the title here is "Young and Dangerous Part 6." It would be an insult to the audience if each of these flicks had to recap the previous plot points for those who can't make it down to the local video store. Personally if I see Kickboxer III on the shelf I look again till I can find Kickboxer. It's the best of the series since part I, and chicken again steals the show from Ekin Cheng as his character allows humility and depth. Real treat to see Sonny Chiba of the over-the-top streetfighter series hold it down. It was nice to see Gigi Lai overshadow Shu Qi even as a dobbleganger. This genre of hong-kong action flicks often asks the western audience to suspend their standards of Hollywood style visuals and comprehendable plots. But "Born to be King" is visually appealing throughout and is logistically comprehensive. We need not know the backstory of each of our leads to grasp their current position on the triad totem pole and their moral dilemmas in a grasp for more power and responsibility.
