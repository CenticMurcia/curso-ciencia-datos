For a Z-Grade movie, this is all right. The acting is better than in a good number of films of this type, and it certainly manages to create mild suspense, (especially in the opening scene). It was a good idea to keep it short; many Z movies try to draw out the story WAY too much, and it turns out terribly.<br /><br />That being said, this is not a good movie and it deserves nothing more than one or two stars. The acting is awful; the dialog is amateurish; the camera work is atrocious; etc. (It is not good enough to fall into the "so bad it's good" category, if that is any indication).<br /><br />Thus, I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie unless Z movies are your thing.
