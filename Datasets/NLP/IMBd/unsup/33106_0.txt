This was just flat out embarrassing. Mediocre beginning, silly middle, stupid ending. <br /><br />May I have my money back, please? <br /><br />I normally enjoy Glenn Robbins but I found him to be totally superficial in this film. And I expect much better from Mick Molloy. <br /><br />You could see what few jokes there were coming from miles away.<br /><br />I'm in the age demographic which made up the concert audiences screaming for Boytown and, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why those women were there. The song lyrics were juvenile and the tunes all sounded exactly the same. <br /><br />I would have walked out of the arena; I should have walked out of the movie theatre.<br /><br />If I were part of a boy band, I would sue everyone involved with the making of this movie.
