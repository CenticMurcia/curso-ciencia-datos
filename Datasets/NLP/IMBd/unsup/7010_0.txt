Well if i had money for fun i would produce and direct a remake of this film. I have such great ideas, for both this film and at the earth's core. Somebody remake these films or give me the money to do it. I loved these films with the superbly cool Doug Mcclure. I remember as a 10 year old (1987) writing a letter to Doug McClure asking what new monster films he would be starring in but sadly he never did and you also had to appreciate Kevin Connor was the guy behind them as Doug was the Main Actor. Yes my childhood was full of anything with Dinosaur type monsters in, The land that time forget, at the earth's core, the people that time forgot, Warlords or atlantis were my favourites. I also liked Harryhausens stop motion movies too and both have more character than cgi has today. I would however use CGI in the remakes if i could make them, but they would have to be mint and the creature would have to have character too.
