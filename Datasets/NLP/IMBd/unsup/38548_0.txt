This horror flick not only is violent, but horridly lame...and has nothing to do with the original PUMPKINHEAD(1989). A group of predictably stupid teenagers resurrect a fabled demon and the creature goes on a bloodthirsty rampage. The messy killing is not enough; the avenging monster leaves a calling card in the form of painted wings at each murder scene. Sheriff Braddock(Andrew Robinson)shares his childhood memories that relate to the origins of the Pumpkinhead legend. Viewing the promotion trailer may just be better than enduring this nerve wrecker. The cast is full of familiar faces: Ami Dolenz, Soleil Moon Frye, Steve Kanaly and Caren Kaye. And yes, Mayor Bubba is THAT Roger Clinton.
