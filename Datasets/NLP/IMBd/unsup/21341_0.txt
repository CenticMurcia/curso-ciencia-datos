The concept for this is total greatness, and pretty much original (it's based on a novel that I'll be looking for in used book stores). Forty years ago a town in Spain was abandoned so that a dam could be built to create a lake. Evil things are happening under the water as the 40th anniversary of the dam's construction approaches. There is evidence that the dam itself is unsafe, but the mayor insists the festivities must go on (I'll be generous and call this a tribute to JAWS and not copying).<br /><br />Good idea. Nice photography on locations in Spain.<br /><br />Limp direction. Uninspired writing. And, worst of all, terrible actors. For some reason it was decided that actors whose native language was Spanish could deliver dialog in English. Oh, no, they couldn't.<br /><br />The story goes from one predictable crisis to another. An warlock returns to the town to take control, only to be sort of thwarted by the granddaughter of the town's former mayor.<br /><br />Meanwhile, down in the town, the celebration is turning into an orgy.<br /><br />The warlock is vanquished. The granddaughter is saved and it looks like things will be all right. Then a little boy the granddaughter was babysitting gets a crazy look and tells her he hates her as strange lights shine on his face, thus setting up a sequel...<br /><br />...if anyone should ever want to make a sequel to this. If, however, Michael Bay should ever decide to spend several million bucks remaking this through Platinum Dune's I'll be there for the 7 PM show opening weekend. It's a good story. But telling it takes talent on both sides of the camera, something very much lacking here.
