At the beginning of this movie someone asks Ladd if he has any friends, he answers "my guns" and if he has any kinfolk to which he replies "my horse". He gets involved in a plot, impersonating the kidnapped son of a rancher who was missing since he was five. However, he falls in love with Mona Freeman who was supposed to be his sister. This was an unusual role for Ladd to play, and it adds a lot to the film, because you don't quite know what to expect from him. There is here everything you can ask from a good western: an interesting story, colorful, and a lot of action. It was the first western directed by Rudolph Matte. I saw Branded when it was released in the fifties ,with crowded matin√©es. I enjoyed it and still enjoyed it when I saw it recently.
