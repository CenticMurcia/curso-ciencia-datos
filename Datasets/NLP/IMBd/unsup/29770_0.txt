A mother (Huppert) and son (Garrel) are living a hedonistic life on some exotic island. They both fool around with the same women. Sounds like a situation with interesting, if twisted, possibilities. But the director has some other agenda - actually several agendas as he is all over the place, unsure what kind of movie he is making. One moment characters are engaging in sexual activities, the next they are spewing pretentious dialog, and then they do something totally unexpected that is seemingly from another movie. The film has no rhyme or rhythm. Some of the scenes are absolutely gross. Although the entire film is incomprehensible, the ending makes no sense whatsoever. Another annoying thing is the director's obsession with graphic male nudity. And what's with Garrel? First he plays a guy who carries on with his sister in "Dreamers," then with his mother in this. A family man.
