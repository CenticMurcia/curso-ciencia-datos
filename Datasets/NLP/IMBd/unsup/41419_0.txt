Normally I don't like to bash indie cinema (It's more fun to trash movies that are poorly crafted but cost $$$ to make) but I have to make an exception. I was fooled by the high IMDb rating and reviews on this turkey, which must have<br /><br />been posted by friends of the creator. Let me say upfront that I'm far from<br /><br />religious, and appreciate good satire in the vein of Election. This was too dumb to be called satire. <br /><br />A Jesus with a whiny Brookyln accent shows up nude in NYC (a'la "The Terminator") and crafts a spandex powder blue "superhero costume" to relate to today's youth. Lots of scatology and sex jokes as Jesus turns the<br /><br />commandments to pro casual sex to win converts. The video and especially<br /><br />audio are sub-porno quality. "Jesus" fights Richard Nixon (guy in rubber Nixon mask) Jim Morrison and Dracula. An interesting concept badly executed. Look<br /><br />elsewhere for religious humor not so puerile, I suggest "The Life of Brian".
