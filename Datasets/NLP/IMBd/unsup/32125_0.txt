This piece of cinema is breathtakingly beautiful. But not only skin-deep. Underneath the gorgeous visuals, music and overflowing humor in this film, I found its secret. Like the moon's reflection on the water. The breezes may shake and distort it. But it's always there, waiting to shine starkly when the waters are still at last. It is the reflected reality of my own struggle with understanding and knowing my own sexuality and identity as a woman in this world of men. It is shining with a heartbreaking sincerity and honesty I've never encountered before. Amid the struggle through much pleasure and so much more pain, its compassion tells me I'm not alone. An inspiring expression of Woman.
