I had to watch this movie in a medieval literature class I am taking in college, and to be quite frank, it was one of the worst films I have seen in the course of my life. The plot mixes both the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and The Countess of The Fountain(a.k.a. Owein) but seems to leave out the whole meaning and message of each work of literature. To someone watching this movie, who has not read these works before may not be as...repulsed...by it as one who has.However, even someone with no knowledge of the texts will still not enjoy this movie.Really the only good thing about it is Sean Connery. I don't like giving bad reviews, but I just can't recommend this movie to anyone.
