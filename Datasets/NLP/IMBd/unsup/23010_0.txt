Katrina was devastation, pure and simple. The break down in the fabric of New Orleans society was not something that was portrayed through the media. As usual, we see what we are supposed to see...no more, no less. Tom's portrayal of the plight of animals after Katrina was bare-boned and showed us the painful reality of how things really were. We saw only a small piece of the aftermath, I can only imagine what it would be like to see the whole picture. Unless a person has experienced this kind of trauma, they cannot know what toll it takes on the mind and how it changes our perception of things and in that, changes the decisions we make. Tom did a wonderful job producing this film. It was moving and elicited many emotional responses in a very short period of time. People need to see this.
