After watching Charmed's 1st season I was interested. However after the third/fourth season, It just went downhill and it became apparent that the writers started to grasp for storyline ideas. They even ripped off a few ideas from other shows (that shall go unnamed), shamelessly. Charmed just ended up plain bad entertainment by the end of the show. It should have ended when it needed to, when it should have, which was Season 4. Then many viewers wouldn't have to have been disappointed and see this show go down in flames. I close by saying that Charmed set out as a great show. It had a strong storyline, good characters, however after 4 years the writers ruined the show with cheap ideas and ripped off story lines. Shame on them.
