I am a Japanese. In this movie I see many false misunderstandings and errors on Japanese culture. For example, they try to overlap Samurais and Native Americans, which is very difficult for Japanese to comprehend. In one scene, Samurais were fighting in a jungle. We do not have a jungle in Japan. They try to depict that swords are the most important thing for samurais, which is not true at all. Bushido is not that shallow.<br /><br />The only notable thing I observed in this movie is that the Hollywood finally learned to be capable of treating foreign cultures positively. I know it is very difficult to make a movie about foreign cultures free from misunderstandings and prejudice.<br /><br />If you want to touch the real Bushido, which Japanese natives embrace, I recommend that you read "Bushido" written by Nitobe Inazo, or watch "Chushingura".
