this movie is without a doubt the worst thing god could ever have let happen. he should have struck the creator of this horrible, terrible sequence of b u l l s h * t with lightning or something. honestly, god. this piece of utter s h * t cannot be called a movie. when i rented it, i thought it was some kind of joke. words simply cannot express my outright **disgust** with all things associated with this film. the actors were pathetic and s h i t t y. i just... i don't even know. does it even have a plot? or a point? the music is pretty f u c k i n g torturous. the blood looked like watered-down grape jelly. the chick's nipples were violet. what is the point of this god-awful, damned to hell piece of s h i t. i hate everything. this movie ruined my life. i only voted it a "1" because there was no **f u c k i n g zero** option. it was not worth the five dollar budget.
