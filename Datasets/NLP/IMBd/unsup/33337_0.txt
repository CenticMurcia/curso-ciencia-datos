Skimming through pages of glowing reviews for this movie made me wonder if Netflix switched disks on me. The first half hour was promising, but it rapidly collapsed into a hopeless mess. The story lurches across a field of gaping holes in the plot, and requires a chain of unbelievable circumstances, then simply disappears into complete irrationality. The characters are all shamelessly predictable PC stereotypes. The key plot elements require either suspension of reality or severe naivet√©. The film needs to be viewed surrealistically to make any sense at all. But its a not surreal; its just contrived...badly. RoadRunner cartoons manipulate their environment less outrageously. If you want the audience to connect the dots, fine...but for Pete's sake, provide some dots.<br /><br />If you want to revel in a predictable PC piece about Mexican illegals and Texas rednecks, and don't need a cohesive story, this one's for you. If you want to see a good film with TLJ hauling a corpse cross-country, rent the last couple episodes of "Lonesome Dove".<br /><br />I understand that this was TLJ's first feature directing job. Tommy...keep the day job.
