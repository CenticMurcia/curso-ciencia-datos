Saw a sneak preview of Starsky and Hutch Saturday night. With the talent involved - this should've been a whole lot funnier. Even the parts that are obviously meant to be the memorable comic moments mostly fall flat. How can you have a movie with Vince Vaughn as the main villain and it not be very funny?<br /><br />This makes Zoolander look like a comic classic, which it certainly is not. An opportunity wasted. 4/10
