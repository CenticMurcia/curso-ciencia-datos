they make this film seem as in its just an art-house good college try for martin scorsese, who'd become one of the best directors (who has never yet gotten an oscar) of our time - but i think this film is fantastic on its own. i really can't explain it much except that watching this movie is like reading kerouac, you'll either love it (get it) or hate it (not understand it)...
