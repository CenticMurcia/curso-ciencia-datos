The film has a low-budget but the action isn't that bad. Especially the opening scene. A boy's family is killed by bad guys and he grows up to be a cop. He has blocked out the memory all of his life, but when a series of events triggers him to remember his dark past, he must get vengeance for his family. Decent acting and okay action. The budget effects the quality of the film but if you can get past that its an okay action-thriller. I bought this film on DVD for like 5 bucks and i had high expectations, but i actually enjoyed it. If you like Pare then it's worth a glance. If you don't like PAre or know he is, don't bother with it.
