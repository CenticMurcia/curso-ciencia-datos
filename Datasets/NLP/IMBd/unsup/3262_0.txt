This is the best and most original piece of pop-culture from Norway ever. I love this movie. It is unique. It is a doll-movie. The motor-race in the movie is really good and well filmed. The dolls are well-made and filmed very well - with stop-motion. All the inventions and mechanics in the film are very good designed.<br /><br />It is a work of genius - I love it. <br /><br />The whole start is good. The music in the start starts it all. <br /><br />If you are from Scandinavia: watch it. <br /><br />If you are from the rest of the world: also watch it.<br /><br />I love this Norwegian film WATCH IT<br /><br />10/10 - Nuff said.
