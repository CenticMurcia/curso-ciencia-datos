Most of the reviewers here seem to have overlooked a portion of the movie audience who love this film and keep it alive for one reason only, and that is to see muscle-boy Reb Brown leap, jump, swing and climb his way into our hearts wearing nothing more than a thong under his flimsy, breeze-catching loincloth.<br /><br />It's his gorgeous buns that are the real stars here, lifting the action twice as high with their splendid rebounds---and no special effects or stunt-doubles were used in those sequences, the bounce you see is authentically Reb! He must have realized he was "showing" during the filming, but the fact that he doesn't seem to care only stirs our appreation.<br /><br />It's sad Reb's real-life future did not include a Yor-2, or a Son of Yor, not even The Buns of Yor, and Reb (Mr. Brown) never again received an opportunity to demonstrate those well rounded talents so fully, consequently losing his reputation as the only actor in Hollywood who could up-stage himself by turning his back to the audience.<br /><br />I hope this revelation sheds some light on why this clunker keeps selling and Columbia Pictures is spending time and money to transfer it to DVD. Can you spell p-r-o-f-i-t-s ?<br /><br />UPDATE: Yes, there exists one other film showcasing Mr. Browns greatest talents; "Sssssss" (1973) Starring, Strother Martin. Reb plays big dumb jock, Steve Randall, who vies for the attention of the films leading lady. A small part for sure and he gets bumped off before the middle of the film, but you know what they say; "There are no small parts"! And, Reb proves it, by cracky, making the most of his 15 min. walking into a shower as God made him.
