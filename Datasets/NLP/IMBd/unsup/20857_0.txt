What a kerfuffle!<br /><br />Love 'em! My absolute fave! I simply love this show. Walliams and Lucas are very talented comedians, their show is bold, innovative and fun. A real feel-good-series. British comedy rocks! "Little Britain" deserves it's place in the Hall Of Fame with the likes of "French & Saunders", "Absolutely Fabulous" and "The League Of Gentlemen". Champagne!<br /><br />Series 1,2 and 3 offer a plethora of delicious, lovable and crazy characters and sketches. Some controversial yeees, but that's the point of it. You just can't beat those catch-phrases, they will burn in your mind forever. No but, yeah but. Some characters and sketches tend to become a bit repetitive by the the time, but still, this is top quality entertainment! Don't give me evils!<br /><br />I love Matt and David for givin me such a good time watching the series. Hopefully the boys continue their work and we'll see series 4..? See "Little Britain Live (2006)" available now on DVD!!! Eh Eh Eh!<br /><br />Dust, anyone? No?
