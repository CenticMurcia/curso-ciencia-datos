In Lille, Claire Gauthier (Isabelle Carré) is an ordinary married woman with a young daughter that works in an insurance company analyzing losses of insured properties. When the single veterinary Laurent Kessler (Benoît Poelvoorde) claims damage in his basement caused by a flooding due to water leakage, Claire resolves the situation favorably for him. The weird Laurent visits Claire in her office successively, inviting her for drinks and lunch, and they get close to each other. Meanwhile, a serial killer is terrorizing Lille, killing women with a scalpel. Claire feels a great attraction for Laurent, who has an unusual behavior in her apartment. When Claire sees a scalpel in the pocket of Laurent's jacket, she fears him, but still loves him.<br /><br />"Entre Ses Mains" is a weird romance between a common but charming woman that seems to have a perfect marriage and a strange and lonely veterinary. Isabelle Carré and Benoît Poelvoorde have magnificent performances, slowly developing the relationship between Claire and Laurent, with some slight touches of eroticism and tension, but never falling in the easy way of the sadomasochism, as I expected that would happen based on the mixed feelings of fear and love of Claire. There is no explanation for the behavior of Claire, feeling attraction for a man with antagonistic attitudes but only things of love. However, the ambiguous conclusion is a little disappointing. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Em Suas Mãos" ("In Your Hands")
