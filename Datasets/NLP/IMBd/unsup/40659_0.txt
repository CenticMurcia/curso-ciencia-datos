Well, I suppose we deserve this sort of thing, given all the male wish-fulfilment fantasy films going around - plot: unlikely guy scores (i.e. sex) with fahbulous fox, via a series of unlikely events. It's only fair to have a few similarly implausible numbers where women (albeit fahbulously foxy ones) score (i.e. marriage) with dreamy, strong-but-sensitive, protective guys with whom they can Live Happily Ever After. And even the dangerous bad man is Goran Visnjic, whose only flaw is that he wants desperately to marry Kidman's character - with menaces if necessary. Fair enough. The male equivalents focus on equally infeasible breasts, after all.<br /><br />There are aspects that do make one think, though. I really don't believe this witch thing, for example, is healthy. A number of shows are currently pushing this particular fantasy. Perhaps it's no more dangerous than the male one in which Our Man routinely dodges surface-to-air missiles, but it seems that some gullible people really believe this stuff, and think they actually have magical abilities. Witch Power is the new Women's Intuition.<br /><br />(I note with alarm another review here which speaks darkly about Belladonna's supposed 'dark' powers: lady, Belladonna is just atropine, a stimulant. It's just a chemical, like adrenalin, and nothing magical. Like most 'medicinal' plants, Deadly Nightshade is just trying to discourage animals from eating it, by dosing them with a substance that, inter alia, wrecks appetite.) I digress. In sum, this is not a very good film, but it's just wish fulfilment for those of a female persuasion and a certain age. Male viewers will probably have to derive what enjoyment they can from observing some very pretty and/or very talented actors, though in a far from ideal vehicle.
