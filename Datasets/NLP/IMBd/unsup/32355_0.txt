John Cena's movie debut and last i hope, Cena's acting is actually fine to be honest so what makes this movie terrible? The Score is absolutely dreadful and i'd say this is what kills the movie. Yup the background music in this film is what completely ruins this movie it is cheesy and the whole film in general feels like " Made for TV ". If anything the WWE should just leave the acting to The Rock and Steve Austin who have proved they can act. You might notice some T2 references including the ending fight scene which just seemed to look like a copy of T2'S fight scene. watch out for tons of movie errors including this:<br /><br />Continuity: At the gas station, after the cop's car gets shot, it shows the car having a flat tire. Triton proceeds to get in the car and take off, driving with all four tires fully filled.<br /><br />Its so bad its enjoyable to watch but it is a pile of crap
