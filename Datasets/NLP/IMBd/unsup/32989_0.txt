i was so disappointed when i watched this movie. having read the entire series of the flowers of the attic, i expected some kind of following the novel to get a decent idea about what v.c. andrews wanted us to receive while reading. the movie was a total stinkbomb and had nothing at all to do with anything. you were better off just reading the series and interpret that from your own imagination.. the actors that were supposed to portray cathy and chris appeared to be in their late 20's at didnt give the effect of being young, as they were supposed to be teenagers. grandmother filled some of what i thought that she would be, but not to the highest extent. i give a warning to all that read this and have an interest in watching this horrible movie.... DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE! (F-)
