I got this movie because of the box art. It looked interesting, like a nice little romantic comedy. The tag line even looks like a comedy. But what really looked cool was Harvey Keitel on the cover.<br /><br />So I paid for the video, went home, and was all set for a good movie. The movie then played. The movie finished. I don't think I'll ever pick a movie by the bow cover again.<br /><br />The movie has perhaps the most uninteresting and unlikeable characters ever. Natural Born Killer's Mickey and Mallory were at least interesting.<br /><br />The plot itself mainly revolves around two or three, maybe even four main plot points. The rest of it is just filler leading up to the quasi interesting.<br /><br />Keitel's and Winslet's performances aren't bad. They worked with what they got. What they got was Holy Smoke. <br /><br />I don't like summarizing, and I don't think I'm allowed to , so I only give my opinions. And in my opinion, don't waste your time on this.
