i really enjoyed this film - the character are all great and the premise is good. the shooting style suited the subject matter very well. rud was great! many belly laughs. the dogma 95 manifesto has produced several films (not all approved) and while i don't entirely "get" the reason for a manifesto i applaud the 3 legit films i have seen. this one is not as dark as celebration or as distressing as the idiots, but they all still seem to run in a similar vein. possibly something to do with the sense of irony and humour. try to catch this one.
