I really do enjoy this remake. It doesn't require too much thinking, you can pretty much be a zombie and enjoy the flick (knuck knuck).... Considering all the other zombie flicks that are out there.. this one is pretty decent<br /><br />The acting is a little campy... the special effects are sort of lame by todays standards.. it never explains why the zombies are there... they just are.. All and all, these components contribute to me enjoying this film.<br /><br />I really do admire George A. Romero and Tom Savini for all their work they have put into Zombie movies... I, myself, am I huge Resident Evil fan but this is classic.<br /><br />8/10 for zombie genre.
