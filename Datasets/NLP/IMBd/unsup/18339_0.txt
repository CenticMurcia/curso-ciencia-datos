John Hodiak stars in this piece of Film-Noir. George Taylor(Hodiak)is a bitter WWII veteran Marine with amnesia. He returns to Los Angeles with hopes of rediscovering his identity. He has only two clues linked to his past: a vicious letter of woe from a woman that hates him and another mysterious note from a "Larry Cravat". George in search of Cravat becomes involved with a winsome lounge singer(Nancy Guild)and her boss(Richard Conte). Police investigator Kendall(Lloyd Nolan)informs the three that Cravat is wanted for murder and the robbery of two million dollars. But what is Taylor's connection? For all he knows, since thugs are chasing him...hell, he himself may be the mysterious Cravat.<br /><br />Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz co-writes the screenplay with Howard Dinsdale. Hodiak is a passive leading man, while the attractive Guild almost steals the movie from him. Nolan plays the copper with a dry humor. Also in the cast: Sheldon Leonard, Fritz Kortner and Lou Nova.
