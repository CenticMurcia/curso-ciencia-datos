This well written script was enhanced by the performances of Grant, Loy, Temple and Collins.<br /><br />Some may say the storyline is farfetched - but most movies are guilty of this crime. The movie is original in idea, but had the same formula and end results for the productions made back then (and a few right now).<br /><br />Highly Recommend this movie.
