everything that happens to this family, they deserve. the whole fact that they learnt a lesson is supposed to be a resolution at the end of the film. you have a man who is too wimpy to tell his boss he won't write a report when he's supposed to be going on holiday. employment laws are on his side, he is allowed holiday. his boss can't threaten his job the way he does, so that conflict would never arise.<br /><br />he hires an RV and is given no instruction as to it's various functions and has not been asked if he has ever driven anything like it? that I find unlikely.<br /><br />their trip to his business meeting is of course plagued with problems, all of which they fully deserve.<br /><br />Even the way they treat the other campers who try to be friendly with them is excessive.<br /><br />robin williams is supposed to be the main comedy name carrying this film but none of the situations he is put in are funny.<br /><br />The seatbelt gag is stupid. there are tribes in the amazon who have never seen cars that would have worked out a seatbelt faster. the fact they insult us by trying the same gag twice?<br /><br />he deserves to lose his laptop and is an idiot. he clearly should have said no to his boss when he asked him to do this report and just gone to hawaii and saved us the trouble of this terrible and contrived movie.<br /><br />best avoided.
