"Der Eisbar" is by far the greatest surprise in german postwar film production. Directed by the emerging Mr. Till Schweiger, who usually plays the protagonist in many european movies (like the upcoming Star Trek, Star Wars bashing satire from Bulli Herbig after Manitou´s Shoe) Imagine Brad Pitt doing a great road track movie... This work feels like "PULP FICTION" on steroids- Cramped with german TV and movie stars this movie blows a heavy punch. It has everything from satire, jokes below the belt -absolutely political incorrect, fast cut scenes, a furious and hilarious plot (the killing of the "Minister of Health" -the mafia mob boss). Anybody outside Germany will have dramatic problems understanding those jokes due to the appearance of well known german faces (like the american diner boss -the star comedian Tom Gerhardt and the country song idol Peter Maffay). Even if you are not acquainted with the star parade, the story is wonderfully told. The whole thing resembles a half breed- Altmans "Short Cuts" and Quentins "Pulp Fiction" We wish there would be a chance for a second or a third Eisbär Movie...
