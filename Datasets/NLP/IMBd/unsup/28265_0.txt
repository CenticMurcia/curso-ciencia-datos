As a person that is interested in Math and when I heard about Flatland the Film I had to obtain a copy. The first time I watched Flatland the film I found it very interesting with great 3D animation. As I watched a second and third time I began to notice hidden things within the film, which must have been placed within the film on purpose, and I did not notice them the first time I watched. In addition, every time I watch it the question comes to mindÂ… how many things did you guys hide in this film and is it your trademark??? I found the film was very true to the book and have recommended this Film to many and the response has been great. We have planned some viewing parties to see if we can find more hidden things. This film is great keep up the good work. When is your next film coming out and what is will be hidden in it?
