First let me quote the late great movie critic Gene Siskel, to like a movie you have to like the people on the screen. You've paid your money you've given your time and you have to be able to root for them in some way. In this movie, the movie's central character the heroine is totally unlikeable.<br /><br />She make extremely nasty comments to her roommate, hangs up on her grandfather when he calls her to tell her her father is dying and is the most narcissistic nasty character I have seen on the screen in a long time. I guess we are suppose to forgive her anti-social attitude because she had quess what-a really bad childhood (who hasn't had a really bad childhood!). Her use of symbolism is maybe out of 6th grade English. Her name is Lily and someone is tending a plant throughout the film, I will leave you to guess what kind of a flower it is. Also there is the requisite crucifixion symbolism and the terrible, terrible secret family secret she must carry-her father has AIDS. Is this 2004? I think you'd be more embarrassed to tell the world your father has tuberculosis or West Nile Virus not AIDS. No one communicates, everyone is lonely and isolated, parents disappoint their children, husbands and wives are alienated-I don't think there is one stereotype not depicted in this movie. The supporting acting is quite good. Gale Harold shines as her neurotic love interest. But the movie is left to be carried by Jennifer Elster and she is just not someone you care to root for.
