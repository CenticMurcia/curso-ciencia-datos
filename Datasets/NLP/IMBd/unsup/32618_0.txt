Somethings gotta give isn't going to change your life, but it's a pleasant enough way to spend a couple of hours. It's a shame more use wasn't made of the supporting cast which includes the excellent Frances McDormand.<br /><br />The focus of the movie is very much on the two lead characters Harry (Nicholson) and Erica (Keaton). Harry is a 63 year old man who has never dated any woman over 30 and it seems never even been close to anyone. Erica bumps into Harry whilst he is dating her daughter. After being married for a number of years Erica has lost interest in relationships following her divorce. No prizes for guessing what's going to happen.<br /><br />Whilst, Erica's character is well played and believable, Harry's character really doesn't add up. It's unlikely that someone with Harry's background would be able to relate and connect so easily with women. Nicholson is really going through the motions here. 6/10
