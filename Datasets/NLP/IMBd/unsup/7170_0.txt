I must say, I'm not really a fan of Poe, but after this film.. Woh, I am now.. This film was great! The feel brought me back to the time of Alfred Hitchcock! I love this film! Ms. Thatcher was an amazing touch! What to say about this film? It's a great film, especially when you don't know the plot. Thats how I went in and I loved it! <br /><br />The acting is very good. Austin and Izabella are very great in this film. I for one, am not a Izabella fan, only seeing her in Forsaken. But was pretty impressed. I wonder why she hasn't broken out yet. And Austin Nichols was a very nice addition. He made a great choice of the character, but felt he could've been less wooden. Other than that, great watch! I suggest this to everyone!
