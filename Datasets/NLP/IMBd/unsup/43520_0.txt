I am a European living in USA for 3 years and always exited to watch a non- Hollywood movie. I have seen a lot that involves guys in this movie and around them. Loved almost everything I saw. So I was very eager to see some new work. I have never heard about the book (until I read some other comments) but I hope it was better then this. So what if he is in love, we all are. Are we thinking of going nuts about it? Sometimes. We have seen this kinda staff too many times. And all that nudity. Only good thing about it is that is all natural, which gives us somewhat soft touch. But still did not understand anything the movie tries to tell us.<br /><br />I never think watching a movie is a waste of time, though this one came close!!!
