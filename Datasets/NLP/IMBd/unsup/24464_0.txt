A rich lonely old woman takes in six homeless people and gives them a home, a job and something much greater. A family. The plot is a little out there, but it works here as we see a rich woman give back to the people who need it more...<br /><br />At first I was quite sceptical...And feared for Ruth but the film tries to portray the message that 'don't judge a book by it's cover', and in turn; something wonderful is thrown at the audience. <br /><br />Doris Roberts performance is quite good, she plays her role gently giving Judy Reyes's character the love of a mother, who has been abandoned by her own daughter.<br /><br />The ending tried to squeeze every last tear out of the audience member which I thought was a little irritating...But it works.
