I think it was obvious that another straight-to-DVD sequel wasn't a wise decision, you even see the letters PU at the beginning, so it was obvious to stink, lol. Basically college professor Miranda Hollander (Helena Mattsson) lives her life like any other normal woman, before suffering a mysterious blackout, and without her knowledge, transforming into a hideous alien creature. Her "uncle" Tom Hollander (Chariots of Fire's Ben Cross) tells her the truth he has kept from her since birth, she is a half human, half alien creature, created from alien DNA to create a hybrid. She has been injected with human hormones to stop the alien inside her coming out since birth, but it is obvious they are not working as well as they used to. The only person who may be able to help her, and explain another creature chasing after Tom, is co-creator of Miranda, Forbes McGuire (Heroes' Dominic Keating). The only way to save her, from dying, is to find a live female to clone from, and Forbes finds a prostitute (of course). The new Miranda is created, with the same memories, but even more vicious, blood-thirsty and desperate to breed, thankfully she is blown up in the end, by Tom. Also starring Edy Arellano as Calder√≥n and Marco Bacuzzi as Rinaldo. The special effects are limited and not convincing, the gore doesn't do anything, and the acting skills, lame Australian accent by Keating, and most dialogue, are just terrible. I can safely say that this was even worse than the previous sequel, and I wouldn't be too surprised if they were stupid enough to make another sequel, or even a prequel. Poor!
