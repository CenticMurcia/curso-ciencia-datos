This game is in a very real sense, very good. You are the Nomad Soul - a disembodied spirit in a hostile world. You must possess the inhabitants and use their bodies in order to free the world of Omnikron from its demonic overlord. During your (third person perspective) adventure, you will encounter 3d fighting sections, 1st person shooting areas, and concerts by David Bowie himself in seedy nightclubs!
