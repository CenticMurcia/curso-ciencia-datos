I am really feeling bad about fanaa movie, in this movie they are showing a terrorist has a hero, if this is the case then all terrorists will think them self has heroes, what about he killed more than 100 Indians and their wife and their sons/daughters? We should not support these types of movies, if we are really Indians and we supports our nation then we need to burn the movie and also the actors they played in this movie.<br /><br />I know only this types of movies can run in India, if it is in any other country if movie like this came in their country against their own country, then they may banned and burned it at that movement it self.<br /><br />If these types of movies will run in India then only GOD has to save India. Because of inefficient and always loving characters our ancestors we lost our great India now also we are doing do same mistake and we going to loose our India one day.
