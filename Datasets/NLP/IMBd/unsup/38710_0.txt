Easily the worst of the Universal "Invisible" series, this barely qualifies as horror. Mostly, it's a lot of embarrassing buffoonery about winning the war that must have lowered morale in theaters all over Allied territory. "You Naszty Spy" and "I'll Never Heil Again" look like Lubitsch in comparison.
