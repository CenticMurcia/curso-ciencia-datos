I was lucky enough to see a screening of Second Best at the Hamptons Film Festival. It's a wonderful film, with snappy, smart, funny dialogue, solid acting by Joe Pantolione and Boyd Gaines, as well as a comfortable blanket of familiarity as everyone has a touch of the "loser" within them. For fans of good drama and the dynamics of male friendships, not to mention desperation, jealousy, and sarcasm, or those who want to laugh out loud, I heartily recommend this movie. Not long after, I saw Sideways, which also deals with the friendship of two off-beat males. If you liked Sideways, you'll like Second Best. While this one doesn't have the wine and the vineyards, it certainly possesses the same biting humor, outrageous moments, and thoughtfulness. All in all, a kickin' indie flick.
