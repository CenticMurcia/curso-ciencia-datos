One wonders why the likes of Ray Liotta, Willem Dafoe, and Stephen Rea would sign on to do a film like this. I seriously hope they actually read the horrible story before agreeing to it.<br /><br />A complete garbage story about a convict saved from execution by being a guinea pig for a doctor. The deal includes trying out a medication that will erase the harmful tendencies of the convicts past, trying to make him a better person for society.<br /><br />I gave it a chance but after about 30 minutes, I realized this story was formed around a single idea and the rest was just filled in along the way. That characters are underdeveloped and you never really get a liking for any of them. Then before you know it, its over, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />The film feels like a movie of the week based on a cheap page turning novel you pick up before you get on an airplane.<br /><br />Unfortunately Liotta and Dafoe don't help. They over-act, probably to compensate for the poor plot.<br /><br />Skip this one if you can. Waste of time.
