I just thought of this film after about forty years and remembered it as a real funny feature picture. So, naturally, I went on IMDb and looked it up.<br /><br />I was surprised that the first(rotating?)review was bad and remembered how original and funny a story and movie it was.<br /><br />So, I clicked on "More reviews" and was glad to see that I was right. Maybe the one reviewer was not about to get drafted at the time as I was, and I faced going straight (no pun intended) to Nam.<br /><br />I saw it with friends most of whom I suppose were straight. Some were filmmakers and we just 'broke a gut' laughing. And the thing is, the entire audience was laughing just as hard in a major Hollywood theater, as they would have in a small art house.<br /><br />The only (SPOILER)in this review is really not much of a spoiler; it's just describing a neat scene. I just did not want to spoil it for someone lucky enough to see the movie if it is ever brought back. The scene is that funny. So just in case this movie is not re-released for TV or rental, and if tomorrow, Televangilist Pat Robertson is made America's censor, here goes ...<br /><br />It is the visual that is hilarious. Of course the straight boys have to invite their parents to see their one-bedroom apartment. In the boys deception they have had to leave it furnished just as it had been before their taking possession from the very gay prior tenants.<br /><br />They were unable to change anything because they were being investigated by the draft board, who did not believe that they were gay, which of course they were not.<br /><br />When the parents and younger brothers and sisters (I think) walked into the one bedroom, THAT THE BOYS WERE SHARING; I and everyone in the theater were laughing so hard, one could not hear the dialog; that is, if the actors were even talking.<br /><br />Picture a bedroom decorated like a '30s or '40s musical, or as my late parents used to love .. operetta movies featuring women's themes, with titles like, "Up in Central Park" and "Naughty Marietta" with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. Oh, how I hated those films as a kid. <br /><br />A bedroom decorated so strongly that it shouted-out, "Ths is a women's room."<br /><br />But what got the most screams of laughter was THE BOY'S BIG RED VELVET BED THAT THEY SHARED ... SHAPED LIKE A HUGE HART!!! I remember that today, forty years later!<br /><br />Great, funny film; I wish they would bring it back.
