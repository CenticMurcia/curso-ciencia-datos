Oi Vey, what can I say about this film? It's starts strong with seemingly good potential gore wise, and an OK storyline, but as the minutes pass by the storyline just gets worse, and worse, until finally at the end, the only thing you can say is "WTF?" The film does have some positives though, the special effects/gore is above par and done very well, and it's fun to watch the cute "Eiko" prance around, I'd like to see her in more films, hopefully in a more serious role though next time. (like Battle Royale II maybe?) The film also gives some nice nods to Romero and Bruce Campbell, and for that you have to respect it, as it's paying homage to the great zombie/gore films that are it's precedent.<br /><br />My recommendation is this: If you are a fan of zombies AND Japanese culture, give this film a go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, it's really a case of 'take it or leave it'.
