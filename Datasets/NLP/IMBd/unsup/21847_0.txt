An excellent example of when film-makers get tired of a project half way through, and rather than create a quality project, simply go through the motions.<br /><br />Dracula's plot and motivations as a villain are nonsensical, as he turns from this God hating hedonist that we had become familiar with in the first movie (and was not contradicted during his non-role in the sequel) into some Dr. Doom-ish would be conquerer of Romania.<br /><br />I could forgive the stretching of Dracula's role from lusty blood sucker into world conquerer were the rest of the film's writing not so empty. I'm not sure which is more of a clich√©, Jason Scott Lee's action movie quips and brooding, or Jason London's I-wish-I-were-written-by-Joss-Whedon attempts at witty banter. Every part of this movie reeks of banality, as the movie chugs along from points A to B to C solely to fulfill the trilogy. The movie diverges from the derivative plot once in a while just to throw the audience tidbits of gore or sexuality, all of which are pretty lack luster, and will fail to thrill experienced horror watchers.<br /><br />What is most bothersome of this film, like the one before it, is that continuity is thrown completely out the window. In the first film, it was revealed that Dracula was Judas cursed with undeath, unable to bear the light of the sun. The second movie totally ignored the end of the first one, and wrote out the entire human cast. Dracula in part two was a new actor, but one still fairly young and seductive looking, and able to appear menacing. For part three, not only is Dracula replaced by the much older Rutger Hauer, but he is now 'the embodiment of evil' reaching back as far as ancient Egypt. When did Dracula become X-men's Apocalypse? I'm unsure, but I am very sure that the writer of each of the two sequels in this series did not watch the prior installment.<br /><br />Boring and poorly achieved in nearly every regard, this tepid movie can be avoided. I only hope you don't get sucked into the same vortex that I did, obligated to watch this film, only to complete the cliffhanger ending left by part 2.
