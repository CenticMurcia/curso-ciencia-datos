This movie was really bad. It didn't make any sense. For instance in the original the first time Ralph sees Dane is when he is a teenager. The last time Ralph and Meggie saw each other before 1954 was Matlock Island in 1935. In the original Ralph tells Meggie its nearly been twenty years since we saw each other. Fee and Vittorio were really bad in the missing Years. Fee had no personality and Vittorio was really mean. Dane also had a strong Aussie accent compared to the original when it was a US accent. The only good thing about this movie was the score but again not as good as the original. They should of left the thorn birds alone. There was no point for a sequel to be made in the middle of a story we all know that Ralph dies. They should have made a new movie called the thorn birds: the next generations that takes place after Ralph's death.
