This movie changed my life. Never before have I witnessed such a dramatic piece with intricate plot lines developed so well. With remarkable performances from some of the finest actors of our generation, including Luke Goss from the Grammy award winning group BROS. Samuel L Jackson portrays a desperate cop in the role of his career and Euegen Levey was truly robbed of an Oscar with his subtle and captivating portrayal of a dentist in a neck brace.<br /><br />If you pass up on the opportunity to go and see or rent this movie then you may aswel end your life or perhaps consider perpetual hibernation for you are passing up the opportunity to have your life changed. When I first saw this movie I gave up the notion of a superior creator and decided that the Man should be the biblical celluloid that dictates my life and takes me to places I never thought possible.<br /><br />Also in the film you get to hear Eugene Levey call samuel L Jackson a bitch and for that alone you must do what ever you can to help yourselves and others to view this work of magnificence. The Man.
