"Big Night" is a hearty, satisfying tale of two Italian brothers coming to America to make it big. Primo and Secondo have two very dissimilar ideals about food and business. The dichotomy that exists between the two brothers provides for both tension and humour and fuels this delightful tale.<br /><br />Shaloub, Tucci and Holm are all magnificent. Holm as the (literally) ass-biting rival restaurateur is absolutely hilarious. Shaloub and Tucci, two native Americans, were very convincing as Italian emigres. The women, Rosselini, Driver and Janney complement and flesh out the cast quite nicely.<br /><br />The film moved along at a nice pace, generously sprinkled with humour, passion and tension. The big dinner party scene is lively and will have you dancing in your seat. And the food they served -- I got full just watching it all.<br /><br />My one complaint with this film was the superfluous use of Italian. It's an AMERICAN film -- why must the brothers (and other cast members) arbitrarily slip into Italian conversations. It's not as if it served as a place for the characters to "secretly" discuss things -- just about everyone was Italian! I don't feel it served the film well at all. It did not add to it's authenticity -- instead it appeared to mimic a true foreign film.<br /><br />Other than that the film was pleasant and enjoyable! After watching "Big Night" you'll have a hankering for a big dish of just about anything Italian.
