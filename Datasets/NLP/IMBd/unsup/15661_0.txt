Many people like to view Half-Wits Holiday as Curly's last performance and talk about how ill he was. I prefer to take a longer look and mention how funny it is. It has plenty of classic stooge mayhem and lines. The boys being regarded as three missing links; feeling ashamed at the prospect of being turned into gentlemen; Symona Boniface telling Moe, "You act as though the sword of Damocles is hanging over your head!"; and of course, a tidy pie fight.<br /><br />I've always thought that Moe seemed to get meaner as he got older, and my personal suspicion was that he didn't like the fact that his brother Curly was forced to act and not rest in his last few years as a stooge. (And after Curly's death, Moe really took it out on Shemp.) I was also thinking it must have been difficult for him on a certain level to be hitting Curly when his kid brother was obviously not well.<br /><br />Anyway, I think this short has one of the most classic stooge lines ever. It's when the boys are seated around the dinner table and being coached on proper dining etiquette but only pretending to use utensils and eat food. Curly turns to Professor Quackenbush and asks, "Pardon me, what are we eating now?"
