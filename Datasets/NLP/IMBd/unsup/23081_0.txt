There's really not much to glean from the film's celebration of its titular cussing. It's neither cathartic nor informative, but it does remind me of the thrill I used to get from that once ubiquitous adolescent prank ("See you next Tuesday") when it was pulled off to great effect. Under the guise of a semi-serious dissertation of how and why the world's favourite expletive became as proverbial and culturally offensive as it is, director Steve Anderson fills most of its running time with obvious allusions to its history and capping it off with vainglorious interviews with the media's foremost douchebags like Bill Maher and Evan Seinfeld, among other celebrities who use their screen time to cheekily rail against conservatism and vaunting themselves as trailblazers in the fight for their country's First Amendment. Obligatory conservative talking heads aside, Anderson fails to establish himself as an impartial mediator, often seeming intimidated and impressed by his more illustrious interviewees. It all adds up to one empty, hollow shell of a documentary that forgets to keep its finger on the pulse. Like we give a flying f*ck.
