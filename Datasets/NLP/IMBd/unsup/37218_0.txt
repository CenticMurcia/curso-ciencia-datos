While vaguely historical,i.e., the Mormons were persecuted and Brigham Young did lead them to Utah; this film is very inaccurate in portraying that history. The production quality is poor, splicing in badly color-tinted black and white stock footage and clips from the 1940 Brigham Young to show the westward trek and cricket plague. The acting of the minor characters and bit players runs from adequate to exceptional, but to say that the acting of the leads is pitiful is more than kind.
