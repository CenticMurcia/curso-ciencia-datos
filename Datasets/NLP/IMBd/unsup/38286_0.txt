Bad! It's like the whole show is made for young kids or older people(50 and up)who doesn't know what good acting, good directing and a good script are. The only reason that this show is still being aired is because half of Norways population is youngsters and oldies, who does not understand English or manage to read the subtitles fast enough, and there's no other shows to watch in Norwegian(Okey, you have the sucky sitcoms). <br /><br />There are some good actors/actresses(not good, but they suck less) and they are the only reason why i gave this 2 out of 10! <br /><br />Definitely not worth checking out!
