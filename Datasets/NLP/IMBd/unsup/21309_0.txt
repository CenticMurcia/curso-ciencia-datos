I fully understand that people who read the book don't appreciate this movie, I believe it's true for 90 % of book adaptations.<br /><br />Anyway, it's the sort of movie I like, clean, all scenes are meaningful, Harisson plays the cool fish, but he's the extreme of the heroism played by Dafoe.<br /><br />Fun part of this movie is how the computer kid solved the password in 5 seconds during the first part of the movie, while he was given all the personal "paper" data on the people involved and then was challenged with a serious job at the end. The voice recognition session made me laugh too.<br /><br />Why don't we have these sort of programs at home? <br /><br />Anyway, good action, entertainment, swift changes, it's never dull. Open a bottle of Muscadet, nicely cooled, sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />
