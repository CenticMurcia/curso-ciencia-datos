I watched this movie as part of the Philadelphia Film Festival a few years back...it was ALMOST unwatchable. I think the only reason people sat through the entire movie was because there was a Q&A session after the film with Dame Dash and Kevin Hart. I don't think anyone even asked about this film...people mentioned the Woodsmen more than this mock-umentary...The only time it was mentioned was because the events in the film actually happened after filming them....<br /><br />I'm surprised that with this amount of star power in the film, they couldn't make something more of it. It almost looks like a student film that the entire cast improvised. or at least...attempted to improvise.
