I saw this film, yea its not a block buster hit but if you had any type of intelligence you would be able comprehend the depth of this movie. Life is a dark and scary place, if no one has encountered anything horrible in their life Gob bless you but, in order to see how the rest of the world works... watch this film. Every human is born pure but it depends on the path you take. It's not hard to fall off the path and end up in a world of terror, drugs and fear. You should be happy that we have talented directors and actors to portray this terrible way of life rather than experiencing it our selves forever. If you think this film is b.s. then you're living on the high land and soon enough, you'll fall off A hole! From Alex.
