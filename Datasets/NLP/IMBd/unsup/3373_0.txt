I don't usually rate movies 1 out of 10, but this movie falls in that category. Everything about this movie is bad, from the horrible acting performances of the two lead kids to the plot that can't hold itself up. Not only was it not well made, it was not interesting whatsoever. I was trying to fall asleep but I couldn't. Not only that, though. Everyone I saw the movie didn't like it. If a group of six different people all agree that a movie is bad, they're probably right. The movie had no appeal at all to the six completely different personalities. Also to be noted is the shabby direction. Part of directing is not just planning how each scene is shot, but it's directing the actors involved in the film. It takes a good director to direct a child actor and turn it into a good performance, and the director of this movie didn't even come close. The two lead kids literally just said their lines and went through motions, without feeling. Please, do yourself a favor and see something else instead.
