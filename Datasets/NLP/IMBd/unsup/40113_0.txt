I am only five minutes and ten into the movie, and I felt compelled to pause and complain about this. Already, the over-dramatic dialogue and stereotypical group of teens makes for an hour and a half of teen-horror crap. The funeral scene implies a whopping body count of ...1! Now i haven't actually seen it yet, so i don't know. When sci-fi/modern technology mixes with horror, when has it EVER been good? i.e. Halloweeen: Resurrection with webcams, Jason X in the future, a 3-D Nightmare on Elm Street, and now Pinhead in cyberspace? All this time, I'm wondering how could Doug Bradley possibly agree to do these types of movies? With the exception of Inferno, the direct-to-DVD sequels were cinematic crap; even Disney has the sense to stop making DVD sequels to good movies after 1. Hellraiser needs a revival, a rejuvenation, a return to the big screen. They did it for Batman, they're doing it for Superman, and they sure as hell can do it for everybody's favorite cenobite.
