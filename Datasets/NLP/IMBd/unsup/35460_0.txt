well my wife spotted this, and we wasted one and a half hours of our life watching it.<br /><br />Spoilers (no honestly it is possible)<br /><br />the idea behind it is great, and you can see inspiration from 24 for the plots and secrets etc. but it shows how you can do this, without the panache of 24. On the DVD the extras on how it is made, are well a little over simplified, and just check out the lead actress on justifying her performance. The fight scenes are few and far between, and badly executed, you can see it is NOT Mr Seagal, as his hair length on the back shots changes between shots.<br /><br />Overall, a nice idea done badly, i would not rent this if i where you. There are better low budget films available in this genre.
