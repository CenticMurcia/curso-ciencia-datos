Is it just me or are people a tad too fussy these days? OK, so Fear Her isn't on such a big scale as the rest of the series, but that still doesn't make it a bad episode.<br /><br />The Doctor and Rose land in 2012, at the time of the London Olympics, but children are vanishing from an ordinary street and a mother is trying to hide her daughter Chloe's powers.<br /><br />The plot is good, the acting is good, and it also has a rather sinister part - a half-living drawing of Chloe's dead father is lurking in her wardrobe and says "I'm coming to hurt you". Overall I think it's a pretty good Doctor Who episode, and I don't know what the fuss is about.
