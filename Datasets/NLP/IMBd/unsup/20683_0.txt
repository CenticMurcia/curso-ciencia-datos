This is a loving study on the importance of love,life,death & art. Forever is a Dutch produced documentary,shot in & around the famed 'Pere Laichaise',the famed cemetery where the likes of Chopin, Oscar Wilde,Simone Signoret,Marcel Proust,and yes...Jim Morrison are buried. Despite the somewhat potential grim nature of it's subject matter,this is not a death obsessed film,but an affirmation of life & how temporary it is. This is a fine,loving film for open minded folk who are passionate about life & art (action/adventure fanciers need not bother--it's not going to be your cup of Budweiser). A bit of searching out will be a pre requisite for this one, as distribution is somewhat limited to art cinemas only (I guess the subtitles will be the biggest tip off).
