Wow! Where to start. Lets go with acting. The acting was so bad, it didn't even have a chance to become good and then go bad again. It sounded as if they couldn't remember their lines, so they had someone hold a card off screen. On top of that you couldn't even hear what they were saying so you had to turn up the volume, then you were blasted with loud music.<br /><br />Now the fighting. The fight scenes were so underwhelming. They looked lazy and boring. Not one person looked like they new any martial arts except Gary Daniels, who even though is a pro-fighter never threw a punch the whole movie. Another thing who can fight on roller blades.<br /><br />The whole pace of the movie was slow and dragged out. It seemed every scene was a montage scene.<br /><br />The only good things in the movie are the masks that the kids and the "White Dragon" wear and Robert Z'Dar as Cobra Khan.<br /><br />If your looking for a children's karate movie, skip this and go get "3 Ninjas 1 and 2".
