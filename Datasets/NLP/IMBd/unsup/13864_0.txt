This delightful musical has it all...The colorful characters from Dogpatch U.S.A.,the great songs that made the Broadway show such a hit,funny and lively dances and colorful sets and costumes!his melodic film is led to victory by the late,great Stubby Kaye as Marryin Sam. While its Abner's story Kaye's Sam steals the picture. His 3 main numbers are all showstoppers especially the famous Jubilation T. Cornpone. Peter Palmer and Leslie Parrish are charming as Abner and Daisy Mae,while Howard St. John is a perfectly pompous General Bullmoose. My only regret is that they cut his brilliant "Progress Is The Root Of All Evil" number from the stage version.Stella Stevens is also well cast as Bullmoose's mistress Appasionata Von Climax. The songs are indeed some of the strongest ever written for a traditional musical comedy including the comedic satire on politic "The Country's in The Very Best Of Hands' and Daisy's and Sam's homage to growing older "Past My Prime".<br /><br /> In short 'Lil Abner' is sheer musical delight.
