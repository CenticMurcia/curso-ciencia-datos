A couple weeks ago, I got a free HBO movie channel preview on Dish Network. While looking through the list of movies, I noticed "Malibu's Most Wanted" and was instantly intrigued. I'm here today to tell you that it was one of the funniest movies I've seen in my life.<br /><br />Bradley "B-Rad" Gluckman is the son of one of the richest men in Malibu. In fact, he's running for governor. B-Rad, out of the goodness of his heart, decides to help his father "get his campaign trizzy on." B-Rad helps out by singing a scandalous rap at one of his father's speeches. Outraged, B-Rad's father decides to send his son to the ghetto with some "hard-core gangsters" to try and "scare the black out of him." Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Without spoiling any of the movie, I'd like to say that I am now the proud owner of not one, but TWO copies of this DVD. "Malibu's Most Wanted" is a hilarious movie that makes many clever nods to pop culture. Some people may be offended by the humor (as it's somewhat racial), but it's done tastefully. I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's needing a good laugh.
