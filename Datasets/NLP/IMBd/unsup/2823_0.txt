It wasn't good....It was great!!!! remarkable performances,Morgan Freeman at his best,simply brilliant!!! Gwyneth Paltrow doing a role like few women would have succeed in this type of movies,and Brad Pitt was pretty good too(despite not liking him...)I fell the need to glue my eyes to the screen,this movie filled me up right from the beginning!! fine acting,fine plot,great effects,the timeline sequence of every event was completely flawless,and why not? Everyone should learn something about their morals with this movie,even the more obvious lesson, being obsessive in order to avoid the seven sins may be a sin itself. And when a movie teaches you something to make you evolve,and at the same time you enjoy and spend some quality time I think I can say that the goal of the movie was accomplished,they have set up the bar very high,but still,they managed to live up to the hype...which makes this movie a classic...1996...It seems like I saw it yesterday...
