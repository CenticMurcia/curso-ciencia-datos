I'd like to make an appeal to everyone out there who has ever been involved in polluting the environment.<br /><br />Godzilla returns to save the world once again, this time battling a blob with eyes. Hedora, as its known, starts off tiny but is soon growing as a result of feasting on all the toxic waste and suchlike. This entry into the seemingly never-ending Godzilla series includes an irritating little boy who says 'Papaaaaaaa' a lot, a storyline that feels as though it was put together with very little thought, occasional silly cartoon sequences showing Hedora doing nasty things, slabs of tedium and two almost identical endings, one after the other.<br /><br />So please, stop polluting the environment. Because in a pollution-free environment, there'll be no need for movie-makers to come up with this kind of trash.
