Ok, I just managed to stay awake through this film, hoping for some emotional jolt at the end to make up for over two hours of tedium.<br /><br />Oh, yeah--late 80's to mid 90's films are considered more sophisticated if left without a meaningful resolution, "Cause that's like life."<br /><br />Strong willed witch of a mother-in-law, spineless son, sweet wife with too little self-esteem. Three people I wouldn't want to know in person, or spend another minute watching.<br /><br />Was it just my DVD or were all the scenes in Leila's home supposed to have the same red lighting as submarines in emergencies?<br /><br />Avid feminists might enjoy this. Avid film-lovers...beware.
