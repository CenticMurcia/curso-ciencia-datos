Gunshy (Gun Shy in the US) is a brilliantly scripted, original and funny film. With great performances by Liam Neason as well as some of his supports, writer / director Eric Blakeney has managed to realise and create one of the most refreshing films to come out of the US for a long time. Too often it is the script that lets a film down - not with Gunshy! And to then put words to the screen as successfully as Blakeney has managed himself is really encouraging. After this directorial debut I can hardly wait to see what he can come up with next! It just leaves me wondering: who screwed up the marketing for Gunshy, because this is definitely a film that deserved a much better reception than it got. Categorising Gunshy as a "Sandra Bullock romantic comedy" is not only clearly wrong, but leaves those searching for such a film disappointed, and the audience that would most appreciate this film unaware of GunshyÂ´s existence. I only saw Gunshy by chance, loved it, and would urge anyone to go and see it!
