I think video stores should create a new genre - the sci-fi/slasher flick. This one begins with a sci-fi premise (which sucks people like me in), that moves quickly to six to ten people isolated on some craft (ship, spaceship, etc.), while some alien life form attempts to kill them all. The Alien series is the classic of this genre - very good. This follows Event Horizon down the ho-hum-ness of the whole thing, just throw some extra gore in and people will see it. By the end of the movie I didn't even react to the characters' fear, I just awaited the inevitable. And there were some good actors in it. Oh well, I was hoping to get more out of the "virus" concept, but was robbed of that as the movie swung rapidly out of sci-fi and into slasher - I should have known. Skip it and rent Alien again, or rent it, if you collect the genre. I gave it a 2 out of respect for Donald Sutherland and Jamie Lee Curtis (what were they thinking?) - zsk
