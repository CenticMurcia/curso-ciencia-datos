Three directors from three different countries made three separate films (around 40 minutes each) and put them together to create one hellacious and twisted film that continues to shock and disgust, shock and disgust, shock and disgust, over and over. These are the three films that collectively make ThreeExtremes: The first film is Hong Kong director Fruit Chan's Dumplings. A woman who feels old and ugly because of her adulterous husband will pay anything and do anything to look younger. She'll even knowingly eat dumplings filled with aborted fetuses. Oh, it's heinous! You see the abortions, the fetuses, and you hear all the slurping, chewing, and crunching. It's nauseating and twisted, but also says a lot about China's over-population and the resulting abortion culture. Fascinating. Definitely my favorite of the three films.<br /><br />Next is Korean director Chan-wook Park's film Cut. A professional movie extra kidnaps his director and holds him and his wife hostage on the director's current movie set. His wife is tied to a piano and the kidnapper forces him to kill an innocent child, or else he'll chop off his wife's fingers. Fingers are blended in a blender, people are strangled, and necks are bitten off. If you love human flesh mutilation, you will love Cut.<br /><br />Box, by Japan's Takashi Miike is the most psychologically haunting of the three films. A quiet, soft-spoken girl has a recurring nightmare about being buried alive in a box in the snow. But why, oh why, would she have such a wacky nightmare? Did something horrific happen to her when she was a child? Something involving boxes and dying? I don't know. You're going to have to see it to find out for yourself.<br /><br />All in all, ThreeExtremes is disturbing, disgusting, brilliant, and chilling. If American movies are just too wussy for your taste, try an Asian film. Or better yet, try three films in one. It's sickin the best way possible.
