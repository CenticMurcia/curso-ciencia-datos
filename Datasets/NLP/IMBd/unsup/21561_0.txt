I really Loved the show, I hope they re-think it and give it another chance. Who was the Designer for those HOT HOT clothes. WOW!! I think the show was fun, The women are business savvy. It was a bit like Sex and the City, but with a different spin. Lucy Lu wore the clothes that we call bringing Sexy Back. The story lines were sometimes slow, but it could have gotten better with a little time. However; Can we see one person on a show where one of the girls relationship works. Even with some ups and downs some relationships do work. Every now and then viewers would like to see a loving relationship, so we can ohhh and ahhh. The concept of the show was good. Overall we Loved the show.
