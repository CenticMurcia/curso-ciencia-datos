I saw the movie tonight (not by choice) and surprise surprise . it sucked! The last good film that QT made was pulp fiction. IMO - I don't think QT is a bad director, but there's no depth and not much thought to his films. all he basically does is make a film look `cool" and that's exactly what this film was! A total disappointment and no surprise there. Plus I think the guy is totally tasteless - he's a professional, he should know better than to talk trash on high-profile films just to bring attention to himself. sad sad sad!
