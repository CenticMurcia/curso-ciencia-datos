This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. The story is awful, and the songs worse. Francis Ford Coppola directed this rubbish?<br /><br />Okay where to Begin. Fred's accent is terrible, is he Irish? Coulda fooled, me cos I don't know where the hell he came from (It really is one of those bad accents, one where he hasn't even tried to pretend to be Irish). Actually that's unfair, all those pretending to be Irish have crap accents. 800 years of suffering under English rule, haven't the Irish suffered enough? And what the hell is it with this Glocca Morra rubbish? Glocca Morra, what the HELL?! There is no such place! Couldn't they have actually used a place which exists in Ireland. Did they have to Make it up? And if they had to make up a name, could they have chosen a better name than GLOCCA MORRA?! There's an underlying anti-racism plot going on. This anti-racism plot is like having Springtime for Hitler be the main interest of Schindler's list, ie showing the evils of Nazi Germany, then praising it. An oxymoron, if you will. What I mean by this is they show the evils of racism against minorities, but come off as highly prejudiced ( a form of racism) to Ireland and it's culture. So it's okay to be prejudiced if the people are white? Stay Away from this film, unless watching bad films is how you get your kicks.
