I just finished watching this movie about 2 hours ago and I want to cry that I actual spent money on this film! I loved the first one. It was fun, upbeat and the characters were really enjoyable. This movie, i just couldn't get into it.. the dialogue seemed fake and the characters, were unrelatable. Although it did deplict some of the "realities" of university life, the story line never went anywheres. The best part of the movie was the last 10 minutes, when cheerleading actually took place. I think thats what made the first one so much fun. It was actually about cheerleader. So for those who want to see it, don't bother! Stick to the original, cause you'll be disappointed by bring it on again!
