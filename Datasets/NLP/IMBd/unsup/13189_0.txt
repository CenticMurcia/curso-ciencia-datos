We did not hesitate to accept the offer of previewing "Dreamer" since both my dad and my husband have owned and raced thoroughbreds. We were not disappointed with the story of what every owner and trainer dreams about. Although the movie is billed as based on a true story, no information is readily available about how much is true or from what the author got his inspiration. As with other "truth-based" films, I came away curious to know more, even though I suspect much of it is far-fetched. However having said that, "Dreamer" is a very, very enjoyable movie that the whole family can watch. If you've ever had even a fleeting desire to own a horse as a kid or an adult, this movie won't disappoint you either.
