This is the very worst film I have ever seen in my life on all accounts. It is a series of continuous and abysmally stupid jokes. If it had a plot, I don't know what it was. It appeared that the guy who was writing it was trying to write an "Airplane" style film but tried too hard and with hackneyed lines. The cheesy "Under Sir Veillance" bit was about the highlight of the entire film. Then, on top of this inanity, add lots of gratuitous nudity which contributes nothing to the story except that the person making the film was probably getting off (it appeared the camera froze in a few chosen spots...like we have never seen those before!) The only funny thing aspect of this film is that it was even listed on here! I was shocked to find it. Okay,it is memorable but so is food poisoning. I was trying to think of the worst film I have ever seen and then looked it up! Haha! There it was! Think of the most boring home movie you have ever seen...then, divide the entertainment value in half. That is this film.
