Crazy Like a Fox is a deeply flawed film that nonetheless has its merits. Well acted (mostly) and beautifully filmed, the movie suffers from a ham handed script and dubious direction. The plot when analyzed simply doesn't make much sense. The occasional voiceovers do more to muddle the story than to clarify:<br /><br />Nate (Rees) sells his historically rich but dilapidated house, finds out the new owners want to tear it down and decides to live for months in a cave on the edge of the property (in Civil War military garb). When the owners go out of town he moves back in as a squatter. He elicits the sympathy and help of the locals, the sheriff and the local judge who back him up despite the fact he is clearly in violation of the law and collectively and somewhat inexplicably they eventually drive the new owners away.<br /><br />OK, sure we're sympathetic to ruthless developers raping the land, but what exactly did Nate living in a cave accomplish other than cast doubt on his sanity? And are we to be sympathetic to people who take the law into their own hands, and use nepotism and small town politics to usurp the rule of law simply because they don't like outsiders? Who exactly then are the bad guys?<br /><br />Shakespearean actor Roger Rees in his first film role is generally good, problems with his accent aside and Mary McDonnel gives a very nice performance. One feels that both would have done better with more coherent direction. The cinematography and the score (by Washington composer David Kane) are both first rate. <br /><br />All in all, CLAF represents opportunities lost.
