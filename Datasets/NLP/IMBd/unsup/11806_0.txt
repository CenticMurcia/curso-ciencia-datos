i didn't know what to expect from this film. i can say that there were plenty of plot twists that will surprise you and keep you interested throughout the movie. one annoying factor is the constant rewinding back to 12:00 noon. that part gets very annoying but its pertinent to each perspective being told.<br /><br />another part i didn't like was the subtle clue to who was involved in the plot(quaids partner or whoever.dude from party of 5) because it made me automatically point out that he was involved nearly an hour and a half before he was actually implicated. if you notice when he's talking to Quaid in the car and Quaids just talking about being around and thanks him and his partner makes a face and says "Dont thank me yet" ..very subtle clue that goes thru one ear and out the other of most but once i heard it i knew he was either involved or was gonna be killed pretty soon, i was sure he was involved and just as i suspected he was. a movie is never as good to me when i pretty much figure it out early.<br /><br />Forest Whitaker gives another great performance, albeit a small one. he was charming, informative, curious and even remorseful all in one character. he risks his life for a little girl who he previously had bumped into and keeps her out of harms way to find her mother after an explosion, these events magnify the events going on in his own life(battle with his wife) and make them actually seem much smaller when he thinks about it...good addition to the movie the whole subplot with the one guys brother being kidnapped has nothing to do with the movie. i don't know why it was in there but it easily could have been done without....<br /><br />the remote controlled gun was amazing lol.. that part surprised me a lot.<br /><br />overall a decent movie but if you expect it to be groundbreaking throughout you will be a little disappointed.
