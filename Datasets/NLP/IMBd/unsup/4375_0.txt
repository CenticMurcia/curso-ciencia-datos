I've been reading some of the comments for this film, and I can't understand those who don't find it funny. Apparently they've never traveled or have never experienced a modicom of mess while traveling (and I LOVE to travel), or, have simply never had a really bad 48 hours, doing whatever! Lemmon's shear repetition of wanting to get everyone's phone number and address is hysterical, because through his fatigue in trying to cope with one problem after another in The Big Apple, he still finds the strength to take down everyone's name and number, and promises to retaliate at a later point in time. Sandy Dennis is a perfect, calm, albeit understandably very fatigued, foil for Lemmon's frustrated and hyper New Yorker-wannabe. For me, she's always a gem to watch.<br /><br />The scene in which Lemmon loses a tooth, followed by losing his hearing, followed by the ability to hear only every other word spoken, is quietly hysterical. Also very funny is his scene in the park "talking" to a little boy....that's all I'll say about that one. Overall, if you're in the mood for observing high-speed neurosis, played to comedic perfection by the inimitable Jack Lemmon, watch this film, and enjoy.
