Although many have said that this film is "awful", and "sad", I think that it is wonderfully entertaining for most real Beatles fans. It may be somewhat slow moving at times, and the music is very raw up until the final concert, but that is the beauty of it. This is not a film full of music videos. It is a film documenting how the Beatles produced the "Let It Be" album. For anyone interested in the songwriting/recording process, this can be very interesting. The out of tune notes, the messed up lyrics, and the arguments throughout the songs are great because that is how they were really written. Through this video we get to see the skeleton of the album as it is being assembled by the "Fab Four". On top of this, there are some amusing parts where they are laughing and goofing around together showing that under the tension and animosity, they were truly great friends.
