Just awful, I now know how Alan King died! When he found out that this movie wasn't a joke, he completely croaked! Thank God, by the way, that no one really likes this film and the film is a big joke anyway. It is the worst movie ever made, don't believe me? Watch this film for yourself! I mean, the director (who apparently wrote the film too!) probably half-assed the script thinking it was so great even though the movie was way too overrated, it's just such a terrible movie. Like I said, if you think it's good just because other people like it, then you're out of your mind. This movie is just so awful, and the songs in this are terrible! Pointless messages galore the genre should be horror because I was pretty scared watching this crap!
