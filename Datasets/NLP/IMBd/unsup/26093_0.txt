I recall watching this as a kid on a now defunct Sicilian TV channel; however, given the ample nudity on display and, for a film of its type, the excessive length of the thing itself, it's very probable that it had been cut to some extent.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a JAWS (1975) rip-off with a difference  in that it's a ragbag of exploitation items as opposed to a real 'shark' film; for long passages, as a matter of fact, the creature is completely forgotten with the plot (if so it can be called) concentrating on the sexual escapades of the two rival/buddy protagonists! It's only in the last half-hour (of this 126-minute picture) that the chase is well and truly on  after the shark attacks and kills one of the two men; still, this doesn't take the other's mind off sex  resulting in perhaps the film's highlight as a group of revelers is attacked at night, with the girl (one of two American sisters vacationing in Mexico) accompanying the hero ending up killed. Apparently, the creature is really after the latter  and eventually he gets to work on executing his personal vendetta <br /><br />Being a Spanish-British co-production, the film features two English actresses among the bevy of willing beauties  Susan George (whose contribution is the most important, even if it comes exactly half-way through the film and extends to little over 30 minutes of screen-time) and Fiona Lewis (who appears early on and is actually the shark's first victim). The repetitious ménage-a'-trois situation results in some serious padding and a generally tedious film; that said, the shark scenes aren't very creatively handled either (apart from the gore)  so that it can't hope to offer any real competition to the Spielberg classic it's imitating! For the record, I recently watched the even more popular (if still essentially dismal) horror/wrestling hybrid NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES (1969) from this director's father and for which they both contributed to the screenplay.<br /><br />Naturally, the look and sound of TINTORERA! (the title being how the Spanish refer to the Tiger Shark species) screams 1970s  including an agreeable recurring song but especially the disco-driven, drug-fuelled boat parties; frustratingly, though, the full-length print I viewed kept not only alternating between English and Spanish dialogue but had English subtitles popping up for the latter and vice-versa!
