If I could choose a 0 out of 10 for this show, I would. I watched one episode, and it just SICKENED me. I cannot believe that kids like this exist in the world. They act like they are so high and mighty...just because Daddy has a few million pounds in the bank, doesn't really help the fact that they are ugly, stupid, stuck up and not likable at all. I feel sorry for them, their friends are obviously only interested in being best friends with the rich girl, and they'll never know the real value of money, or what it's like to actually earn your own money - which is such a good feeling! They've been robbed of a normal life, so I feel sorry for them. But fair enough, they exist, but WHY PUT THEM ON TELEVISION TO SICKEN AND ENRAGE THE REST OF THE WORLD? What is the point of this show? These girls shouldn't have the satisfaction of thinking they are some kind of celebrity... MTV really has gone downhill - its obvious they are running out of things to broadcast. Awful.
