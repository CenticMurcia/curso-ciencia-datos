The moment i got to know that "Sajid Khan" was directing the film, i had already lost any hopes of the movie being any good anyways because he already has a very idiotic, blunt and stunted sense of humor and such a guy making a whole comedy movie.....Still i took my chances! What more of a disaster can one expect!...the guy didn't disappoint, he not only created a stupid piece of cinema, made look the actors foolish, screwed up the screenplay, senseless direction & not only this but ruined even the script which was clearly like almost every Bollywood Movie nowadays lifted form a Hollywood original....well in this case it was "Three Men and A Baby"... There's hardly anything that can be said more about it, i just wish i could abuse the director on his face and for making me suffer!
