I'm sorry to say, but Hungarian cinema (especially comedies) nowadays is really bad. Always the same old "stars" play in the "blockbusters" telling really bad jokes, but still, have really high reputation here. Hungarian film-making had glorious times about 50 years earlier, but it is just struggling now. But, there were a few exceptions, highly enjoyable films, like Kontroll, Üvegtigris, and Gábor Herendi's previous film, Valami Amerika.<br /><br />I thought that he's standing in front of a promising career. Because of this very amusing picture, I had very high expectations about Magyar Vándor. But after seeing 10 minutes of the film, I started to feel disappointed. And it just got worse and worse. But the story is promising, most of us would have made an enjoyable film from this material. But not the "elite" of Hungarian film-making. Terrible jokes, each one of them is told about ten times, and the whole movie treats the viewer like a complete idiot. And this is what I really don't like. That film was a total waste of money. They should have donated the amount instead.
