Nowadays the "Matrix Style" is a common way to make an action-modern-kung fu movie, in most cases with strange results. But, damn, this "So Close" is SOOOO cool!! It has GREAT style and wonderful scenes. I gave it a 9 and I really think it deserves it. Of course, acting is not at the greatest levels of cinema history. But it's not bad and solves its object. Cinematography is great, with some scenes of pure beautiness. Direction is very good. Corey Yuen is really a good director (I also enjoyed "the transporter" another Yuen's movie) and uses the camera with great creativity. People who like action movies should be watching this movie now!
