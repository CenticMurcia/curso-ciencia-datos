Tom is spending a day at the beach, and is out to impress the sexy white cat who is sunbathing nearby. Mischievous Jerry, however, is determined to scupper Tom's plans.<br /><br />I love it when Tom and Jerry get away from their usual domestic setting to cause havoc somewhere new, and the seaside proves to be the ideal locale for plenty of inventive mayhem and violent hi-jinx: the cat and mouse get in trouble with a cantankerous crab, who is keen to use his pincers on the duo whenever possible; Jerry gets Tom to swallow sand, break his teeth on a shell sandwich, and leap head first onto a wooden post (which the cat is tricked into thinking is a drowning woman); Jerry is launched from a soda bottle into the sea; and Tom swallows an inflatable horse.
