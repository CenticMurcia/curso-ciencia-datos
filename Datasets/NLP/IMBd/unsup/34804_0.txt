This is a movie I had a hard time wrapping my mind around. The description sounded wonderful. It sounded like a murder mystery with Al Pacino leading a pack of devoted police officers to find a serial killer. As a huge fan of Pacino, I thought this would give him a chance to stretch and create a character.<br /><br />Glancing through the reviews, I see that I'm not the only one that found this a disaster. It was bad in so many ways that I found myself amazed. How could an actor of Al Pacino's stature have gotten himself into such a mess? I have no answer at all but can agree with nearly everyone who posted that he should have known better. The day the script was handed to him, he should have realized that it was beneath someone of his abiliity.<br /><br />This was a pointless exercise in sadism, with so many suspicious incidental characters that it became laughable. The supporting acting was bad and the dialog they were forced to speak worse. The 88 minutes gimmick made no sense, because the film was not shot in real time. At one point Al pays a cabbie $100 so he can drive his taxi, then takes the opportunity to drive around explaining the plot instead of racing to the next location. He's a college professor to, but he seems to only use this as an excuse to sleep with as many students as possible. I'm still trying to get my mind around why his hair was piled so high he looked like Elvis. Sorry, Al. THis might be your worst film.
