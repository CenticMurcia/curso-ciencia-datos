This may very well be the worst movie I've ever seen. Watching this was comparable to running my male generative organs through a meat grinder. Low budget early 90s grungy sci-fi with a limp plot and horrible acting. The only reason I sat through the whole thing is because I was hypnotized by how much it sucked. This movie may in fact give "Plan 9 from Outer Space" a run for the title of "worst movie EVER!"
