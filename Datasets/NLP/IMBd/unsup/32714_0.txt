This is a horrible movie that shows that the director/producer/actors did not at all bother find out about a culture they are talking about.<br /><br />This movie is full of flaws and displays a totally wrong picture of the Arabic/Muslim culture. Even the infrastructure of Bahrain is shown as old/poor with camels and stuff.<br /><br />Any person who ever has seen any of the gulf countries (some of the richest countries in the world) will see that the infrastructure is in much better shape and way more modern that in the US or western Europe...<br /><br />And no attention is given to the fact that the adult marine is actually having his love-affair with a minor, which is not romantic, but disgusting.<br /><br />This movie really just makes me wanna puke my guts out!<br /><br />Disgusting, simplistic and manipulative!
