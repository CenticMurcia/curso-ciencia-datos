Of all the crummy movies I've seen, this poor man's version of 'Brief Encounter' would have to be one of the worst. It's even worse than the Richard Burton/Sophia Loren version of 'Brief Encounter' and that was an abomination. Although 'Roses' was pretty to look at, it had no substance whatsover and the main characters - Ann Jillian and Lee Horsley - were an unconvincing pair of dills.
