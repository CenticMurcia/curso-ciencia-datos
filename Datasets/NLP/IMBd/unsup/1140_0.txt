Not the best work of Samuel L. Jackson. Eugene Levy couldn't act nervous if you put a gun to his head. That monotone whinny voice makes me cringe. He is a stiff actor. I don't know Samuel but I'm sure you didn't need the money. Crappy story, crappy acting, guy dies taking a crap. The should have paid me to watch it. <br /><br />Grade: C for crap<br /><br />Terrible movie.<br /><br />Why? Why? Why Sam?<br /><br />The best part of the movie was the end credits. I hope you come back with a good movie Sam. Eugene needs to stop appearing in every dumb ever made.
