Probably the most moving TV episode I have ever seen. Not only best NCIS, but the best episode of any series ever. This brought me to tears.<br /><br />The last 10 minutes of the show was the most compelling I have ever seen. The reconstruction of the the battle, was moving and showing the cost of human lives in war is one never to forget. The presents of old enemies faces each other, and then sharing a drink is the best ever.<br /><br />If you don't cry or feel proud of the men and women in the military you have no heart. <br /><br />My favorite part also is when the Medal of Honor is shown to the two Marines who snap to attention and salute.
