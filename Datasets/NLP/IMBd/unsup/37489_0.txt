I had hoped for much more. With the cast it should have been great. With the topic of the story (abortion) it should have been great. Instead it became a scene tearing, over done, over emotional, ultimately boring movie. Talk about waste, this is a good example. In addition, it was unrealistic, not believable, i.e: the most junior justice, only on the court 3 days, delivering one of the most important decisions in years. A dying man singing Danny Boy to change his friend's vote. I could go on. Fortunately, I dozed through parts of the movie so was spared the full disaster this movie represents.
