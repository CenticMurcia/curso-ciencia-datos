This is a long line of Hollywood Nazi propaganda bombs that are funded by the immensely wealthy Nazi party. Again, all we get are a pitiful excuse to kill as many brunette women as possible. It has become a joke, and would be funny if it weren't for the wackos who think that this makes a film a classic. That makes it dangerous. On the surface, it is about a Roswell type affair, searching for an alien cover up by the government (try to make sense out of that? No, you can't, since the military could ask for billions of dollars more in budget if they could show evidence of aliens, so we have the most ludicrous idea since those idiots who thought Leonardo da Vinci met Jesus Christ and knew his lineage.) But the propaganda, like most Nazi propaganda, is not even subtle. How any person can not see this is beyond comprehension.<br /><br />What is really horrible is that great scripts and ideas are shot down by producers and directors for crap like this.
