A rather inoffensive monster indulges his rock-collecting hobby after being partially revitalized by said rocks. Sadly, he fails to murder a small, shrill, annoying 30ish college sophomore and his larger, furrier, slightly less annoying roommate. In fact, the monster harms no one other than the hoods who murdered him and dumped his body into a lake, which he adopts as his home following his revivification by the greenish meteorites. This may have been the inspiration for most of the menaces on the "Smallville" TV series. The ending is remarkably incoherent, alternating between scenes of the monster holding the final meteorite fragment aloft and quick views of a descending roman candle ball which makes funny sounds. Finally, the police lieutenant shrugs and the movie is over.
