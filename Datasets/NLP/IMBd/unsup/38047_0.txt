This movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever. OK they went over the line with going against political correctness. I guess that was the reason for this film. Word of mouth brings in people that are against political correctness or something like that.Thus,they fill a niche and make guaranteed money. Capitalism, the Howard Stern way. Thats fine,but it was a lousy product. The film dared to be different. By being overly anti political correct, that is ultimately what killed this film. The politically incorrect humor was diluted after 10 minutes of this film. It was just forced. Thus the shock was not only not funny, but not shocking anymore. Artie Lang was atrocious and so was Ralph Macchio. I can understand why Mr. Macchio is not getting parts. This was a film that did not need to be made. Yes usual fare of heavyset,middle age loser , living with his mom somehow an item with a beautiful woman. Predictable movie, taking place in working class town in NJ. Caricatures, stereotypes,lame humor,hard liquor but no beer. This movie had it all and managed to make it NOT work. The plot , party animal, fraternity type of misfits trying to win a softball championship against an elite snobs team. They even managed a stereotype here, making this obnoxious mayoral candidate a cousin of one of our protagonists. There you have the plot. See this at your own peril.
