Sybil Danning is an extremely stunning sight to behold when she's wearing just a smile, sure, but there's only so much so can do when saddled with an abysmal script (and that's 90% of her career's work). There's no question that she makes unwatchable films watchable. This time around she plays Diane. a teacher who wants her husband's parents money, but that won't happen until his mom and aunt are either dead or declared incompetent (the latter is kinda like the makers of this film). Enter Private Lessons' Eric Brown as Jay, a college student who's more gullible than a fifth grader (if that) and plans to scare the old women, but there's a 'mystery' serial killer at work. As I said before Danning is the ONLY reason for someone to watch this (and even then only when it's on cable, as it's not worth renting). The character's lack any kind of spark, the plot is very weak, and for a thriller, it's not in the least bit thrilling. Also the powers that be seemed to openly want to sabotage the film as with the amount of chances to get Sybil fully nude, they go to great lengths to not show her fourth acting talent, her tits and ass being the first three, so you know where I'm going with that one. Stick with a better Sybil film such as Chained Heat or Malibu Express instead <br /><br />Eye Candy: Sybil Danning shows T&A multiple times, Suzanne Kennedy'shows her right breast briefly <br /><br />My Grade: D
