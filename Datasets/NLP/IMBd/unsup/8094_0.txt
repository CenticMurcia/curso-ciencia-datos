I just watched the video of this film (it wasn't released widely in theaters) and I think it was well worth seeing. I think if the distributors had marketed it for the people who enjoyed "Notting Hill" it could have done well in theaters.<br /><br />The basic plot is of three boyhood friends in London who all meet an American girl. Eventhough the outcome is fairly predictable, the plot takes several twists to arrive there.<br /><br />If you like romantic comedies, give this one a chance. You won't be disappointed.
