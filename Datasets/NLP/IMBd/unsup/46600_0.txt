It sounds like a nightmare - you should marry in next 24 hours or lose a mighty heritage. The problem might not be that big, but the best girl you know happens to be mad at you and she's moving to other country. You did propose to her but you did that in such a manner that you have to pay now a perhaps too high a price for it.<br /><br />The Bachelor himself seems to think "no big deal" and he takes it all that calmly that it's no surprise if you happen to forget his grand problem. On the other hand the supposed-to-be-Bride (Zellweger) doesn't fail and she's the best part in the whole film. Even if the film hardly appears as entirely interesting you may want to see the crowd of brides chasing hapless Bachelor down the streets, but hardly anything else here produces great moments, though it doesn't irritate much either.
