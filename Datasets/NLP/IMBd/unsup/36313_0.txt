Our friend Doctor Bones is an independent record producer and DJ. He is very suave and fancies being a Svengali to youthful bands... nay, a Svengali to the world! Yes, the world with his amazing mind control voodoo R 'n' B.<br /><br />Our heroes breeze their way through the audition even with some hanger-on moaning throughout. Then they drink half a bottle of wine between then out of picnic cups. They are an amazing band. The singer looks like an inept prostitute and they have a bassist but no bassline on their tunes.<br /><br />Other stuff happens... I can't be bothered. Doctor Bones is a nitwit and his plan is rubbish. The band are horrible and like every other character, deserve to die, luckily most of the cast do. Bones is quite good when he's perving up the girl.<br /><br />My favourite bits are the most telling. The running time is a weedy 72 minutes but in that they spend a good 10 auditioning no-hopers pointlessly until the Glowing Skull Stick of Doom red-eyes its approval. Also I like the 10 minutes tossed on a tour of the studio facilities.<br /><br />The ending is quite nice because it's just openly thrown away, the heroes get a Box of Evil and we don't even see them react to it, the credits simply roll.<br /><br />A horrible movie. It offends the ears too but not quite on the scale Bones intends. They namecheck Doctor Dre though, that counted as a highlight.
