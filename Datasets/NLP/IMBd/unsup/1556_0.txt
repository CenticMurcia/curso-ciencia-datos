His name is Albert Pyun and his movies are crap. The ideas for his movies sound cool in a B movie way, but they never deliver. Captain America, Cyborg, Mean Guns, Adrenalin, Brain Smasher, Dangerously Close, and Radioactive Dreams have all caused me pain more than any other director. I have not seen any Ed Wood movies, but I imagine that they will be similar. Radioactive Dreams is relentlessly annoying. If you thought that the word Focker was used too many times in Meet The Parents, wait until Marlowe repeats "we are slick dicks!" for the tenth time. I have always hated the use of period slang and this movie uses 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's slang in it's horde of cliched characters from four decades. Notice that movies that used a lot of slang that were made during these decades are now either unintentionally funny or unbelievably inferior. There was a hope in me during the movie that Michael Dudikoff would die a horrible death. He is honestly that annoying. John Stockwell appears to have no spine in both this and Dangerously Close. His voice is whinny. No matter what I say, you will see it if you want to, but I can not imagine an intelligent person that would consider this a good movie.
