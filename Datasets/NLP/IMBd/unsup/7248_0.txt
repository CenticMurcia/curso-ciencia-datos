By 1941, the boys - Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy - were getting "long in the tooth" and their films showed it. Sadly, they kept going for awhile after this movie.<br /><br />This film simply wasn't funny, and these guys were supposed to provide laughs. That is what I learned to expect from them, having watched a few of their 1930s efforts. That's why I purchased this on tape. However, I never found one thing to laugh in the first half of this film, got discouraged and brought the tape back to the video store.<br /><br />The physical slapstick is okay, not too bad but all the one-line jokes are horrible, just not funny, nor are a number of the skits. Neither are the "fat" jokes, which are overplayed. Those are at Ollie's expense and one might have been good once or twice, but you hear it throughout the movie. I did laugh early on as Stan was trying the mow the lawn with a pair of scissors, but there weren't enough crazy-funny scenes from that point to make this be a recommended film.
