Now for those people that have seen this movie, let's face it, this movie probably wouldn't strike a cord with people like E.T. or Starwars, but for an 80's flick, this movie's pretty damn good.<br /><br />If this movie was made with a higher budget, and with good computer FX. I would give it a 10/10. But it was not, needless to say that it was doing pretty go for it's time.<br /><br />I have seen movie's made around the same time as this movie, the plot sucked in them and the acting could have come from a small group of hillbillies hanging around the set for left over beers. Not that I am saying this movie acting perfect. Over all this acting is good exept for some spotty areas here and there. For those of you who are fond of 80's sci-fi flicks I highly recommend this movie.
