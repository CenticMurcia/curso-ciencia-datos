Cinderella III is by far the best Disney movie to be the final chapter in a trilogy. Most of the sequels and "final chapters" never have the chance to hold their own and try to be at least as good as the first, but this movie does it. We see the Stepmother turn more wicked than she was in the first film after she gets the wand. We see which step-sister is actually ugly and wicked. Anastasia's character really shines in this film. Though watching and dealing with Cinderella's newest problem, you also watch, laugh, and cry with Anastasia. You truly see what's in her heart and how she feels. I love the way she progresses and shows that though someone may come from a family of cold black hearts, that one person can still be warm and caring on the inside if given the chance. The Prince is given a new look on how sweet and kind he actually is and why he's "Prince Charming". The mice are lovable as always and almost even more and of course, Cinderella our Heroin... this movie deserves to be watched with an open mind. Yes, go and remember how the original story goes, but do not expect it to be as sugar coated, Cinderella III is for one that everyone will enjoy. When magic's involved... all bets are off.
