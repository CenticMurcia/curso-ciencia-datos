Hush is a real masterpiece. Three of the finest actors going around star in this and they all play their parts extremly well. Jessica Lange as Martha is the perfect women to play this character she had a good grip of it.<br /><br />Gweneth plays Helen brilliantly as that innocent but wise new wife. And Jonathen is good as the moddie coddled son.<br /><br />The location is a perfect 10 out of 10. I fell in love with Kilronin what a beautiful place. Hush builds and builds to a climax, The climax i must admit could be a little better, but maybe the director was thinking a like myself of a possible sequel.<br /><br />Jessica Lange full marks to you though a great role in a good film of the 90's where it may show what some mothers inlaws are actually like, no offence
