This poorly scripted short adds nothing positive to Roscoe Arbuckle's career. There are a few good moments, but the storyline is weak, and the direction uninspired. Arbuckle uses the same presentational style he employed more than a decade before, but without the inventive comedy of those years. The character of Windy Riley, an obnoxious buffoon who endlessly boasts, earns no sympathy. One of the few grace notes is Louise Brooks, who all-too-briefly gets to show off her smooth speaking voice and winning dance talent. But she is frustratingly underused and even her face is often hidden by poor blocking. It's too bad that fallen stars like Arbuckle who ended up at the lower-grade Educational Pictures didn't do--or weren't able to do--more with what they had left.
