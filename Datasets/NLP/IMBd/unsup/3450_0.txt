I rented this with a friend of mine and I must say that it is so so so sad that some stupid video distributor could possibly find this film decent enough to release. Or BAD ENOUGH! It doesn't even serve as camp value or a "so bad it's good" movie. Just an awful movie, the worst Ive ever seen!<br /><br />0 out of 10, 0 out of 10, 0 OUT OF 10!!!
