I can't believe I forced my friend to watch this film with me. I don't intentionally pick crappy movies. It's just that some actors I like are in crappy movies. I bought ATQM because Eddie Izzard is in it and I'm EI mad at the moment. I also bought The Avengers because he's in it but that's another tale of woe....<br /><br />In ATQM, Eddie plays a drag queen who has to teach a group of men to be women so they can steal an Enigma machine from a German factory where only women work. Eddie is the only one who looks comfortable in a dress. Although I don't think brown is his color. He gets to show off his legs and his German but it's not enough to lift this film off the bottom.<br /><br />There was one interesting thing, if you're a ST:TNG fan, David Birkin who played both the young Jean-Luc Picard in "Rascals" and Rene Picard in "Family" is in ATLQM as a code breaking, multi-lingual genius.
