I was really disappointed that this was rated on IMDb as high as it was. I decided to take a chance on it because of that...and it was a big disappointment. This is a waste of time and film! I could barely make it through it...and was only waiting for the appearance of Brittany Murphy who, delightful as she usually is, couldn't even come close to saving this film.
