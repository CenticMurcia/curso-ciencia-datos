Unfunny and shockingly unshocking, John Waters has done better. I watched the NC-17 version and really, despite a lot of sexual dialogue, it's hard to see it being deserving of that dreaded rating. Now Pink Flamingos, that was a deserving film! But that's another review altogether! The plot of A Dirty Shame is mostly pointless and drifts into the realm of absurdity, making whatever Waters was trying to say become worthless and forgettable. That all said, there were a few positive things; ugly Tracey Ullman was amusing as the lead and the gargantuan prosthetic boobies that Selma Blair wore were realistic and well made. WellÂ…they were.
