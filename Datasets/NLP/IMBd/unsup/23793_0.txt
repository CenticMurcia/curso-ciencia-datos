Three sisters, upon learning that their Grandfather that they never knew has recently died and left them a motel, decide to take a road trip with some friends to the property not knowing that some deviant lunatics are awaiting them there.<br /><br />Imagine "The Hills have Eyes" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre".
