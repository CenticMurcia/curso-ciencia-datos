This film is set in my hometown of Lake Havasu City, Arizona, home of the London Bridge. What I can tell you about this film is that you should only see it if you live in LHC and would like a big laugh. To see big stars (Rose Marie from the Dick Van Dyke Show and David Hasselhoff) in our little meccha is unreal, especially when you see that Rose Marie is the owner of the hotel at the edge of town. This film is one for the history books, and if you had the opportunity to see this film on NBC when it first aired, you would have probably seen the Apple Computer "1984" commercials a few times too. Ahh memories!
