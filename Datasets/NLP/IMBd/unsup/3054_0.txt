I've seen a LOT of movies in my time, and have even studied them as literature in university, but nothing could have prepared me for just how incredibly bad this piece of cinematic dreck was... and that's giving dreck a bad name! The rules dictate that I cannot give a lower score than 1, but trust me, if I could go lower, I would.<br /><br />My friend Tommy and I had just rented "Boyz 'N The Hood" and "Menace 2 Society" and found them absolutely stunning! We were shocked, and in a good way. So we figured "Juice" would be equally as intense. Nope. We never made it through the first 20 minutes before we had to shut it off. We couldn't understand HALF of what the characters were saying; maybe we'd have been better off if we knew some gansta rap slang, because the conversations made absolutely no sense to us. I mean, we started to wonder if maybe this movie should've been made with subtitles.<br /><br />And if that weren't bad enough, on a purely professional level, "Juice" looks like it was shot by amateurs! I mean seriously, just how real are we supposed to take this movie when in one scene (set in a diner, if I recall correctly), the boom mic dips into the picture frame, not once, but twice! Or was it three times? And who was operating it, anyway? It only picked up one half of a conversation between two characters in a booth... and they were sitting right next to each other! We heard one guy just fine; the other sounded like he was mumbling. This was the point when Tommy and I were laughing at it so hard, we shut the movie off, and immediately drove back to the video store to see about getting a refund.<br /><br />If you know ANYTHING at all about film, then STAY AWAY from "Juice"! I'm far from being an expert, but I know enough to state that in my opinion, "Juice" is nothing short of putrid.
