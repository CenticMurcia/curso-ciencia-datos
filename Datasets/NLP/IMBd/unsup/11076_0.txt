Well, let me just get this out of the way -- I sure as hell hope I can look half as great at "40-something" as Susan does in this film! I actually tuned in because of James Spader... having just seen him in "Secretary" renewed my curiosity. I thought it was a very good movie, a classic example of money and a big house (and the "perfect" wife) not always bringing happiness. Mostly a feel good but definitely not just fluff -- wondered if I would find those two believable as a couple and ended up thinking they were a great match... Enjoy!
