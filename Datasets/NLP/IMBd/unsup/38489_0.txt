This movie has basically nothing to recommend it.<br /><br />The writers bear the heaviest burden for this dog. I'm generally a fan of Tim Curry, Darryl Hannah, and both the Movie and TV(original) "Addams Family "shows. This movie was an embarrassment to anything related to the "Addams Family"<br /><br />Tim Curry appears to have been pressed into a bad Raul Julia impersonation, rather than allowed to find his own style, Darryl Hannah and and the rest just don't seem to have been given anything to work with.<br /><br />And neither have you, the viewer. This movie reeks, but if you're reading this, you've probably already found that out to your sorrow.
