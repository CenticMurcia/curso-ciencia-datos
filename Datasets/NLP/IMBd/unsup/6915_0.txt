So, after the film's subject drones for hours about various women's issues, I'm supposed to take her seriously as a woman of substance and a feminist. Give me a break. <br /><br />What kind of feminist:<br /><br />1. Gets involved in bad relationship after bad relationship without recognizing her own self-destructive behavior and poor choice in partners? 2. Has an affair with another woman's husband and (apparently) feels no remorse for destroying a marriage? 3. I may not have heard this correctly, so my apologies if I misunderstood, but did I hear her say she'd had multiple abortions? I'm pro-choice, but abortion isn't birth control, lady. If you want women to achieve true sexual liberation, you best start behaving like a woman worthy of it. <br /><br />In my mind, Jennifer Fox is not a woman to admire and this film is nothing but a vehicle for her own neurosis and narcissism.<br /><br />As a husband and father of two daughters, I shudder at the idea of women looking at Ms. Fox as a role model.
