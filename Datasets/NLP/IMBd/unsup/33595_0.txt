Is there enough budget to release a DVD???? I'm sure many out here want to have a copy. I'm writing this comment because I've been looking on the internet for over a year to find if there has been a home video release. Just think how many people want to see this film and there evidently has been no progress that I have seen to indicate that there is any production in the works to release a home video. This is about all I can say on the subject. I have long admired Ms McPherson as a spiritual leader and dynamic personality. I've heard recorded sermons and viewed most all other video material that relates to her story. Maybe a grant from SAG should be considered to have this important film available to the general public.
