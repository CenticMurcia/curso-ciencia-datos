When I first heard that my local movie theater was going to be playing a movie called "Shrooms." I laughed simply at the name and concept of it. A drug-induced horror flick? Reading the poster tag line, the first few movies I thought about were "The Tripper" and "Idle Hands," both had a comedic edge to it.<br /><br />I decided that I would give it a go. After work was finished, I slipped in to watch it as we gave the print a run through.<br /><br />It appeared to me at first to be a fairly basic horror flick. You have the classic group of teens setting out into the woods alone, you have the suspicious characters who seem to lurk on the outside of this group, and you have the stranded complex which ties their permanency to the unfamiliar setting. Trite, but hey, a lot of classics seem to fare well with these aspects.<br /><br />First, off there are some pros to the film, though they are only very slight. The side characters and presences were fairly convincing in making me believe that there was some malevolent murderer outside of the teenage group. Even when I had considered my verdict, these factors were almost enough to make me think otherwise. (Note, almost).<br /><br />The cons of this film are as follows: As I watched the characters get picked off one by one. I was positively sure as to who was committing the murders by the second to third dead victim. (To my misfortune, I was correct.) I was able to come to this conclusion because of the repetitive mechanics that befell every incident relentlessly. First, the main character would have a vision of who would die. Within the next five minutes or so, that person would die. Soon after, perhaps another five minutes or so, the main character would find her friend dead. To what I can recall, this pattern occurred with every single character. The main character's visions were never inaccurate to what would happen, nor were they ever vague, so when the given character would die, you had already seen it happen. When the hallucinations would occur later in the film, you could begin to suspect what was going to happen, and chances are that you're left with no sense of shock. Overall, It was a very boring prospect.
