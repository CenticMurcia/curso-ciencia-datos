This is a film built entirely for fans of Shakespeare. If you want a truly cinematic version, try the Brando version. This version is as true to Shakespeare as any film I have seen. John Gielgud in his second Julius Caesar film role, this time as Caesar himself, is studied and brilliant. Brutus plays off of Antony well as the weaker of the generals. Surprisingly, Heston plays a brilliant Antony, strong and resilient, as Antony should be played, and showing a serious command of the language and supernatural world of Shakespeare's Caesar. I recommend this film for any true reader or scholar of Shakespeare as the definitive Julius Caesar film adaptation. If you want Hollywood-type entertainment, go for the earlier but flashier Brando version.
