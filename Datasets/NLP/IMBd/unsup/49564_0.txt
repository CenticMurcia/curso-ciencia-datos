This is supposed to be sort of a true story. Shelley Winters stars as Ma Barker who, with her perverted, animalistic and sadistic sons, goes around the country robbing, raping and killing. There is decent acting in the flick, but only by a very young Robert DeNiro. Shelley Winters never was much as an actress. Bruce Dern is pretty decent in his role as well, but he seems to excel in bizarre character roles. There is plenty of totally senseless violence, and these people are depicted as just totally evil. At no point in the film can you feel anything resembling pity for this bunch. All in all, this is a poorly made low budget film and pretty much not worth your time. I gave it 2 out of 10 since they throw out votes of 1.
