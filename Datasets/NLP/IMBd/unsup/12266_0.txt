I do not know about the stereotypes, who believed what and when, if anyone were really the way depicted, etc. This was a warm interpretation of old, familiar Old Testament stories backed by a joyful choir. Rex Ingram was a great actor, and he was inspiring in each of his roles in this film. To the role of God, one challenging to any mortal actor, he brought a sense of immense love and transformation brought on by that love. The image of him putting his arm around an aged and exhausted Moses as the Israelites hit Jericho without their leader was one of compassionate friendship. This is what we're told God felt for Moses.<br /><br />Hey, 10-cent cigars in Heaven! There is so much in this about what Heaven might have meant to people in a different time, a different condition. And to us. Volumes were spoken of the Archangel Gabriel, after the Lord had done his work: "Dy'a want a cigar, Lawd?" I agree with the other reviewers who say that this film is a priceless joy.
