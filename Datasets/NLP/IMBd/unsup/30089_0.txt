This is another great show from WWE! It is 2 hours of non stop entertainment. This show was created in 1999 to compete with TBS' then wrestling show WCW Thunder! WWE (Then known as WWF) quickly whooped WCW in the ratings for Thursday Nights, forcing WCW to move their show to Wednesdays. Ray Mysterio, King Booker, And The one 7'2 guy all rule. This show has had wrestlers start out here and eventually get traded to Raw. Stars that have gone through this include: John Cena, Randy Orton, and Torrie Wilson to name a few. This is one show I was almost always look forward to watching every Friday Night. Hopefully This show, along with Monday Night Raw will be around for years to come. So if you want a good show to watch on Fridays, ya'll better watch this.
