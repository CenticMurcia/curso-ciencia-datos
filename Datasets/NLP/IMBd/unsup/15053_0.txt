I'd only seen Craig on A River Runs Through it. Where he was under care from a master.<br /><br />But in this movie.... he's alone. This is where what little talent is shown to be nil.<br /><br />(Spoilers)<br /><br />In truth.. I bought this dvd for $4 and because it's a movie Sandra would rather forget. I can see why. Although it lacks full nudity... it show's enough for us to imagine the rest. <br /><br />It also shows that Sandra can act (unlike one of her peers Julia Roberts).<br /><br />And she does act when she wants to. Craig... he can't act. That and his character is asking for a fight.<br /><br />This movie has such horrible writing. It's probably a good thing that this is a basic student film. Most of the Corman films are. They help beginning filmakers create their first films. <br /><br />These idiots have no chemistry together. No chemistry and they have to drug the two of them just to get them to bed.<br /><br />And this movie is way too short. If they coulda gotten rid of Craig. Things might have been better. Then there was the stupid killing of Sandra. It woulda been worth our while for the two of them to escape off in the plane. Bleh. Thank god the dvd was $4. They were having a sale on Corman films. To bad they didn't have any of Krista Allens Emmanuelle films. :(<br /><br />3/10<br /><br />Quality: 0/10 Entertainment: 5/10 Replayable: 1/10
