I don't know why I keep trying these movies at the video store. The cover and story are intriguing, and I am irrevocably drawn to it in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, this one will be different than the mountains of B schlock that I've seen in the past. But alas, it just never happens.<br /><br />This is one more on the pile of practically worthless movies I've seen that have a great idea, but extremely poor execution. I am a horror fan, and love the premise of ghosts, haunted towns, and other supernatural elements in a movie when handled well. <br /><br />The acting from the first frame was unconvincing and amateur, and proceeded throughout. Suspense was typically minimal and most of the "horror" moments were handled very sloppily. I will never grasp how such crap can manage to get funded. The producer(s) must take out a second mortgage or something else dire, and then roll the dice and hope that enough schmucks will shell out their hard earned cash to gobble up their vile stew. Hey, Blair Witch sucked and it made money, right? <br /><br />I must digress a moment and say that there were a few decent scare moments here and there, maybe one good gore bit to keep it from being a complete waste of one and a half hours of my life. It was also interesting to see a host of a show I enjoy called "Cities of the Underworld" on the History Channel have a bit part here. <br /><br />But these fleeting moments do not make the experience worthwhile. If you must submit yourself to this "film," and I use the term loosely, then get it for $0.50 at Family Video. Or just forget it and look for something that's bound to be better.
