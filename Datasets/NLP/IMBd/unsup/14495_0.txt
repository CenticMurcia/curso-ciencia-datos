but he sure has a bad taste of humor, then. He so to see was the only one (and hopefully will always be the only one) that gave this film a 10. This must've been after numerous bottles of vodka, because I don't see how you ever can earnestly even give attention to this product. For my part, I only do it in an attempt to prevent people from spoiling their temper and wasting their time. This is by far the worst movie I ever saw, and even the predicate 'movie' gives it too much credit. Believe me: if you hate yourself, are in a really sick mood or seek for some stimuli to throw up (for instance after a wild party) - go see this film. If one or all of these reasons are absent: stay cheerfully away from this aberration.
