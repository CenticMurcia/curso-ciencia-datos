If you want to see a film where Chevy and Goldie are really on top of their game, this is the one!<br /><br />"Seems Like Old Times" couldn't miss, really - here is a script by Neil Simon, a solid comedy cast (Gould as the befuddled judge is a stand-out) and a completely engaging feel for what comedic timing is. There are no slow spots, flat jokes or flopped sight gags anywhere throughout and what can one say about Grodin? He's great, the modern day "stone-face" scores yet again!<br /><br />The lines are endlessly quotable and some are downright classic. My favorite has to be where Goldie has to do some quick thinking to explain to the cops why bank robber/ex-husband Chevy is in the back of her car. When the cops ask her driver (Carter) if he'd seen any of what happened - "No, I came late."<br /><br />To tell anything else would be spoiler enough. This is a film that has to be experienced first-hand to be truly enjoyed. And if you like sight gags, one-liners and either Goldie Hawn, Chevy Chase or Charles Grodin, look no further for your favorite movie.<br /><br />Watch "Seems Like Old Times" - you'll have a GREAT time.<br /><br />Ten stars and a handful of Zagnut bars for this one. And remember - it's never a good idea in court to have a St. Bernard dribble on your briefs.
