In "Presumed Innocent",Harrison Ford plays deputy prosecutor Rusty Sabich,who has been assigned to investigate the murder of a colleague.the hitch is,he had been sleeping with.he digs a bit deeper into the case than someone wants him to and finds himself charged with her murder.i had had the chance to watch this movie several times over the years and never got around to it.finally,i sat down to watch it.i was not impressed.the movie plods along much too slowly.it is not riveting or even compelling but i suck with it.i will give points for the ending though.it is something i did not expect and would have been pretty decent except they dragged it out long.Harrison Ford was convincing in a dramatic role.Bonnie Bedelia was good as the wife,and Raul Julia was very good as Sabich's defence attorney.as for the movie on a whole,it was disappointing. i wish i could give this movie a better rating,but the best i can do is 4/10
