This title doesn't bother to come up with its own ideas, it just steals them all from one of the best horror movies of all time and adds a bit more sex. Most movies take ideas from other films, but not 3/4 of a superior film to which they will be compared unfavourably.<br /><br />Acting and special effects are as to be expected of a low budget production, but while those can be forgiven, the lack of any originality can't. I'm sorry there was one original idea but it was so laughable it barely counts. A blind exorcist in sunglasses that make him look more like a biker than a priest. "Yeah I'm a bad ass priest, not like those other little pussy priests who couldn't drive a demon out of a wet paper bag."
