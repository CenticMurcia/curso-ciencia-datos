Saawariya is not such a astonishing well-made picture.it is just because i've seen Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas,Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam,Khamoshi & Black.between all Saawariya is my least favorite.any of those films are memorable.not just for it is so artistic,but the myth inside of em gave me pleasure.now it comes to Saawariya,which is a dramatic/Romance part of a tail.it's an adaptation from The White Nights.it is not a good adaptation.just for it low potential for turning a Russian story to a musical movie of Indian cinema industry.<br /><br />Masha Allah everyone has done his best to make a longtime,full of art and hesitating movie.reputation says that it is the third film of S.L.B with Salman Khan.but this time Salman is Details.and Ranbir Kapoor is the topic. playing a lover in Indian films is so ancient.Ranbir is Raj Kapoor's grandson.but he doesn't do a good performance like a lover.technically it would be a flop for S.L.B with this picture.Rani as Gulabji is wasted.she cant hit like Black.but she has a good song to show how much glorious she is. Sonam Kapoor is the same useless walking in the scene like Salman.but let me tell you that the Art Direction is very good. i love its songs,they are very qualified.they are very great. what more?Deko Chanda ayah,Chanda nazar Ayaa,too Bi ajaa...
