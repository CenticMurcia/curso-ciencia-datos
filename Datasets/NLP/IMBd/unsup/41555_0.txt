I thought that Adrian Paul could improve his chances at the movies since he did a superb job of acting in the Highlander Series, unfortunately I was wrong. I do mean wrong. This movie is the worst thing I've seen since I watched Barney. I couldn't find a single thing to like about it. The plot could've been written better by a child of six years. The entire movie screamed for help. The amount of real dialogue could've been crammed into the first five minutes, anything else said was either cursing of strange things questions on the part of Paul's character. The only good scene in the entire film is the shot of the woman and her daughter laying dead in the snow, for a moment you get a glimpse of an actual movie. Of course it's the scene where everyone is quiet and no one is moving, and Adrian Paul's doing voice overs. I couldn't even stomach thirty minutes of the film with out feeling as if I could cry. It's a shame anyone was allowed to make such a movie. Please do not watch this. Of course I am mostly complaining about Adrian's shift to bad acting, we want more Highlander, but no more movies like Breed.
