This is a movie that you will stop and watch every time it shows on TV: IF you have a true romantic spirit and love an outdoor action movie.<br /><br />The first sentence says it all, but let me say that the actors are well matched and the chemistry is great. I recently spent some time in Western Vancouver Island and was struck by the scenery and immediately thought of this movie and the beautiful backdrop in every scene. It is truly a beautiful movie.<br /><br />I am not a movie critic and as you probably can tell, this is my first, impromptu attempt to recommend a movie. It is a story about an itinerate cowboy and a secret that he stumbles across while tracking some runaway convicts. The story line has many facets that unfold as the cowboy becomes entangled in the secret that he uncovers.
