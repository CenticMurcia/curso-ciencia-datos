While Expendableman covered most of the salient aspects of this fine bit of cinematography he missed one item. The vehicle is not a Land Rover it is a Jeep Cherokee. Expendableman covered the aspects of the movie which require you to suspend your rational mind or at least douse it with alcohol. However, that a Jeep could be beat up by a mutant genius bear bent on revenge, rolled down a hill and still drive for miles is absolutely believable. Please feel free to drop by the North American XJ Association (NAXJA) web site to discuss the finer aspects of this fine vehicle. Oh, and, in spite of the name, we welcome participation from wherever Jeep Cherokees are in use around the world.
