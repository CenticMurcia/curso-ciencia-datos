A standout at the 2008 Daytona Beach Film Festival, ''The Flyboys'' deserves to be seen. <br /><br />Here's the review from Film Critic Jeff Farance:<br /><br />''The Flyboys'' 5 (of 5 stars)<br /><br />This is the sort of discovery that film festivals live for. As do festival audiences.<br /><br />To say it's a family film is to take nothing away from its maturity, its urgency and its adventure as two boys with a love of all things airborne become entwined in a mob plot to rip off a casino's cash haul by crashing the plane carrying it and its guards.<br /><br />A sprinkling of familiar faces (Stephen Baldwin, Tom Sizemore, Robert Costanzo) accent the fine performances by stars Jesse James and Reiley McClendon.<br /><br />But what's amazing is the total professionalism, including some palm-sweat-inducing aerial acrobatics and ground chase scenes, along with outstanding special effects. ''The Flyboys'' simply soars, and takes its audience along into the clouds for a breathtaking ride.
