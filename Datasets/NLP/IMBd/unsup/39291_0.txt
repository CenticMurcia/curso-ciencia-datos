Okay, so I'm a big movie buff & I just HAD to say I've seen this movie at least ONCE! Unfortunately, once was certainly more than enough.<br /><br />Really bad movie here with not even enough 'kitsch' or 'camp' to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />While the movie is certainly presented tongue in cheek, it still relies to heavily on the idea that Mae West at 85 is somehow still a desirable sexy vamp.<br /><br />Sorry but it just don't wash! Adding insult to injury is the fact that again, at 85, Mae West delivers all her lines in basically the same delivery: basically a parody of her earlier self.<br /><br />So in many respects the movie comes off as rather gruesome.<br /><br />If it had gone more over the top, PERHAPS it might have at least achieved some sort of John Waters sensibility.<br /><br />As it is, it plays like one long boring Love Boat episode.<br /><br />Really there is nothing in this movie that merits anyone wasting their time in viewing it.<br /><br />So viewers beware, unless you're some crazy movie fan, who feels the need to cross a movie off his 'never seen list' (like me!!!) than do yourself a favor and skip it.<br /><br />Instead watch Ms. West's films from the 30s. They're actually not all that bad.<br /><br />Don't say you haven't been warned!
