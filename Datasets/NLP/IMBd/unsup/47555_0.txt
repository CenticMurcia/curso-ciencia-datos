Intertwining stories cover a group of characters, many of them gay, in Los Angeles. The characters are uninteresting and the script is a dreary bore. Kudrow is a limited actress who lacks the star presence to carry a film. The rest of the acting is not bad, with Arnold surprisingly effective as a rich man with a gay son. Roos wrote and directed but shows little aptitude for either task. The plot lines are ludicrous, especially the one about a gay couple and a lesbian couple arguing about whether the latter used the former's sperm. Most annoyingly, the screen is sporadically split in half and some random, trivial information is displayed about the characters.
