Perverse, the movie was perverse with the strange "exotic" nasty clothes they wore, the lesbian kiss? WTF!? In ancient Greece?<br /><br />Incorrect: Wikipedia quote: "at nine-year intervals, seven Athenian boys and seven Athenian girls were to be sent to Crete to be devoured by the Minotaur" The movie states 8 "youngsters" every third year. How come the village has been raided 5 times already, and the movie states: northern territory, foolish plot! Marriage between sister and brother is a ancient Egyptian tradition. Sub Saharan African actors as Minoans? WTF? How stupid can you be? Whats next? Far East Asian Vikings? North American natives as Samurais? Eskimos acting Zulu warriors? Caucasians in Apocalypto 2? Hey Mel lets make all the natives blond and blue eyed, thats the REAL story! The Minotaur is supposed to be a man with a head tail of a bull (sometimes with the hooves/hid legs of one as well). And what is that creature supposed to be a minotaur? A gigantic rat with horns and hooves? Just looks stupid.<br /><br />Stupid: All the running around the maze screaming each others names and the monster actually being able to sneak up to them with all its noisy breathing and running. Sniffing "gas" out of a goat skull, some kind of joke? What kind of helmets do they have? Haha, looks like something they robbed from Sauron in LOTR.<br /><br />Horrible, stupid movie, I believe it's one of the worst I've ever seen. I give it 2/10 because it had quite nice looking actresses.<br /><br />It's not hard to make a good movie out of a myth, how can you rape it so bad? This is not good, nor to learn history nor myth, as someone wrote.
