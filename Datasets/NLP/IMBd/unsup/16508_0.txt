Tobe Hooper, a well-known director of one of the greatest horrors ever made - "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", came back to his roots and shot good, low-budget slasher. I must admit that "Toolbox Murders" has a generic plot. However, one cannot deny that the idea of somebody prowling in an old, neglected apartment without certain rooms seems scary. Unfortunately characters' behavior is illogical and improbable, which is a frequent sin of this kind of flick. I also regret that the murderer becomes so similar to his predecessors at the end. (trying to avoid spoiler here) On the other side, the film has numerous virtues which, to my mind, fully compensate derivativeness of screenplay. First of all, the story develops very well and in the course of time characters gained my sympathy. Secondly, as the plot develops awe-inspiring, gory scenes, which should satisfy every horror fan, occurs. I liked that the director plays with viewer's expectations, as horrifying scenes with the usage of various tools happen unexpectedly. What's more, Angela Bettis is outstanding as the main heroine. To conclude, this flick surpasses most of horror films produced nowadays.
