This film is presented as professionally as any block busters out of Hollywood. For being a short film it will keep you thinking about the subject and message for days after watching.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who has ever agreed with the opinion of a "Womans Choice"! This film will provoke you to reconsider.<br /><br />Even though most of the actors have only been in a few films, you will wonder why they have not been cast more often.<br /><br />If you watch this film and are not challenged by its thought provoking message, you need to watch it again because you did not pay attention the first time.
