The Only question that came to my mind after watching this film was - Wowwwwwwwwwwww how can someone make such an awful film and still get 9.5 rating in IMDb??????? I mean there are bad movies and then there are bad movies, this one beats them all to the pole. A half developed storyline, bad action, even worse acting and some very confused concepts eg- the ministry of offense, CORE(is it a paramilitary organization or govt) etc etc...... this in all sums up the whole movie.<br /><br />But credit must go to the producer for his willingness to produce such a bad movie and provide so many bad actors with employment.<br /><br />All in all don't ever never watch this movie.....i got the DVD from a friend of mine (who wanted to take revenge on me....for burning his steak)
