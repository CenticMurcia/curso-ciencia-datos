This poorly made documentary tries to convince people that CIA somehow planned 9/11, because they wanted a war on terror. At first it sounds like a fantastic plan for a fictional movie, but people actually believes in it - almost like a religion.<br /><br />Since its release, all the facts have been disputed, and even the creators of this "documentary" admits that it is full of flaws. But they don't care if they have evidence of their claims or not, as long as USA is responsible for 9/11, then they are happy. <br /><br />But why don't any of these conspiracy theorists think for just 1 minute? If the CIA planned 9/11, to make the war on terror, then the Arabs must have been patsies. But then why was the Arabs from Saudi Arabia???? If the CIA and American Government is so powerful as the Conspiracy Theorists claim, then they made the Arabs come to America to be in the Planes. But then why from Saudi Arabia, if USA after-wards waged war against Afghanistan and Iraq?? If the CIA was so powerful as the conspiracy theorists claim, then they would made Iraqies and Afghans go into those planes, because then they would have a greater argument to attack the Arab-countries in the so-called war on terror, especially Iraq.<br /><br />The problem is that it is not a concern of the conspiracy theorists. Because it is religion to them. They WANT the Americans to be responsible for every major event in history. They want to see CIA pulling the strings. <br /><br />The typical Conspiracy theorists, when working on a conspiracy theory, starts with the conclusion, and then works from there, choosing the evidence that can fit the theory and discarding and ignoring all facts and evidence that contradicts the overall theory.<br /><br />Also all the facts of this film have been debunked: www.911myths.com<br /><br />The worst part of the film is when Dylan Avery claims that the families of the victims of United 93 didn't talk to the passengers on the plane. No, Avery claims that they talked to CIA-agents, who used voice-reconstruction-technology, to make it seem that there where a struggle on the plane. The technology in question is just a new technology, that CANT be used live, it has to be used on a recording, and even then it is not 100 % accurate. Also different people have different way of speaking, not only accents and voice, but also how they react, humor, way of talking and so on, which technology cant imitate. Also if they copied their voices, then they must have had all these many passengers, all of them mind you, under surveillance for months. And also many of the people that where on the plane didn't even decide to board the plane until few days before. You conspiracy theorists aren't using your mind.<br /><br />And then think of how complex this plan is: monitoring hundreds of people, making sure that none of the thousands of pilots, airport-personal, CIA, NSA, FBI, Policemen, firemen and citizens didn't talk. Making sure this voice-reconstruction-technology worked. Killing all the people on United 93, by many military-men, who had no moral problems with it. Don't you get it? If just one of these factors didn't work, then the whole operation fell?? And people would know the truth. Which heavily implies that there WAS NO CONSPIRACY.
