Let's give it its due. There is some nice amateur cinematography here. The story is interesting and much better than many horror stories. Unfortunately, the actors (who probably aren't actors) mumble their lines. There is little give and take or timing. There are a lot of street elements thrown in because I suspect the filmmakers know some of these people. Things unfold sort of slowly. Still, I was somewhat captured by the thing. I disagree that anyone with a camera could make this film. It's far from even a good film but I think the movie shows talent behind the camera. That's worth something. There are a few good isolated scenes as well.
