Story: In a world of relativism where anything goes and values are becoming personalized, this movie gave me a truly fresh outlook on old Christian and Buddhist values. In this movie, I saw the basic principals of goodness and value, which we all were taught as children, become relevant in the "real world" of that era-and most definitely more relevant today. Principals like "Do to others as you would have them do to you," "Turn the other cheek," "There is no greater love than to lay down your life for a friend." I walked away from this movie changed, and excited to know that I had just seen a standard set for society today.<br /><br />Technical: The first time I realized that this was a low budget film was after I had watched it and heard the news from someone else. It didn't give away that secret during viewing. There were some problems with lighting and a really cheesy wheelchair. The music was a mix of Celtic and Far East, and I enjoyed it. I also liked how they chose to portray violence; they weren't graphic about it, but it wasn't whitewashed. There were also some new styles of filming which I found to be quite interesting. But, you'll have to see for yourself :)<br /><br />Overall a great movie.
