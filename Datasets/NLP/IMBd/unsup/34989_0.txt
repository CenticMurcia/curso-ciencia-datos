Much like a lot of comedies recently, Balls of Fury does a good job of appealing to the 13 and under crowd. People looking for a comedy that's smart and keeps the laughs coming should avoid this film. Reading a plot synopsis of this film, it certainly sounds promising, but experience it first hand and you can really get an idea of how it can't deliver. Dan Fogler is about as unbelievable as they come. The filmmakers seem like they want his character to be a bit over the top, but he seems like a mix between Jack Black and Chris Farley and he fails miserably. Christopher Walken is hilarious, but with the script as weak as it is, a lot of his potential humor is lost. George Lopez has his funny moments and he could have had more if the film would have played up his desire to be a James Bond-like hero. Diedrich Bader steals the show as a male sex slave with some affection for pandas, but this isn't saying much as he's only in the film for all of 5 minutes.<br /><br />All in all, Balls of Fury should be avoided. What could have potentially been a send up of an obscure sport (ie Blads of Glory), turns out to be an uninspired waste of time and money. For good humor that can really be enjoyed, check out Superbad. I hated that movie too, but it is leaps and bounds above Balls of Fury.
