While I really liked both plot and storyline, the satire mixed with random acts of violence makes it almost sort of dirty watching it and makes you sort of say, "actually that was sort of funny". Any which way though, I gave this movie a favorable rating. Someday we'll see in lights: George Orwell, Kurt Vonnegut, and whatever twisted writer wrote this movie, cause it was pretty good.
