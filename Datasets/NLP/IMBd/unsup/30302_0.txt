Yes, this movie was a flop, but who ever judged a movie by how the box office does. A lot of dreck does good. A lot of gems die. This is one of them.<br /><br />This is a movie about friendship. Two needy people find each other. They're very different, but together, they become better and stronger people. There is deep friendship, but whether there is a sexual element, I'll leave to you. Neither girl is shown to have a sexual focus, either to males or females.<br /><br />Robin Johnson, who deserves all the fine line written about her, is great, but Trini Alvarado is also good. She has to be the lesser role, but she is no less important. Pity Robin Johnson could never make it big, but if she's reading this, I hope you're happy, and you've made a mark, which most actors never do. I heard you on the DVD.<br /><br />I wish the two could have stayed together. Remember, alternative endings are not just for DVDs. Think one up yourself.
