When I first turned on the movie I though it was gonna be horrible,and not to my surprise it was horrible. I also thought the movie was unrealistic come on who would let a dog play basketball even if the dog could. I think it would be cheating cause how are you gonna get the ball from the dog.<br /><br />They had Michceal Jeter playing the clown a homosexual to make the movie even worse. The acting was horrible the plot was lame this is an all around corny movie. I remember in 1997 when it came out I didn't watch it now ten years later I disgusted with the movie. I also fond out the star of the movie was born on my birthday.
