Adrienne and Jack meet, fall in love, marry, have a child, and live in a wonderful New York apartment. Then Jack is killed in a car crash. Slowly, things start to unravel for Adrienne in "Deceived," a 1991 film starring Goldie Hawn and John Heard.<br /><br />This is a highly derivative movie concerning fake museum pieces, fake identity, and a double life, but it manages to be exciting and occasionally scary. As other people have commented, there are plot holes aplenty. Hawn and Heard are both marvelous in their roles, Hawn for a change in a serious part. She shows she's as talented a "straight" actress as she is a comedienne. The final big scene will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the climax of it is a knockout. This could have been one of the great movies if the script had been tighter because it is very well directed and performed with some excellent camera work and great music.<br /><br />Despite script holes, I still found it entertaining. I wouldn't have minded paying good money to see it in the theater, and it makes a riveting rental.
