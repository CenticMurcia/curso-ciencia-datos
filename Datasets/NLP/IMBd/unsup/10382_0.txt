It makes you think what do you care more about, is national security really important if it costs us our personal freedom. This is why we left England people! This is why America is such a great country, everyone is individually represented. This constitution was designed to protect everyone as an individual, not to protect the society. It's in the bill of rights and the constitution, their really shouldn't be this much argument about it. Republicans, and claimed "patriots" ideas are violating the constitution much more than said "radical" liberals do, we fight for the people, which is what this country is based on in the first place. Anyway, watch it if its on, think about this as you watch it, and the next time you vote.
