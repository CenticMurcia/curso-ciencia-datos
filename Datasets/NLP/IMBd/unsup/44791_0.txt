Wow, right from the start this movie is a real downer, not exactly an uplifting film! This is really depressing.<br /><br />William Hurt, Robert Duvall, Raul Julia, Sandrine Bonnaire and Jean-Marc Barr star in a film dealing with a plague that is infecting a South American city. It sounds interesting, which is why I rented it, along with the great cast.<br /><br />However, I found this very disappointing, not only because it was so depressing but it's too talky, the photography disappointed me and I think it tries to be a lot "smarter" than it comes across. I can't see a lot of people enjoying this film. Half the cast members don't seem to be into this story, either, especially Duvall who usually gives great performances. <br /><br />A friend of mine suggested I read the book and forget the movie. I should have taken her advice. At least the author was famous.
