A total quasi plagiarist Rip-off of there is something about Mary. Once again the rich and privileged of Australia use fraudulently obtained tax payer funded government grants to make a mediocre film with louse monotone emotionless acting.<br /><br />How Americans can be impressed with the constant flow of rubbish from this oligarchy totally astounds me. <br /><br />Whilst there are many Talented Australian Actors and film Auteur's they never make it into the mainstream which has been hijacked by the rich. <br /><br />Obviously the American Film Industry has been totally conned into believing our mainstream people have talent which explains the constant stream of ever worsening quality of films these days.
