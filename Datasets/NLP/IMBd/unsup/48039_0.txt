***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** Maybe some spoilers, but it really doesn't matter...<br /><br />Wow. When you look at the cover of this film, and see that it's a London crime film.... you kind of get high hopes for this movie. Make no mistake, this is really REALLY bad. I've never submitted a comment on a movie before, but I HAD to for this one.... that must say something. First of all, the actors in this movie make the actors in soap operas and pornos look like Oscar winners. The acting is that bad. There isn't one believable, entertaining, interesting character in this thing. Well, the one "tough guy" of the four goons (the short bald one) was mildly entertaining, but he got killed off pretty quickly.... darn. I also read that there were some great "one-liners" in this movie, but I didn't hear any. There's a really lame twist at the end.... big surprise. Oh, it's also a lot of fun when you can see the dead bodies breathing (I haven't seen that blunder in film in quite some time). The whole thing is just really sloppy and uninteresting. It could probably be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I guess it has some decent violence and gunplay in it, but even it is rediculous and unrealistic, with very poor effects (big flashes of light when someone gets shot from point blank range). It also looks like none of these people have ever fired or held a gun before, for that matter. Rent it if you must, but this movie is pretty much just a waste of time.
