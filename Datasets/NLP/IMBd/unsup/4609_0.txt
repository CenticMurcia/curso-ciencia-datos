The way they portrayed this movie was absolutely exceptional. It was well filmed and well pieced together. In some ways it almost represented a documentary in the filming of discussions in class. Danielle Panabaker played the part of Jacey well. I could believe she was really the character she portrayed. The other characters were well written, but I saw a depth of understanding in Danielle that I didn't see in the rest, although they did a marvelous job as well. For once it wasn't a film of being pregnant, it portrayed what came next and I think that was a smart move. It was something new and different. The emotions running from this film, gave characters that people could relate too.
