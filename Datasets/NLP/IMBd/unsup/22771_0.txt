My aunt made a really funny comment when we watched this movie. See the title of my comment. There are guns everywhere in "Fulltime Killer."<br /><br />There are good references to "Leon" and "El Mariachi" among other films, but Fulltime Killer doesn't reach the levels of cinematic excellence displayed in those movies.<br /><br />There are a few nice touches, and the romance here doesn't feel forced, but overall it's just an above average action flick.<br /><br />7 out of 10
