(I tried not to spoil anything, but I clicked the spoiler alert just in case.)<br /><br />The Staircase was accidentally absorbing. Even though the filmmakers had an unmistakably obvious point of view, they did not succeed in persuading me to the same conclusion. Yet, to Maha's credit, the film was thoroughly engaging from beginning to end. Most of the characters it dwelled on were so despicable, transparent, and sad that I can think of no real life situation where I'd have spent more than five minutes in the company of such people. But it was tolerable and even darkly fascinating to observe them on screen over the course of this enthralling real life documentary. <br /><br />Since I first watched the film, I've read an excellent book by Diane Fanning about the Michael Peterson case. I recommend it to all -- titled "Written In Blood." My instincts, according to this exceptionally well researched, well written book, were pretty solid as it turns out. Common sense served me well, and I believe common sense prevailed in the face of a million+ bucks in "expert obfuscation" and P.R. hi-jinx -- AKA David Rudolph's High Powered Legal Defense Team. <br /><br />I can say without reservation, The Staircase is highly entertaining and well crafted. Yet I must encourage viewers to balance the heavily one-sided array of facts and suggestions by consulting additional sources. There are a number of places online offering background, evidence, testimony, and opinion. Or get one straightforward, well organized, and riveting account in Fanning's book. After bulking up your knowledge of the opposing viewpoint and forensic evidence, watch The Staircase a second time and experience a whole new set of "Aha!" moments.<br /><br />One other spectacular element that must be mentioned: the exquisite and haunting original music composed (and performed?) by Jocelyn Pook. Hats off to the directors for spotting this amazing talent.
