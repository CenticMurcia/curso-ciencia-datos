An OK movie but not a great movie. The story is not compelling, maybe because it tries to stay too close to the original media. The X-men powers are cool at first but become quickly boring. Some of the X-men give the impression they themselves aren't very familiar with their own powers as if they just discovered them.<br /><br />Save your $9.
