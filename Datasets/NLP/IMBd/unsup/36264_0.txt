I came away from this show feeling bored and empty. B5 is in the creators own words about the human condition. Apart from the beginning scene where Lyta talks about arrogance it is just another junk sci-fi movie.<br /><br />Maybe if you're a fan of the usual stuff that gets trundled out in the sci-fi genre you may like this. Movies about monsters from other dimensions. However, I liked B5 for its emotional turmoil and because I came to admire the characters. <br /><br />This show has it's moments for the fans but mostly its a let down for the B5 series.
