Where do I start this film hit me like a suckerpunch, a mate of mine threw it on and all I knew and needed to know was that Malcom McDowell was in it. Well whoever plays his younger counterpart is the most evil I have seen on the screen in any movie for a long time. Scarface and Snatch are comedies compared to this. Style, substance and slit throat violence that I haven't seen done this good and chilling since the Untouchables, damn fine viewing.
