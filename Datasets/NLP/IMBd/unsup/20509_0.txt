I saw all 3 original Taxi movies and I think they are hilarious! Now I decided to rent the US remake. I wasn't convinced it was a good idea, but I had to see how it was. I laughed, but not as much as I did watching the French movie. Personally thought the outtakes were the funniest part.<br /><br />I remember making my boyfriend (who doesn't speak a word of French) watch the French version. I translated most part, for the most part, I didn't even do it justice, and he was rolling on the floor the whole time, even if he didn't understand the whole thing. But he was even more disappointed than me by this remake. Especially by the fact that they changed as many characters as they could into females... Come on. Brazilian models in bikini tops? Model feeling the female cop's butt and boobs? A good movie doesn't need this to get people's interest.<br /><br />I'll stick to the original version. "ET C'EST PARTI!"
