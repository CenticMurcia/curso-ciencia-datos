3 hours of crap.<br /><br />Point blank this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Keep in mind that I only say this because this movie should be good. (Decent actors, big budget, Scoresese, etc.)<br /><br />Instead this movie just falls flat on its 3 hour face. This movie is almost as bad as "Waterworld". I think this movie could have easily cut out 60 minutes. (It would still be bad but at least not the kind of bad that makes you want to run off the nearest sufficiently high place, all the while screaming curses that would make a sailor blush.)<br /><br />If you have been waiting all your life for a movie that could combine insulting predictability with the length of "Pearl Harbor" then this is the movie for you.
