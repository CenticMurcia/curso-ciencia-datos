`Playing the Field' is a delightful series from the pen of Kay Mellor who gave us the excellent, much darker `Band of Gold'. We again have a group of women at the centre of the story, this time they are soccer players rather than prostitutes.<br /><br />Although issues like drug-taking, infidelity and a shocking family secret are included `Playing the Field' is fairly light-hearted and good-natured and if you can't guess who wins the climactic Cup FinalÂ… Well, I'm not going to provide a spoiler! As a matter of fact I found the actual scenes of ladies playing football the least convincing part of the show.<br /><br />The top grade cast is of great interest with two of the stars of popular English comedy-drama `Cold Feet'. James Nesbitt & John Thomson, appearing as well as a couple of faces from the hilarious `Royle Family' plus the superb Lesley Sharp (Clocking Off, The Full Monty), Melanie Hill (Crocodile Shoes) and others.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
