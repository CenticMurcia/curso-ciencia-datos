I taped Night Of The Big Heat when BBC1 screened it during the early hours a few years ago.<br /><br />The Northern island of Fara is experiencing very warm temperatures even though it is the middle of Winter while the rest of the UK is seeing the usual Winter weather. At the same time, people are being killed in mysterious circumstances, all being burned to death. It turns out these killings and heat are caused by aliens...<br /><br />This movie is shot well in colour and is atmospheric and creepy throughout.<br /><br />The excellent cast include horror regulars Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing and are joined by Patrick Allen (When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth), Kenneth Cope (Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)), Jane Merrow, Sarah Lawson and Percy Herbert.<br /><br />Hight Of The Big Heat is certainly worth checking out. Excellent.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
