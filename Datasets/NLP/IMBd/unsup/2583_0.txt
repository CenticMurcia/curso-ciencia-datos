I would give this no stars if I had the option. An insult to the original 1946 'Sentimental Journey' which starred John Payne & Maureen O'Hara (a highly under rated screen couple from the golden age of cinema, in my opinion, who should have been cast alongside each other in more than the 4 films they did, as they had definite chemistry. )All I can say is pass on this and watch the original - its better acted and scripted than this drivel. When you see the on screen electricity between Payne & O'Hara, you'll see why, they give Scarlett & Rhett a run for their money and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie for that matter. Can't understand why they had to remake Sentimental Journey anyway as it was only 12 years old at the time this dud was made!
