This one brought back some unfunny memories (which I thought I'd share, though they have absolutely nothing, really, to do with this movie). I was working in a gas station, late one night, when a pair of would-be robbers tried to get the drop on me. I had a .38 on me and managed to get the drop on them, instead. They fled. About a month later, they returned, during the day, and robbed me at gunpoint in front of literally dozens of witnesses. The company for which I worked promptly fired me. "Standard operating procedure," they lied. (An assistant manager would get robbed twice in the following months and the gas station would eventually close down... but said assman never got canned.) I laughed my butt off when I saw ATTACK THE GAS STATION! I highly recommend it.
