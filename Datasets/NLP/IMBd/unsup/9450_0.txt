This movie was so much better than I thought it would be. It had a story, good characters, it was exciting, AND it was based on a real story! I am really glad that the Disney Channel took the time, money, and effort to make this rather dazzling movie! It is not just for girls that like basketball, but for all people. Even if you hate basketball. That is another thing. It was really truthful about what happens in basketball and what the consequences can be. The people that played Heather and Heidi were excellent! They are so talented in many ways. It is weird, but in all the time that I have spent watching this movie and watching the commercials I thought that I would never ever be able to tell them apart (Heather and Heidi, that is), but after studying it, I could tell them apart just fine. Since they are not sisters in real life, they have less of a comparison to each other than say, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. They look like one person. The only thing that may agitate people that watch the Disney Channel often, is that they advertise WAY too much for their movies. I guess it is the only way to get the message out to people about when it is on. Well, I recommend this to everyone! It is certainly a 10 out of 10! Good job Disney!
