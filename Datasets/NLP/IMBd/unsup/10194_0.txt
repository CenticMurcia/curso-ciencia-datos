This was probably the best movie I have seen in a long time. It was definitely a psychological thrill. Everything was perfectly crafted, and all tied together in the most fantastic way. A movie done similarly could be The Ring, or One Missed Call. Each ties all the little seemingly meaningless details together into a beautifully crafted horror movie. Most horror is pop out scares, or slashers, but this movie is among the few that is genuinely creepy. The characters are deep and come to life on a screen, they all have their own psyche state, and this movie is very believable. Currently I have been on a Stephen King movie rampage, and while they are creepy, I haven't come across one where all the details tie together as masterfully. They are definitely scary, due to SK's exquisite writing, and ideas, but most of them have less of psychological ramifications, that a movie like the orphanage. I absolutely loved The Orphanage. Appologies if some of this isn't coherent, I am watching 1408 while typing this submission.
