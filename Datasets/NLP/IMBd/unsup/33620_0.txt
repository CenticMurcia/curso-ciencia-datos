First of all,this movie is Canadian-so why pick Amityville.The radio announcer is speaking pure Canadian (AY!) The movie can be summed up in one word:ODD.Even in a land of misfits,it is a misfit.The characters are pure wierd.One is a psychic with bad dreams-another is a maker of "painkillers".One seems to own a restaurant chain-but only the name is mentioned.I believe it is the BLUE GOOSE. A priest is killed by a deranged man,during confession,of all times.(sounds like Exorcist III).He then hangs himself the next day in guilt.The mysterious characters continue with a lady with a glass eye (Mrs.Morioriti)who tells the story about the priest. I won't go on any longer as the mystery continues:it looks like someone wrote a haunted house story and took advantage of the Amityville legend.It is not THE HOUSE,but a house on the way.The humor barely carries it.
