Lenny Bruce is iconic - Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Robin Williams all owe much to Bruce's honesty. No one-liners, just observational comedy on sex and relationships.<br /><br />Here under Bob Fosse's stark direction Hoffman shines. This is the closet Dustin Hoffman comes to method acting: if you go to YouTube and look at Bruce you can really see the effort Hoffman put in here.<br /><br />The film tries to explain, only partially successfully, how Lenny came to be the comedian he was. The biographical format works well enough but we are never really given the insight as to how he developed his stage act, rather it is explained through the drugs and circumstances...<br /><br />All in all a good, fairly gritty film, which charts the life of one f comedy's great groundbreakers, and a killer performance by Dustin Hoffman.
