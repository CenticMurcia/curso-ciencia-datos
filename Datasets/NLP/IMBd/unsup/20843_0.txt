Little Britain I can safely say is probably my new favourite show, it's so creative and hilarious, and even the parts that some people might get offended by don't quite cross that line, making it perfect. I can watch it over and over and never get bored! There's so many great quotes in there to that you can say randomly and will always be funny. Even in the sketches where you know what's going to happen, or what the characters going to say, it still manages to make you laugh. Anyone who doesn't like this show must be crazy I say. Matt and David are like, my heroes now, they're so talented at taking on all those different roles and pulling them off so well! They are comedic geniuses, it's not often you find actors who are so extremely versatile, even at acting as the opposite sex.<br /><br />I'd say Little Britain is an instant classic, and I hope to see much more of it in the future!
