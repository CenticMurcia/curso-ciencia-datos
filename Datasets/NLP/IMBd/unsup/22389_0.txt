This cartoon is another "my old (fill in the blank) can beat your new (fill in the blank)" plot, in the vein of John Henry versus the mechanical drill. Because I want to discuss some of the details of this short, this is a spoiler warning: <br /><br />This is an interesting little short, though there's very little that's all that special, save for Frank Tashlin using some tricks usually reserved for live-action film rather than cartoons. This is about a race, between Porky and a bully, with Porky using an old, broken-down old engine on its last wheels against a modern locomotive. As Porky is the hero in this picture, it's fairly apparent who will win in the end, but the gags make an obvious trip a fun and scenic journey.<br /><br />Along the way, there are quite a few sight gags, including one which kept the short from being seen in its entirety for quite a while. A bull has a strong supporting role in a couple of scenes and has a hand (or rather, a couple of horns) in the final outcome of the race.<br /><br />This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 4 and is well worth seeing. Recommended.
