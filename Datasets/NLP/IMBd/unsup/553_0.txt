When I saw that this was going being TV, I thought cool. I know it was going to bad, from hiring about off some b-movie site. But this was really bad, not as bad as Epic Movie ( How CENSORED like that got made is beyond me), but still pretty bad. <br /><br />Our story beings with two really bad rapper wanna-bes and there brain dead girl friends, after getting stoned, got get from a Drive-thru restaurant at 2 AM! After getting mouth offed at by the guy at the voice box thing the two guys sneak in to beat the voice box guy, This when things start getting dumb. The morons don't reallies the place is closed, I don't know if was drugs they took or what but you have to blind not to see the place is closed, then there killed by a heavy metal reject from Killer Klowns From Outer Space! <br /><br />Won after the movie becomes this miss-mess of ideas, from other, better, movies. Here's a list of them: <br /><br />An Nightmare on elm street Happy Brithbay to me Gappa <br /><br />Well just those three I came name right now. heres a list of things about this movie that make it so dumb: <br /><br />1. The killer is a ghost, but they still killed him. 2. There is No Way On God's green earth, that a character called Hory the clown would be aloud to saw to children. 3. No way in hell a TV ad, with behaver like that would shown on TV burring the day! 4. Whean two losers are being killed in plane site, someone would have came to their aid! 5. horribly lame jokes, about AC/DC, Elvira and other stuff. 6. Microwave..... more like cardboard box! 7. Very bad effects. 8. Very,Very, Very bad acting 9. So her boyfriend is the killer now? 10. Careters pop in and out of nowhere all the time 11. How the hell the mom known where her kid was 12. So way was the ghost/killer whoring her about him? 13. Horrordla Havey Matel rap sound track. <br /><br />So in short this is movie is like fast Food, BAD FOR YOU! <br /><br />Rating: 2/10
