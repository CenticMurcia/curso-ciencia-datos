Why are there only WASPs on this ark? Where are the African, the Asian and all the other people? It occurs to me, that this film implies a racist latency, because only white men are saved from the Flood.<br /><br />Also the Special effects look like a 20 year old computer game. I wonder also, why such rubbish is dubbed, while really good movies are only subtitled in Germany.<br /><br />Here you can also see, that Tony Danza slowly is going south. Perhaps he was all the time there.<br /><br />So the movie is maybe something for right-winged Christians, for all the others a really embarrassing play.
