I found this a very refreshing film in that the camera angles are creative without becoming annoying, and the focus is on the characters rather than on effects. As has already been said here, though, "The I Inside" does try to get a bit too clever for its own good, and the very last sequence should simply have been dropped in my opinion. Interestingly enough, there is an alternative ending supplied, which was much closer to how I would have liked things to have gone. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something off the mainstream, but it should be taken with a "the film's what you make of it" approach towards the end to still be enjoyed. Oh, and if you liked "Jacob's Ladder" it's a must-see...
