this movie was terrible but in a way that allowed me to see it through to the end. think ed wood. i swear the whole flick was an out of control eye candy piece with little or no substance. the characters were a mess and i really couldn't care less what happened to them, their minds were already deteriorated to the point of no return. pseudo-symbolism at its worst.
