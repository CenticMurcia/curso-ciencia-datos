But the problem with "Hood Angels" is not just the lack of budget; it is also the lack of talent. The trailer promises an action-packed film, but the actual film is mostly talk, with about 3-4 fight scenes, all of which are spoiled by the disastrous editing (in one scene, a guy gets kicked in the face; in the next shot, he is holding his stomach!). The portrayal of the rap world is totally stereotypical (perhaps it's not so surprising that the director is white). From its straight-to-video look to the acting, "Hood Angels" is an amateurish production in all respects. Fortunately, one of the female leads, Kenia Brown, is stunning and athletic; unfortunately, she only appeared in one more film after this and then disappeared. (*)
