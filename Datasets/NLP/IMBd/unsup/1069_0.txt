The most fascinating thing about this movie is the wildly diverging responses it produces.<br /><br />I thought it was rubbish from beginning to end.<br /><br />The way in which the alien functions is not made clear at all, perhaps deliberately to camouflage the inconsistencies in the plot, so that many events make no sense. The obligatory romantic interest is as boring as it gets. The ending seems copied from any old slasher movie where the monster simply won't stay down.<br /><br />A waste of Sutherland (who's always worth watching) and Warner (who's extremely beautiful in a low-key unglamorous way).
