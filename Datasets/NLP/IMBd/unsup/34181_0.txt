MAD DOG AND GLORY sums up with what's been wrong with Hollywood for many years - It tries and makes cross genre movies that appeal to everyone<br /><br />Robert DeNiro plays Wayne Dobie a cop who's too affable for his own good and who'd rather be a photographer . What he's a cop in a big city and after so many years it's just now struck him he'd rather be doing something else ! I was also curious ( Apart from giving the movie a snappy name ) why he goes by the name " Mad Dog " if he's so mild mannered ?<br /><br />The reason for this might have been explained on screen but I had a problem trying to keep up with it as it kept switching genres . The opening sequence screams that it's going to be a violent - Very violent - urban thriller , there's bits after this that hints it might be a farcical comedy and then the movie settles down into a rom com . The producers ( One of whom is Martin Scorsese ) might think they're making a movie for everyone but I promise if you like one aspect of how the movie plays out you'll also be very irritated by the other aspects and when you make a movie with something for everyone you're in serious danger of making a movie with something for no one
