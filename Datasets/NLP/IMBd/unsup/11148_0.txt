Why, because Catholics are taught that the only way to God is through the priest and other Christians are taught that believing in God, his teachings and the teachings of Jesus Christ is what gives you salvation. So I don't have to buy into Jakes' vision of the world and black women in particular. I gave this movie a 4/10 only because I loved to see black actors working I only wish they could find some other films to exhibits their crafts. I know that life is not a basket of roses but I believe that man is basically good that he makes a lot of wrong choices but give a break every wrong choice in one movie! 25% of the black men were good, again dope and weakness is all we ever see of ourselves and oh yes beauty shops. I'm glad that God touched during this movie so that I could forgive the good Bishop and be glad that I never bought the book.
