A potentially interesting film about the hijinks at a car dealership starts out very funny, with on-target jabs at the named industry; but midway through, it abruptly changes tone.<br /><br />The apparent satire on automobile salesmanship suddenly turns into a dramatic thriller-type film with nearly all the main characters erupting into violence that culminates in a truly rotten denouement.<br /><br />Worth seeing only for the first half, which, as mentioned, delivers the laughs and offers a nice change of pace for FULL HOUSE's Lori Loughlin, who breaks her "nice lady" image with a foul mouth and a brief nude scene.<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****.
