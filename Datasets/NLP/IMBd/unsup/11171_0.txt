This film is not for the jaded or the cranky film geeks that shriek whenever they see a mainstream independent movie about love and difficult emotions, and then go on to dismiss it as unoriginal or cliche. It is the filmmakers responsibility to please an audience with honest emotions, good or bad. If you don't like the way the characters act then take a look in the mirror and when do we ever like every character in a movie? In this movie most of the characters are redeeming, that's what matters. Some people can't deal with love and that's exactly what this movie is about. The characters in this film represent who we are, we get upset, we do cry out, we do make stupid decisions! There is no drama without those elements. It's our final decision that counts. This movie is about hope and reconciliation. It's tied together so well, it just made sense, I've been one of those characters and maybe that's why I connected so well with it. I mean I love this movie. It's crafted in a beautiful and moving way, so what if it's totally unoriginal so what if it's schmaltzy, it's good "American Corn." Audiences will love this movie. The use of baseball in the film is manifested in a brilliant way as it fuels the story within the characters intersecting lives. It's a completely original way of using baseball as a metaphor for who we are. It's not your typical feel good movie, it pays great attention to detail and the acting is very good. It's the first truly independent film I've seen with heart. To use a cliche proudly, The Road Home.
