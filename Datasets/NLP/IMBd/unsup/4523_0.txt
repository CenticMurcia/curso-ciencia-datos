Jeffrey Tambor plays a middle-aged man who plays jazz in the evenings. His relationships (so typical of guys like this!) are sex-only with 25-year-old bimbos and jazz groupies. Then, when he loses interest (Hello, you have nothing to talk to them about) and has a disturbing dream, he decides he might be gay, and goes to a gay bar by accident. I'd dismiss this as slapstick absurdity, but the truth is that I've met too many guys like this, and Tambor is 100% right on the mark. Bill Duke is excellent as his jazz-playing buddy. He also has a poignant scene with Michael McKean as a lonely transsexual. When he meets Jill Clayburgh (in the gay bar by mistake with girlfriends Sandy Duncan and Caroline Aaron), he thinks she is a transvestite or transsexual. She is so amazed at what an ass this guy is, she decides to give him enough rope to hang himself, and winds up, much to her surprise, enjoying his company, and thus, the romance begins.<br /><br />To say much mire would spoil it, but their chemistry is magnificent, and despite a few unnecessary slapsticky moments with Tambor's mother in the film, most of it is refreshing and enchanting. If you're over 40, and especially if you've ever been a single woman dating in a big city, watch and enjoy! <br /><br />
