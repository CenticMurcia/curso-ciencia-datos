When I saw this movie, I thought it was amazing. Then I went to Disney World, and went on the ride, and it was much better. Much of the stuff in the movie is the same as the ride, but in the movie, you cant experience it for yourself. Even though it is another movie ride, it wasnt that bad. A lot of the actors in this film have been in previous Disney films such as Eddie Murphy, who led an exceptional role, and Wallace Shawn who has been on Teachers Pet(tv show), and My Favorite Martian. Most of the scenes shot in this movie were very good, including one where Eddie Murphys character spins around the room, with a crystal ball. The ghost were filmed very good also, but they should have watched Tower of Terror beforehand, and maybe they would have had a better idea about it. I would give this film an 8 out of 10.
