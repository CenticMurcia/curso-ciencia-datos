This genuinely creepy Korean serial killer drama has style to spare, with some of the most gorgeous cinematography you're ever likely to see in this type of movie. As sick as I am of the whole serial killer genre, this is easily one of the better ones and I would recommend it highly. Much better than American fare like Kiss The Girls and The Bone Collector. Tell Me Something is also one of the only movies I've seen in the past few years that has a surprise ending that is genuinely surprising.
