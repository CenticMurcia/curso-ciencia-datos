As a British adolescent at the time this film was released, I was very grateful for it. As with most British movies, it's shot like crap but you know, it really doesn't matter when the script and the performances complement one another so well.<br /><br />I've grown up with it and still find something to smile about every time, much the same way that I do when listening to Jonathan Richman's mid-80's albums Rockin and Romance and Jonathan Sings.<br /><br />There's a really beautiful balance of knowing and naivety in most of the characters. Whilst the very slight main plot featuring Dorothy and the football team was what the publicists concentrated on, it's Gregory and the supporting characters who hold all of it's charm. They continue what Forsyth had captured in debut That Sinking Feeling and which, tragically, he never seems to have recaptured.
