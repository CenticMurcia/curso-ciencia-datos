When I saw this movie in the dollar rental bin at the video rental store I should have left it there. Let me start off by sharing with you what happened upon completion of the movie. My friend Rob and I looked at each other with blank stares on our faces. Neither of us could express what we had just seen into words. After a few seconds of that Rob made his way to the VCR. When he got there, he pressed the eject button. The tape seemed to take hours to eject. Once it decided to show it's face the tape was yanked out and broken into at least 243 pieces. We both new that we would have to pay the video store for the tape. To us though this was worth it. There was even talk of renting it at every store in our area and doing the same to them.<br /><br />The movie was obviously written for a small specific group of people inside a specific generation. This is not a movie that can weather the times and still be enjoyed and understood by future generations.<br /><br />Please for your own good do not watch this movie.
