I consider my-self lucky enough to stumble upon a copy of Star Wars:Clone Wars . This mini series really bridges the gap nicely as episode 2 ended whilst the clone wars really got under way , so this done a really good show of showing what the wars were like . There is more action crammed into this one DVD than the first two prequel movies , nearly all the characters are used to their full potential and you really want to be a jedi as you you see them unleash their awesome power whether it be Yoda , kit , or Mace they all impress . No stupid or silly people in here like Jar-Jar Binks or wooden acting from Anakin . Darth Sidous actually seems a lot more frightening in here than in the movies . I could say more but I really feel that I should leave at that because I don't want to ruin the ride . A must for all Star Wars fans .<br /><br />STAR WARS : CLONE WARS 8 OUT 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOOD NIGHT .
