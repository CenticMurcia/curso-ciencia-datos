The film is about two brothers who lost contact with each other during their teenage years. The younger brother Josh, live a messy but rather okay life, he hang out with his friends, doing silly things. At Josh 18th birthday his long lost brother comes home... I leave the rest for you to find out.<br /><br />I think it's a kind of messy movie, it really doesn't tell a story. Not a good story anyway. You can almost figure out quite fast how things are. The acting in the movie was decent, Josh wears the same expression on his face during 99% of the film.<br /><br />My advice to you, watch it if you're really bored.
