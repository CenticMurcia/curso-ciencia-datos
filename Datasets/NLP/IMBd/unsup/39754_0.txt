Over Actors Theater can be so entertaining. Every possible clich√© for a disaster movie, you would think that someone would say "But wait, that's been done." But no, they just went right ahead. I just had to finish it to see how bad it could get, Good for mocking and a good laugh. The actors tried to do the best they could, the girl scientist was very earnest and sincere. Michael Ironsides has never overacted so enthusiastically. He committed to the part and just went for it. I know he must have been rolling his eyes but it was never in the shot. That says a lot for this talented veteran actor. The special effects were low budget but one could certainly tell what it was they were going for. Watch this movie with friends and have comment contests. It will be a hoot.
