"Tomorrow Is Forever" is a great movie. I think Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles are great together. And even though Orson Welles rarely played the romantic lead, he's wonderful. I cried during most of the movie the first time I saw it. There are also wonderful performances by George Brent and young Natalie Wood. "Tomorrow Is Forever" is a movie you need to see at least once! It's great!
