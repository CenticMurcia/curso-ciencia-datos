61 is about two professional baseball players who are running to beat Babe Ruth's record. This is the best baseball movie or television series I have ever seen, clearly! The acting by Barry Pepper as Roger Maris and Thomas Jane as Micky Mantle were terrific. Their excellent duos. I don't know about you, but the series was a very realistic baseball movie. I remember watching this series on HBO because it was always on and all I was thinking was that this movie is just great. I mean there were a couple of flaws but other than that I really did like this series and the acting was amazing. I highly recommend.<br /><br />Hedeen's outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-
