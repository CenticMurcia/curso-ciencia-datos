Pretty dull horror flick and the predictable plot twist sinks it. This is a very rare horror film that i got on a 8 horror disc set) And i must say it certainly is awful. the 2 main leads are terrible and don't have any chemistry what so ever. This did manage to have a creepy moment or two and the buried alive scene was great it's just it's TOO DULL!!!! and the performances are terrible. No gore except an impaling. The acting for the most part is wooden and unconvincing. Steve Drexel is terrible in the lead role and annoyed the hell out of me and had no chemistry with Tracy Olsen at all. Tracy Olsen was pretty but that's about it she was pretty terrible. Rod Lauren is the only decent actor here he was likable and came out of this looking decent. Stephen Roberts is wooden and bland as the killer. Overall skip this one at all costs! * out of 5
