G'day. I will start by saying, yes, I did only pay a dollar for this DVD, plus it came with "Dream a Little Dream 2", but one dollar was ten dollars too much, hahaha.<br /><br />There is not one single good thing I can say about this, which is honestly the first time I have been in this situation. I'm at a loss for words.<br /><br />Basically, it just involves a man (would-be actor) acting pointlessly crazy, screaming and laughing, and talking to himself, and carrying his dead girlfriend around, and for some reason, her body never becomes even slightly stiff and she never even loses the light from her eyes. Not for one moment does she actually look lifeless, which would have helped with the darker side this movie tries so hard to project.<br /><br />I would also like to take the opportunity to mention that the ending to this almost turned my friends and I off movies for life...<br /><br />Hey, I even enjoyed "Weekend at Bernie's" a little bit, but this? "Bleh" times a thousand.<br /><br />I don't really "get" any of it, but perhaps I am to blame and not the ones who put it out. Oh well.<br /><br />The fact that this movie has less than a hundred votes (nearly 50 giving it a 10, yeah right) indicates that the true public totally ignored this one, which can only be a good thing (especially for Val Kilmer fans).<br /><br />1/10. Sorry, that's my one and only verdict. Worst movie ever. Although there are plenty of movies far better than this, which I also gave only a 1/10. On a scale of 1 to 1,000, I'd still give it a 1...<br /><br />Perhaps I should point out that all the others I saw this with also said it was the worst movie they'd ever seen, and one of them was nearly 50, so I'm not alone.
