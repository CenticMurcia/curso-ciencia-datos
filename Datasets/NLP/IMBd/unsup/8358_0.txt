If you haven't seen this flick, it is right up there with Young Frankenstein as the funniest of all time. Written by Tim Conway.<br /><br />Please note that the DVD is indeed edited. Some of the best gags with the pigeons were cut altogether in addition to some other dialouge scenes. These scenes are still available on the old Video Treasures VHS release that is available used.<br /><br />For those curious, the gag with the pigeon painted black/wings is cut, the pigeon catching fire is cut and the "Don't tell her they're canned peas!" scene was also cut. Unbelievable that Conway would let this happen to his only masterpiece....<br /><br />Perhaps maybe we'll get an uncut DVD someday - yeah right - it's amazing this is out on DVD now. <br /><br />Saw this in the theater when I was young and went back the very next day to see it again. After that I waited for 10 years before it came on TV and it still holds up today. RIP Don Knotts, thanks for all of the laughter...
