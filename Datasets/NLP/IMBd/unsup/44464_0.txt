Recap: A brutish and violent gunfighter holds the little frontier settlement of Hard Times in terror. Local mayor Will Blue is helpless, and the terror only ends with the gunfighter burning the town and riding out. The town is almost deserted, but when a saloon manager, along with his group of prostitutes settles in the town to serve the miners from the surrounding mountains, there is hope once again. But Blue struggles with both his own guilt of having done nothing and other locals accusations of the same. And sometimes the gunfighter will return, will Blue be able to defend his town then?<br /><br />Comments: A rather uneventful and badly acted western. Especially the movies threat, the gunfighter, is so exaggerated so that the threat seems just silly. The it is supposed that the drama should come from the tension between the surviving townsfolk, but it never gets really interesting. One problem is that the supposed hero, Blue, is nothing of the kind. And without a hero and an absent threat, there is no real reason to care. Is there? In fact, Blue is so little of a hero that he doesn't even succeeds to gain redemption when the villain returns. He doesn't do anything until the villain is out of bullets, and defenseless. Only then does Blue fight him.<br /><br />With nothing to care about, the movie uninteresting at best, and boring at worst. It certainly is disappointing. A veteran such as Henry Fonda should be better in choosing his projects, and do better with the material at hand. But I guess he didn't care eitherÂ… <br /><br />3/10
