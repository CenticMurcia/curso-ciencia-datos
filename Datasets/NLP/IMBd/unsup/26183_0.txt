I first saw this movie when I was about eight or nine, about thirty years ago, on morning television. Oddly, I still remember it quite well; it is one movie no one would be liable to forget, if only for the deranged character of Mrs. Marrable, and the pesky Aunt Alice, who is out to uncover the murky truth about her mistress.<br /><br />While the basic plot and characterization are dark, the movie deflected from the darkness, with comedic situations (such as Aunt Alice serving cocktails, or Chloe the dog digging at Mrs. Marrable's fine pine trees, or the Mexican gardener quipping "Oh, Mrs. Marrable! I tawt eet was somtheeng bad," and an adolescent boy smoking his first stick). Ironies also abound.<br /><br />You can be assured though, that you will not get the shock of your life, or that you will spend a sleepless night out of fright. Nope. As a matter of fact, I, as a child of eight or nine, had a jolly good time; I had to laugh at times. It was entertaining. Never mind the TV feel of the movie, or the undefinable color quality that seems to typify other movies of the period. Don't think too much of the improbable plot. Never mind if it passes the litmus test of critics.<br /><br />I assure you that for the acting of Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon, and the throughly wicked Mrs. Marrable, plus your desire to be entertained, the movie is worth watching. After a bit of browsing, I am not very surprised that Ms. Page (1985) and Ms. Gordon (1968) were both Academy Award winners. Such excellent actresses! What you waiting for? Have a jolly good time! Get out and borrow the movie! RRCS
