I was truly mesmerized after watching this film last night, though many of my friends warned me not to and i can understand why. The movie doesn't typically have the qualities of a bollywood film( i mean great stunts, thumpy songs may be few stunts), its slow, sometimes repetitive and emotional.<br /><br />Its about a happy young man Raj and his falling in love with Sakina, who is waiting for her love Iman(Salman Khan) to return on the day of Id. Quite a simple story. Whats magical about the film is the way SLB(Sanjay Leela Bhansali) created the characters, their behaviors u can't help but get connected. The movie is not like a wild river which will blow you away, its more like a silent stream which slowly soothes you.<br /><br />Ranbir kapoor really didn't appear to be acting for the first time. He is natural. Sonam kapoor impresses too. The art direction and the cinematography has to credited more than other departments in the film. The film really is just like reading a beautiful poem(if only u r interested in reading one).<br /><br />And movie is totally backed up by the excellent music both in background and in songs by Monty.<br /><br />May be the director could have avoided few dance sequences which seemed as if forced into movie but most of them are well choreographed and well performed.<br /><br />Finally i will say that this movie is not for the people who are looking for passing the time or just coming to the hall for few laughs and masala.
