I really enjoyed watching this documentary. More than anything, the readers were phenomenal. The readers brought those ex-slaves' voices to life. I must make it a point to see the readers' future projects :)<br /><br />This documentary allowed me to truly feel the horrors of slavery: people being stripped of their identity, heritage, dignity, and self-respect. Watching this documentary didn't make me angry or hateful, although the descriptions of the violence were hard to swallow (hey, it happened. No need to deny that the US slavery was violent and emotionally damaging to the slaves and some of their descendants).<br /><br />This documentary is not for the faint-hearted. Read a slave narrative if you want to know about slavery from the perspective of someone who was a slave. Reading about graphic violence may be better for some than hearing it in a documentary.
