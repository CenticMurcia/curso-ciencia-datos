Not a good movie, but I couldn't stop watching it! There was just a lot of comedy in the fact that everyone was horrible at acting. They need to just stick to rapping! If you enjoy horrible acting and corny exaggeration in a story, then this is the movie for you. Reminded me a lot of the Master P movie "I'm Bout it". I woudld only suggest this film for fans of Cam'Ron and Dip-Set. It is fun to watch your favorite rappers in film, even when its not a good film. It also tells you a little about how they came up, and how they got started. I don't know how much of the story is true, but I like to think it is exaggerated a little.
