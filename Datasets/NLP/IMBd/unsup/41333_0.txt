That this show is renewed once much less that it ever got on air at all is yet another example of how dumb our country has become. This kind of gutter garbage does nothing for the human experience and is insulting. I'm not saying everything on TV has to have a moral center or be totally educational, but good lord, do we really have to sink this low? I hope parents are not letting their children watch this. If they are they should be hauled in front of a court for child abuse. This show does nothing but play to the dumbest in all of us. It's like waiting for a car wreck. It's worst than that. The only logical next step to is televise executions. Actually, on second thought, let's not. That would probably be the most popular show on TV and spawn spin offs like "Who wants to be an executioner?"
