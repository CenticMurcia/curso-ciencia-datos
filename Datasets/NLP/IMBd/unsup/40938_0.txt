Okay, to start things of, I've seen some pretty unbearable movies in my time; EG: Disaster Movie, Troll 4, Epic Movie etc. But this one comes very close to taking the cake. The idea of the movie is pretty juvenile, a ventriloquist mother dies leaving her children in a foster home with the dummies, and yep you guessed it, the dummy is actually alive!<br /><br />From here on the movie takes very lame twists and turns, it wasn't even fun to predict who would die or what would happen next because it was so predictable.<br /><br />The movie was also very poorly written and badly acted, every second word the main female protagonist said was a curse word and the male character didn't was mute or something.<br /><br />Anyway this movie really blew me away, how bad it was of course, blew me away.<br /><br />1/10
