This show is one of the British classics. A comedy gem like Only Fools & Horses, Fawlty Towers and a few select others. The show's original and never-before-attempted space setting blends with clever, rapid fire jokes to bring laughter to anyone's face.<br /><br />The show's style changed throughout the years, changing from a traditional sitcom (albeit in space) to a drama series in the later years. But throughout the changing ways and new characters and settings, the humour always remained top notch. Because of this, I find it impossible to single out a "best episode" or even "best series". Some of the finest jokes I've ever heard come from Red Dwarf. And the fact that the Americans made their own version just shows how brilliant it must be.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it before, quickly rush out and buy series 1 through 8. And if you've already got them, sit down and watch. Red Dwarf, in one word, is (as Lister would say) "fan-smegging-tastic!"
