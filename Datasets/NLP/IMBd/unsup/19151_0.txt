This show is one of the most hilarious cartoons I have ever seen! The only drawback is the sometimes violent and/or disgusting humor, so if you are uncomfortable about your children being exposed to that, it's probably a bad idea to allow them to watch this. Mandy is brilliantly voiced, and has an incredibly violent sense of humor. She frequently insults everybody, including her parents and other adults. Billy, on the other hand, is a happy-go-lucky idiot. In one episode, he remarks, "I guess nothing really gets to me." to which Mandy replies, "You know what they say: Ignorance is bliss." All in all, it's a wonderful show and Maxwell Atoms is a genius.I give it nine out of ten stars! Thumbs UP!
