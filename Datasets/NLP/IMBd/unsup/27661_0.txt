Ferocious Female Freedom Fighters (1982) was a project that Charles Kaufman and the L.A. Connection worked on. Troma bought the rights to a real bad Indonesian action film (shot in Panavision) and re-dubbed it. They made a terrible movie watchable, but it's filled with very juvenile and dated material. But that doesn't mean it's not watchable.<br /><br />The plot is (F.F.F.F) is about a female wrestler (Bambi)who's sick brother needs an emergency operation. To get the money fast, she signs up with a shady wrestling organization (even though she was courted by a rival promoter). During her training she meets Barney (a man who talks and fights like Elvis) and tries to woo her throughout the movie. Like I said, the movie's humor is very juvenile and adult but if you're into Troma films then you'll dig this one big time. What will happen to Bambi? Will her little brother get that operation? Can Barney sweep her off of her feet? You'll have to find out for yourself!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
