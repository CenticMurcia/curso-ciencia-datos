Red Dwarf is often billed as a unique comedy outing, but in truth its humour has its roots in the same laddism culture that appealed to audiences of Men Behaving Badly. And much like MBB, its beginnings were so-so. Where it differs from other laddism comedies, however, is the extent to which characters AND plot lines developed in sophistication and imagination, to the extent that the Kryten+ series are deservedly accorded the rare tag of sci-fi comedy, rather than outer space sitcom. On a personal note, my eldest daughter was 9 years old when she first saw Lister teaching Kryten to call Rimmer a smeghead, and she laughed herself silly. That'll always make it a classic in my book. G&N rule!
