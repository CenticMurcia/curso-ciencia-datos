A brother (Josh Lucas), his sister (Catherine McCormack) and their partners take a holiday on a sail boat and visit an island off New England in order for the sister to do some research into two women who were brutally murdered there in 1873. The movie incorporates two narrative strands, one based in the present and the other in 1873.<br /><br />I am a big fan of director Kathryn Bigelow but I found this movie to be incredibly boring, slow, dull and a complete waste of time. I think that Sean Penn is an excellent actor but here he was acting a totally annoying character, what made him think this film was a good idea!<br /><br />Elizabeth Hurley acted like the muppett she is, sticking her tits out for all the lads and using her sexuality as she has no acting skills. The actors in 1873 were shockingly bad, and that strand of the movie looked like a bad made for T.V movie.<br /><br />Nothing good to say about this it is terrible, my worst nightmare would be to have someone force me to watch it through again
