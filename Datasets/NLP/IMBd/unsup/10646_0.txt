Saw this in a near empty cinema when it came out and enjoyed it all the more. Got it again on a battered old VHS and it is still as great. So why do some people hate it? I think firstly the film is more about mood than plot, so you have to be able to relax to get into it. Its dream-like and as in dreams (and musicals) not everything makes sense or looks right. The film is also about colour, every set piece has been designed to show bright neon colours - again dream like, but to others it just looks fake. And to top it all you have a dream girl in the shape of Natassia Kinski - if you do not find her attractive you are really not going to like this. It really is a lonely feeling when you know you love something as much as this and other people cannot see the beauty in it.
