One of the hallmarks of a good European film is that it gets to be re-made in Hollywood. Director/Producer/Writer Luc Besson has received this dubious honour twice, firstly with a remake of "Nikita" and more recently with one of "Taxi".<br /><br />I can't comment on the American version of "Taxi", but the remake of "Nikita", known as "Point of No Return" or "The Assassin", isn't a patch on the original. <br /><br />"Nikita" made me feel sympathy for the central characters, to the extent that I was almost in tears at times. The story is a simple one of love and longing to be free, interspersed with Besson's trademark economical-yet-bloody action scenes.<br /><br />"Nikita" proves that there is more to Cinema than Hollywood.
