First of all, this is a bad film. Its only redeeming quality is Eugene Levy. Other than Mr. Levy, this is a very bad copy of Weird Science. The guys in this film are the type of people I would like to see killed in the next university shooting. They are obnoxious, sexist and stupid. The dialog is painful. The cinematography is like an after school TV special as is the acting. Oh the acting! Check out Kate's entrance when she is first created! Embarrassing... possibly the most embarrassing performance by any amateur actress ever! It is also the reason we have never seen Ali Landry again in a major film. It is not the worst film ever made but it is bad. It is best viewed when drinking or sick so that the pain can be numbed a little. You have been warned. Oh, yes I forgot to mention the "special effects"... it looks like they couldn't afford a smoke machine so smoke is created by a guy with a cigar off-screen. Other special effects include "sparks" which look like they were made by a kid's birthday cake sparkler. Combine this bad film making with bad acting and you have something almost as bad as Tom Cats or Sin City.
