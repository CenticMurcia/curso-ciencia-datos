I think this movie, while dated due to some comments in the dialogue, is a great film about how priorities change as we grow older. Yeah life sucks when you are young and if you focus on that life will always suck. I know that as I have grown older I have come to realize that there is more to life than complaining about the "Raw Deal" I have been handed. The four main characters in this movie all know this fact but find it out in one traumatic slap in the face evening while trying to drown the suburban noise in Phoenix Arizona. (Which in having visited I know is no small feat.) This is a film that spoke to me and everyone I have showed it to. Thanks, wherever you are Karl T. Hirsch.
