I did not think that Cannibal Ferox 11 was as good as the first film. It is about a man called Michael Sopkiw who hitches a ride to Brazil to dig up some dinosaur bones. Once he is in Brazil he gets in to trouble with the locals and manages to get a ride on a charter flight deep into Amazonia. but he plane crashes deep in the heart of the jungle, leaving Sopkiw, Soares, and two super models on their own to get back home. The group runs into cannibals, and murderous animals. they must face the cannibal tribes sacrifices to stay alive. I thought that this was quite a good cannibal film, but not as good as the first film Cannibal Ferox was, but i did end up enjoying it. 4/10
