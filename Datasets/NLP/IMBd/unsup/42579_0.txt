As far as i know it the Germans had German accents. this film proved me wrong, as the consistency made me question whether the owner of Rome was English. none of the actors have any signs of talent, apart from Gregory peck, with the only accent that fits in with his past. i know the public is meant to suspend your disbelief when you watch films, but this is the extent. i also learnt that if you are shot then there are no bullet holes and no blood. so educational. if you want to watch an idiotic attempt at an interesting second world war story, with no thought at all towards realism then this is the film for you. i think harry potter is more realistic.
