If you have seen the original Walt Disney Pictures film, then you might have seen the TV series. Not long after the TV series, they decided to make a straight to video sequel to the film, and they shouldn't have. Aladdin now lives in the palace with Princess Jasmine, and Genie comes back from his journeys or whatever. Unfortunately, they do not know that Jafar and Iago are not finished yet. Iago escapes from the lamp, and Jafar later gets released by the TV series' best villain, Abis Mal. Jafar is now a genie, and plans to use his evil magic to destroy Aladdin and wreak revenge. The only good thing I can say about this is that Genie is voiced by The Simpsons' Homer Simpson, Dan Castellaneta, but personally Robin Williams is much better. A much better third film, King of Thieves followed. Poor!
