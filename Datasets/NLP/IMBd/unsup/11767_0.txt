I don't understand the trashing comments I just read. This film is very, very good. I've seen it at least 5 or 6 times and it was enjoyable the first and last time I saw it. The film making was superb. I actually did some research to see where that cottage was located and see if there were any rentals.<br /><br />I saw no character flaws in anyone. Each character was precise and very believable. Continuity errors were at a minimum. I also don't understand the rating this movie got. It was NOT THAT BAD! If there was poor acting, or plots, or errors then I could see trashing the movie. But really!<br /><br />Even the musical score was perfect for each scene. A mixture of real classical and real rock. The music score designer deserves an 'A'.<br /><br />Best parts: 1) Beethoven's nose in the beginning, followed by his dream sequence. 2) Anything Regina did. She was perfect! 3) Grodin trying to explain where babies come from. 3) The bully sequence at the fair (bite this guy in the weiner!) 4) The hamburger eating contest. 5) The tree stump scene with Penn. 6) Finally, all of the grunting noises Beethoven made. I can actually imitate each one. My kids love it when I do that.<br /><br />Come on people. The movie was really enjoyable with quality Hollywood direction and design. Please stop knocking it. Give it another try. Or next time, try watching it with a child. You'll see.<br /><br />
