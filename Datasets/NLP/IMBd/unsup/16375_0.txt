A couple of interesting footnotes. The wrecked train in the film is still visible today in the river where it sank in the film, somewhere in Tennesseee, I believe. Also, check out the civil war general played by Mike Donlin. Donlin was a star player for the New York (baseball) Giants, who parlayed his ballplayer's love of night life and glamor into a film career.
