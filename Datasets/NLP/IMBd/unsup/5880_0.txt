Bird of Paradise surely ranks as one of King Vidor's worst efforts---in fact it's hard to believe that the man who created The Crowd and The Big Parade could be involved with something as shoddy as this. Dolores Del Rio is hopelessly miscast as an island girl who falls for Joel McCrea, the seaman who virtually rapes her before jumping ship. We see lots of appallingly stereotypical natives (even for the period) and the writing is suffused with the worst racist instincts. Vidor redeemed himself later in his career with the thoughtful Japanese War Bride, but this is a depressing lowpoint in his ouevre.
