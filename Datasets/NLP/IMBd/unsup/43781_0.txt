Sam Elliott and Katharine Ross play an American couple traveling through England where they are taken in by a mysterious millionaire who apparently heads up a devil's coven. The evil lurking at the mansion won't allow anyone to leave--and so we're all held prisoner together, watching the guests meet their 'imaginative' grisly fates. Fashionable nastiness, "Ten Little Indians" style, with director Richard Marquand showing no sympathy for his victims--nor giving viewers any genuine thrills to enjoy along the way. Marquand gets ridiculously showy with his camera tricks--even staging one shot through the nozzle in Elliott's shower stall! Lethargy settles in early, the talented leads are wasted, and the shocks are awfully slow in coming. *1/2 from ****
