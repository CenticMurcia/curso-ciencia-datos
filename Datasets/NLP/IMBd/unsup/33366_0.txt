I get a kick out of the many characters on the show. Unfortunately Ted Danson cannot help but add his personal political views to the script and as a result he loses about half of his potential audience. The co-stars of the show deserve better. Start a service business in any small town America and then bash half of the towns populous. Not a good idea if you want to succeed in any business. Ted is a good actor but apparently so independently wealthy he doesn't need a larger television audience. He selfishly discards the other cast members forgetting they add more value to the show than he ever could. Re-cast the Becker character with anyone who can act and at the same time keep his political mouth shut and the existing cast of characters could carry the show, without Ted Danson. Terry Farrell is an excellent actress. Hattie Winston has a great deal of talent. Shawnee Smith's character is adorable. The other cast members add so much to the show you can almost ignore Ted Danson's snotty little remarks about the republican party and conservatives in general. Wise up Ted! It's not all about you!
