This film is a musical about a shop which contains a giant talking plant, and a geek who fancies this blonde bimbo, who has a nasty, spiteful boyfriend.<br /><br />I have never, ever seen such crap in my life. Full of cheesy songs and I cringed whilst watching this, and then fell asleep about 40 minutes through. What a waste of my time that was! It is embarrassing to watch, I don't see how anyone could watch this film in the privacy of their own home without cringing and turning the TV off.<br /><br />My advice to anyone wanting to see this film: Don't waste your time. This film is appalling and absolute garbage.<br /><br />I rate this film 0 of 10, and that's being generous!
