May contain spoilers. Grace's Choice is one of the most inspiring movies I've seen. A true story of a teenager who takes on the responsibility of raising her 3 brothers due to their drunken mother's absence. She changes her life and gives up a lot to care for her brothers, keep them together and create a stable, loving home.In the process, through very hard times she manages to work full-time and finish school. I recommend this movie to everyone, it is well worth your time, it shows people anything is possible if you put your heart in it. It is a little bit of a chick flick, but very much worth watching. I give this movie 10/10.
