Comment first for Ian: Small town? They make it pretty clear that the name of that town is NEW YORK CITY--specifically Manhattan.<br /><br />So again, here we have a sweet tale with no sex or violence and very little language. But I would feel uncomfotable watching this with my kids in the room because of the strong pro-homosexuality message. Does somebody in Hollywood actually get paid to purposely spoil otherwise "G" rated movies by throwing in just enough immoraity to make them unsuitable for general consumption?<br /><br />Demi Moore shows here that she can be a knockout WITH her clothes on, although I'm not partial to blondes and would ratehr have seen her with her natural color. Jeff Daniels does a good neurotic. My only criticism of the casting is that the role of Grace should have been given to somebody who could really sing like Bessie Smith, and then given a chance to do so.
