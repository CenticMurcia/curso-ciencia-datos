I have seen this on MST3K several times and all I can say is,,,,,,,blech! However, whoever made it must have been trying to create a sword and sorcery version of Star Wars. David Warner's characters could be Obi-Wan and Vader, the boy -Luke, Leo -Han Solo and Thena -Leia. Her banter with Leo is almost just like Leia's with Han. The Power Source could be the Force, the Delta Knights the Jedi and even the treehouses could have come straight from the Ewoks. Thank god the movie is horrible enough that there were no sequels. Richard Kind from "Spin City" and "Mad About You" stars in this confusing farce as does the talented Olivia Hussey, but she is woefully underused in this movie. I can only assume she left halfway through filming.
