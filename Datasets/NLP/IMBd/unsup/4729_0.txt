I wont write a lot about this movie since its a comedy except to say that probably most original(well not original but perfectly acted with great chemistry between actors) since meet my parents, most comedies have been pretty stupid.<br /><br />You have your usual humor with dumb blonde jokes, falls, slips etc. This movie happens to be very romantic as well as extremely hilarious as the 2 main actors match perfectly well with each other. Even the cuddle/kiss scenes aren't overly pushing but slowly developed to let the viewer actually keep like they are really passionate about each other but don't have to display it to everyone.<br /><br />Now the funny things weren't the jokes the developed over the movie, but they were the small reactions that character goes through against other actions.<br /><br />As kate's character tries makes him leave her, most men can put themselves in his shoes and totally go nuts over this, however for him with big plans on the line, he has to take it all in, but can he?<br /><br />Cheers!
