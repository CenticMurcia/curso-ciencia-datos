There are few shows that keep me coming back for more, or that I would pine for to see a new version of, but Blackadder is one of those shows. You need only look at the great writing and great acting to see a show that will forever stand the test of time.<br /><br />Blackadder goes Forth is pure genius, tinged with sadness- on this occasion Blackadder is yet again obnoxious, ruthless and selfish, but in the aim of doing something we can understand- escaping the trenches of WWI. Desperation underpins everything he does. The real 'bad guy' is General Melchiot, with his hare-brained schemes, which, as Blackadder puts it, feels like 'pushing Field Marshall Hague's drinks cabinet another few inches closer to Berlin'.<br /><br />Such lines as 'I'm as British as Queen Victoria' 'So you're father's German, you're brothers are German and you're cousins are German?' are rattled off with accomplished acting skill and timing. Like I said, this show is pure genius.<br /><br />The ending just serves to highlight the tragic nature of WWI, and the futility faced by all in the trenches. It's a touching moment, that makes you stop and think.
