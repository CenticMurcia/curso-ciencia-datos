This "movie" is dumb. I mean, really, really, really DUMB! The "plot" is so lame I can't even begin to describe it's lameness, the acting sucks like a Volta (especially the cops, God, it still gives me nightmares!), and worst of all - there's hardly any action or fight scenes in the movie at all. The few action scenes that are in there are so bad it's a relief when they're over (usually after 5 seconds), and everything in between is just unbearable to watch. I'd rather be water-boarded than watch this filth again. And one more thing : Justin Marks, if you read this (nothing personal) : STOP WRITING MOVIE SCRIPTS! I swear, if Sony let you ruin Shadow of the Colossus like you did with this movie I will set myself on fire outside your house. Besides, there IS already a king, and his name is Uwe Boll.
