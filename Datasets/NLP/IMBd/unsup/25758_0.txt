This is a touching and compelling portrait of the legendary martial artist, humanist, entertainer and philosopher, Bruce Lee.<br /><br />While interested in Lee, and entertained by his films, I have never considered myself a fan. Produced with love and care, A Warrior's Journey has helped rekindle my interest in a man whose timeless messages, and amazing physicality were lost to the world as I was growing up.<br /><br />This documentary is less comprehensive than a biopic, as it really does not cover all of Mr. Lee's too-short life. Rather, it is a film essay concerning his importance as a cultural icon and his unique melding of intensely personal quasi-taoist philosophy with the practice of martial art. If you've ever wondered what the "big fuss" concerning Bruce Lee is, this film is the right choice. Interviews with Lee's friends, students and family are carefully woven together with a well-written voice-over narrative, interviews with Lee, and the ever-intense fight footage from several of Lee's films. Particularly interesting are the articulate comments of his friend and student, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, and Linda, his wife.<br /><br />An added bonus, worth more than the cost of the DVD, is the complete remaining footage of Lee's last major project "The Game of Death", featuring some of the most interesting physical acting and clever martial arts photography I have ever seen.<br /><br />I did not expect much from this film, but was surprised to find that once I got it rolling, I could not take my eyes off the screen.
