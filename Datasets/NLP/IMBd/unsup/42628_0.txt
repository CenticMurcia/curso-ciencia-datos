A generic cop thriller. The boys in blue hunt down a killer/stalker who likes to play sadistic games of "hangman" with the cops to give them a chance to save his victims.<br /><br />The only thing in this movie I thought was good was Lou Diamond Philips, who seems to be great in everything i've seen him in. Why he chose to do this, I have no idea.<br /><br />The basic premise could have gone somewhere, but there was a great deal of cheesy, cliche dialogue and I thought the actor playing the killer was miscast.<br /><br />And I have a problem with the director here. Was he and crew doing shots of whiskey with the teamsters right before shooting began? I don't like giving overly negative reviews, but to tell you the truth, after seeing this, I think I will pass over anything with Ken Girotti's name on it. This was just a very poorly directed film. Even with the cheesy dialogue, it could have been good with Lou Diamond Philips and a director who knew what he was doing.
