I watched this experiment shortly after watching the second episode of Doctor Who. That particular endeavour has successfully updated a previous science fiction programme and brought it kicking and screaming into the 21st century. Witty, intelligent scripts;good cast giving top notch performances;state of the art special effects. This on the other hand was a waste of the viewer's time. At least it was restricted to a digital channel so the majority of people would have avoided watching it. I only hope the luvvies taken part in the exercise enjoyed the "danger" of a live performance. I found the acting flat, the special effects non-existent (if you want to leave it to the imagination of the viewer-do radio) and the script ludicrous (example reaction to man in lab when apparent tramp wanders in)
