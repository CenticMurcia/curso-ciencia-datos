Don't see this movie, not even for free, the "action" scenes in this movie last for about 2 minutes, and i says that over half the budget was spent there.. So what do you get.. its not even close to Bravehart, some scenes in Bravehart you could see people just stand and swing a sword in the background, its the same here, but its the main characters who do it... sigh.. Thers a "love story" in this movie too, following that one is more painful then jumping from a cliff just to see the end of the day. Im gonna write something positive, It was so boring so I actually fell asleep the last 30 minutes. Sweden have some good actors, Stellan Skars√•rd, Max Vond Sydow, Peter Stormare and Dolph Lundgren, I think Sweden should be proud of those people, cause this movie just make Sweden look bad in front of the world.
