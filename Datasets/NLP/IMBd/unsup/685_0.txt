Another memorable horror movie straight from master Stuart Gordon.The characters are cool,the acting is really good.Features a nice amount of blood and torture and a little bit of nudity.I love especially the sequence when one guy is cut in half by a huge pendulum.Great music score too and Rona de Ricci,who plays Maria is a beautiful woman.To sum up,this film is not scary at all,but absolutely worth watching.
