Other then the fantastic villain of Armand Assante and the very brief reference to Aztec culture this film went where it shouldn't have. For me, taking the kids to see a film specifically made for children is the only safe haven I have from vulgarity and lude acts that seem to filter through on the television. This film had me second guessing the FCC and the sanity of the people at Dreamworks, who as of the last few years have really allowed a lot of innuendo's and straight forward adult oriented remarks into their kids films.In this film towards the end the sexuality of the film takes one gigantic leap where two title characters roll around on the ground in a make out session. The language was a bit heavy as well. Since then I have yet to take my kids to a Dreamworks film (especially after seeing Shrek). What could have been a great vehicle for exploring the ancient Aztec civilization turned into a sad excuse for a film that was an attempt to push the envelope and lost. Parents beware.
