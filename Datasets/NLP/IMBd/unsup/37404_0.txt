This has a great cast, and a great premise, but unfortunately, Chris Kattan already did this, and did it BETTER! Unperceived family ties drag a young man into the gangster life. Unfortunately, this is pretty lame, in spite of the fantastic cast. What a monumental waste of real talent! Every possible stereotypical Sicilian mob element possible has been brought into this production, but instead of making the individual components work, it flooded the story line with unnecessary "Italianizations;" most of them ineffectual and out of place, clashing with one another, and rendering scene after scene nearly unwatchable.<br /><br />Sorry, but I didn't derive much pleasure from this, at all. If you want a good mobster/comedy, please do yourself a favor and check out Corky Romano. While it's no masterpiece, it's light years ahead of this.<br /><br />It rates a 3.8/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
