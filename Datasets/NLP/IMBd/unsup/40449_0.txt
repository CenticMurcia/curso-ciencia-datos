The film opens with several embarrassingly puerile skits featuring the "Dice man". It then moves to his sold-out stand-up concert, where his monologues are alternately explicitly crude, arrogant, racist, and sexist. One or two lines were amusing, the rest of the film is almost (but not quite) as bad as Martin Lawrence's horrible stand-up film YOU SO CRAZY.<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****.
