I've seen some bad movies. I've seen some great movies. This movie is neither. It's barely even a movie.<br /><br />Maybe I should explain what I mean: Most films have a general sense of coherence. By that I mean, scene A points to scene B, scene C explains some aspect of scene A, and in one way or another most of the scenes relate to Theme X. In THIS film, however, the whole thing is all over the place. It's more like an algebra problem with seven unresolved variables.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a character with obvious mental issues. I say issues because the whole film does nothing to explain exactly what is wrong with her. It simply goes to great lengths to let you know something is wrong with her head.<br /><br />Apparently the filmmakers felt this gave them license to produce scene after scene of random, unrelated material with twisting camera angles and the characters moving from a somewhat solid, real atmosphere to a whirling dream world where everything spells disaster.<br /><br />This happens for an hour and thirty-five minutes, roughly.<br /><br />I would say it all culminates in a lackluster ending, but "culminate" is too strong a word. Really what happens is some crap happens, some people walk around, and the film reveals what the creators obviously thought to be some brilliant revelation about the main character. Unfortunately, Hitchcock these people are not.<br /><br />I don't mind films that leave some material open to interpretation. What I do mind is a film that ends up being more like a Rorschach test than any kind of intelligent, coherent item of media. <br /><br />Seriously. This sucks. I'm incredibly angry at my waste of money, and I only spent a dollar at Redbox.
