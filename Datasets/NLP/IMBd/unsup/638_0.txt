I've seen a few episodes of this modern murder mystery-comedy series. In addition to being a challenging who-dunnit, there was a perfect blendy of hilarious comedy (can't beat having obsessive-compulsive detective to solve the most intricate crime mysteries). Sure beats 99% of most TV programming out there today. I found the writing to be witty (Andy Breckman who wrote script for the movie "Rat Race", also hilarious). The entire acting cast fit each of their roles perfectly. I've seen most of the main actors before, either on TV or on big screen. Tony Shalhoub is perfect as Adrian Monk. Some of you might remember him as Jack Jeebs in "Men in Black II". Bitty Schram is classic in the role as the more serious other half of the comedy duo, that being Monk's "half way house psych nurse" Sharona Fleming. I loved the scene where they were playing the board game "Clue" ... classic anticipatory comedy! I still chuckle thinking about it. If this series were to appear in print I would read them all! I look forward to watching many more episodes of this series. I hope it's temporary absence from the small screen doesn't mean that it hasn't made the ratings cut!
