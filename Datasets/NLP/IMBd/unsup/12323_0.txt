The first Nightmare On Elm Street is one of my favorite horror movies.It had an original plot and was very entertaining.Now this is the first of the many sequels that followed it.Sure its not as good as the first and its the second worst one in the series(in my opinion).But its still an entertaining and good 1980's slasher flick.The cast is different from the first film and neither of the actors or actresses from this film return for any of the sequels.In this film, a family moves into the house that Nancy lived in during the first film.Freddy possesses the teenager who lives in the house and makes him do his killings for him.With the help of his girlfriend, he must stop Freddy.Though the sequels are known for their comedy, this film wasn't meant to be a comedy.Yet there are a few laugh out loud scenes in it.Nightmare On Elm Street 2 is an alright sequel that slasher film fans should enjoy.<br /><br />Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence, Profanity, Sexual Situations and Brief Nudity.
