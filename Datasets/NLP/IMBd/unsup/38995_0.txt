Hello Moviegoers, The Palm Theatre hardly ever disappoints, but nobody bats a thousand, eh? I was looking forward to Confederate States of America. The concept, what if the south had won the civil war, what would popular culture be like, is an intriguing notion, no?<br /><br />Well, I thought so, but what a soggy leaden thing this movie was. It's framed as a British documentary of American History airing in America with Confederacy styled commercials. The documentary part is stiff, uninspired and dull. The commercials, which promote a racist condescending slave owning economy, were, well, flat.<br /><br />I loved the Shaw quote at the beginning, "If you're going to tell people the truth, you'd better make them laugh or they'll kill you." Fortunately for the filmmaker he was nowhere to be found at the end of the screening. This project desperately needed a Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock to breathe some life into it. <br /><br />Oh Well, Confederate States of America, stay away in droves.<br /><br />This is K-Pig<br /><br />This is 1030 KYNS
