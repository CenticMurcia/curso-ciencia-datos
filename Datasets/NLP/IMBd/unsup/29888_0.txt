This episode has to be one of my most favourite, FAVOURITE eps of all time. It was heart wrenchingly beautiful, enormously sad, and absolutely charming. I had heard a lot about this episode before i actually got to watch it, but it lived up to, and blasted past, all my expectations. Dean gets to see how life could have turned out had hunting never been apart of his and Sam's lives. The acting surpassed anything i could and would have expected from Jensen and Jared, Jensen especially. His reaction upon seeing his mother for the first time, was so heart wrenching. He played the confusion factor brilliantly, the guys face is like a book, you can read everything Dean is feeling throughout the whole ep. There is an absolutely adorkable moment with a lawn moment, I just wanted to hug Dean and squeeze his cheek lol. Jareds acting as the wussy brother was brilliant. Sam would have been a complete soft touch if the deamon hadn't shown up when he was a baby put it that way lol. The addition of pictures of Jared and Jensen when they were younger, as a younger Sam and dean were such a brilliant touch lol, loved it. The attention to detail on this programme is phenomenal. Especially things like drawing your attention to the fact that Dean didn't have his usual amulet necklace, by using an uber shiny one which makes you go 'hey wheres dean necklace?' Anyway, the ending is brilliance on screen, the choice between everything you'v ever wanted, or the lives of everyone you have ever saved i bow down to the brilliance of kripke and the acting abilities of our guys *bows* definitely one to be watched over and over...and over ...and one more time :D XsarahX
