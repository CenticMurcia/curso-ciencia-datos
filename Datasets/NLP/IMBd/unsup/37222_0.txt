The only thing historical about this film is that there was once a man named Brigham that had many wives and went to Utah. Other then that, you have to look somewhere else to find out about the Mormons. Not one scene through this film is historically accurate. The makers take so much license in this film that you have to be very ignorant to believe it. My friends and I watched it once as a joke. Perhaps it works better if considered a parody. As for the question of polygamy, it is very clear from the beginning that the filmmakers have no idea how it was practiced among the Mormons. In fact, it appears that someone just sat down with a cold beer and dreamt up what it may have been like.
