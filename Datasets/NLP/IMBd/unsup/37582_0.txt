The Fear Chamber is set in Los Angeles where a serial killer (Richard Tyson) has been abducting, mutilating & murdering young girls. Los Angeles detective Nick Ferguson (Rhett Giles) is on the case & catches up with the killer but loses him after being stabbed in the heart, waking up in hospital Ferguson realises that he had heart surgery & that the killer is still at large, Ferguson's captain (Steven Williams) is on his case to get results & the pressure is also on from a sensationalistic media & a worried public. While in bed one night Ferguson has a vision, a vision of one of the killers victims which helps him identify her. The visions continue & despite other's scepticism Ferguson uses them to help him track down the brutal serial killer...<br /><br />Co-written & directed by Kevin Carraway this supernatural serial killer thriller is probably best described as a cross between The Sixth Sense (1999) & The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & definitely best described as all crap. For a start the title The Fear Chamber has no real relevance to anything featured in the film although that's not a major issue to be honest, what is a major issue though is how bad the script is. The script almost completely ignore the killer & his motives until the very end, the majority of the run time focuses on detective Ferguson & his mental issue problems, his drinking problems & his personal problems in general. Ferguson is a veritable bundle of clich√©s as a cop in a film, he has a drinking problem, he is burnt out, the case he is on takes up his whole life, he has suffered close personal loss with the murder of his wife & he has a hard but ultimately fair captain who shouts & moans a lot. Seen it all before & the dialogue is really flat, it feels like the actor's are reading from cue cards just off screen that were written in a rush, the dialogue just doesn't feel that personal & has no life to it. Then there's the obligatory twist, now I will admit I usually am rubbish at guessing twist's but the two main ones that crop up at the end of The Fear Chamber are two of the most obvious plot twist's ever. I guessed both of them well in advance & anyone who has seen The Sixth Sense will guess at least one of them it's so obvious & the second twist has no impact anyway. The pace is slow, the film focuses on domestic drama rather than dramatic incident, there's nothing new here & the final twist is insultingly poor.<br /><br />The Fear Chamber has cheap straight-to-video/DVD production written all over it, I only saw it a few hours ago & I can barely remember anything about it. There's an odd creative decision at the start in which the sky is tinted red for some bizarre reason, I have no idea why & it's an odd look in a film which is meant to be set in the real world. There's no real horror here, we only see the killer kidnap one girl & his activities seem to be a secondary consideration for the makers as they concentrate on Ferguson. There's a fairly gory scene where the killer cuts someone open with a scalpel & remove her kidney but apart from that this is very tame stuff. The Fear Chamber is regularly set in the most underpopulated police station in cinematic history, it seems only detective Ferguson & his boss works there & would one cop all by himself by assigned such a big case? Wouldn't he at least have a partner? Surely there would be an entire team working under him trying to track down a brutal serial killer? Or is a serial killer not considered that important? Also why did the killer paint his face at the end like a clown & what caused the room to shake? I know it was probably meant to be a supernatural occurrence but it's never referred to as such.<br /><br />Filmed in real locations the film has a very made-for-telly cheap bland look about it, it's competent but forgettable & I still don't get the red sky at the start. The acting is poor throughout, Rhett Giles doesn't seem interested, Miranda Kwok as Kathryn is terrible as are the whole cast really.<br /><br />The Fear Chamber is a poor serial killer thriller with supernatural overtones which is pretty bad all round really & it also features one of the most predictable twist endings ever which is a straight rip-off of The Sixth Sense anyway. Not to be confused with the classic Boris Karloff horror flick The Fear Chamber (1968).
