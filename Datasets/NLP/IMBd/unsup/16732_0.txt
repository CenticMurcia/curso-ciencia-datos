Comparison between "The Simpsons" and "Futurama"<br /><br />Having been created by the same man who gave us The Simpsons, this show would undoubtedly be destined for a billion comparisons with The Simpsons. I think its fairly hard to say which is better. The Simpsons came first, and in its brilliance captured the loyalty of millions upon millions of fans.<br /><br />Futurama somewhat faltered there. I'm not quite sure what caused it to get cancelled over in the US of A, but I'm sure if it had been handled as well as it could've, it would've been a huge success.<br /><br />In The Simpsons, you get a strong sense of reoccuring characters. Matt Groaning and co have created a whole towns worth of people for their show, that we continually see throughout different episodes, which gives the viewer a bigger sense of being 'in' on the deal. We can connect with characters and decide favourites among them, even if they're only sometimes on the show. We don't get that so much on Futurama. Sure you get characters which you see over and over (other than the main crew), but few are characterised so well. With the exception of Zap Brannagan, and perhaps the robot mafia, the regulars are generally fairly void of character; they definitely have quirks, but deeper character is lacking.<br /><br />A great thing about Futurama is it can go some places where The Simpsons could never touch, seeing as the writers have the whole universe at their disposal, for example we see in the first episode as Fry familiarizes himself with the future. The Simpsons is set in reality, albeit a slightly distorted one, and is restricted by that, whereas Futurama can fly the writers' more wild ideas.<br /><br />I think that each deserves to be viewed in its own light. It may not necessarily be as good as The Simpsons, but it is definitely high above your average comedy material, and is great to watch on repeat viewings.
