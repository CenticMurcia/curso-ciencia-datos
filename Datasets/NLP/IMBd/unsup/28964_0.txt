This is a very touching film, which has always fascinated me as I do have an interest in feral children. The film, based on David Kendall's novel 'Lazaro', revolves around young Lazaro, a child raised deep in the Amazonian jungle by his mother following the death of his priest father before he was born. Mother and son live a happy, idyllic life until gold-hunters enter their territory and end up murdering Lazaro's mother. Left to fend for himself, he is then taken in by the dolphins who live in the river and protect their human charge from predators as they would their own calves. Some years later, when Lazaro is about ten or so, he is then found and brought to the city where his father's mentor vows to care for him and make him civilised. But Lazaro is more intent in revenge when he sees the man who killed his mother...<br /><br />The acting from Alessandro Rabelo, who plays Lazaro, and Ajay Naidu, who was cast in the role of Lazaro's best friend, was excellent. You can't help but grow attached to the boys and care for their plight. Charles Durning also gave a masterful performance as the priest who just wanted to do right by Lazaro; he had such a rapport with young Rabelo, leaving the audience convinced of the growing bond between the two. The haunting music only adds to the sense of mysticism and spirituality conjured up by the storyline of the film.<br /><br />'Where the River Runs Black' really is a one of a kind and I highly recommend it to anyone just looking for something that bit different. It touches many issues, from the plight of rescuing feral children (is there a point where they should just be left alone?) to whether we have a right to seek vengeance when we are wronged to environmental issues (the cutting down of the rain forests). It's a film that stays with you forever.
