After seven years and seventeen pictures at Warner Brothers, Doris Day moved to MGM to star in a dramatic musical based on the life of 30s singing star, Ruth Etting. The film was called "Love Me or Leave Me" and would co-star James Cagney. Shot in CinemaScope and Technicolor, it was a lavish film.<br /><br />Doris Day gave the performance of her career and matched the great James Cagney in the acting department. The critics were raving loud and clear and rumors of Oscars for Miss Day and Cagney were often discussed.<br /><br />The story concerned a young singing hopeful, Ruth Etting, in 20s Chicago who meets a tough gangster, Martin Snyder, who strong-arms her to fame. First in nightclubs, then radio, the Zigfield Follies in New York and finally, Hollywood films.<br /><br />James Cagney attacked the role of Snyder with frightening realism. His experience as an actor culminated in an explosive performance and garnered him a Best Actor Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Doris Day, the first actress to get billing over Cagney in over 30 years, deserved a nomination, but lost out to Eleanor Parker in "Interrupted Melody", also at MGM. She was remarkable throughout most of the film. There were times when she lost character and broke into her "girl next door" personality but those mistakes were few, however, and I'm sure when Miss Day sees the film today, she could kick herself.<br /><br />She is the showcase of the film, however, and delivers, vocally, some beautiful music. In addition to the Etting standards, two new songs were added. "I'll Never Stop Loving You", which became a big record hit for Miss Day and an Oscar nominee for Best Song, and "Never Look Back", a gorgeous ballad done with a full orchestra.<br /><br />Her big extravagant Follies number, "Shaking the Blues Away" was typical MGM and a far cry from anything she did at Warner Brothers.<br /><br />Cameron Mitchell as Johnny Alderman, the musical director who loves Etting, Harry Bellaver, Robert Keith and Tom Tully were all first rate. Even Veda Ann Borg in a walk-on, was fun.<br /><br />I loved this picture and recommend it highly. You won't see Doris Day used to better advantage than here. She and Cagney were excellent together, and memorable.
