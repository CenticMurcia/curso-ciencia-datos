How could anybody have not seen through this sham of writing?! 1. This man-child would have been locked up YEARS ago! 2. Who, in God's name, let's someone in that condition be responsible for their own medication? 3. The "Lord" leaves the mansion BEFORE the nurse arrives? Ridiculous!! 4. After killing his mother, he's still loose? Then, apparently not searched, he still has the knife at the funeral!!! I don't care how bad off the family were financially, in their position this neglect would never have been realistic. I literally wanted to confiscate the world's copy's and destroy them!! This was LAUGHABLY bad. Infintile in it's ridiculous depictions. Pathetic!
