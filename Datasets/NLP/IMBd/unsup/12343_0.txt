An absolutely flawless screenplay which makes the acting look so simple. At least that is what you would think while you are watching the movie but then the acting is super.<br /><br />To me the whole movie is like a work of art. When an artist begins his painting, you have no clue where he is going. He would begin with something and start to draw lines which don't make any sense and yet as they say "patience bears fruits", while you wait patiently, there emerges the unexpected master piece which you could not even imagine. And that is what exactly happened to me while watching the movie.<br /><br />I am personally not a good critique myself but I could not hold myself from writing this.<br /><br />Sadullah
