I watched this Beatles documentary for the first time when it was released for the second time in the Spanish theaters in 1980.<br /><br />I enjoyed it very much in spite of being 10 years old, because a friend of mine had the "Let it be" tape and we used to listen to it very often and we both knew all the songs pretty well. We had a splendid time.<br /><br />Now I have a copy in VHS of the film and I use to watch it from time to time. <br /><br />I know it´s mostly a documentary about The Beatles break-up which is kind of sad, but it would be unfair to say the film is not most enjoyable and besides the rehearsals and the arguments, it ends with the very last Beatles concert, (the famous rooftop concert).<br /><br />The Beatles were four guys who spent some six years together 24 hours a day, "eight days a week" as they would say, working very hard, dealing with all kind of stressing events and it´s logical they split up in the end. Fame is very expensive. George Harrison explains it very well in the last chapter of The Beatles Anthology: "The fans gave the money and the screams, and The Beatles kind of gave their nervous systems...". And I agree with him. It had to be hell!.<br /><br />None of the four Beatles was to blame for their break-up, that´s something that just had to happen.<br /><br />If you ever have the chance of watching this film, just do it. It´s a must for all the Beatles fans and all the music lovers.<br /><br />I hope this gem is released in DVD with lots of extras in the near future!!. Please, release it!!.<br /><br />Long live the Beatles!.
