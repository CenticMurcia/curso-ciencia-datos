I bought this movie for 3 dollars and feel like I was robbed. As a huge horror fan I thought this film showed promise but I was terribly wrong. I could go on for ever about why this film is so bad but I will just give you a few details. First of all the movie is supposed to be set during Christmas, but there is no snow and it appears that it's summer time. Next the film is just terrible, the storyline is thin, it drags along (every scene seems like it's twice as long as it should be), and the acting is downright awful. In addition the film quality is cheap and looks like it was made on a budget of about 10 dollars. As far as gore, there is really only one scene in which you see a person killed by the Santa and the effects are almost as bad as the acting and the storyline. Well I won't go on anymore but will advise you to please avoid this movie at all costs. For true Christmas horror I would recommend either Black Christmas or Silent Night Deadly Night.
