Well i must say i was VERY impressed with this film. It definitely beats Cinderella 2. The animation was superb and the songs were great. Especially Gus and Jaq preforming "At the ball".A great plot line which shows Cinderella to have a more stronger personality and willing to fight for her happy ever after. Sadly the fairy godmother does not have a big part in the film but you soon forget about it as you get glued into the thrilling adventure. Definitely a Disney film that should be remembered for all time. the songs are very catchy. If you want a Disney film to entertain not just the kids but you as well this is definitely the film to buy.
