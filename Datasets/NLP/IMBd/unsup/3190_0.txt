In Mexico, the very religious woman Esperanza (Dolores Heredia) has just lost her teenager daughter Blanca (Maya Zapata) in a simple throat surgery. The girl contracted an unknown virus, and had to be buried in a sealed closed coffin. While cooking at home, Esperanza sees the image of São Judas Tadeu projected on the dirty oven of her stove, who tells her that she shall look for her daughter. Esperanza, in her mind, believes the doctor sold her virgin daughter to some brothel and decides to look for her in many whorehouses in her town, in Tijuana and in Los Angeles. She confesses every vision she had and what she did to Padre Salvador (Fernando Toree Laphame), who advises her about how to she should have proceeded. Her journey begins in Mexico and ends in Los Angeles, where she meets the fighter Ángel (Alberto Estrella). They fall in love for each other. The end of this funny story is not corny. This film is one of the most intelligent comedies I have ever seen. Beginning with the name of each character: Esperanza means `hope'; Blanca means `white', the symbol of purity; Padre Salvador means `priest who saves'; Los Angeles means `the angels'; Paloma means `dove', the symbol of peace; Ángel means `angel'. Further, there are many jokes with saints, but all of them very respectful. The confessions of Esperanza, always after some confusion, are also hilarious. However, the beliefs of Esperanza are very respected until the last scene. She begins very fragile, but in the end she finds love and accepts the death of her daughter, although keeping her faith. The story, although being a love and hope story, is not corny. I liked it a lot. My vote is eight.
