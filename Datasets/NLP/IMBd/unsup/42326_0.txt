Funny teen movie, but mostly based on extremely silly clich√©s, on jokes about sex, or on extremely absurd situations that make it no better than any "scary movie" (In case you're wondering, it's not a compliment, to me). At times EuroTrip can be annoying, and offensive to different European people too... BUT I have to say that cameos raise the overall value: Vinnie Jones is simply a genius, as always, and Rade Sebredja (or however it's supposed to be written, hope you will excuse me) shines briefly and brightly. Matt Damon is also very funny. Ah, and the girls that appear are really cute, and often quite naked! Overall, I give it a 3 out of 10, but if you've got a couple of hours to disconnect your brain and don't care about how pointless a movie can get, you might as well enjoy the show!
