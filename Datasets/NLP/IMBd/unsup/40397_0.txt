The biggest problem with the critically slammed "Car Pool" is its lack of originality. The affable Arnold plays a likeable two-bit carnival owner in need of money who carjacks a gaggle of kids on their way to school in a van driven by Paymer. What ensues are the usual chases and sophomoric nonsense. A busy flick with lots going on, "Car Pool" is a regurgitation of hackneyed stunts and gags which have been done many times before. An okay diversion for the vegetating sofa spud and little more. (D)<br /><br />Note - IMHO Arnold's Razzie is undeserved. It's hard to look good in a really bad film.
