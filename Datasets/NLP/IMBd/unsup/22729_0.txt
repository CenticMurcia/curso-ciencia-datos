I have seen many musical-like movies in my time. And after just seeing "RENT" which I did NOT like, I was a little worried about what I was about to endure.<br /><br />Well I am happy to report that I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />First of all, it is beautiful to look at. And Sanika is just plain fine to look at. :) The songs weren't great, but they were decent. The story was very good, and I enjoyed the characters, especially Raj. Once thing that was weird was how they would mix Hindu language and English. There were some cheesy moments, but nothing too bad.<br /><br />So basically unlike "RENT" were there were many times I just wanted to stop watching it, for Saawariya that was not the case.<br /><br />I recommend everyone to watch this. I really enjoyed it.
