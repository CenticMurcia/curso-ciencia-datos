Alien Abduction: The McPherson tape is an extremely original idea. I had never heard of this movie before and began watching it a little belatedly as it was on TV tonight. Being brutally honest, I am a little freaked. The concept of the film is rather terrifying.<br /><br />Reading through reviews and comments on here I am at a loss as to why people want to express feelings as to why this footage isn't real. Of course it isn't and clearly wasn't intended to be. It was made as entertainment and was good value for it. I am usually not scared by films, only the Exorcist has had any sort of effect on me and I was 11 when I saw that. Tonight, that has all changed.<br /><br />It is interesting to note how the reaction of the characters change throughout as the story unfolds. Tommy, the filmer, goes through various phsycological emotions as the film goes on. That is human nature and what is perhaps most unnerving.<br /><br />I find that what frightens me the most about this film is in fact the appearance of the aliens. Clearly very stereotypical and fake but the silence and calmness of their demeanour is haunting. The characters are faced with uncertainty and are helpless as they are hunted.<br /><br />The ending is what made the film. Questions are left, which is the mark of a truly 'scary movie.' Although the idea has since been adopted by The Blair Witch Project the originality of Alien Abduction is what will see it remain a classic horror movie.
