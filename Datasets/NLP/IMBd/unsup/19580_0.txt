Anyone who went to see this film based on its trailers--and who was then, predictably, disappointed by what s/he saw--should consider her/himself an absolute, and willing, buffoon.<br /><br />I do believe that this film was mismarketed, and woefully so. Appealing to the lowest common denominator, the trailers showed us aging white Warren bustin' moves/rhymes and talkin' jive. One would expect, by all accounts, the typical scenario: high falootin smart guy makes ass of himself or, equally, white guy loses marbles and believes he is black. Great idea, apparently, according to those who bought into the ads. I had no interest in seeing Bulworth when it was first released, and only gave it a chance on video since virtually every review I'd read recommended it.<br /><br />As it turns out, Bulworth was totally misrepresented by the trailers, which is a shame because it is a much better, much more intelligent film than it would have you believe. There are some very dark, quite substantial elements to it that one might not expect. And I'm not referring to the obvious seedy underbelly of politics and socio-economic superstructures--of which we are all, of course, aware. Bulworth is much more than simple social criticism. At the core of the film is Bulworth himself--and it is indeed the human element which redeems what could have been a cold, bloodless and unremarkable movie-as-statement (as in Wag the Dog). Bulworth is about a man and about the essential decisions he makes (not just the bizarre behaviour he exhibits), and is, at its heart, deeply existential.<br /><br />The writing is excellent, the pacing is effective and Beatty's performance is strangely compelling. The love-story sub-plot is perhaps the least successful component (Halle Berry is not entirely convincing)--and the film very nearly shoots itself in the foot near the end--but, overall, this is a very satisfying and stirring movie-going experience (even on video).<br /><br />I would recommend Bulworth to everyone--especially those who have pre-conceived notions about it. And to those who would decide to spend $8.50+ on a movie, based exclusively on its trailers, some advice: read a few reviews before you make that decision.
