Such a shame that this program was canceled mid-season. It was a great chick series! Such a romantic series with a lady lawyer and a policeman husband. The families were Catholic and very close. It was sort of a step-back in time for those of who remember when families were close and shared Sunday dinners along with great conversation around the dinner table. The acting was really great and the young couple seemed so natural and true. Did anyone else out there ever see this program besides me? I always seem to get hooked on programs that are canceled early on in the season and I know it is because I am the only one who watches the show.
