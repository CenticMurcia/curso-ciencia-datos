Oh look, another comedy that throws together bits and pieces of other TV comedy sucesses, only to end up with soulless crap. The talentless John Lehr tries far too hard and seems entirely unaware of himself. In fact, The supporting cast pull their characters off better than he does. It's physically painful watching Lehr butcher what is already a weak script. Not only is it a struggle to find what could even be considered laugh lines, but Lehr ensures there's nothing funny about his basic character (unlike a show like The Office, for example, where Steve Carrel could stand motionless and still be hilarious). Ignore the first couple comments which are brutally obvious plants. Don't waste your time with this show, it won't be around much longer anyway.
