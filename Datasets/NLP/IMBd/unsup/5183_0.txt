With great hopes of hearing that this movie was funny my roommates and i rented it. i would have rather watched grass grow, hung myself, or stab myself in the eye with a knife then watch this movie. the plot was weak at best, the acting was horrible. the big scene you wait the entire movie for was worthless. the only thing that held this movie together was the character of eve (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and the character munch (Brian Klugman). munch did some funny things, not laugh out loud funny but things that you wish you did in college. the character of eve was very attractive however lacked in acting. if you really want to waste a hour and a haft of your life go head watch this movie, but it frankly sucks. i've seen some bad movies, and this is surly on my top 3 all time worst movies list, hands down.
