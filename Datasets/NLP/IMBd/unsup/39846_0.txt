Oh the first film was trashy, seedy and truly in bad-taste and that's what made the dementedly serious piece entertaining. It had balls. This ridiculously low-rent sequel is a complete botch, and pointless beyond belief. I don't know if they knew that or not. But I tend to think so. By throwing flashback after flashback of the first film within the first 45 minutes (were half-way there) and having Ricky, the brother of the original Santa killer provide the voice-over. Which is quite baffling, since he was only young and wasn't in it much, but he can go into so much detail. It had me thinking "Should I just turn it off, and put the first one instead?". But after that slog out, it still has a 'few' amusingly stupid merits throughout its shoddiness and vapid moments. Boy, doesn't it get outlandish. Like that sequence in the cinema and that one-of-a-kind wander down a suburban street. They're poorly executed (just like everything else in it), but gave me a good laugh. Some padded sub-plots can slow it down, the script is laced with mind-numbing dialogues and an amateurishly random score is very inept. Actually there are one or two surprisingly creative deaths, but they do lack that mean-spirited vibe. An overbearing Eric Freeman takes over the psychotic mantle, and is unbeatably awful and at the same time comical. How can you beat that 'convincing' evil cackle?! There's no denying this is a long running big joke, and it purposely plays it up.
