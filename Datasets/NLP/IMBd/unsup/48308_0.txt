This movie is supposedly based on a true story? Ann-Margret's character is annoying. -SOME SPOILERS- Without giving it all away, Ann Margret's character lies her way into a murder conviction just because she wants to get her abusive, alcoholic boyfriend put in jail too. AM's character uses the system in order to get revenge and punish herself. Meanwhile, since the Police have focused on the wrong person; the killer is walking the streets. This movie is supposedly based on a true story. If so, it is a very sad tale. On the other hand, it has a lot of dark comedy in the way it shows how the police play into Ann Margret's hands and how political pressure makes the Police look for the easiest choice, not necessarily the right choice. Marg Helgenberger is the Chief Detective, and she is usually an outstanding actress and she brings a lot of energy to her roles. In this movie she really is a very hard-working and sympathetic character. Even after she realizes that Ann-Margret duped her and is going to seriously hurt her career, Ms. Helgenberger continues to work towards finding the truth. In the end, the movie does not reach a satisfying conclusion. The only HERO, Marg Helgenberger, is sort of ignored; and the seedy character of Ann-Margret is the one who gets her way all the time, flaunts the legal system, gets several innocent people killed, and gets away with it because she is an older woman with abuse issues. The movie involved me emotionally and even if I did not like the ending it was a pretty good movie.
