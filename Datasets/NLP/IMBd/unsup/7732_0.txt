Great and funny movie! The smaller parts of Skank and Gutterhead were hilarious. I just loved those two guys. They almost stole the movie from Charlie Sheen. Charlie and Keri (lead boy and girl) were well cast. It was a toss-up who was the prettier of the two. While watching I thought Keri amazingly sexy and wondered if she was some Playboy Centerfold who won a part in a small movie. (check out her biography on IMDb, she WAS a bunny at one time). Every outfit she had was absolutely cute and hot looking. The cars were cool and it was fun watching them race. Two bloopers I caught were when Skank and Gutterhead had a shotgun. They kept talking about putting "bullets" in the shotgun. You would think scriptwriters knew that you put shotgun SHELLS in a shotgun, not bullets. Bullets go in a gun. Also, I had to look up Cassavetes birthplace. For 99% of the movie he speaks "standard American English" (no identifiable accent). But one scene where he is in his bad guy garage, and Randy Quaid approaches him, he slips into some kind of New York/New Jersey accent. See if you can catch it, it's only a few lines but he gives away his birthplace. I looked him up on the IMDb and he's from New York. Randy Quaid is perfectly cast, as usual. The guy is a legend.
