Well, this is far from horror. For about an hour it is nothing more than a drama... and even as this not really a good one. This was one of the weakest pieces of crap i have ever watched. It was lame, boring and the acting was just awful. It takes about 55 minutes of slow paced intrigue (and made me yawn a couple of times) until that so-called horror starts. A little girl is killed by one of the villains and her blood spattered body is found on the big wheel of the circus the next morning... huh! A few minutes later one of the villains is killed with a big hammer and another one gets stabbed with a knife... that's all. And did i mention the really annoying music? This was horrible and really got on my nerves. Brave as i am i sat through and don't know why by now. This was one pretty bad experience. Definitely NOT RECOMMENDED for anyone! Banned in 42 countries? Haha... what a joke... they must be kidding!!! You can only be disappointed with this one and waste time of your life you'll never get back. Done.
