This was so bad that If it hadn't included a hot tub scene with Jennifer Hill, it would have been one of the worst movies of all time.<br /><br />It has a good monster in The Ice Queen, but she was wasted with her incessant screaming, and the set just didn't allow her to really develop. The battle with Audrey (Tara Walden) was set up for a promising scene, but it just didn't develop.<br /><br />There was really no one you could care about in this film. It really didn't matter who came out. The pair that did were probably the least likable.<br /><br />Despite giving us her all in that hot tub, Elaine (Hill) didn't fare too well.
