Ok, first of all I have to say that I am a Tsukamoto fan. I've been calling Tsukamoto the lovebaby of Lynch and Cronenberg for years now. His visual style is excellent! People who don't like films without a story can never appreciate a Tsukamoto film. His movies are film in it's purest form. No story just images put together like you have never seen.<br /><br />The thing about Gemini is that this is the only Tsukamoto I can think of which has some kind of deeper meaning to it. It's telling something about the rich and poor diversities. The moral seems to be that you can't judge someone based on his financial position...... at least that's what I made of it. With Tsukamoto you never know what the story means (if it has a story), but this is the only film of his which looked like it had at least some kind of a plot. Also his directing style was somewhat calmer. Not many slowmotions and shaking camerawork. The film still is all about the images though, and right from the start you know it's a Tsukamoto when you see his trademark: Maggots eating some rotten flesh.<br /><br />What can I say, I love his movies. This is not his best work though. I think Tokyo Fist was his best, but this is a strong second. Tsukamoto is one of a kind!!!! 10
