"Fracture" benefits mainly from the acting of two great actors, Ryan Gosling and Anthony Hopkins. The movie revolves around a battle of wits, a duel between their two characters and it's their charisma and skill that's the key for its success. The whole movie is almost like a game, about who can outsmart the other, who can win it all. A game with high stakes.<br /><br />The direction is above par, with nice, beautiful shots, maintaining a great deal of intensity throughout the movie.<br /><br />The script is tight as long as you don't over analyse it.<br /><br />"Fracture" is not a masterpiece, it won't change your life, but it's a chance to watch two generations, at work, at the top of their game.<br /><br />It keeps you watching, it keeps your interest and it entertains you.<br /><br />I do think the ending could have been much better, but still, it doesn't hurt the overall quality of the movie.<br /><br />"Fracture" is a safe bet, perfect for fans of the genre. A good effort by everyone involved. It doesn't disappoint.
