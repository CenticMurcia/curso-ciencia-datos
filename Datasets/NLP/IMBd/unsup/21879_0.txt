Really nice to read all of the comments and know that the film was appreciated. I first saw the film in NYC as a sneak preview before 2001 Space Odyssey. My companion and I agreed that there was no reason to stay after Made For Each Other. I searched for that film in every TV schedule for more than ten years...it must have been practically every day, because when I did find it(and made my copy!)i never saw it again. Always the other movie of the same name with James Stewart. I found these comments because I was trying to find a copy of the DVD online, so if anyone hears of of how to find it...share!! the copy of my copy is getting old! the french would love this movie even now.
