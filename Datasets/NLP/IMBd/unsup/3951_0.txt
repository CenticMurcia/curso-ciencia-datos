I have seen this movie more times than I could think to count. It is absolutely hilarious! I know every word.<br /><br />Really. Moving is my all time favorite comedy. When I come across a friend who hasn't seen it or even heard of it, I quickly rectify. It's a classic. Randy Quaid's performance(s) is flawless. Dana Carvey will make your tummy ache from laughing so hard.<br /><br />Richard Pryor is perfection. Anytime I need a guaranteed laugh, I pop this one in. Excellent from beginning to end.
