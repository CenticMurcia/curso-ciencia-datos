I'm not going to recap every flaw in this movie, others already have and it would take way too long. I'm just going to hit a few of the most memorable moments and ask some questions that the movie didn't answer.....<br /><br />Who was that military unit and who was attacking them? Was that even in the script, or just some leftover footage from another movie? Who was the guy who killed the pilot? Where'd he come from and what made him decide to fly the plane? <br /><br />They spent way too long in the bar scene, who walks around a bar with a wet t-shirt before the contest? How much money did she really need for "law school" anyway? her story keeps changing. I'm guessing she keeps using her tuition on breast implants and trashy clothes.<br /><br />Any chance to believe anything in this movie vanished when the 911 operator hung-up on the bartender after calling him a drunk. Why didn't he keep calling? or call someone else? Why were there 7 people at the lodge and 30 cars in the parking lot?<br /><br />Who was the Dr? What was his story? Why did they stay in the same part of the lodge, just going back and forth? Why didn't they try to escape? Why didn't they start a fire, with all that wood laying around, to stay warm and scare the ice queen away? No point in trying to be logical now.<br /><br />The only reason to watch this movie is seeing a bimbo in the thinest possible clothes, a tight top, a short skirt and high heels running around in the snow and freezing temperatures, with no winter clothing and she never makes an attempt to find any. It's obviously not really cold, she'd have gotten frostbite on her toes in a few minutes in those shoes! Even before the avalanche, who dresses like that at a ski area in the winter? <br /><br />I could go on, bad special effects, lame sets, no real snow, horrible continuity, bad acting, but my review is starting to look like the movie, a disorganized mess. This movie should get zero stars, can we have a zero star choice please?
