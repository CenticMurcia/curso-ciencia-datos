This movie is not original material. Or maybe I should say it is not an original idea. After you view this movie and come to your own opinion, do me a favor. Check out a play written in 1965 by Douglas Turner Ward. The play is entitled, "A Day of Absence". The play was written in 1965, and precedes this movie by 40 years. The play was performed, at that time, by The Negro Ensemble Company, Inc. Ward was not only the playwright, he also performed in the play. A Day of Absence is a classic play written from a Black perspective. The plot is self-explanatory and the play itself is hilarious. But, as a warning. see the movie first and read Douglas Turner Ward's play afterwords.
