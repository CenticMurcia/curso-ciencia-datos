Alan Arkin stars in what may be his finest hour on screen, playing a deaf mute in a small Georgia town who befriends the daughter of his boarder (Sondra Locke), a young girl just coming of age. Thomas C. Ryan adapted the novel by Carson McCullers, and his passages with these two sensitive, interesting people forms the lovely centerpiece of the picture. Director Robert Ellis Miller handles Arkin and Locke just right, but unfortunately there's a subplot shoehorned in about racial tensions in the town which plays like irrational soap opera (and just gets in the way). Miller's finale feels truncated, chopped short, so the feelings we have for the characters are not quite resolved, and the heart of the story doesn't completely reach us. *** from ****
