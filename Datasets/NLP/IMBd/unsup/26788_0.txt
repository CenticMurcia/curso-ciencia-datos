After having seen this movies I was surprised because it was beyond my expectations.I was expecting a film with some poor jokes and little nice jokes but it was an interesting experience to see that the film has got good humorous parts.More than this the level of drama is perfect,in one scene it makes you laugh and in the coming scene you can cry so it's really hard to mix these so perfectly in a film.<br /><br />What made really excited is the level of quality of direction in this movie.I know the music clips and other films of this director (Ã–.Faruk Sorak who also directed G.O.R.A.) and I always liked his style,maybe he doesn't bring a new kind of direction style to the world but I think he can make the best direction in Turkey.Although I live in Europe I don't like the European style movies and I always like to see good action sees with a good scenario and this goal is achieved perfectly by this director.<br /><br />Although the superiority of this film for a Turkish person I don't think it can make the same impact in Europe or United States because the film tells you a story which makes real deep wounds (I'm not joking,the wounds are really deep!) in Turkish young people.I think after the great Hababam Sinifi; movies (the old ones with Kemal Sunal,etc.) this is the only film that can take to high school ages' memories.<br /><br />And the last words...It's 9/10 and It's not 10/10 because of its ending...It gives real good advices to the life but when the film finishes you leave the theater with some questions in your mind but maybe there is coming a second film and I may change my mind to 10/10 after seeing the conclusion.<br /><br />Shortly If you are living in Turkey don't miss it!! If you are living out of Turkey if you can't see it in the theater take the DVD,you won't regret.<br /><br />P.S.: It's a good idea that Jean Claude Van Damme is playing in the movie to attract an interest but the poorest level of acting is from him in the whole acting squad I think.
