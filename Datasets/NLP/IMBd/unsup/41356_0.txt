ANDY BARKER P.I. was an anemic private eye spoof that just makes you miss the real deal, a show like SLEDGE HAMMER!, all the more. BARKER tried to mix the HAMMER blend of actual, legitimate mysteries and crime plots along with slapstick and comedy, but the problems lie in the fact that the lousy writing was funny, the plots were stale and the main character was bland and benign without a decent comic attitude. You can go on YOU TUBE and find unsold pilots that are much funnier than this tripe that somehow makes it on the air. Perhaps it was just scheduled to make Conan O'Brien happy, who is admittedly a clever comic force (see LOOKWELL). ANDY BARKER P.I. is forgotten already and won't even qualify as a trivia question in a few months.
