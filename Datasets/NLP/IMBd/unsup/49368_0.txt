I remember seeing this on T.V. in the early '80's, and even though I was still kind of young, I thought it was awful. <br /><br />Rock Hudson should really have been more selective of the scripts he accepted. some of his films are really good, and others like "embryo" and this piece of drek should have been left to the next generation of actors.<br /><br />now for the scene that I thought was the funniest of the whole movie. it happens at the very end as the camera is pulling away and the screen starts to fade to black. If I remember the scene correctly, a group of people are still in either a wrecked hotel or a cave and some guys wife has just been declared dead. as the camera pulls back you can clearly see the "dead woman" stand up and walk off set.
