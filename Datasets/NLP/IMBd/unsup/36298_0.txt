I heard so much of this film that I decided to check it out for myself. I had expected more out of this film, it had a few things that kept me interested though; it had that Tobe Hooper quality and strangeness that he happens to manage in most if his films. I did not expect this film to take place entirely on a stage setting though. This made the film look even more cheaper than it's low budget and it could have been so much better if it would have been set in a real farm much like we see in "TCM". The characters were a real hoot in this film. I never knew just how UGLY Robert Englund really is until I saw him in this film with his big nose as big as Bozo the clowns nose and his head shaped like a used q-tip with a spare amount of hair attached. The one that stole the movie was the owner of the hotel, he reminded me of the eldest brother/sheriff that played in "TCM", I think that he would have been a good one for that part as well.
