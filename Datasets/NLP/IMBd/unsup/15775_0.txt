I first saw this movie a year after it came out, it was 1989, i was 14, and i have never been so scared in my life, I've just watched it again, and while its still scary i am now 32.<br /><br />While a lot of horror films from this time focused on annoying teenagers being slashed up. this deranged killer was far more interesting and sadistic, (it seems they took ideas from jack the ripper with the killer in black with brief case and piercing eyes while walking round misty murky streets)) there is one scene near the beginning, a killing of an actress that is so bloody and gore fested that at 14 i threw up.<br /><br />some of the acting is deliberately done bad, actors sometimes have to do this to make the movie look more enigmatic this seems the case with the lead actress jenny wright, I've seen her in other movies and she can most definitely act, the movie also has this 50's look about it, as the killer time travels his way out of her book.<br /><br />The only thing that i found fault with, was the murder scenes were not that gory, (apart from the redhead)but still it was very atmospheric and sinister, and you won't be disappointed if you watch it.
