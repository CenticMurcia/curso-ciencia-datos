This is an extremely funny movie! Jamie Kennedy is awesome! I always laugh hard at this movie! Kennedy plays Brad "B-Rad G" Gluckman, the rapper-wannabe son of Bill Gluckman is running for the office of Governor of California. He shows up at his dad's campaign and starts rapping. Members from the campaign hire two black actors named Sean and PJ to scare B-Rad into acting like a white boy again. PJ gets his smokin' hot cousin, Shondra to help, but B-Rad is hard to change. B-Rad finds out it's not real, and begins to take matters into his own hands, but when a real gangsta' named Tec holds the actors and B-Rad hostage, Bill Gluckman forgets his campaign and tries to find his son, along with B-Rad's wannabe-gangsta' friends. If you love comedy, Jamie Kennedy, and 'da hood, you'll love MALIBU'S MOST WANTED!!!
