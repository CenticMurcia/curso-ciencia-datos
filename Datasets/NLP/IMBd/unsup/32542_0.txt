This had to be THE WORST movie i have ever seen. Not only was the acting HORRENDOUS, but the plot made me want to punch a baby. I had to drink away the fact that i spent $1.08(NY sales tax) on this film. If i was given the choice to watch this movie one more time or pee razorblades for a week, i would gladly pee razorblades. Whoever casted the main character(the fat kid) should be mauled to death by a fully grown bear. Seriously, how does anyone ever think that this movie was remotely enjoyable. What was up with the line "Your a** stinks". ? What was that all about??? Now the fact that the DVD is one day over due, makes me sick to my stomach because not only could i get a 4piece chicken nuggets for the price of that DVD, i could have helped a starving child. worthless.
