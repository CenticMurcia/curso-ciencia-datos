Filmation animation is not Disney, so why were they trying to be? Why make a sequel to one of the most beloved stories of all time? If it was to make money, it's pretty obvious this didn't make anything, and if it was to tell a new fantastic story, then this is an even bigger failure. The story is just too out there, and the animation is way too loose to make a good animated feature.<br /><br />We start this story after the end of the first Snow White. Snow White and the Prince are happily married and Queen free. Too bad the Queen's brother Lord Miser (Malcom McDowall) shows up to avenge his sister's death. He steals the Prince, and Snow White goes to the Dwarfs' cottage for refuge, only to find their not there. The dwarfs are busy, but taking their place are the seven dwarf elves, who all have stupid powers given to them by Mother Nature (Phyllis Diller). Snow White and the Dwarf Elves must venture into evil, dark places to find the Prince. Meanwhile, Scowl the Owl (Ed Asner) and his bat buddy, Batso (Frank Welker) try to stop Snow White with silly, unfunny results.<br /><br />Everything about this film is just bad. The animation is ugly, and hurt my eyes. The music and songs sound like they were played on a Cassio and sung by lounge singers. At one point, Scowl the Owl raps about how bad he is, and though I agree about the bad part, this song is torture to listen to. The characters are bad too. Why did they get rid of the Seven Dwarfs and replace them with less interesting characters? What a dumb idea. Why do the trees and flowers talk in the forest in this movie? This isn't Alice in Wonderland, it's Snow White.<br /><br />In the trailer for this movie, the announcer claims this is the biggest, most famous vocal ensemble ever in an animated picture. What a lie! Any famous person here is a washed up actor aged 50 or more, excluding Irene Carro, who isn't known for acting on screen anyways. Nonetheless, the voice work isn't terrible. Irene Cara doesn't sound how you would expect Snow White to sound, but she's okay. Ed Asner, Malcom McDowall and Frank Welker voice the "bad guys", and they all have pleasant voices. Possibly it wasn't the best idea to have Carol Channing and Phyllis Diller doing voices in the same movie. One of them is enough to make your ear drums bleed, both of them is next to intolerable.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sad attempt at an animated movie. It's just bad! My rating: * out of ****. 80 mins. G
