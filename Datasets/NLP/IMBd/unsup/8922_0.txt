This movie had a good premise, and at a point in the flick I thought the tables were turning and I was really going to enjoy this one. However, it did not turn the corner for me and in the end was generally a movie I did not care for, but was one or two steps away from being a movie I could classify as okay. One of the problems is the setup in this film. It takes a long time for this movie to really get going, though part of this may stem from the fact I have been spoiled by other horror movies like "The Mist" and "Feast" that only take a short time before all hell breaks loose. The story has this people living in a building that is about to be taken over by some corporation...what this has to do with anything is beyond me as this is never touched on after the city goes crazy. A man awaits his daughter's return home after a tour of duty in Irag I am guessing. You also meet these two old guys and another guy who is a friend of the father and returning girl. You also meet a mother and her son. However, as normally as their day is progressing all is not well. During newscasts and other scenes you see that rats are becoming a bit more aggressive and there victims are becoming a bit messed up too. This goes on for a bit then the city is thrown into chaos as the victims of the rats start dining on everyone not infected. At this point the movie seemed to be getting better, however the camera work is so jumpy that I had a hard time following the picture. There was also a bit more street action than I was thinking there would be as I was thinking it would be the tenants holding up in their apartment complex more. Sort of a Night of the Living Dead scenario. So it came close to being okay for me, but missed the mark and the ending was quite strange too.
