It's another one of those teenagers going camping in the woods movies with really stupid dialogue, bad acting and loud scary music coming in at the appropriate time. The characters are as shallow as their names (Richie, T.P., Betsy...). The music is atrociously bad at some points (especially in the not even full of useless nudity, jacuzzi scene). At some points, the lighting effects are quite nice, but totally irrelevant, why should the wood scenes be lighted in blue ? So imagine a bunch of teenagers : the over dramatic intellectual, the sentimental blonde, the overachieving jock, the curious clown, the feminist and the mustache guy. Now tell me you aren't looking forward to see them get mutilated by the Madman Marz, a legendary farmer who killed his family for no apparent reason. The story is more than predictable, ever so much due to the fact that we see the death of the characters during the first scene as a previews of the gore end. It is redundant, boring, common and badly done. I don't recommend it, it's not even a source of much laughs.
