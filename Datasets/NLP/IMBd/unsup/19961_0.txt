I saw the movie last evening and I think it's a very competent thriller. Nicely shot without being too stylish. Crisp and to the point. The interest never flags down. The plot is realistic and the characterization has the existential overtones the French so much love: agents doomed to obey orders and never ask questions living a lonely life of lies without any friends(while blowing up ships and routinely jumping down planes). The film manages to find new ways to thrill and narrate the story; and that when the espionage thriller field has already been saturated with Hollywood super-productions; so for a French movie to succeed with half the budget and with a European sensibility is great going. Part of the action moves in Casablanca and Geneva but these locales are used in a refreshing way not the usual Hollywood exotica "elsewhere"; if you see this movie try to compare it to say Bourne Identity and you will know what I mean. I love thrillers but for a long time hadn't seen a movie that really kept me glued, but this was it. There are minor gaffes like the makeup in places, the panicky way the agents are always looking around (why are they being so obvious in a crowd when they are supposed to be secret, eh) and some flat actors. But overall the movie is fun and well worth a visit.
