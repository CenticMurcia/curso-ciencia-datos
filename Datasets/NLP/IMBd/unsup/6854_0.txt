Warning! Keep a way This movie is a waist of your time and money. I never saw worse acting than this. The effects are ridicules, especially the weapons effects the Special Forces in the beginning of the movie are firing m-16s at the attackers but they seem to hit none, zero then finally they hit the attackers keep in mind that they are using full auto and they are facing each other!!! but the worst scene was when the attackers moved in a small room and the special forces attacked them by entering the room firing rapidly with their m16s and some how they did not hit anyone then the attackers used a smoke grenade to push the special forces outside the small room.
