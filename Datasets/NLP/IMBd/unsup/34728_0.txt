Bert Gordon's follow-up to his "Food of the Gods" from the previous year begins with a real estate scam headed by bitchy Joan Collins in a remote area. Collins used this character template for her much more famous role as the queen bitch on the Dynasty TV series in the '80s. I believe she was also in a movie titled "The Bitch" a year or two after this. In a strange turn of events, just as some of her conned victims become aware of her scam, the cast is attacked by giant ants. It's a lesson to all con artists out there - one way or another you'll get your comeuppance, if not at the hands of angry 'customers,' then angry giant ants. Ironically, and I use the term loosely, the ants derail a potentially interesting plot; I was waiting to see Collins get tarred & feathered by her victims. Instead, we get the 'pursue and destroy fleeing humans through wilderness' plot, a more tedious 2nd act than I would have thought. Unfortunately, this picture must fall inferior to the ultimate giant ants movie, "Them," from way back in 1954, and which may have had better special FX. The biggest surprise was Gordon's adherence to much of the original story by H.G. Wells, as the audience finds out in the 3rd act. Also surprising was seeing Robert Lansing, who easily gives the best performance - hey, ya gotta put the kids through college somehow, right? Then Albert Salmi pops up as a distracted sheriff or police captain. For more ants with attitude, see Phase IV(74), the TV movie Ants!(77), Matinee(93) and, for a more realistic look, The Naked Jungle(54) and The Hellstrom Chronicle(71).
