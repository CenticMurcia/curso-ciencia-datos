I remember seeing this film in a summer school class I was in in the early 90s. I seemed to remember the film being an interesting romp back then so I decided to give this film another watch. Remarkably the film still holds up well even though it's a movie primarily aimed at children, however the film is really brought down by the third act.<br /><br />Explorers tell the story of three friends (Ben, Wolfgang, and Darren) who stumble upon a way to make a spacecraft after Ben sketches a diagram from a weird dream he has one night, As the spacecraft gets nearer to completion it becomes obvious that Ben's dream may not of simply been a stroke of luck. It appears someone or something not of this earth is seeking them out.<br /><br />Like I said previously, Explorers is a film that holds up extremely well even as an adult, it's creative exciting and gives the kids a personality beyond what is often seen in the media. The Scifi motif is nice too, and leaves the audience wanting to know more about what exactlys going on.<br /><br />Unfortunately when the kids do reach space the whole thing completely falls flat. The director wasn't quite sure where to go from their and as a result it turns into a cornball comedy that seems to try way to hard for the audiences approval.<br /><br />Still despite this it does have a good first half and the message in the third act is interesting even if it's hidden under bad joke and horrible dialog. So I am giving it a seven despite the lackluster ending. Seeing a spaceship controlled by 14 year olds crashing around town is just too much fun, even if it eventually looses steam.
