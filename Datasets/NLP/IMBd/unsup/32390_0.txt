This film was terrible in every way. The acting was downright terrible ( and I mean terrible). Especially the hysterical shouting wife was terrible and the Oh-I'm-so-mean husband shouldn't be allowed to ever 'act' again. There is no pacing, the movie takes ridiculous turns and the plot is filled with stupid moral lessons for the non-intelligent viewer. Everything is so over the top it was almost funny. I say almost, because the film depressed me completely by it's badness. Subtlety is seriously lacking in this movie. Every time the evil husband gets screen time a 'darth Vader' like tune is played. Like that isn't bad enough, it's the same tune every time. This is just one of the elements what makes this film a C-film. Stay away from this at all costs.
