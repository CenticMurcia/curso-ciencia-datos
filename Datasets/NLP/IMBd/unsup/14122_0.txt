There exists a tiny subgenre of "def-con" movies, sort of disaster movies with nuclear defense systems going haywire: Fail-Safe, Dr. Strangelove, War Games, By Dawn's Early Light....and the little-known 1970 Colossus, in which two computers supervising the missile arsenal link up and get smart. This film is often called dated, but to my eye it has stood the test of time very well. Like in Andromeda Strain (1971) all the money is in the sets, the actors are inexpensive unknowns. Unlike most old scifi-tales this one isn't about robots or space exploration, but about computers, data links and electronic surveillance. That is why the frightening Colossus scenario is actually MORE plausible today. Mostly this film is about technicians communicating with a computer; minimal "human interest"-subplot, no chases or gunfights, just the scifi scenario. That's the way i like it. I am very happy that Colossus: the Forbin project is finally available widely on VHS and DVD. Maybe now it finds its audience, it certainly deserves that. After seeing this film,interacting with your computer may feel somehow..different.<br /><br />
