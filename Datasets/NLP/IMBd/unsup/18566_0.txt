In The Woods appeared at the East Lansing Film Festival and to much surprise many seemed to enjoy it. The film concerns two hunters, who find and then are terrorized by, an evil entity. The film's cinematographer makes great use of contrast staging the first half of the film in a rural forest setting and the second half in an urban landscape.<br /><br />The film stars DJ Perry and Stuart MacDonald in a mostly amateurish production that never rises above it's similarities to two other films.<br /><br />The film's director, Lynn Drizick, borrows heavily from The Blair Witch Project and Backdraft. He even places mention of B.W. on the film's poster.<br /><br />Perry stands out as the man forced to do battle with ominous demonic forces from hell including a specific devil dog. He offers up a comedic/action-hero performance not seen since Bruce Campbell in the Evil Dead trilogy.
