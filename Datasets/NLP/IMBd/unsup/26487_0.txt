I was so bored one night, I ordered this flick off a pay per view at home. It sounded good, a landslide, terror, a fear of snakes, etc., the whole underhanded land developer scheme. The acting, it was so bad, I laughed at half the comments the actors made to each other while they were buried under the landslide. The birth scene was laughable at most, ridiculous comments from the woman in labour and her friend.. " I hate you!" "You can't hate me, I organized your baby shower for you!" " That's why I hate you!" -pregnant woman to her friend while she gave birth under a pile of rubble after attending her own baby shower.<br /><br />I can't believe that the actors carried on filming the movie. A boy gets bit by a snake, and the Dad, a fireman from New York, somehow gets the boy to walk. When the boy loses consciousness and his Dad "blows" in his mouth to give him CPR, (I'm not kidding here) the boy opens his eyes and says something like " am I sounding OK?" Dad, calm as ever says yes.... It was embarrassing. It almost made my teeth fall out.
