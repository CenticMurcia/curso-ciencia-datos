I'm generously giving this movie a 2 rating only because we laughed so hard we cried at several points during it. This film is absolutely awful! The dialogue is stupid, I'm pretty sure the casting was done by knocking on neighbor's doors asking them if they'd like to be in a movie and the "special effects" are completely laughable (hence the 'laughing until we cried' part). Of course, there are a couple of gratuitous nudity scenes for all you men out there. If you watch this purely out of curiosity, take notice of the horrible blood splatter effect and the sinking boat scene. We laughed so hard we had to rewind and watch them again just to laugh even harder! I can't believe someone out there actually funded the making of this atrocity! LOL
