This is an absolutely dismal sequel, with annoying performance from David Bradley, and dull action scenes!. All the characters are boring,and while it does have some action, none of it is that exciting, plus Steve James looked very bored in this, and i don't blame him!. David Bradley bored me to tears, as he has no charisma what so ever, and him and James had no chemistry , plus you will be wishing Dudikoff was in this !. The plot feels very stale, and the main villain was extremely weak, plus the finale was extremely lame. The fight scenes are very bland and boring, and the only good thing about this movie was the opening, and after watching that, i was thinking to myself "hey" this might not be so bad, was i ever wrong. The only reason i watched this is because it was a double feature with American Ninja 2, and as i expected American Ninja 3 is crap plain and simple!. This is an absolutely dismal sequel, with annoying performance from David Bradley, and dull action scenes, avoid like the plague!. The Direction is extremely bland. Cedric Sundstrom does a very bad job here, creating dull action scenes, very dull camera work, and keeping the film at a boring pace!. The Acting is terrible!. David Bradley is awful here, he annoyed me, and had no charisma what so ever, and while he has lots of skill he just isn't that exciting,and he had no chemistry with Steve James!. Steve James is not his usual fantastic self, he looked very bored here, and gave a mediocre performance (Not his fault), and had no chemistry with David Bradley!, still he was able to keep this movie barely bearable with his presence. (James rules! though). Marjoe Gortner is laughable as the villain, he was much too hammy and boring to be menacing, i didn't like him at all. Michele B. Chan does okay here, and did what she had to adequately. Rest of the cast are terrible. Overall avoid like the plague!. * out of 5
