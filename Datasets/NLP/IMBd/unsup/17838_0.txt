After getting involved with lots of drugs, poor Jack goes absolutely nuts and begins killing all who enter the warehouse where he works. A friend of mine suggested this film to me, saying; "Jackhammer Massacre is the scariest, goriest film I've ever seen." Those are his words exactly. From the title alone I knew this wouldn't be the epic horror picture my friend described, but WOW, this movie really, reallysucked. Every cliché in the book has been rolled up into ninety minutes of pure torture. It seems every 5 minutes or so some miscellaneous character, always jackhammer fodder, enters the warehouse, just to meet up with Jack and die a gruesome death. There's a very generous amount of gore, though the make-up effects themselves vary in quality from pretty decent to chintzy. The acting is flat and the characters; uninteresting, but that's to be expected. Director/Co-writer Joe CastroOne of the effects artists at SOTA effects, a company who's work in the past has usually been less-than-stellarwould have been much better off handling the gore rather than writing/directing, because he shows no sense of pacing. Maybe that, combined with the film's predictability, is what made in so hard to sit through.<br /><br />Tiny spoiler ahead!<br /><br />"Jackhammer Massacre" has good gore but nothing else going for it. Skip it unless you're desperate for entertainment, or if you think a character being killed off via a jackhammer up the anus is funny (I'll admit the scene was pretty funny). <br /><br />And no, I didn't kill the friend who recommended this to me, he redeemed himself by showing me "Shaun of the Dead". 2/10.
