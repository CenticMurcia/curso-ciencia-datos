The movie begins with Harold (Charles Russell) killing his girlfriend and dumping her body on the train. Mike, a loud little kid (Dale Belding), witnesses him. Harold tries to kill him, but is distracted and Mike runs away.<br /><br />Later, Harold ends up in a hotel/boarding house (?) in a small town where he runs into Jean Maxwell (the fabulous Mary Beth Hughes), a beautiful loser who will pretty much latch onto any guy who will get her out of that small town, as well as Mike and his mother, Ruth (Lee Patrick). There are also some semi-drunk old men who provide some comic relief that seems really out of place in such a dark film.<br /><br />Harold recognizes Mike and is constantly trying to off him, but is alway foiled. Soon, the story of the dead woman found on the train is all over the news, which makes Harold even more nervous. <br /><br />In the meantime, Jean continues to make advances at Harold, but he more or less ignores her and tells her she shouldn't be hitting on him. Also, Mike comes close to ratting out Harold, but is always cut off by his noisy, impatient bitty of a mother. This gives Harold even more reason to get rid of him. <br /><br />Then one night, Ruth sends Mike up to Harold's room to keep him company. Harold ties him up and stuffs him in a closet then tells everyone that Mike ran away out the window. Everyone goes to look for him but Jean, who can tell that Harold was lying about something. She goes up to his room, looking smokin' hot in fancy dress. She soon discovers Mike in the closet and finds out the truth. She tells Harold he can't hurt Mike, regardless of the fact she wants to run away with him. He punches her and she's out cold on the floor. <br /><br />But eventually, everyone finds out the truth about Harold and he's resigned to his fate. We flash back to a fortune teller on a train. He has just told this story to a young lady and warns her not to leave the train. She laughs and leaves anyway. She's the woman who Harold kills at the beginning of the movie. Silly dame should've stayed on the train . . .<br /><br />The film is strange because of all Harold's brutality towards a the kid and all of the humor that shows up throughout. Harold is so bent on killing the kidÂ—it's pretty dark. <br /><br />All in all, this is an entertaining, suspenseful b-grade noir movie. Mary Beth Hughes is fantastic as the sassy-mouthed hopeless loser. I'm so glad to see this movie on DVD!
