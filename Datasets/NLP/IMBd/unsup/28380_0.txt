Enjoy many of William A Wellman's direction of films and in this film he goes completely slapstick with his leading stars being Carole Lombard as Hazel Flagg and Fredric March as Wally Cook. Janet Gaynor was originally selected for the role as Hazel Flagg and was decided that Carole Lombard was best suited for the role and she was a great success. This is a story about Hazel Flagg who lives in a town called Warsaw, Vermont and Hazel has been advised by her physician in town that she has a very short time to live, because she has a radiation in her system and it will take her life. A New York City newspaper man picks up on her story and decides to visit her town and write a complete story about her condition and her life. This report is Wally Cook, (Fredric March) who visits this town and gets a very cold reception from everyone in town and especially Margaret Hamilton, (Warsaw, Vermont Drug Store Lady) who two year later appeared in "The Wizard of Oz" in 1939. There is lots of comedy and Carole Lombard the wife of Clark Gable gave a great performance with lots of vitality and humor. Enjoy.
