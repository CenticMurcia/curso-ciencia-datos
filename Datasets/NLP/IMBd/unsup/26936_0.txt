As i said, jet li at his best. Nice movie, but with a slightly thin storyline (but i didn't expect a fair drama though) Written partly by my favorite director ...luc besson, quite noticeable though. Credits must also go to the director (Chris Nahon) , making this movie as your first movie ever is a great earning !!<br /><br />Last but not least, credits to this crazy french guy (Tch√©ky Karyo)from "bad boys" (fouchet) ...i really like the creepy types he plays so well!<br /><br />although i really like this movie ....i still wouldn't want a kiss of the dragon though (you'll understand after seeing the movie)<br /><br />Germy
