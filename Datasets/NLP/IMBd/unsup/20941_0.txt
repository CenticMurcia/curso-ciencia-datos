Jim Carrey burst into the movie scene with his trademark manic delivery in this mock detective story. There are no other real comedic talents in the movie, but it doesn't matter, Carrey is so forceful that he dominates the screen whenever he is in the picture with his big hair and wild Hawaiian shirts. The story itself is simply a detectives story with the detective more interested in his menagerie of pets than in the quarterback who is missing. That is one of the great scenes, watching the ever growing number of animals flock to Carrey as he lets out a wailing note as is the scene where he searches a bunch of Football players and personal with his head, a lighter, and a bottle of chloroform. The best has to the last scene where he battles Sean Young before unmasking her "little" secret. Along with Liar Liar, this is Carrey at his craziest.
