Shanghai Triad never gains momentum from a slow start and languid pacing until it eventually fizzles out.<br /><br />Gong Li looks superb and director Zhang Yimou's attention to detail and stylistic conceits never fail to impress. But the plot is overly simplistic and the characters never rise above a narrative bogged down with one dimensional characters and clich√©d situations. You get the feeling Yimou was ready for something different in his career and Gong Li had played one too many parts under his direction.<br /><br />That said, it is entertaining without ever attaining the high standards of previous collaborations.
