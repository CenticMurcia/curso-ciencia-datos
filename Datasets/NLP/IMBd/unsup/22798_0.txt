One of my all time favorite movies. I am not an "animation nut" but this movie has so much comedy, drama, action... and the voices are fantastic. <br /><br />This is great for kids of all ages AND adults! It has Ice Hockey, Marathon, track, Skiing, bob-sled, ice skating, field events ie: hammer throw/shot put/poll vault/etc] , Soccer, fied hockey (a little), disco dancing, fashion modeling, swimming, gymnastics/horse/u.parallel bars (spelling!?)/floor routine, Fencing (that's right, fencing!), Boxing, and more and more. It also shows great sportsmanship, Love, friendship, honour, diversity of countries, - oh just go get this movie!<br /><br />The music in it will stay with you- (in a great way).<br /><br />This movie truly is a classic. Not because it is 26 years old, but because it is so great and there are no others like it. - although I will recommend these (not a lot alike): "Dot & the Kangaroo" (much better than 'dot and the bunny') "Emmett Otter's Jug band Christmas" (if you have not heard of this one- you are probably a kid or from another country. <br /><br />Be well fellow humans.
