Sometimes you discover that a movie is not that good but better than you expected, sometimes you go to the movies expecting an unforgettable time and leave the theater with a "it-was-very-good-but-could-be-better" feeling. Prince of Egypt fits the last case.<br /><br />It's all there: the visual impact, the fantastic scenes (the one in the Red Sea is no less than wonderful), the emotions attached to a very known story, etc. But this could be the best of all the movies in animation history and it isn't.<br /><br />First of all, this Moses is like a shadow, he should be the soul of the story but feels like he's just passing through it; even his sister Mirian is more expressive than him. The personality of someone who has been chosen by God to free His people and, for that very reason, must throw his past away, could be much better explored.<br /><br />There are too musical scenes too. I know they're different from another scores, as long as they're sometimes close to an opera act, but this shouldn't be an excuse to fill almost the entire plot with them. The one in the very beginning and the last, with the made-to-be hit "when you believe", are very fine; but the one with the priests is completely strange to the movie's mood. And, worse, the part that shows the plagues is a waste of good cinematography possibilities: it's all filled with songs and music. It seems like they didn't know how to do the scene and then decided to make a musical out of it. I really don't understand why animated stories must always be entwined with that horrible Broadway style.<br /><br />But don't misunderstand me, you should watch this movie, and in the big screen. Although the plot is filmed mostly with a visual point of view, there are memorable scenes that can make you feel fully delighted and they're worth the price of the ticket. Otherwise, if you wait for the video, you might think this is just another one.
