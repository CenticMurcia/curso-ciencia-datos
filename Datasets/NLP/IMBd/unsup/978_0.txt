I did not know what to expect when I watched this movie but I can tell you it left me guessing from the beginning to the ending, and the ending was what threw me so , this movie was well done for a made for TV movie. The story line kept you wondering who was actually involved and Shannen Doherty was great. She has so much talent and did such a good job in this movie. She brought believability to the role and dept to the character. She proved that no matter how her past is constantly being thrown back at her she has an incredible talent and puts more than one hundred percent into what she does. She proves that she can move on with her work.
