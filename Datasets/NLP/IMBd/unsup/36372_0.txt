I was disappointed in this remake. At least they did try to get a little creative by involving a lake house instead of only having Jason at Camp Crystal. Who knew Jason could leave the campground. The main disappointment was the killings weren't that good for a slasher flick. There wasn't a whole lot of blood and what killings they did show were quick. There wasn't much detail. Also, Jason does not take prisoners, so he would never have kept Whitney alive. It's not right for some remake to completely rewrite the rules of a classic killer. Also, this movie had quite a bit more T&A than most of the 13th sequels. It was clearly pandering to 15 year old boys.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: If you are going to redo a classic about a serial killer, at least have new innovative ways to kill of the teens. The killings just weren't that good and not enough gore. I only recommend this if you want to watch a movie with friends that is so bad, it's actually funny and you can have fun laughing at it.
