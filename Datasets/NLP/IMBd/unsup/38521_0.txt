After Child's Play, I couldn't possibly think that there'd be any way for the series to improve in any way. And you know what, it isn't any better than Child's Play, only worse. Everything about this horrible sequel just blows. There's no scares, no thrills, the acting sucks; with characters shifting personalities multiple times. If there is anything good to say about the film it's that it retains the originality of the first, only to be ruined by your typical worse-than-Hell horror movie sequel formula. One thing's for sure, if this were how "good" horror movies were, the genre would've died long ago. With nothing that's truly good or even acceptable, it's a miracle that I'd give this movie a three, deserves much worse.
