This comprehensive and moving documentary dealing with the hopes and aspirations of gay and lesbian couples to be able to be legally married raises a lot of issues that straight people have probably never considered. I know I never did. The points raised are very valid and moving, and the need to recognize and acknowledge them becomes very evident. I was very moved by some issues that I had never considered.<br /><br />As a result of the new insights I have gained from watching this film, my ideas have certainly changed and my previous prejudices have been eliminated. No matter what a person's views may be regarding the issue of homosexual marriage, this film is well worth watching and thinking about. I wholeheartedly recommend it.
