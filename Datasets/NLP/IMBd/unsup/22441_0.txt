This movie surely is the best artistic piece of cinema ever made in Greece.<br /><br />The story tells us about a guy who has to confront the nightmares of his broken heart visualized as a couple of bizarre women doing horrible things in their lame house. During his stay out the house, he will soon come to realize not only that his passion was a mere delusion, but will also discover the emptiness of many things that are generally considered enjoyable such as food and sex.<br /><br />The storyline is neither straight nor clear. However, this non-straight format is essential because the films aim is not just to tell a simple story. I would say that it deals more with ideas and thoughts than with persons and their deeds.<br /><br />Carefully crafted to the last detail, with great performances, I would consider this film equivalent to Eraserhead by David Lynch and Vargtimmen by Ingmar Bergman.
