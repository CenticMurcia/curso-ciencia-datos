it was a pity that IMDb didn't have the ability to rate movies as 0 because that is exactly what i would have given it. however, i have had to give it 1 out of 10, but i mean 0......<br /><br />plot was very poor, movie was too confusing and the poor plot didn't make me feel a connection, like or dislike anyone in the movie.<br /><br />seemed like random things happening with no explanation or leading up to any event in particular.<br /><br />acting was a bit wooden, and the accent from Dominic Keating was probably the most entertaining of any of the script.<br /><br />please avoid this movie, as you can never get the 90 minutes of your life back that you waste on this.
