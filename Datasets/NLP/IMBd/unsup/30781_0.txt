I wanted to see this movie since I read that they were shooting it... well, living in Germany didn't help much! Finally I could see it in the course of the Gay & Lesbian Film Festival in Frankfurt! I must say it was worth the wait...<br /><br />The first segment with Vanessa Redgrave shows the problems gays have, because there is no way to have a legalized partnership... they are talking about it, but we still don't have the rights every married couple has... it probably was the best segment of the whole movie! It showed in a very sensible way how a couple gets separated by death... and the heir takes the house and parts of the things they bought together, not thinking about that it might be hurting the widow. He just ignores the possibility that the two women had a deeper relationship than pure friendship. Isn't that the most common problem? Ignorance. It is great that a movie makes us aware of this.<br /><br />The second segment wasn't that good, but it was okay... the synopsis was you don't need to be a feminist to be a lesbian... we are all different, don't try to put us into categories... it won't work anyway! A member of a feministic group gets involved with a butch is avoided by her friend for it.<br /><br />The third & last segment was great, with a very sexy Sharon Stone and a wonderful funny Ellen DeGeneres. That love scene was marvellous! But it also showed what problems lesbians have, if they want to have children in a sensible way!<br /><br />The whole movie deals with the reality a lesbian faces every day... it is cleverly written, takes a bit of humor and a lot of actuality to give insights most people don't even think about!<br /><br />All in all it is a great movie, not only for lesbians... but also for people who want to understand the mysterious creature... the lesbian!
