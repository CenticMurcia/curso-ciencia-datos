The previous poster commented that this movie was not available in Widescreen.<br /><br />There's at least 2 ways to get this in Widescreen. I've got one on the 'Quality' label - it's a 2 movie set on one disc. The other movie is some William Shatner film. I was pretty shocked to see it in widescreen considering the package was only $5.00.<br /><br />The 2nd way is on the 'Legends of the West' 8 Movie Collection. I'm pretty sure that's widescreen as well.<br /><br />Slow movie that drags on. <br /><br />The theme song repeats all the way throughout the movie. Don't remember if there was more than one actual song played throughout it's entirety.<br /><br />This movie is really only for Blaxploitation/Fred Williamson completests.
