While watching another indie horror flick, I'd made up my mind that I need to start reviewing Indies as a separate entity from Hollywood films; they simply can't compare. Then I watched "Dead Life" and realized that may just be the biggest crock since the "Weaopns of Mass Destruction" excuse.<br /><br />For the first 38 minutes, it's average; not bad, just average. The acting is, like most Indie releases, a mixed bag; some (Michael Hanton) are above average and could easily make the transition into bigger-budgeted productions and others...well, let's just leave it at that. The effects, too, could use some work in the beginning of the film; it's hard to suspend belief when a closeup of a zombie face shows the reflective glare from the cream-based makeup and, around it, a half-inch border of normal skin.<br /><br />At the 39 minute mark though, "Dead Life" not only does everything right, it actually surpasses most Hollywood films and does a lot of things better.<br /><br />Schotten wisely pulls his cameras back a bit and lets the zombies strut their stuff without revealing flaws in the effects. The script begins to tighten its focus and, while much of the film owes its existence to Romero's "Dead" trilogy, it also throws in a couple of unexpected twists of its own. Even the film's grainy, artifact-filled visuals work to create a gritty, creepy experience.<br /><br />Add to that an unexpected, underlying morality and some of the most creative one-shots I've seen in a while (the zombie who eats himself, for example) and you've got a helluva ride. From start to finish, the carnage never lets up. Thank you, William Victor Schotten and the "Dead Life" crew, for showing this jaded reviewer that there are some gems to be found in Indie Horror.<br /><br />My rating: 8 out of 10 guys looking for "food" in the hardware store may not be in the wrong place.
