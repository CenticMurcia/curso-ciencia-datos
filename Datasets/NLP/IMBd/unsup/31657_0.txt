Unfortunately, I never got the chance to watch this film in Germany when it won its awards at the Berlin Film Festival in 2004. I only had the chance to watch it when I came back to the Philippines and I never really expected what impact it would have on me.<br /><br />First, it is obvious that Miss Yamamoto is a gifted screenplay writer and director de los Reyes will bring it far in his respective field if he will continue his great contributions for Philippine cinema. Maginifico is really an enlightment and inspiration towards the development of Filipino films. This is what the dying entertainment industry needs right now.<br /><br />The story and the sound effects were good, the music really fitted very well to the setting. The beginning scenes of the story weren't really captivating at all so one needed patience to get attracted to its plot. The scenes are simple but they become touching once the story gears to an end. In this film, no character has to wail or shout to catch viewers' emotions, the reality and frankness of the film was so direct and impressive that the story simply forces you to cry at some point. I never really cry at movies, even Hollywood tear-jerkers have no effect on me. This one has just awaken so much truth and reality in the Philippine society of poverty and innocence of a child, it really is heartrending.<br /><br />One thing that could have been improved are the visual qualities of the film, they are really not compatible to global standards. And there were too many scenes at the story that were really out of topic etc. but otherwise, this film really is a knockout. It is a great contribution to the local film industry and films like these with high quality deserve good production and not only support for the commercial mainstream in the Philippines but also in cinemas worldwide. It can really par with many Hollywood masterpieces.
