I didn't like this one. It's based on a very interesting idea, that the enormity and complexity of the universe can be reduced to a single, simple equation. Nowadays they'd build a whole series around that concept. Unfortunately that idea got lost in an impenetrable storyline that left me decidedly flummoxed by end credits. Let me admit right here that a big part of my attraction to the X-Files is its plot contrivances and normally vague resolutions. I think anyone who really likes the show must feel the same way, especially if you stayed tuned in through the last couple seasons. But this episode takes the usual confusion associated with the program to another level. I would wager anything that none of the actors, Gillian Anderson, Annabeth Gish, nor Robert Patrick (and certainly not Burt Reynolds), could make heads or tails of this mess if you asked them about it, even as they were shooting it. In fact, I would challenge even the writers of the show to articulate exactly what's going on here. You see, I cannot give any concise summary of the episode because its impossible. Of course I did rather enjoy the playful tone of the episode. However it would take a lot more charm than Mr. Evening Shade could ever offer to distract from the inanity of the plot. Actually I don't know if I should even call it a plot. And I doubt anyone disagrees because to this point no one else has posted anything about 'Improbable'. For fans willing to sit through the episode it's hard to acknowledge how bad it is.
