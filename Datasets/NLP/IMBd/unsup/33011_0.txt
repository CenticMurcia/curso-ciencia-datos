The only surprise is how this movie ended up being made. HA HA.The plot has Gloria(Madonna) as a missionary who needs to get some jewels to buy opium.In turn to sell the opium for medicine for the mission. She is joined by (Glendon)Sean Penn who helps her to get the jewels and avoid the sneaky Walter Faraday(played by Paul Freeman) who is after them and the jewels.He is disguised as an old man whom Gloria thinks is just a storekeeper.Most of the action is corny , the acting bad ,poor writing but you can't blame it all on the writers.Casting Madonna as a virginal missionary and Sean Penn in an Indiana Jones type role was pure idiocy. Actually ,I will say one positive thing , I did like the soundtrack-all of the songs are performed by the late former beatle George Harrison. The only reason I went to see it at the time was I loved Madonna and her music and wanted to see her on screen. She was terrible and so was Sean Penn(he is so damn ugly) how could they cast him as a romantic lead.Guess because they were going together at the time. 4 stars for the soundtrack by George Harrison, 0 stars for the movie itself.<br /><br />Of note to movie buffs - Paul Freeman who plays the bad guy Walter Faraday in this movie was also in Raiders of the Lost Ark playing Indy's nemesis Belloq.
