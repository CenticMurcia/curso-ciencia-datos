This may have been the single worst large studio production I have ever seen. Beginning with the acting, Gwynneth Paltrow sleepwalks through this one like no actor I have ever seen. The one thing she displayed in this putrid mess was spectacular posture. Her dialog lacked life, which was largely due to it's laughable nature. Her attempts at physical comedy were so amateurish that I began to wonder if the whole thing was a spoof. Christina Appelgate couldn't have been worse if she were deceased. Candice Bergen tried desperately to reprise her Miss Congeniality role even though her character was written without any personal depth. Even the likable Mark Ruffalo came off poorly when confronted with the terrible direction and revolting writing that backed this travesty. When Mike Myers provides the best performance in your movie, you know you are in trouble.<br /><br />I watched the movie alone and I asked myself, aloud, if this were the unfunniest comedy I had ever seen or the least moving drama. That is, the movie was so bad I was talking to myself. The story of a small town resident trying to get away has been done so frequently that undertaking it again requires something special. A View From the Top lacked that something. The nadir occurs when Appelgate and Paltrow fight in the galley of an otherwise empty plane, spilling peanuts and drink carts along the way. Maybe that sounds amusing, but when you see the actresses looking for things to knock over you know you are in the midst of a bad dream. Actually, check that. The nadir occurs when several of the students, including our heroine, first go to Sally Westin's (Bergen) house for dinner and we are subjected to a stream of jokes surrounding the homosexuality of Randy Jones (Josh Molina) that are at best unfunny and at worst offensively homophobic.<br /><br />Before I get myself worked up any more over this, let me just say stay away from this film.
