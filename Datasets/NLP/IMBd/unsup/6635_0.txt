I just saw this movie, and as a Dane, I'm offended and disappointed. It was just so... bad! The plot seemed unoriginal, the cast was .. well, disappointing, and what happened to Paige's hair? Movie 1 it was brown and straight, but now it's unnaturally curly and blond? And the actor? Kam Heskin? Not really...<br /><br />But what I had the biggest problem with was that this was supposed to be about a Danish prince, and that most of the movie is supposed to take place in Denmark, yet there were no Danish actors (in the first there was at least one), and the actors who where supposed to be Danish couldn't even speak Danish properly, and they almost didn't speak the language at all! I know Danish is a hard language to learn and to speak, the Queen of Denmark's husband doesn't even speak it that well after many years in Denmark, but then you need to employ at least A FEW Danes, instead of just teaching the actors a few words.<br /><br />Most of the characters' names weren't good either. I don't know if the writer researched Denmark or Norway and Sweeden when finding names, but names like Rosalind and Edward are very rare, and not exactly typical royal names. Harald is not common either, at least not in Denmark. One of our princes' is name Felix! Joachim! Christian! Frederik! I have a whole list of this that seem wrong about the movie from a Danish perspective, I just needed to vent a few.<br /><br />It just really annoys me that they couldn't take the time to make an effort. I heard the first movie was inspired by the love story of our future king and queen, Frederik and Mary, and in that case, I'm offended on behalf of the royal Danish family.<br /><br />Gads, that movie was bad.
