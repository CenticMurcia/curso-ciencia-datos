I count this as the worst sequel ever in one of the best series ever.Previous rocky movies dealt with a lot of hardship but had a great overall positive and motivating feeling.Then this farce of a film comes along.Its the worst start ever for a movie.Hey Rocky you're brain damaged and oh yeah you lost ALL your money.Somehow.There's no decent fight in the whole movie that scrap at the end is nothing better than the one at the chipper last night..How long does it take to fly to Russia?? At least ten years apparently thats how much his son has aged by the time he gets back from the drago fight.There's NO MONTAGE!!!!! No epic training music! 2 stars just for the Micky scene.
