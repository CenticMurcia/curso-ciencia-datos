I saw this today when going to the movies with my family. When it said rated R for strange violence and language, I was anticipating really heavy blood and violence like when I saw the new "Rambo," which I didn't expect to be like what it was...<br /><br />Jason Statham plays Jensen Ames, an ex-NASCAR driver who finds himself framed for murdering his wife in 2012 United States. He's sent to prison, but not just any prison. It's the jail used for "Death Race," a popular race where convicts race for their freedom -- and kill or be killed. The warden is this cool, cold, sadistic in a smooth way woman who wants our poor guy to race as "Frankenstein," a popular convict who won four out of the five wins needed to get free. But will Ames be able to win? This is a pretty good movie to be honest. I'm not a huge fan when it comes to gore. Yes, it has gore people. How else will convict play on the track? If you like Jason Statham and 89 min action, then see this movie. highly recommend it.<br /><br />A total of 8/10 stars.
