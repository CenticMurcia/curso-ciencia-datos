The idea for this movie is just great and I must say it was very well carried out. The way the world and lesbians/gays have changed during the past decades is so well represented in the movie. I was sad in the beginning (1961) and just thrilled when coming nearer today, somehow I was much involved to this movie all the time. I found Chloe Sevigny cute and the 70´s were exactly how I´ve read they were. If these walls could talk 2 is very realistic and touching in every possible way.
