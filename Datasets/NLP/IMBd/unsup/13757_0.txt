Cruel World has taken years to release, with about a dozen supposed release dates and practically zero updates on when the movie was going to release. I was excited for the film, but because of the lack of updates - I just expected this movie to be released "one day". It had good reviews from screenings, and was even released in Australia...so I don't know why they took so long to release this amusing slasher flick! I loved this!<br /><br />The movie opens with a great appearance from Jaime Pressly, who has an encounter with Edward Furlong in her home, after something she did to him on a Reality-TV show they were both on. After some brutal results, Edward takes over her mansion and holds a Reality-TV show of his own with his psychotic brother, as the unlucky contestants realize (as Furlong quotes) "If you get voted of this show, you get voted off for good!". I loved this flick, it was really cool and really entertaining to watch.<br /><br />Cruel World is a slasher film you don't take seriously at all, because it is a movie that is pure, slasher fun with a lot of humor involved. I mean, when was the last time you saw an Asian female being chased by a maniac...only to pee on him and do martial arts kicks? This movie has some funny humor like this spread throughout the film. I wouldn't say it's a Horror-Comedy actually, or a spoof. I'd just say it's a fun movie you don't take seriously!<br /><br />The acting was really good, and Jaime Pressly stood out in her role in the movie. Edward Furlong looked like he was having fun as a psycho, and had some funny one-liners as he provides commentary for us over the contestants. All of the other cast were great too, and I liked their characters...even if some of them were stereotypes. The movie has a high body count too, and entertaining death scenes. They handled the Reality-TV show aspect quite well actually, and even though it was rather straight-forward, it was still good.<br /><br />Overall, Cruel World was definitely worth the wait. I have no idea what took so long for this movie to get released, as it really is a fun slasher film to watch. It has some really good acting, cool death scenes, humor and more. Recommended!<br /><br />7/10
