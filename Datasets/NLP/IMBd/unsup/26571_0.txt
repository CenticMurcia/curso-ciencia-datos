The film the Celtic riddle is a legendary piece of film art. Jessica fletcher at her finest (as always). The plot infallible, the characters despite the badly fake Irish accents are what we would call shadows to Angela's amazing acting abilities. I find Jessica's ability to spot a large haematoma on the back of someones head from a great distance to be an amazing talent. One which many a health-care professional could do with. Despite the Northern Licence Plates in what should be a film set in the south of Ireland. Being Irish myself I find it is not very often that Northern licence plates are found in the Republic, especially not on police cars, which by the way should be the Garda.<br /><br />Despite these errors, minor flaws, I still find the Celtic riddle to be the greatest film to be released in 2003. I wish Angela Lansbury all the best in future film making, hoping she does return to Ireland as Jessica Fletcher, taking on-board my constructive criticism of course.<br /><br />Lots of Luv and respect From Louise Brick
