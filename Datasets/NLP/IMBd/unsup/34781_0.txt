I'm a nut about Italian films, and Italy in general. I love Sardinia and Sardinians. It's a beautiful island with energetic and beautiful people that are anything but Italian. But... this film is nonsensical. Like a pure experiment on weirdness. Someone already pointed out a very distasteful scene that makes anyone cringe (the idea of man as a pure male beast that only knows sex from beasts). The four stories (should be three, but, oddly, there are four) are disconnected and they don't pull together in the final act (as the Director seems to think).<br /><br />I wouldn't say anything about the pace. It's just simply that there's no point in this film, no argument, except the possible reference to life, death and the after-world... And this is the first film I remember that four different photographers are involved in... something that shows pretty well... not favourably.
