MIGHT CONTAIN A SPOILER: I like haunted house movies, but once and awhile one comes along that actually has something new. This is not one of them. The script has the same worn-out themes of hidden rooms, mysterious deaths, kooky neighbors, weird histories and the disbelieving husband who discovers the truth in the end. A mysterious woman and a wierd dog are tagged on to the script without much of an explanation as Ally Sheedy (looking eerily like a young Kate Jackson) and her husband, William R. Moses, dump their life savings into a house that predictably burns down in the end. There is some spooky ghost behavior as a radio comes on by itself, but there is nothing scary about this movie except for some convincingly fake spirit photography.
