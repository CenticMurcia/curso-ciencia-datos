I think trashiness is a form of art, seriously. But trashy cinema is the kind of thing that needs to be done by someone who truly understands that this sub-genre requires hard work and great imagination. I'm convinced director Deodato has no clue of what I'm talking about. He wants to shock the audience but he commits a series of unpardonable mistakes that ruin material perfectly suited for what is fondly known as exploitation cinema. "House On The Edge Of The Park" has a strong cult following, but I found the film silly and boring. Sure, there is plenty of gratuitous nudity and violence here, but Deodato forgot a crucial element in the creation of trash: you have to be able to force the viewer to love their own feelings of inadequacy. The film simply never made me feel anything, negative or positive. I think the reason I found this movie so uninteresting is because you are never asked to identify with either the hunters or the prey. It is all so bland, so insipid, and seriously devoid of energy. Even the usually animated cult figure David Hess (who was better utilized by Wes Craven in the sleaze classic "The Last House on the Left"), looks bored. Don't be fooled by its reputation, this film is a big snooze.
