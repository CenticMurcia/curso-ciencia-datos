i seen this poor done comic film.but it would been better if they used a family that wasn't based on nothing.the movie starts as Denise finds a dinosaur bone in his back yard,and a fake<br /><br />who claims to be a dinosaur hunter comes to stay with the family.and he is real annoying too.the film did not deliver much laughs.the only two funny things in the movie was when Denise tries to sneak that fudge candy to his room and the scene where Mr Wilson's washer overflowed.it would be a better film if it involved a different character.the 93 version was a real one.this one wasn't a Denise the menace at all. and i saw this one 2 or 3 times a month when it was on HBO.
