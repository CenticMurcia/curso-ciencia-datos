The only regret I had watching "Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey" was that Bruce, the master of all masters, wasn't still alive to see what great tribute is being paid to him with this documentary. He would have been so proud. What a shame it is that such a young, handsome man is ripped out of this life by some, well, whoever it was - IT WAS WRONG!!! The documentary contains great footage of Bruce, the master, and of his movies, too. I especially liked the parts from the movies, since they reminded me of the time I was watching them. I didn't miss a single movie, and I say that with the proviso that I am not capable of understanding Chinese. Therefore I have even more regrets that he only got to making one English movie before the tragedy. So people out there, don't miss that great account of a great master, Bruce, in a great documentary. It's really a great experience and shouldn't me missed by anyone. I enjoyed it a great deal and I am very choosy, for example I didn't like Star Wars.
