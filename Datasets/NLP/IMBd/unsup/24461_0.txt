This movie is the perfect example of what is comedy. And a movie can be a hit and does good business without women too. The story line is same and old one. 4 friends Roy, Adi, Manav and Boman, lives together share good and funny moments. Their jokes are hilarious. Though Sanjay Dutt is also there in the movie, but the young boys does a good job, and make this movie a perfect comedy, this is a type of movie which you can see again and again, A complete funny entertainer. These four friends going from Bombay to Goa for some money, but when money words comes, there is no place for any other thing. This happen with these friends too. All friendship breaks bcoz they are not be able to decide what is the share they have to distribute. Lots and lots of characters are coming at regular intervals and joins them in their journey. This movie is as comedy as I can compare this with Hera Pheri and Golmaal. There's not a single moment in the movie where you say that you are not enjoying. All characters is superb and specially our Adi(Arshad) and Manav(Javed). After Dil, Beta, Mann and Masti, Inder Kumar's this flick proves that he is a king of comedy.
