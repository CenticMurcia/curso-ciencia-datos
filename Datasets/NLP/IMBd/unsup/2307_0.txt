I first saw this wonderful movie as a young boy in 1938. I don't know how many times I've seen it since then, but it always gives my heart a lift and I leave the theatre (it must be seen on a large screen)with a happy face. Above all else, there is the master of charm and grace, Errol Flynn, who gives, probably, his best performance. Close behind comes the superb, Warner Bros. regulars - lovely Olivia de Havilland, the evil Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains, and, of course, the Merry Men, with Alan Hale, Patrick Knowles, Eugene Pallette, Herbert Mundin leading the list. The story is well known and is told in a respectful and loving fashion, with perfect direction by William Keighly and Michael Curtiz. The cinematography, by Tony Gaudio and Sol Polito, is in glorious, three strip Technicolor and the famous score by Maestro Erich Wolfgang Korngold is outstanding and won him an Oscar. This is a movie for all ages; they will all be happy to have seen it. +
