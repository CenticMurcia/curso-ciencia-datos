Although I thought it was one of Woody Allen's best, I must say that I am biased. Most of America (anywhere west of Manhattan) doesn't get Woody. I do. I also don't like a lot of what he's done, but this wasn't one of those times. Anybody under the age of 40 probably was turned off by the music in the film. Sorry, but that's what made it for me. I do have one minor comment about ten seconds of the movie. There was a scene in a Jr. High classroom in which one kid brings a condom to class and the entire class breaks out in laughter. Never would have happened. Kids in the 30's had no earthly idea what a rubber was, not even in New York. I grew up with radio and the movie showed how much affect it had on the daily life of all Americans. It accurately depicted the morals of the country back then, not like some more modern films that like to distort what America once stood for. Hats off to Woody for this one.
