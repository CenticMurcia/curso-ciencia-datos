Why, oh why did I see this horrible film? Well, it was purely because I am trying to see the films of the great auteur, Ray Dennis Steckler--one of the most craptastic directors/producers/actors in motion picture history. I fact, I have, on a lark, decided to see as many of the films of a group of craptastic film makers--including Al Adamson, Arch Hall (Junior and Senior), Larry Buchanan, Ed Wood, William Grefe and a few others. These men all shared many wonderful traits--the ability to make films for almost nothing and a complete ineptness that makes many of their films unintentional laugh riots. However, not all of their films are laughable messes--some are just nasty, horrible films--like THE Hollywood STRANGLER.<br /><br />What makes this film so unpleasant and non-funny is that the film, though inept, is also a bit like being inside the mind of a sex pervert murderer--and seeing his depravity up close and in person. Sometimes seeing crime is interesting--this is more like being and experiencing the murders first-hand--a nasty proposition indeed. Some may like this but mostly it just felt sleazy and sick. And, there were lots of assorted murders (stabbings, suffocations, etc.) and tons of gratuitous nudity--with women who looked rather skanky.<br /><br />Overall, the entire film was handled so poorly, even the voyeurs out there will be disappointed. That's because when Steckler made the film, it was silent! Sound was added later as well as a voice-over dialog as well as occasional "Popeye Speak". In other words, voices were added in some scenes and the voices were too soft and rather garbled--sort of like the way Popeye talked to himself in cartoons! It all is very bizarre and very cheap. The only saving grace to all this is that the film is rather short.<br /><br />A terrible film in every way. And, for that matter, I worry about anyone who would actually get enjoyment out of this thing. It's just nasty and stupid--a rare combination.
