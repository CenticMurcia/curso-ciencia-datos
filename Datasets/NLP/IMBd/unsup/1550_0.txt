In 1840, America's line life is the sea, with an intense commerce. In Key West shore, two ship savage companies dispute the wrecked vessels. The honest one belongs to the impulsive Loxi Claiborne (Paulette Goddard) and Capt. Phil Philpott (Lynne Overman) and the other one is owned by the unscrupulous pirate King Cutler (Raymond Massey). While rescuing the crew of the ship "Julliete", wrecked on the reeves by the First Mate Mathias Widgeon (Victor Kilian), Loxi falls in love for Captain Jack Stuart (John Wayne). She travels to Charleston to defend Jack and convince the ship owner to give the position of captain of the new steamship of the company, manipulating the powerful shipping company lawyer Steve Tolliver (Ray Milland), who also falls in love for her. This triangle of love leads Jack Stuart to bad and fatal choices.<br /><br />"Reap the Wild Wind" is another great film of this great director and producer Cecil B. DeMille. The story is a triangle of love full of adventure, drama, suspense and romance. The use of the Technicolor is amazing, being this movie nominated for Best Cinematography, Color, and Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Color. Awarded in Best Effects, Special Effects, shows a spectacular fight of Jack and Steve against an octopus in the end, in a wrecked vessel. The performances of the gorgeous and spontaneous Paulette Goddard, the intelligent Ray Milland, the naive and precipitated John Wayne, the villain Raymond Massey and the funny and smart captain Lynne Overman are outstanding and very well supported by a fantastic cast. The lines are also excellent, having right doses of humor. In my opinion, this movie is absolutely underrated in IMDb. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Vendaval das Paix√µes" ("Gale of the Passions")
