Oh this was just HORRIBLE! I am still puking! Can you imagine if the flying turtle dropped a speeding turtle turd on you while you were in your row boat? I think this was based on a true story. Apparently there was an over-sized turtle that lived in the Pacific Northwest that had a neck that put most porn stars to shame. He was accepted by the locals and soon became a charter and rented himself out as quick mode of transportation. I saw this flick on HBO one night and was completely blown away by the special effects and dialogue. When the credits rolled, I had a tear in my eye and was wishing that it wasn't over and that there might be a chance of a sequel.
