Bananas age better than this trainwreck of a movie. You know those soft porn movies that Cinemax airs really late at night?? They're better than this.<br /><br />I suppose it was audacious and cutting-edge in '74, but now it's just silly and boring. You keep waiting for it to get better but it never does. The parts that could be funny never follow through on their potential. (the green light they shine on Drac's face when he realized the blood he's just sucked out of another pathetic daughter's neck is kinda funny, tho. And the only laugh the whole movie got out of me.) The sex is even boring. The women are vague and too willowy. The studly farmhand boorish and bland.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.<br /><br />Total, pretentious claptrap.
