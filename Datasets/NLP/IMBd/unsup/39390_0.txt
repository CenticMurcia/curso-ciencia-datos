I love foreign movies from all over the world. But this movie from Thailand nearly made me to hate movies from Thailand the way I hate Hollywoood movies. But, I will not, I will continue to watch movies from Thailand and I will even give it a try and watch another movie from Weerasethakul.<br /><br />At first, I thought to myself, how in the heck did such a movie even win an award. This movie looked like some amateur movie made by some amateur director. I had to research this director and found out that he is a respectable person in the world of artistic movies. I was really disappointed, that somebody of his caliber could make a movie this horrible. There is no story, nothing, nada. What was he trying to tell us? The only redeeming aspect of this movie is cinematography, the landscapes are beautiful and the scene where the couple are having a picnic is breathtaking. Also the scene at the river is amazing. That is the only good thing I saw in the movie. The movie lacked passion, no emotion. Even the stupid sex scenes were virtually empty, at least you'd expect people to show some emotion here. But, NO! nothing! To add insult to injury, the movie dragged on for a good 2 hours! I just wish the people who awarded this awful movie could just explain to me what they found award-worthy. Maybe I missed it, I am no expert in movie making and all BUT I know a good movie when I see one, and Blissfully Yours is NOT one of them.<br /><br />NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!
