I was blessed to have seen this movie last night. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me love life. <br /><br />This movie is a great movie that depicts a love of a father for his son. Will Smith did an incredible job and deserves every accolade available to him. His son also did a fantastic job.<br /><br />There is a great lesson that is learned in this movie and it truly shares the struggles of everyday life.<br /><br />This movie was heart felt and touching. It was truly an experience worth having. Thank you for making this movie and I look forward to seeing it again.
