I loved this movie! It moved me, made me laugh and cry and appreciate love, hate, and compassion. Juliette Binoche is the narrator of this story, she is the one who presents the events from her perspective, but incorporates other into it. This movie has wonderful symbolism that is expressed in so many ways. Whether it is a horse, a ship, or people marching, the different expression of movement and the implication of each and everyone of those is vividly portrayed. Also Binoche's view and adoration of her husband and her compassion to the prisoner is so real, so touching. At times, the viewer along with the narrator seems uncertain of feelings expressed toward Jean and Neel and the camera plays with the viewer's mind allowing him to suspect the worst and be pleasantly surprised. This movie has a very gloomy setting, but really the feelings expressed, the magnitude of love is so powerful that the dull surroundings do not strain the viewer. I thought this movie was phenomenal because it expressed the best of human nature in such real ways. It showed that not everything is black and white, not everyone is jealous and vengeful and finally people do have a sense of obligation and honor. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is up for a serious, beautiful and sad movie.
