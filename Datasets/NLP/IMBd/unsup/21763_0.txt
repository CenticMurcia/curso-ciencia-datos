Once again, Wes Anderson has created a film that has interesting and odd, including its character, script, and plot. He returns to familiar themes of family (mainly mending relationships with parents/children). The movie is not always easy to understand and the ending may leave some seeking more. There is character development, but there seem to be some holes and the plot seems to jump forward at times. But for those who can comprehend metaphors and tolerate ambiguity, viewers may leave the film satisfied.<br /><br />As usual, the movie's charm comes from its oddball characters, and script and thanks to the cinematographry and colors of India, it is a beautiful movie to watch.
