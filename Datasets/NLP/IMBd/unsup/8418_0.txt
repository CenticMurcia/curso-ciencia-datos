This film is just too cheesy for words. It makes a great laugh at the silliness movie, and everything in it is silly, so you'll be laughing a lot.<br /><br />Firstly there's Jan Michael Vincent, He's so wooden an actor and with George Peppard along too you have the makings of a whole forest.<br /><br />Then there's the ludicrous vehicles they travel in. What's with the flipping wheels?<br /><br />The special effects are weak. The scorpions look exactly like what they are - real scorpions superimposed onto the film.<br /><br />Very silly and very funny. Watch whilst getting drunk.
