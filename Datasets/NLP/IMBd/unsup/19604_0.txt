My criteria for a true bad movie is one that is either just plain boring or just plain stupid. Highlander 2 is an example of the latter, while Devil Monster is a pretty good example of one that's just boring.<br /><br />This cheapie is another movie that's basically ten minutes of story and fifty minutes of travelogue. Too much nature footage detracted from the already-scant story. The story that's there is pretty much just a minor melodrama, probably more at home in a silent movie (in which most of the principal actors would've also more at home). About the only really interesting bit is the fact that the hero doesn't get the girl at the end. Most of what passes for special effects are just crudely done opticals, but they don't really detract from the film as much as one would think.<br /><br />I'd love to see The Sea Fiend (the movie from which this one was edited) to see if what they took out made things go any more interestingly.
