Let's take a few snaps-pots of this film:<br /><br />- she sends a picture of her naked boyfriend to her family - when asked if she had an affair with the guy at the florist she replies oh no ! I just gave him a blow job - this guy will later in the film describe that it was like sex between sister and brother - her father has a gallery filled with sexually explicit and obscene paintings,he salivates at the name of orgasm, cunnilingus and is ecstatic when saying: sex good - at the party the guy who sits next to the main male character starts stray away to speak about women pubic hair <br /><br />Please, I am French, I know a lot of French people, I have been to lots of parties in Paris and know a lot of uninhibited people, but the description of French sex obsessed people in this film is grotesquely twisted and exaggerated. <br /><br />Like the description of the taxi drivers being stupid racist and fascist dick heads,is clearly over the top.<br /><br />As a French person I almost fell offended in front of this accumulation of stupid stereotypes.<br /><br />Please avoid.
