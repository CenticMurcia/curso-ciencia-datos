My original review was mean. Yeah, this show is stupid. The farm animals do stuff when the farmer isn't looking. If you want something that might make you smile, watch the movie. The show has is moments. It has progressed with humor, but still clich√©. Personally, I don't like the show or the movie much, but this is something you can watch if there really is "nothing on". Nothing special, that's why it doesn't play much. This isn't a show trying to be nominated for an Oscar, so just sit back and watch. Let loose and enjoy yourself. If you laughed, admit it. Just because the majority of the show may not make you laugh, don't be so negative. Think positve. If you laugh, at least say you did.
