This is a heart wrenching movie that examines the paths that separate women throughout the years (1950's to present) take when faced with an unexpected pregnancy. Regardless of where on the abortion spectrum you fall this is a must see. I would not recommend this as a child appropriate movie(especially for children under about age 12) unless you and your child are going to sit down and discuss what happens in this movie.
