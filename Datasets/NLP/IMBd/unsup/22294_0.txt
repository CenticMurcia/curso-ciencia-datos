I cant remember if I watched 5 or 6 seasons,but I do remember that I thought the series was very funny for a while,but then it became a little more confusing and darker (I liked the first computer best),I don't know if its just me but I felt it was almost depressing watching the later seasons. maybe the whole series just got too absurd for me.. and c'mon people,is it really that funny every time someone says smeg head? is this a British thing maybe? I also feel the acting is poor,not really funny characters,well rimmer is a little funny, the cat too,but lister is terrible. but it had its moments I admit, the idea is really great and its cool that it looks so cheesy and low tech,but the crew should have consisted of other characters. Imagine David brent and Gareth (from the office)on a space ship, that would be funny!
