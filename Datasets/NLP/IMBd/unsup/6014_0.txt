I am a HUGE fan of all 4 of the main actors in this film. They have all made films that are high on my list of favorites. My expectations for this film were, therefore, VERY high. All of these actors are capable of elevating mundane roles and films into something special. Unfortunately none of them can do so in this film.<br /><br />The comments of rhoda-1 are most illuminating. Changing the motivations of the characters in the original Somerset Maugham play results in a very unsatisfying movie. (I would love to see the original play!)<br /><br />The situation in this film is the same as My Favorite Wife (and the mediocre remake, Move Over Darling) - except the male and female roles have been reversed. But there the similarity ends. In My Favorite Wife, Cary Grant wants to restore his first marriage to Irene Dunne. Ditto in the remake with Rock Hudson and Doris Day. Both Grant and Hudson are motivated by the desire to let the second wife down easily. By contrast, in Too Many Husbands, the normally lovable Jean Arthur plays a character who at first seems torn between her two husbands, but increasingly seems to just bask in the egocentric pleasure of having two men pursue her. This motivation completely undermines the sympathy I initially had for her. By contrast, I am completely sympathetic with the erstwhile husband and wife in the other two films.<br /><br />In addition, while there is some clever dialog in Too Many Husbands, it is too scant. Most of the time the characters are just sophomoric. Jean Arthur reverts to a flirty schoolgirl leading-on two schoolboys. Unfortunately both Fred MacMurray and Melyn Douglas behave accordingly. The furniture-jumping scene is painful to watch. Nothing of this juvenile nature happens in My Favorite Wife (or Move Over Darling).<br /><br />This one trick pony becomes all the more annoying when the end arrives without any resolution. It is as if the viewer has simply been watching the beginning of a perpetual competition between two high school boys pursuing the same girl.<br /><br />Basically this film is disappointing because Jean Arthur becomes pretty unsympathetic, the 3 characters in the love triangle are all sophomoric in the extreme, and there is no resolution at the end of the film.<br /><br />I absolutely love both romantic comedies and screwball comedies. Too Many Husbands is an insult to both. It is ANTI-romantic and not screwball but sophomoric, slapstick silliness. What a total waste of incredible talent.
