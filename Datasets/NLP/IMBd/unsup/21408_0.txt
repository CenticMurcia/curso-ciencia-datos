I really think all teenagers should watch this at the beginning of their high school days.It will make things a lot easier for them due to the message of this film.Its about saying "screw'em" to the world and to just be yourself and that its OK to be abnormal because "there is no normal".Every teenager suffers from Self Esteem problems but after watching this film they should feel a lot more relaxed within themselves.From touching scenes to funny set pieces it has something for most people and will leave you with a nice feeling inside,how many movies do that these days where its all doom and gloom and ridiculous scenarios.This is also a very well acted movie and is lovely piece of work overall.
