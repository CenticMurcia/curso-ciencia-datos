I would really like to know if this mckenzie-c guy had anything to do with the production, because none of the positive attributes he states in his review are in this boring clich√©d nonsenical disasterpiece. Technically it's one step up from The Bonesetter, I'll give Brett Kelly that much. But that's hardly a compliment.<br /><br />After accidentally running over his girlfriend Amy with his car bumbling everyman Steve uses an ancient spell to revive her. Stop me if you've heard this plot before(like from "My Boyfriend's Back) but Steve then proceeds to hide Amy's current undead state from his friends and family. Therein lies the only joke,and no one's laughing.Ultimately My Dead Girlfriend is done in by bad writing and the amateurish performances. All the actors were friends of the director no doubt. At least Bonesetter had a more original premise.
