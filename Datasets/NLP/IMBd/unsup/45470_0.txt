Oh boy! If this 'documentary' was made by a schoolchild, there's an outside chance I would have found their methods of stirring the pot funny.<br /><br />But, come on! What the hell do these nuts take the viewers for? Did they make it for school children? Hang on...yeah, that's it! They made it for school children. I get it now. Sure, what they are trying to do is question power...but it only just dawned on me how clever these guys really are.<br /><br />They have stooped to school child levels so that they can secure the attention of the young. That's good thinking. By getting young people thinking critically a seed is planted.<br /><br />Anyway, that's the only way this film can be praised.<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty childish.<br /><br />But hang on a minute...I heard someone say the other day that 95% of the world's population don't think...that they are infants...that the world has not progressed to adulthood.<br /><br />Maybe this whole documentary is extremely well targeted. Maybe 95 out of 100 people who see it will get the message.<br /><br />I got the message.<br /><br />But I thought the 'Yes' men were a bit self indulgent.<br /><br />They flew all over the world, they giggled like schoolgirls and they loved the camera.<br /><br />They hammered the nail into the wood, but at the end of the day it was a little bent.<br /><br />If you guys really want to stir the pot, and make us dumb viewers think...then do it better. You're the stars, you're the talent, you're intelligent and witty...make a 'The Yes Men 2' and really get your hands dirty.<br /><br />And for the love of everything...stop giggling and carrying on like kids in a candy store.<br /><br />Don't you remember anything Yoda said?<br /><br />"An agitator must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind...Hmph...Adventure...Heh...Excitement...Heh. An agitator craves not these things. You are reckless." <br /><br />Or something like that.
