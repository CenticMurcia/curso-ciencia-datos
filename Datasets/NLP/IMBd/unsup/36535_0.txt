You might think a movie about conjoined twins would be wacky or even funny, but somehow the Farrelly brothers knew how to suck every bit of comedy out of a potentially hillarious film and leave the viewer with nothing more than a few sparse chuckles. Stuck on You could just as easily have been titled "Any other movie about small town brothers" because it makes no attempts to serperate itself from any other movie about brothers who have been together for most of their lives. Nothing new, nothing funnier, nothing inventive. I might have thought that the Farrelly brothers could have interviewed a few conjoined twins to get a little more perspective on their lives. I'm sure there are many aspects of their lives that the average person would find funny, just as there are funny moments in anyone's life that, if revealed, would get a good belly laugh from a crowd. My problem is that this movie is just like all of the others. Go see Bad Santa if you want to laugh this holiday season. 4/10
