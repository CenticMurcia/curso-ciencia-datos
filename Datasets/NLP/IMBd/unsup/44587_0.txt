I don't really think that letter would have gotten far, but it would be fun to try. Because this movie, is one bad piece of ****. But i really should see it coming when it starts and you see Dean Cain running. Dean Cain means crappy. At least in my book. And this movie is crappy with cream on it. I don't want to ruin the movie if you actually are going to watch it but i can say this. DON'T WATCH IT!!! Stay away from "The Glow". It is suppose to be a thriller movie with suspense but all it has is some old people with ugly make up. The movie has a lot of plot holes as would be expected and it isn't really worth anything except the off button on your TV. I rate this movie 2/10.
