[CONTAINS SPOILERS]<br /><br /> The Ninja Turtles are back with their friend, April O'Neil. She's going on vacation and has brought the turtles some gifts. She brought Splinter a sceptor. One used in ancient Japan.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, in 1603 in Japan. The evil warlord Lord Norinaga has<br /><br />taken control of the village. He has a rebellious son, Kenshin. Kenshin goes inside the temple, takes a sceptor and says "Open Wide, Gates of Time". Now I'm not exactly sure why he does this. Sorry. And soon it's the old switcheroo: April and Kenshin switch places.<br /><br />And clothes! Kenshin now wears April's leather jacket and April wears Kenshin's robes. The problem is soon identified. The sceptor has magic powers. It can transport beings through time. Leonardo announces they must go back and rescue April. Michaelangelo is cool with the idea, but wonders if they had pizza back then. Back in ancient Japan, everyone thinks April is a witch.<br /><br />Especially Walker, a sly devil who's in cahoots with Lord Norinaga. They<br /><br />put April in a cage. Back in modern day New York, Michaelangelo has brought in some heavy artillery: Casey Jones! Casey has been given the task of staying behind and keeping an eye on Kenshin while the turtles go back in time. Soon they are ready to go. They're transported into the places of four warriors riding horses in battle. They can't seem to get the hang of them. Michaelangelo is riding his backwards, rides into the woods and get's captured. He was also the one holding the sceptor so now it is gone. Michaelangelo also has an encounter with Mitsu, Kenshin's love interest. The three other turtles go looking for Michaelangelo in the temple. They adapt to the language--most unsuccessfully, and rescue April (it's what they live for). Also in jail with April was Whit, a man who looks remarkably like Casey Jones! They all escape together. The turtles also have an encounter with fury fighting warriors and whip them in their own creative style. Michaelangelo escapes from where we was being held captive. The turtles even save young Yoshi from a burning building. Michaelangelo does the risky job of going in and getting him, and Leonardo brings the kid back with mouth to mouth revelation. Raphael becomes good friends with Yoshi and teaches him to watch his temper, though he should be taking his own advice. The turtles know they must return to the future, or disrupt the time continueum and have a major paradox. Unfortunately, the sceptor is gone, so they build another one and quickly lose it. They find the original. They soon engage in a battle with the evil. They even send Walker right off a cliff. It was actually an accident on his part with a little help from Whit. Soon it's time to go. Michaelangelo<br /><br />doesn't want to go. Raphael is still gray on that decision, but Donatello wants very much to go. So does April. Leonardo is sort of in the middle. Suddenly, the sceptor is turned on. There is very little time remaining. Back in New York, Casey Jones had really gotten the four warriors that arrived in the turtles' places into hockey. He has quite some trouble getting them back, but he does. Michaelangelo is very hesitant and they disappear without him. Back to the sewer. The others find Michaelangelo gone, but he soon arrives. He's saddened about leaving his new friends and says he'll never smile again. That changes thanks to Splinter wearing a lamp shade and pretending to be Elvis.<br /><br /> This movie wasn't as good as the others. On change is that now Leonardo is the joke maker. He used to be the serious one, but now he's making jokes with the rest of them. Also, Corey Feldman is back! He couldn't make Part II because he was in rehab, getting off his heroine addiction. I'm glad Elias Koteas returns as Casey Jones. Movie probably would've been better if Casey had had a more major role in it. Anyway, I say it isn't as good as the othe
