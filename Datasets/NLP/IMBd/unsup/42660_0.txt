This movie starts with a good sense. Savina Gersak left her husband for some period. But her husband followed her. She gave ride to stranger. In the first look itself, the stranger looks creepy, but for her (Who is mad on her husband) he is like her brother. She is expression-less in most of the movie. At some point she was crying and there was no tear in her eyes. She did whatever Justin (The Stranger) asked him to do, never resisted. She became the hostage.<br /><br />Another thing, the cops are also not treated nicely in the movie. The villain took care of all cops except hero (husband of Savina Gersak).<br /><br />In the movie a continuous race is going on. People are left behind and they change vehicles but still catches another person. How come? After living here in US, I got to know that it's very difficult to chase another person if he is 1 hour ahead on the highway, but according to movie, it looks like that it ain't difficult. The villain changed vehicle from Laura's car to Bus, then ambulance, but Hero recognizes every vehicle. Again how, nobody knows.<br /><br />Plot was OK, but never got executed well.
