This was an really good movie.<br /><br />Acting: 8/10 For its genre pretty much as good as it gets. The lead actress Meiko Kaji is good and fits the part. The other actors are all alright also.<br /><br />Story: 9/10 I liked this story though it was not so complex which it wasn't meant to be. The only lacking thing was all the plot twists that were not needed at all and just made the end a bit weird.<br /><br />Action:10/10 I loved the action in this movie. I loved the sword parasol. And I loved the fountains of blood.<br /><br />Overall:9/10 I really liked this. Easy to sit through unlike some other old samurai movies. I love the story I love the music I love the acting.
