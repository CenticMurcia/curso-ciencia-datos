Few people know about this film and it has never received the critical attention it deserves. But do watch it. You won't be let down. It holds your attention from beginning to end. I also don't think there's been a film with so many actors cast against type. You could never imagine Omar Sharif and Gordon Jackson as German officers. John Gregson never lived down his Genevieve image, no shame in that, so it is actually quite shocking to see him as a Nazi assisting in plans for liquidating a ghetto ("I've ordered three times as many flame throwers just to be on the safe side"). Maybe it's not as realistic as Band of Brothers or Schindler's List but it was made 40 years ago. I wonder though why Harry Andrews wasn't credited? Was it because he was usually on the a British officer?
