I'm a fan of action films with lots of martial arts, so I know how to enjoy a brainless movie from time to time. But this one is so bad it's incomparable.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are typical and dull, always falling into the same pattern over and over again. The "story" can't entertain a viewer for more than 30 minutes because of the boring acting by most of the cast. If they can't even keep a straight face or tone of voice while making this, then why should I when I watch it, even though it's not meant to be comedy.<br /><br />Even if you manage to look past all that and try to enjoy it for the fights, it still disappoints: no original moves, lousy stunt work and 'enemies suddenly distracting each other so the main character can get away, even though all exits are locked' are some of the things that come into mind.<br /><br />Maybe in the end my expectations were too high, but then again, how low do I have to set my standards to be able to enjoy a movie? I will never see a movie written or directed by Jason Yee again.
