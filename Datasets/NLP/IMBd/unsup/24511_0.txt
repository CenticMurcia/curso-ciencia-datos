The plot is really poor... A mixture of "I know what you did last summer", "blair witch project, and so on...<br /><br />You can't compare this movie to a Hollywood movie!<br /><br />But when you compare this movie with Austrian movies from the last 10 years, you will see, that Austrian movie makers try to reach an "international level". Special about this movie is the fact, that the spoken language is not "German German" but "austrian German". This may be a reason, that many Germans can't stand this movie.<br /><br />I like this movie, because it is the first step to a new age of Austrian movies.
