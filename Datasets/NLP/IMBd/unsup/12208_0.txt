If you take a close look at the scene where Lucy climbs out the window the second time she's wearing pants pajamas but as she's walking across the store it shows her with a gown. You will notice when she puts her leg out the window it quickly shows no pants. I enjoyed the movie numerous times. I recommend it to a soft heart person who cares for the contents of the movie not the actors. It's for anyone who adores the Beatles or Sean Penn as I do.
