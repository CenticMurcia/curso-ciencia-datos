This is a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone, just not whole-heartedly. You see, it was far from great as there were a few plot problems that got in the way of my complete enjoyment. First, it was very hard to believe that when the school teacher found evidence of who the serial killer was, she would keep this to herself--even if she did like the person a lot. Secondly, the film only had one or two plot twists and there really were no other potential people portrayed in the movie who could have been the murderer, so the identity of the actual criminal wasn't in much doubt--even when a little plot twist was added to make you possibly doubt it was really him. No, to be an exceptional suspense film, there must be more dead-ends and twists--this movie just didn't offer surprises. What I DID like about the film was the romance. I would have MUCH preferred to see this played out instead of the whole serial killer angle.
