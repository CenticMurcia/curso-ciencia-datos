I had never heard of this movie, but boy was I disappointed in it. The plot really didn't make sense, and the actors weren't really given enough decent material to work with. Actors like Michael Lerner (who I loved in Barton Fink) and Paul Giamatti (take your pick; he's a great character actor) were wasted in this seemingly pointless exercise in filmmaking. I think the humor was supposed to stem from the odd "situation" of two ordinary guys cracking safes, but it didn't ring true. Good or great comedy is supposed to make you forget that the situations are implausible or impossible, but "Safe Men" just reminded you the whole time that this could never really happened. It wasn't one of those absolutely painful films that makes you groan, but it is the kind of movie I just couldn't wait to see end. "Meet the Parents", John Hamburg's second effort as a writer is much funnier and much better, so don't count him out as a comedic force in the future, but BLEECH!
