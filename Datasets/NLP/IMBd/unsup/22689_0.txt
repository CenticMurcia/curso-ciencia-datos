I discovered this show years ago and wow is this funny! Unlike the American version, this show had no restrictions and anything goes with the improvisers. Also unlike the lame version of todays "Whose Line", the games at times where played by other improvisers that made things fresh. Song styles before becoming about the same thing every time by Wayne Brady, were actually funny and were about different things. I remember when Mike McShane and Josie Lawrence did a song styles and the song was about kitty litter. Greg Proops did news flash once in a while instead of Colin all the time, and I loved the game Helping Hands. My personal favorite improvisers are: Paul Mertin, Tony Slattery, and Greg Proops. The ongoing war between Greg Proops and Clive Anderson was always funny, how the improvisers will say that Clive has no neck, and Clive Anderson is a MUCH better host than O SO BORING Drew Carey.<br /><br />The Last Word: The British Version Ruled. Want decent improv without the restrictions and with humor? Tune in, It rules.
