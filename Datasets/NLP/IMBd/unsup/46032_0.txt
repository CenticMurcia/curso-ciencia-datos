Every scene of this movie hit you over the head with the fact that it was - indeed - a movie. I could never believe that Walken was a hardbitten mercenary anymore than I could believe that a tinhat dictator would be so easily overthrown, or so given to fits of cowardice.<br /><br />And the battle scenes all seemed to be exactly what a movie version of war would look like. Lots of carefully placed explosives, lots of propane torches to simulate fire, and lots of schmaltzy acting in all the death and dying.<br /><br />And then the film just sorta ends with little or no real conclusion. The fight was over and the credits rolled up. Ho hum. Why did they bother?
