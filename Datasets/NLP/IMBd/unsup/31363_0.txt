I didn't expect much from this DVD picked up in a remainder bin. I was in for a delightful surprise.<br /><br />Based on a stage play by David Grieg, the story draws together the main theme of Leo Waters, played with nuance and emotional subtlety by Anthony Paglia, the architect and his design of a building project several years ago and his subsequent disconnection from it, reflected in the disconnection from his wife, Julia (Isabella Rosellini) who is completely underused, and his children.<br /><br />The film begins with Leo's son, Martin, dropping out from college. Martin is troubled, furtive and secretive.<br /><br />Viola Davis is the activist in the projects, eager to tear down the buildings and get the area cleaned up who butts heads with Leo.<br /><br />Hayden Panatierre plays the teenage daughter just coming into her own sexuality and experimenting in bars and stranger hookups unbeknownst to her parents. An excellent performance.<br /><br />How all these threads come together, and in some cases come apart, is the heart of the movie. The audience is expected to think and draw their own conclusions and the ending is very satisfying, an emotional confrontation between a father and son.<br /><br />The cast are flawless as is the script and the quick incisive simultaneous snapshots of different scenes move the story arc forward.<br /><br />8 out of 10. Not to be missed.
