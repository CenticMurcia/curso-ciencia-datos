When I first heard of this movie I thought it was goingto be an awesome time-traveling movie with lots off dogfighting featuring WW2 Japanese planes on American jet action!But do I get that? HARDLY! I found this movie boring and unimaginative. I mean, fantastic, COME ON! I could pull more fantastic sh!t outta my @$$ with less material! It has a good premise but doesn't strecth the limits of imagination. I'm not saying this is the worst part, but this movie isn't really that great. It could never sdtand up to time traveling greats like Back To The Future or H.G. Well's The Time Machine. In my opinion, go with The Philly Experiment, It looks, and feels more interesting...
