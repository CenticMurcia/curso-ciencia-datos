The Secret Garden is easily one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I loved it as a child and still find it absolutely amazing now. It has a wonderful cast. The young people in it are fantastic, performing better than I would ever have expected from people their age. The adults are also fantastic - especially Maggie Smith, she never disappoints me, and I think this is one of her best performances yet. The entire setting of the film is reflects the wonder and magic that have made the book by Frances Hodgson Burnett a classic. The images of the garden itself are absolutely stunning, it is almost worth watching the film just to see the beautiful landscape and architecture which is featured in it. If you want to escape the real world for a few hours I would definitely suggest this film. I just can not believe it wasn't the massive hit that it most definitely deserved to be!
