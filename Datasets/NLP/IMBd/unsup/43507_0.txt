Katrina (Emily Barcley) is a sad, pathetic, utterly narcissistic young unwed child neglecting mother. The only true love of her life, her brother, has been sent to prison for beheading some poor convenience store attendant, and she's angry about that. Angry enough to do something drastic.<br /><br />This film was competent enough and kept my interest, but the main characters are so completely devoid of likability or sympathy that it's too hard to empathize with them. There for I didn't get invested in them, much less give a toss about what they were doing. It's marginally well acted and all that, but I just didn't care.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Emily Barclay provides the T&A <br /><br />My Grade: C-
