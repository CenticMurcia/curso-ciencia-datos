I watched this film when it screened during the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, and I couldn't stop laughing at Spencer Spector's get up. Joe Cortese rips up the screen as the gay movie producer and I think his performance was one of the more memorable ones to date. Watch for his interactions with the lead Silvio who becomes his total puppet with his questionable intelligence.<br /><br />The entire film was well shot, the casting was great and it was fun seeing all the bad guys coming altogether in this, especially Tom Sizemore, who also rips it up! I enjoyed this and I'm glad I stayed up to catch the midnight screening. Oh and the twist threw me for a loop too, would never expected that!
