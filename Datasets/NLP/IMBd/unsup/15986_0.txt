I have NO words to describe HOW WELL this movie has been made. This movie rediscovers the beauty of LOVE, long after the success of DDLJ, when creativity started dwindling with more and more movies trying to replicate it rather than coming up with something altogether different or FRESH. With a very good cast, a nice blend of wit and sentiment, and many other pluses, this romantic comedy remains as enjoyable and charming as ever. The fluffy but pleasant story benefits greatly from the director's touch, since he had the knack of giving significance to little things without taking them or himself too seriously. Presenting his characters honestly yet sympathetically, he makes the somewhat contrived situation seem believable and worth caring about.Wonderful movie with super hit songs. A must see movie for all movie lovers.I'd recommend the DVD if you don't know the language.
