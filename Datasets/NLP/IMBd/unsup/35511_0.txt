I used the hypnotherapist Kyrah Malan, when she was in Sacramento and got great results with my goals. I went back to her for other goals and it always worked for me. I know it was more than just voodoo because I had tried to loose weight for 20 years before then and nothing had ever worked. She was always really nice and professional. I know that she works on a donation basis and does a lot of charity work not charging people for her services when she feels they really need the help and couldn't otherwise get it. When I found this site and watched the clip I told my friend (who had told me about Kyrah) about this show and she said NONE of the women in the breast enlargement study had to pay a dime. Penn & Teller made it look like they had to pay money. She also said the woman who didn't notice any difference never attended any of the sessions or did the things she was supposed to. I bet they edited the program to make her look bad and so they could make fun of her. If someone is a fake their fair game, but why find a hypnotist who is good and then try to make them look bad? In my eyes that makes them (P&T) the liars and fakes.
