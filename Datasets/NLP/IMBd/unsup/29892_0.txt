I actually own a mix of over 40 old and new martial arts movies. I have also seen recent productions like City of Violence(Korea)and Kill Zone(china)and despite my great exposure to the genre this movie's boldness in comedy, creative and action makes it stand out as the most fully entertaining action movie in a few years. I have seen ong bak, the protector, and born to fight all form the same director and enjoyed all three very much. This movie fits right in; yet still stands out because of the originality, at least in the west, of its story. The main actor was very good and convincing in his fighting. I think the director is the among the best fight action choreographers and photographers in the movie industry second only to matrix legend yuen woo ping and tied with Corey Yuen.
