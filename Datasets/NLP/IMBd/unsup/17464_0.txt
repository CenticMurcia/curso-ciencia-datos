1-Ichi origin is from the Japanese comic. A great prequel to the story of "Ichi the killer". It is a stand alone so even if you have not seen "Ichi the killer", you won't have a problem understanding this one. The fight scenes are great with lots of violence and blood. A short summary of the movie: It is about a Japanese high school student wanting the title of being the best fighter. Ichi is the best fighter because he can fight with quick speed. A great plus is that the actor who played Ichi is the same actor of the movie "Ichi the Killer". This movie is not quite as violence and graphic as "Ichi the Killer" but the story and the fight scene are great.<br /><br />
