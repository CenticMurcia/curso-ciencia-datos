This cartoon adaptation of Dicken's "A Christmas Carol" is relatively unknown, compared to creators Bass and Rankin, Jr.'s more famous "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer." It came relatively late in the cycle of original prime-time animation for television - before video eliminated the market. But it's no less memorable than its predecessors. A high-powered cast for this type of cartoon - particularly Matthau - helps enormously. The animation is fine, but the songs are really a standout. Neglected, and unjustly so.
