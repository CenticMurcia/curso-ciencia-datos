Given the meager quality of a good part of the third season, that's what this feels like.<br /><br />I can live with a dimension-crossing paranoid maniac. I can live with him being a threat to the immediate area, several solar systems, maybe even the galaxy.<br /><br />But the universe?<br /><br />I don't even want to talk about the basic flaws in the whole matter-antimatter plot point, but 150-200 lbs of matter and antimatter wouldn't take out the universe.<br /><br />The dilithium bit I can live with. They were still getting their feet wet on the technology, deciding what exactly this and that could and couldn't do. I just grind my teeth a little during those scenes.<br /><br />The thing I just absolutely can't buy is the solution. Toss Laz A in with Laz B and let them duke it out for eternity?<br /><br />The ship has phasers. Take out his ship. No ship, no doorway. And if you're afraid he might build another one, you have two choices.<br /><br />#1 - Lock him up for the rest of his natural life, doped out on thorazine to the gills. #2 - You've got a phaser in your hand, he doesn't, and what happens on Planet Vegas stays on Planet Vegas.<br /><br />Still, though, not as bad as Spock's Brain. Or Wink of an Eye. Or Spectre of the Gun. Or.... well, you get the idea.
