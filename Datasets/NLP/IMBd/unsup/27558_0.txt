This show is great - pure entertainment. It's updated and different and has beautiful women and a good story line. The sets and costumes, for a small-time TV sci-fi show, aren't bad. The characters from the various cantons show imagination and allow for varied stories. This show is s-o-o-o-o much better than Battlestar. OK, Flash is a little dippy, but, hey, look at the old Buster Crabbe movies. Could there have been a worse actor? I don't know who was worse Flash, Zarkov, or Ming. Yet they have endured the test of time, and clearly set the stage for the various Star Trek series. (If you look closely William Shatner as Captain Kirk copied Buster Crabbe's "shoulder run" - he ran with his shoulders.) I TiVo the Friday episode and can't wait until Saturday morning to watch it. It's like a trip down memory lane. Give Flash a break!
