Too bad they did not release a soundtrack CD because the music is the only redeeming thing about this movie. Imagine an unlikely cross between "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Redneck Zombies". Assemble a cast too physically unappealing (and too sleazy) to get work in the porn industry even though their acting skills are on that level.<br /><br />When both the director and the writer have their careers stalled for three years after a movie, it is a good indication that you will be viewing a truly staggering mess. Unfortunately the script kept only a bare outline of the Shakespeare play and replaced the rest with student film quality dialogue and plot elements. Most high school class project films are better than this-if only because they have a shorter running length.<br /><br />This is slightly more dull and mind-numbing than spending two hours observing a bunch of drones and wiggers indulging themselves at an actual club. If you are determined to stay with it until the end, and are searching for a way to maintain you sanity, you can focus on trying to figure out where the $1.5 Million budget went since none of it made it onto the screen.<br /><br />Obviously this movie is not for Shakespeare purists but neither is it for anyone with a few still active brain cells. The cinematography is high school MiniDV quality, the production design is accidental, and the editing supports the theory a lot of drugs made their way into the systems of the post-production staff. I am embarrassed to admit even watching it, oh the sacrifices I make for public service.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
