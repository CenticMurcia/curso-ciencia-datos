It's amazing to me how such a talented cast could be involved with such a ridiculously bad movie. Yes, guns are bad, but this film almost made me want to go out and buy one just to fire it at my television. The only thing this film made me think seriously about was whether or not I could go back to the video store and return it in time to get something else for free.
