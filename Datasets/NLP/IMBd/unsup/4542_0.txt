It was nice that this version followed so close to the actual book; Warner Brother's version didn't. I love this book and it was through the reading of this book that I realized "reading is fun". If you are going to adapt a classic I think you should be true to it and not mess with a good thing. This film does that and captures the heart of what the author wrote. I introduced my daughters to the movie first and later I read them the book; they didn't notice many differences except possibly the age of Sarah in the beginning. I would love to see this adaptation redone again on film instead of video so as to make it more lifelike (able to lose yourself in it without remembering you are watching a movie)and allow a new generation of children to try their hand at making Sarah Crew's story come alive. Also I look forward to the day it is released on DVD so that I can add it to my collection.
