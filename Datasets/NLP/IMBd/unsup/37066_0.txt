If so, I think I didn't get it. It was somewhat entertaining, but hardly funny. I just couldn't have fun with these people. Half the characters were obnoxious, rude, abusive bastards, and the other half were ineffectual, incompetent, mumbling, pathetic losers, or sometimes a combination of the two. And yeah, I know that can be funny sometimes, but this wasn't the kind of bunch I wanted to spend two hours with. I didn't like them, I couldn't find them sympathetic, I couldn't relate to anyone, I couldn't understand why they loved each other so much, and in the end I couldn't help but feel that none of them deserved the luck they had (which was a lot in some cases). All they did was argue, shout, fight, fight again, fight some more, insult each other, do stupid stuff for no reason... It wasn't funny at all, it just got tiring after a while. And believe me, I am NOT squeamish about bad language, but I found that the amount of it in this film was just too much to put up with sometimes. They way the characters overused it made you dislike them even more.<br /><br />I never quite understood the craze for writer David Serrano's previous film, El Otro Lado de la Cama, which was a huge hit here in Spain, and seeing this didn't change my mind much: he's overrated.<br /><br />(One positive thing I will say: Alterio's impressive performance as the menacing, borderline psycho Antonio does raise an eyebrow or two. No wonder he got several nominations for Spanish awards)
