I usually read the reviews of the users here on IMDb before I watch a movie.I have come to rely on this site for renting and watching films.When I saw the title of this film "The other side of heaven" I felt that the title was somewhat inspiring.After 5 minutes from the actual beginning, I kind of knew what direction it was heading.I still wanted to watch it though.I'm Christian Orthodox, but this has nothing to do with this film or with me thinking to better watch a sample from a movie after reading a review next time.<br /><br />I think that the film is well made...good acting, nice sets, good directing, but has an awful script.It is inspired by true events...I know...but then so are a lot of WW2 films...that doesn't mean that "poetic license" is not involved here.If in the WW2 films "poetic license" means political points of view...(he who wins the war writes the history (Churchill's was a genius!):D)in this case (the accent being put on the fact that the film is based on true events) I found that "poetic license" means...well,kind of bullshitting people.<br /><br />My opinion on this film is that it's kind of...a little propagandistic.There are some scenes in it that made me laugh a little...there's one about the missionary man kind of resurrecting a native child (was that food poisoning, or what?...food poisoning in the case of natives...they know what to eat with their eyes closed...never mind), scenes with the missionary man and his adepts on a boat, far out sea...dressed in suits, or on the beach, dressed in suits...(am I a dirty bastard, or does anyone else find it funny?)<br /><br />It's interesting though that it sheds light on the Mormon doctrine, rites and such, as well as the inner church bureaucracy.It is a very good effort, starting a bit shy, not saying anything about the religious aspect, then less and less shy until it really becomes very enlightening on these matters.This is not my first Mormon film, I saw another one, more interesting, "The princess and the Marine", about an Arabian princess being saved by a Mormon GI-Joe from her native country.I liked it very much. (also based on a true story).This I've got to hand it to you Mormon producers, you are very truthful. <br /><br />I am this "mean" because I really don't like to see propaganda in films.Films are made for people to enjoy and relax, not to attract new followers.I don't have anything against loving the man next to you, selfishness and dedication to a cause bigger than you and I, but this is really bullshit.This film is not about "loving the man next to you".This film is about "You can find God, and peace if you repent.Repent and God will welcome you with His arms wide open.".As proof of this, that I don't have anything against the Mormon religion,I'd have to say that I saw Salingrad (even though the film's made by "zie Germans" about "zie Germans", fuhrer and Nazi stuff mentioned in there, Sven Hassle style) and absolutely loved it, and I gave you another example with another Mormon film I really enjoyed in the last paragraph.So don't throw any rocks at me please.Just because I didn't like this movie doesn't mean that I don't like Mormons...I just don't like this film.<br /><br />As for inspiring...I find Happy Feet inspiring, and I don't have to necessarily be a penguin to say that, but this film, The other side of Heaven...let's put it this way...if you really want to sin, buy it.(you'll see what I mean afterwords, when you will see what you payed for) If you're a patient man/woman and you think that you can get past the "propagandistic" content, it's a well made film, I think, and if you really have nothing else to do, you might want to pirate it a-harrrr.Just kidding...never do something illegal...even in this case...watch it, and you'll see why (it's bad to do something illegal).Anyway, I hope I didn't bore you with this long review...If you will consider watching it, you will find that you do have your limits as patience is concerned...just don't pay too much for it.<br /><br />Have a nice day, and enjoy...
