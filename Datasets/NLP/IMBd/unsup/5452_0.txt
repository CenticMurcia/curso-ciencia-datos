I have probably seen every horror movie from excellent FX and totally stupid to low budget and actually good. Well, this is one of those low budget but and actually good. I have read many comments and a lot of complaints about the acting. No one is going to win an academy award, but the actors did a good job considering that the sound was probably not the best in the world and they were having to speak louder, which makes the acting not as good as it should be. I think if this movie had a descent budget it could have been actually really good. It was good considering the obstacles the actors had to go through and it was a good attempt to try to try a new idea.<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this movie. The nudity was not as bad as in many soap operas I have seen and the talk was not near as bad as the Exorcist or any stupid male bonding movie. I have heard worse.
