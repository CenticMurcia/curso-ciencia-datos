At first, Zach (Wil Wheaton sadly of Star Trek: The Next Generation fame) and his sister are the only two people in a very religious family that suspect that the meteor that recently fall from the sky is affecting the water in detrimental ways. However when the animals start acting crazy and the humans shortly following suit, the devout father begins to think it's God's curse for his wife cheating. As if that wasn't enough the family also must deal with a real-estate developer who wants to buy their land.<br /><br />Any Star Trek fan who wants to see Wheaton get a beat down (most likely all of them) will enjoy this film in parts (I must admit those parts were a bit cathartic for me. Other than that slight recommendation, this is just a sub-par B-horror film with laughable special effects. Maybe good enough for a rainy Saturday afternoon, MAYBE.<br /><br />My Grade: D+<br /><br />MGM DVD Extras: no real extras, but it comes with "The Curse 2" on Side B
