<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies. The story is well told, the characters work very well in the film and it's beautifully shot.<br /><br />It is also home to one of the funniest scenes of all time from a movie - the draft/registration for vietnam. I won't give it away, but it makes me laugh out loud everytime I see it.<br /><br />
