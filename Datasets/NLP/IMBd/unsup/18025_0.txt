I absolutely adore this movie. I loved the book, and the movie is a nice version of it. I saw it on TV about two years ago, but since then it hasn't been on and is fairly vague in my mind. I HAVE to buy the DVD soon, as it's a necessity for my collection. People with kids should buy this as it's a great way to introduce them to the world of Louisa May Alcott, but it's not just a film for youngsters. It even made me tear up, which is almost impossible for me, definitely a feel-good film. Lovers of the film Little Women will like this one too, they're very similar in different ways, minus the more famous actors that LW has. I'd give it a solid eight out of ten, highly recommended, and a great family film.
