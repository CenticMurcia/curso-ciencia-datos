Computer Bank Security man Harrison Ford is stuck in an unfortunate decision as his company is about to merge with another whose boss is Robert Patrick. That unfortunate situation is a group of thuggish criminals whose leader is Paul Bettany who holds Ford's family(including wife Virginia Madsen)hostage forcing him to encrypt moneys from his bank's wealthiest clients into a Caymen account or else suffer the consequences. Ford will have to find a way to match wits with Bettany and this film shows the cat and mouse game that ensues.<br /><br />Pedestrian, by-the-numbers thriller is about a predictable as they come following right in line with the same types of thrillers Hollywood churns out add nauseum. The cast doesn't have a chance to freshen not-very-ripe material. The uninspired story which tries hard to be slick, but comes off as improbable asking us to believe that Ford could be able to successfully do what he does. Madsen tries to bring life to the typical mother role she's saddled with and Ford tries to muster of his old mojo, but this film is just too ordinary. Bettany just passes time as his talent is squandered on a second-rate villain. Disappointing, unfullfilling thriller.
