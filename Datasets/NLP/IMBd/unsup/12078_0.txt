I enjoyed the movie.A few years ago I saw a documentary on F.T.Hopkins. Viggo is a favorite.It was good to see Omar Shariff.My sister's three kids are going to love the story of this.I do recommend it to any-one who likes westerns,horse riding and just general good fun.I liked the sand dunes.The different horses,land scape veiws.It shows what I thought to be more side of the Native American Indian.Beautiful colours in the horses.I think Viggos love and admiration for the horse shows in this film.It also shows an older part of amercia. I felt you can learn something from the film.There is a very good shot of the statue of liberty when he leaves his country for the race.Laurel
