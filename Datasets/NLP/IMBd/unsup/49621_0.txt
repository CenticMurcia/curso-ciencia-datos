How can a movie be this noisy and still put me to sleep? Is it the writing, which would have me believe:<br /><br />o An adventurer with seeming inexhaustible amounts of money would risk life and limb to GIVE away tons of arms and ammunition to `the revolution'? o That rebels would ride off and leave machine guns and light artillery pieces behind? o That Robert Mitchum, a prisoner scheduled to be shot, could hide two hand grenades in his jacket? o That Ursula Theiss, held hostage by seasoned rebels, would be allowed to keep a gun in her purse?<br /><br /> Ursula Theiss (Mrs. Robert Taylor) is pretty, but her love scenes with Mitchum lack spark. Far better is the interplay between Mitchum and Gilbert Roland, as well as his scenes with Zachery Scott and Jos√© Torvay (Gonzalez). In fact Mitchum's scenes with practically everyone but Theiss are better than his with her. Not very smart when the plot devices hinge on the Mitchum / Theiss relationship.<br /><br />Dull, dull, dull, and LOUD!
