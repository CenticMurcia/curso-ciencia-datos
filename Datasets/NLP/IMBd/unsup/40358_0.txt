This movie is so bad, and Jeffrey Comb's acting is so good, that my unborn baby popped out of me and slapped against the screen in a flood of blood and amniotic fluids! Curse you Jeffrey Combs! Curse your Oscar grade acting and damn you for still being sexy after all these years! The special effects were pretty good, however Mark Frost's face...well, it's definitely one of the signs of the apocalypse. My God, man, can you over-act any more? Also, I think it made me gay. Pregnant mothers and straight people beware, don't watch this movie or you'll be as bad as those monsters at the abortion clinics! And also you'll lead a deviant lifestyle! <br /><br />Signed Two Angry Bitc--Ladies
