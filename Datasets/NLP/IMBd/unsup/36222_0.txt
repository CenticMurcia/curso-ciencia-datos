I've been on a kick of seeking out "B" (and "C,"D" and "Z") DVD's from the dollar bins. So far, every choice has been a pleasant and surprising experience. This includes "The Bat". The DVD cover graphic shows both Morehead and "Vinnie" in publicity stills form the 1930's so I was expecting the movie to be from that era as well. Wrong! This flick would have been "retro" in 1949, let alone in 1959!! My jaw dropped when I saw a 1958 Ford and that "Jackie Kennedy-esquire" dress worn by Agnes Morehead at "the afternoon tea". A 1928 Packard with Margaret DuMont frock on Miss Morehead would have been more fitting. The embarrassingly overwrought and predictable plot and the wannabe "noir" photography was even more incongruous. But all these shortcomings are forgiven just to watch Agnes Morehead "chew the scenery"! She was truly one of the great stage actresses of the 40's and 50's, but in a low-rent vehicle such as this, she can only be described as the female "ham" equivalent of Olivier! And don't mention Endora! Just as Sir Alec Guinness shuddered for being immortalized by the wretched trash that is and was "Starwars", so did Ms. Morehead at being most-remembered as 2nd banana on such drivel as "Bewitched"...Bottom line, this DVD is worth the ride just for being an out-of-place-in-the-wrong-period, period piece...
