A big disappointment, this "save the newspaper story with one big expose against a corrupt politician" was boring - the ultimate sin in a film. Also, I found none of the characters likable: no one to root for, despite the presence of some famous actors I like. The cast includes Humphrey Bogart, Ethel Barrymore, Kim Hunter, Ed Begley, Warren Stevens and Jim Backus.<br /><br />Most of them simply talk too much and do too little. It also has a blasphemous scene early on when they hold a "wake" for the paper and smugly use Christian terms (i.e. "saved") irreverently, just to get some cheap laughs. I'm surprised they got away with this since the Hays Code was still very much in effect in 1952.
