While I am glad there is a movie such as this to help inform people about this sort of thing, there were a few things about the movie that angered me. while I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone...I was very angry what the real Michelle had to go through. Also, it was very disappointing that the criminal got such a light sentence. Anyone who commits this type of crime should be given harsher penalties otherwise, when they are released, they may just do it again. There just isn't enough being done about identity theft and frauds these days. A slap on the wrist is just not enough. Also, victims should NOT be afraid to fight back harder. Being scared when you see someone commit a crime against you is not going to stop criminals. If this had been me, (thank the Lord it wasn't) she would not have been able to get away. She would not have had the opp. to do some things she did.....
