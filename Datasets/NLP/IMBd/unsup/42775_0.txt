I really wanted to give it a positive rate as I really like Jackie Chen, but unfortunately, after watching it I can't, if being objective..<br /><br />The plot is weak, none of the characters are genuinely developed into real depth, and many of them just make you wonder where the heck is his/her place in the whole plot!?? The storyline is always being dragged and the fight scenes feel so redundant, I kept saying "please, please just use a gun to skip these!"<br /><br />I give Rob-B-Hood two more stars one for the lovely baby(he may be the most vivid character in this movie), one for the respectable dedication by Jackie(the overall failure should not be blamed on him). I'll be expecting Jackie Chen's next performance, and I'll also try to avoid the production from others in the crew..
