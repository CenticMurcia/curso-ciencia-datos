While 'Head' deconstructed the manufactured mania of The Monkees perfectly, '33 1/3' just wallows in its own self-awareness like a spoiled brat who didn't get a Playstation 2 for Christmas.<br /><br />'Head' is dated, but '33 1/3' showcases the worst commercial excesses of the decade. The "story" involves a Darwinistic plot to take over the world by way of pop music. The Monkees are created test-tube style and are expected to lull the human race into submission. The members of The Monkees try to regain their individuality during thinly-produced solo spots. Padded with VERY LONG solarized, split-screen psychedelic dance numbers, it's no wonder that the entire Hippie phenomenon would be over within a year of 33 1/3. The mass media had swallowed up the original 'message' of the movement, and 33 1/3 was what was it spit out.<br /><br />The worst crime perpetrated by '33 1/3' is a retro 50's number where rock legends Fats Domino, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis play second fiddle TO The Monkees. It's weird to think that when this aired, The Monkees themselves were complete has-beens.<br /><br />'33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee' ranks with 'The Star Wars Holiday Special' as one of the worst variety efforts ever aired. If you need a reason to hate The Monkees, pick this up.
