An incredible person suggested me and my brother to watch ''1 Giant Leap'', saying that the movie would be very inspiring for us. I started watching the documentary expecting something nice, but what I got was something beyond that: I found the documentary VERY good, and I felt happiness and joy after watching it, like a sensation of inner peace.<br /><br />With so many people collaborating with it, like artists, performers, writers and philosophers from different parts of the world,''1 Giant Leap'' is a project of two musicians (Jamie Catto and Duncan Bridgeman), showing different topics of everybody's life, like '' sex'',''religion'', ''Confrontation'', ''happiness'' and so on. Each person gives their sincere opinion and idea about a subject, and we see how so many people in different parts of the world are connected, even in a non voluntary way.<br /><br />Even people who are not into ' spiritual' themes will probably enjoy to watch this DVD. In my opinion it is a beautiful work of art, and I watched it 3 times only in the first 2 days having the DVD.<br /><br />I am not surprised to know that this documentary was nominated for two Academy Awards in 2003.Such a pity that it didn't received any award, because for sure it deserved!
