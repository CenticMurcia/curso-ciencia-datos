Horrible. Terrible. Awful. Words just can't describe this artsy, soft-core, sex-violence romp, passing itself off as an anti-war film with deep meaning. The characters are just that, "Characters". One is crazier then the next. Each is suppose to be haunted by a war that has just ended, making each a wild, out-of-control, sex-starved, bunch of psycho misfits. The acting is way over the top, cheesy, and basically terrible. Guy Pierce looks pale and sickly, and at one points climbs up a tree to scream at the moon in a lunatic howl. He must of seen the final result of his performance in this smelly mess. However, there are a few minor good points. A beautiful island, a host of sexy-long legged British beauties who can't wait to strip off their clothes, and even the legendary 1960s model, Twiggy, ardently kissing another women; bedding her down in the process. If you're looking for a great ant-war film, rent or buy Paths of Glory or MASH, and don't waste a cent on this mess.
