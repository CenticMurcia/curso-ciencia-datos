Directed by Richard Benjamin,My Favorite Year is a film that I saw for the first time a few months ago and loved instantly.<br /><br />I think it's so very underrated and that's a shame because it has so much to offer.The story is all about young assistant and aspiring comedy writer Benjy Stone(Mark Linn-Baker)who works at the 30 Rock Studios in the 1950's.<br /><br />Everyones excited by the news that a Hollywood legend the actor Alan Swann(Peter O'Toole)will be guest starring on one of their live shows a sketch about Muskateers.<br /><br />Well of course everyones thrilled but there's just one small problem....Alan is a notorious hell-raiser who has a reputation of being drunk when he's not working.So Benjy is set the task of staying with Swann to make sure he shows up for the show sober.<br /><br />And so begins a week he'll never forget as he's befriended by his childhood hero and learns a thing or two about life from a man who's seen it all and lives for today not tomorrow.This will have you laughing and crying I found it a fun and surprisingly touching and poignant film.<br /><br />Peter is just superb as the fading actor and I found it fun to see him play Swann as a mix of Errol Flynn,himself and I think there's some Douglas Fairbanks in there as well.Some priceless scenes involving him include Swann trying to go off with another mans girl at The Stork Club and an unforgettable incident involving a fire hose and an apartment building.<br /><br />Oscar nominated again for his work here Peter lost yet again and that's a shame because he's excellent and shows he has a real gift for comedy.Other performances to keep an eye out for include Lainie Kazan as Benjys mum Belle who tells Alan a few home truths and Lou Jacobi as Benjys Uncle Morty.Funny,poignant and well acted this is one that deserves more attention than it's had and is one to watch especially if you need cheering up a classic.
