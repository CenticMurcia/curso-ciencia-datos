Hard Boiled's stark cinematography of the nicotine stained Hong Kong night scene portrays the toughness and rawness of probably the greatest computer unaided action film made. As well, the cinematography supports the toughness of our hard boiled hero. <br /><br />Articulately directed, the care Woo shows is astounding. Every frame is some sort of slow mo, odd angle or intense bout of testosterone. Fueled by this pace the file contradicts a dream. Lasting hours but feeling like only seconds. <br /><br />Being so enthralled in the action I did not pay too much attention to the acting other than that to say it wasn't bad enough for me to notice nor great enough for me to be in awe. <br /><br />Scene by scene the action progresses hardly letting up during its long (about)30 minute end siege. "You can never get too much of good thing," would be an unfitting quote here. This constant, endless seeming, action sequence becomes redundant. As over and over people are getting shot or huge explosions are happening. Eventually it loses its adrenaline rushing touch.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film was the fact that the grisly, one eyed, psycho did not fit the stereotype. He cared for the innocent people. I was blown away by this never seeing it coming. First time I ever seen a character as such not fit his blood hungry stereotype. <br /><br />Too bad Woo ever came here. Hollywood has made him suck and looks like ruined what talent he had back during this film and the Killer's production. After watching Windtalkers im weary of anymore of his new films. In a nonracist way Woo should go back to China. 9/10
