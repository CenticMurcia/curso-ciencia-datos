CHUD only good point is the idea behind the plot. Monsters in the subway is a somewhat underplayed B-movie idea that could use some more cinematic tries. -- The movie drags a bit, and is somewhat mundane in its approach and execution, but is worth watching none the less. I only gave it a "4" though, maybe because the middle of the movie dragged, and I was expecting better special effects than the movie could deliver.
