This film is fairly enjoyable, but not special, and there are much better parodies out there. There are a few particularly funny moments, but many of the jokes fall flat, due to either poor delivery or them just not being funny. <br /><br />There are a few important flaws in this. One is that quite a few of the funny moments seem to be copies of better parodies. Another is he choice of target. Scream is one of the worst choices to parody, because it displays fewer of the cliches of horror, and highlighting absurdities is the whole point of parody.<br /><br />This is basically worth a watch, but there are a number of parodies that are a lot better than this. <br /><br />
