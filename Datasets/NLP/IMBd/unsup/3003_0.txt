Did anyone else notice how perfect the soundtrack to this movie was? The whole time I was watching, I noticed all the songs and the scene that they went with. The song when they go to the Ping Islands is a really good electronic song by Mark Mothersbough, and the second I heard it I knew I had to download it. So when I got back from the movie, I downloaded the whole soundtrack. Seau Jorge doing David Bowie songs is a plus too. Another thing I noticed about this movie is that me and my friends were the only ones to laugh during the entire movie. It was ridiculous how many people were in the theater compared to how much laughing came out of them, which was none. This movie is hysterical, and I don't know why they weren't amused.
