The original title of the film was going to be 'Sexual Perversity in Chicago' from David Mamet's stage play that this is based on, and the name change is understandable. Sexual Perversity is an intriguing name but it's also a bit too harsh. My biggest guess as to why the name was changed is because the film itself is nowhere near as intelligent or perceptive as a film with that risky a title should have.<br /><br />About Last Night explores the meeting of 20-something's Demi Moore and Rob Lowe and their relationship that follows. Moore is an advertising executive just getting out of a relationship with her boss. Lowe is working in a warehouse that ships restaurant goods. They meet during a baseball game and then again at a bar. Lowe invited Moore back to her place and they have sex and fall for each other, blah blah blah. Lowe's best friend (James Belushi) doesn't like this 'broad' - a phrase spoken constantly throughout; and Moore's roommate (Elizabeth Perkins) - is a cold hearted, selfish, cry-baby.<br /><br />Yes, that whole synopsis was mundane for a reason. About Last Night is not an interesting movie. We've seen how relationships form and progress and fall apart - so what does this film have to offer that's fresh and new? Well it's certainly not perspective. What we get are four young actors who whine, shout at each other, deliver bad one liners, and plain aggravate the audience.<br /><br />Who cheers for these people? There is no intelligence to these characters as in a scene when Lowe starts yelling at Moore because she won't throw her tampons away which 1 minute later results in Moore storming out of the apartment. Who acts like this?! Granted, I'm sure there is an audience for this movie as it currently has a 5.8 rating. I myself found no redeeming qualities in the characters, their actions, or in the film itself.<br /><br />I'm sure there are people out there in the world who act this petty and childish - but it's awfully hard to put up with these people for so long. The film itself clocks in just shy of two hours. There are not one, not two, but SIX montages. Including; <br /><br />The 'We're falling in love!' montage.<br /><br />The 'We're moving in together!' montage.<br /><br />The 'Our relationship is becoming deep and meaningful and full of sex clips' montage.<br /><br />The 'I'm Robe Lowe and where did I go wrong?' montage.<br /><br />There are two more. But I don't want to give away too much, although I'm sure most of you will be able to pick up on every little thing that will happen plot-wise after the first twenty minutes.<br /><br />And for those of you who have seen About Last Night there are many scenes that had me scratching my head saying "Why is THIS scene in the movie?"...The scene with Elizabeth Perkins reading to the children in her kindergarten class and then discussing sex briefly...That scene is just plain awful. Enough to make me see what other horrific moments this film would put me through. An excruciatingly annoying film filled with repellent characters. Lowe and Moore are pretty to look at, and if that does it for you, rent it. If not, avoid at all costs.
