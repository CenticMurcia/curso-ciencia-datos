Ten Inch Hero was like opening a present from your grandmother: like discovering that she got you an iPhone instead of the black socks you had prepared yourself to smile and be grateful for. In reality, that's exactly what this movie turned out to be - an unexpected surprise and a truly uplifting story - when realistically, the average viewer would have just been satisfied to ogle Jensen Ackles sporting a mohawk.<br /><br />The story of Ten Inch Hero, written by Betsy Morris and directed by David Mackay, is told through the genuine and poignant interweaving accounts of an unlikely group of friends. Set in a sandwich deli in Santa Cruz, the plot follows the lives of the off-beat employees as friendships are created and relationships are formed, damaged, then repaired. The focus of the movie rests mainly on four young characters: a young artist searching for her estranged daughter, a brunette temptress sleeping her way through California one man at a time, the quiet and reserved humanitarian looking for romance on the 'net, and last but certainly not least, the quirky but sensitive punk rocker searching for love and acceptance.<br /><br />Elizabeth Harnois gives an exceptional breakout performance as Piper, the artistic neophyte who introduces our 'Heroes' when she stumbles across the eccentric hippy-run diner and applies for a job on the spot, told "normal people need not apply". Harnois' role as a confused young mother searching for the daughter she gave up for adoption at the tender age of fifteen is heart-warming and emotional as she faces her fears and is rewarded in ways she never expected.<br /><br />Also new to the silver screen, Danneel Harris is amusingly wanton as the brunette bombshell, enticing the men of Santa Cruz to the buy sandwiches by the inch with a come-hither smile and unbearably cheesy pick up lines. Harris makes what could be a predictable character surprisingly dynamic as her relationships with her friends deepen and help her to grow, and eventually, realize her full potential.<br /><br />As Jen, the kind-hearted computer geek, Clea Duvall's performance is moving and surprisingly real. Jen is the quiet, saintly one of the boisterous group, known for giving hand outs to the homeless people of the community. Jen's transformation happens slowly throughout the movie, as she steps out from her sanctuary behind the computer screen to meet her potential true love, a man she has never met outside of a chat room.<br /><br />Finally, Jensen Ackles as hilariously witty and enigmatic Priestly is even more charming and adorable than expected, and well worth the wait. With a different wonderfully weird hairdo and hilariously outragious t-shirt in every scene, Ackles brings a deadly combination of sensitivity and hilarity to the character, leading up to a delightfully romantic ending that is sure to leave every woman in the theatre staring up at the screen in love-struck awe.<br /><br />Even without a star-studded cast (or anything remotely close), Ten Inch Hero is a diamond in the rough. The quality of acting comes as a welcome surprise, and the story has the audience roaring with laughter one moment and close to tears the next. Whether it turns out to be a sleeper 'hit' or not, Ten Inch Hero is unexpectedly gratifying and extremely entertaining, sure to leave a smile on the face of just about anyone who is lucky enough to see it.
