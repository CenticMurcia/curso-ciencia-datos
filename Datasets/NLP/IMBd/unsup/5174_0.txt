I was lucky enough to screen this movie a while back. The raw cut was very impressive. I thought it would be worthy of a future theater release. Comparable to the great Adam Sandler romantic comedies, but with more of an Animal House feel. This movie has many actors that you would recognize from other movies (like the dude driving the Jetta in fast and furious) or TV (like the hot chick in Entourage) and obviously Michael Douglas' son - Cameron. This is definitely not a talentless production, rather one of those rare occasions where a few young talented actors come together and show some signs of what will make them future movie stars. I cannot wait to see the final release. There are scenes in this movie that will bring a lot of us guys back to our college days. Also great for women who would like insight into the dumb things guys do and talk about when they get together with nothing but time on their hands; great times and lots of laughs. This movie catches this environment like few movies I have seen. Highly recommended.
