This film is quite amazingly bad. So bad that it's thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />The special effects are OK, sometimes they are quite good and they are always sufficient for the film's needs. The actors are generally capable but their performances are wooden. Is it the script? Is it the direction? I think it's both. The basic plot line is pure 1960s 'B' movie but whoever turned that into a script must have been on a deadline. Maybe the director realised that there wasn't much he could do to rescue it so just moved as quickly as possible from set piece to set piece.<br /><br />Best actor: Stanley Tucci's hairpiece.<br /><br />Best game: Guess which character dies next.
