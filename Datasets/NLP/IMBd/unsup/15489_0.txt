This is the first time I've seen Jerry get all this physical abuse, at least for the first three minutes of the cartoon. Why he chose to live inside a pool table in a pool hall in the first place is puzzling. What happened to his normal "house" inside the wall the house where he and Tom live?<br /><br />Whatever, he starts taking a pounding the first time a billiard ball goes into a pocket and winds up crashing on top of his little bed. When he comes out of the corner pocket, Tom spots him and really abuses him, even using him at the end of his pool cue. He takes a number of beating from the balls on the table. It's brutal but rare to see the mouse get it like this.<br /><br />However, enough is enough and he starts to fight back At that point, Tom gets brutalized but Jerry still gets it, too. <br /><br />This might be the most violent Tom and Jerry cartoon I've seen. Being a fan of this series, I am used to it and know it's only cartoon and much of the slapstick- violence is funny. However, some of things here are unbelievable, like Tom getting the entire cue shoved down his throat and Jerry getting an eight-ball rammed into his butt. For anyone who is a little leery of too much violence in cartoons, for either them or their kids, you are forewarned.
