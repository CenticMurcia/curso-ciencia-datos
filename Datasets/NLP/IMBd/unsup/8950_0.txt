"Summer's End" tells the story of a retired black doctor (Jones) who buys lakeside property in Georgia and finds himself reliving a long buried but not forgotten past. With the look of a made-for-tv flick and a somewhat obvious screenplay, "Summer's End", an earnest drama built around the Jones character's relationship with a young boy, serves as a reminder that racial prejudice in American lives on. A good watch for all.
