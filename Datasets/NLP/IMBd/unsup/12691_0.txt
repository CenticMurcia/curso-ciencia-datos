John Cromwell directed, David O. Selznick produced, and Ronald Colman, Madeline Carroll, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and David Niven star in the 1937 film "The Prisoner of Zenda." That's really all any viewer needs to know.<br /><br />Rudolph Rassendyll (Colman), King Rudolf V's identical cousin, is asked to impersonate the kidnapped future king (Colman) at the coronation. Otherwise, the crown goes to his younger brother.<br /><br />This is a top-notch film with a great performance by Ronald Colman in a dual role, something he was called upon to do during his career several times. Colman was an smooth actor of great charm. One of the comments (from a man, of course) asked if he was supposed to be handsome because if he was, the commenter couldn't see it. Just an opinion: Colman was good-looking in the style of actors in the early to mid-thirties, but it was his gentle quality, beautiful speaking voice, and fine acting that put him over with female audiences. Here his fianc√© is the gorgeous Madeleine Carroll, and they make a wonderful couple.<br /><br />Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is one of my favorite actors, and he performs the villainous Rupert with panache, creating an excellent character. Raymond Massey is another villain, Michael, and he's very good. David Niven is in a small role - he's on his way up as a younger Colman - in fact, he was supposed to play Colman's brother in Lost Horizon.<br /><br />The end of the film is total action with a magnificent swordfight. Don't miss this version of Prisoner of Zenda.
