When people usually think of Madonna they think of the silly "Like A Virgin" and "Material Girl" videos. If you watch this video you will realize there is much more to Madonna than that.<br /><br />The video start off with three Erotica videos. Bad Girl plays like a movie and is one of her most underrated. Next, is her excellent cover of Fever. I love her red hair and the video looks Greek mythology inspired. Third, is Rain which is one the videos that made me a Madonna fan. The video is suppose to look "behind the scenes". I'd have to say Rain is one of her over looked songs.<br /><br />As the video goes on you get to the Bedtime Stories videos. It starts with the hit Secret. The video is shot in black and white and shows Madonna in a club. After that we get to one of my personal favorites Take A Bow. This is one of those songs and videos I could listen to over and over again. Strangely, it made the animal rights people angry because there is a scene with Madonna's boyfriend bull fighting. Bedtime Story comes up next. I find this video one of her best but very disturbing. Finally, Bedtime Stories videos are wrapped up with Human Nature. It is easily one the best videos of all time if you ask me. Madonna is biting back at her critics. Also, I love the way they decided to bleep out the words.<br /><br />Love Don't Live Here appears next from her Like A Virgin and the new Something To Remember album. It was released to soften her image for her new movie Evita were she won a Golden Globe and Oscar. The video is probably my least favorite but still pleasantly simplistic.<br /><br />Ray of Light videos show up next. Frozen is one of my favorites and has a haunting video. Ray of Light is truly beautiful. It shows how fast life goes. Third, Drowned World/Substitute For Love comes up. It shows the hardships of being a celebrity and how you can get lonely. Finally, you get to see the Power of Goodbye and Nothing Really Matters videos. I love the feeling the colors of the video gives you.<br /><br />Last, you get the Beautiful Stranger video. If you're an Austin Powers fan this is for you! The more you watch the video the funnier it gets just like the movie.<br /><br />In conclusion, the only thing that could of been better is if they added the Deeper and Deeper and Erotica video. The reason they're not on here was to avoid controversy. Still, Deeper and Deeper is easily one of the greatest of all time. This is differently the video collection to get. I can't think of a greater one!
