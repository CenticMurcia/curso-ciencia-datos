This is a great movie i strongly suggest that you pick it up if you get the chance it is exactly what a movie should be an escape from reality do not listen to all the people badmouthing it the only reason they do so is because they either have no sense of humor or they think that the only thing that people should watch is social commentaries and reality shows i personally think that movies need to go back to this state where it was about the movie itself and not just the special effects i think it is sad that most modern day movies rely only on the eye candy, this movie is a great movie to sit down in front of and just forget the outside world exists at all
