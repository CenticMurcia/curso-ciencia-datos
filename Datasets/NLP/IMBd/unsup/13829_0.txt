After a long period of time (maybe 15 years, maybe more) I have finally seen this film thank you to the internet (and some unknown friend who put it "in the air"). It's interesting watching a feature that you have been years reading about; in this case much more to knock it down as a an anti-communist pamphlet with no interest. And like many films along cinema history this is a great and surprisingly unknown film, typical of the best period in McCarey's career, which it means that it's a perfectly edited, wonderfully rhymed, gracefully shot film. It's almost a perfect portrait of American families in the 50's, better (and before) than Nicholas Ray's "Rebel without a cause" and the consequences of generation affairs between father and sons, between the America coming out of a war and the new country that looks upon the future. Remarkable cast, perfect Robert Walker and Dean Jagger and moving Helen Hayes.
