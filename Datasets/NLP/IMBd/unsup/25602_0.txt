Scientist Ray Milland believes he's seeing and speaking to his late young daughter in "Daughter of the Mind," also starring Gene Tierney and Don Murray. I suspect this was a pilot for a series on psychic phenomenon that was to star Murray; hence the "guest starring" credits for Tierney and Milland.<br /><br />This is an intriguing drama. Milland is a scientist involved in sensitive government work, and our side is convinced that the messages he's getting from his daughter to quit what he's doing - bringing into play the possibility of defection - are a conjurer's trick by the other side. George MacCready, who plays Murray's boss, asks him to investigate. There are some sticking points for Murray. He sees the girl's image, he hears her voice - and then, during a séance, a wax replica of her hand appears in water, with verifiable fingerprints yet! If these things aren't true, how are they being accomplished? John Carradine, who plays an expert in the field of séances and mediums, advises him, "You're going about it the wrong way. Don't ask if it was a trick. Ask yourself, if you were going to do it, how would you?" Gene Tierney plays Milland's wife. 1969 was the last year she worked with the exception of one appearance in 1980. Though not Laura any longer, the blue eyes are still beautiful and vibrant, her smile is still lovely, and though illness has taken its toll, she is still beautiful. Ray Milland is fine as the devastated father though his bad hairpiece is distracting. He lost his hair after a permanent he received for "Reap the Wild Wind," and eventually embraced baldness. Pamelyn Ferdin, a popular child actress of the day, plays the daughter. All in all, a very interesting story.
