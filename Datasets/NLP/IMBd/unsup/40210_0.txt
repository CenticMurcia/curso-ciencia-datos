It almost made me puke and I woke up the next morning needing an aspirin.<br /><br />I am glad to have learned the following 1) tequila can cure anything, 2) that body shots can perform miracles, 3)Joey Lawrence is still alive, and 4) that dreams really can come true in America because apparently anyone will give anybody a bunch a money to make anything no matter how crappy it is.<br /><br />I wish I could have found this somewhat funny but the acting was so bad and the story so weak that I just couldn't. What's sad is that in some ways this comes off as some sort of after school special regarding the evils of tequila use or something. Shame on you Joey Lawrence.
