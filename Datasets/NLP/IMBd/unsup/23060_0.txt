One of my 80's sport's comedy ever. Goldie Hawn is at her best as Molly McGrath, a woman who feels that she can coach a winning football team. But feels she is taken seriously because she is a woman. Molly has other problems, she is divorced with two daughters, and has a nagging ex husband. And her job has a track coach is wearing thin. But with luck she finally gets the chance to coach a football team. When she finally gets there, she soon realizes that many other people would not dare coach there, and the team is a bunch of goof balls who don't seem to respect her and care about winning any more. Can Molly earn their respect, and show them they can be winners? I've always been a football fan, but this movie was great with Goldie Hawn starring in it.
