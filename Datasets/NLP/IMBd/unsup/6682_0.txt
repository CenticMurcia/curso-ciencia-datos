I saw Battle in Heaven at this year's Cannes film festival, and though I had trouble sitting still and keeping my eyes on the screen, the end result was an incredibly interesting movie that experimented with new ideas, while most of the films at Cannes this year were just recycling the same ideas and techniques. The film begins and ends with a blow-job, which may be too much for many viewers to handle (one theory is that they'll delete the first and last scenes for an American debut). There is a lot of sex throughout the film; it usually involves overweight people (overweight is putting it nicely), and it's always very awkward. The music and the sound effects are very clever. I hope the film opens in the US... but go see it at your own risk. If you can make it through the first few minutes, you'll love the rest and you'll be amazed by what can be captured on film today.
