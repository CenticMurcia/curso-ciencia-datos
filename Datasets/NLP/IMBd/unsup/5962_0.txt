The story is completely different from the video game. I liked that. You don't know whats going on and how it is going to end. Although it has everything it needs to be a "resident evil". Ubrella, S.T.A.R.S, t-virus, zombies, lickers....an the story takes place indoors. That gives you the feel of resident evil's 1 mansion. The screenplay is good and comparable to resident evil's 1 game, for example there is a traitor who walk among them just like Wesker! <br /><br />It could be more scary with suspense and one or two riddles like the games.<br /><br />The movie ends perfect for an excellent sequel, raccoon city seems to be dead! Everything is destroyed, blood everywhere and milla jovovitch alone with a shotgun in her hands!
