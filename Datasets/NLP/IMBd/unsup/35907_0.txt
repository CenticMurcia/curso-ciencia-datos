Washed up, bloated, Ryan O'Neal is the star of this TV flick, so that should give you enough information to know just how bad "Epoch" is going to be. Unfortunately, I bit anyway. What a colossal waste of time. The plot is transparent; the characters, unbelievably shallow, hackneyed and stock. The actors? I've seen better acting in high school productions. They deliver lines about as well as Ackroyd's Beldar from Saturday Night Live. How the producers and directors could have put their names to this time waster is beyond me. Don't be fooled by the cool production art on the DVD cover. This bomb is of such "Epoch" proportions the fact that it actually was released should be science fiction. I feel like such a fool for having rented it to watch.
