i love this romantic love story soooooooo much!!<br /><br />the prince is so lonely, so gentle, so generous, so man!!!!! <br /><br />do u think a man like him can be true in real life? i envy such deep love between he and his lover...<br /><br />although mixed with pain and doubt, and beginning with a forced wedding, their love is warm and deep and pure.<br /><br />and the cute teddy bears, adds love air too. <br /><br />the story gives us a hope for true love.. it reminds me of such feeling which has gone too far away and too long ago in my heart.<br /><br />love will melt icy lonely heart. love will open your door of heart toward a sunny garden.<br /><br />u will hope the best moments will never end, when your hands were grasped by your lover and when you sleep so safely in your lover's arms. at least the TV series make me think of that and hope for that.<br /><br />oh god, give me such a love bah!
