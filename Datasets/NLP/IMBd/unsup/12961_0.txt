How does movies like this get made? I can understand the writer not being able to see the material for what it is, but how does ANYONE read this script and think it will make a good movie. It was about as far from funny as an alleged comedy can get. This sad attempt is a rehashing off all the old, older and oldest gags and bringing nothing new to the table.<br /><br />I was going to go on, but I can't waste any more time with this. My request to the producers, director and writer - "You don't have a clue about film-making. Please seek alternate work rather than continue to disappoint those investing their time seeking entertainment!"
