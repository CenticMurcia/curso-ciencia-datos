This film never fails to make me cry. However, it never manipulates the tears. There's such a truth and realness to the presentation of the material - not maudlin or contrived in any way. The performances are wonderful all around. Phyllis Frelich and Ed Waterstreet are superb and Mare Winingham couldn't be better. Two of televisions most breathtaking scenes are in this movie - the scene where Winingham's character confronts her mother's comment about being irresponsible and the scene where Winingham's character is alone in the church. If this movie (specifically these scenes) don't punch a hole in your chest than you aren't human.
