Be warned, the acting in this movie is HORRIBLE. I don't think anyone really wanted to do this film, and I'm wondering what kind of financial trouble C. Thomas Howell is in to have to do this ...<br /><br />He, along with Martin Kove are the only "stars" you'll recognize, the rest of the players are unknowns and are likely to go down in history as the most unemotional "horror" movie actors of all time.<br /><br />Not only were the "special effects" laughable (the ants were made of paper mache' it looked like), but even the DVD effects weren't on par! The ants used as selecting tools weren't lined up properly so on certain options all you got were legs.<br /><br />There are some serious plot malfunctions with "Glass Trap." Let's consider the following: * We don't find out how the ants became mutated until halfway through the film, and then this information comes from a "super secret" federal agency, and yet podunk sheriff is apparently special enough to get the scoop.<br /><br />* There is no mention of how Paolo and Curtis get off the roof.<br /><br />* Where did Uncle Hank's body go? * Why did Carley not call the cops when she first saw the ants? Or even use the phone when she and the security guard were trapped together? These are just some of the MANY indiscretions with this film. Regardless, it still gave me one of the best laughs I've had in a while. Highly recommended for a night in with a big group of friends!
