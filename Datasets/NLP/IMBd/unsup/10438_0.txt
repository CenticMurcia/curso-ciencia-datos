OK, so it says it started in 2004 and the final season is summer 2007. I only saw it this season, could be cause with being Military don't always know where going to be. Can the first season if its before this summer, be downloaded or purchased on DVD? I really wish it wasn't ending so soon as have really enjoyed it. I do agree that without Cassie there is just something missing. We have really enjoyed the show thus far and are looking forward to seeing it next year, but will not be thrilled when the show comes to an end. would really appreciate anyone letting us know where we can get a copy of what am assuming the first season, it would be appreciated, or are we possibly a season behind here in the US? because Cassie died mid way here and from what I read, she was there for the first 2 seasons. <br /><br />Blessed Be Deb
