This is just awful! Having seen the "original" - Riget - you wont need to argue with me on that statement! I hope this teaches people a lesson. Don't remake exceptional good movies or series for that matter, - You might mess up, and mess up bad! <br /><br />Would it have been too much to ask for keeping it real? Why all the altering of the perfectly good story? Why have my beloved spooks gone? Why add ridiculously plain, well known, easy-to-see-thru horror to a masterpiece like Lars Von Trier's "Riget"? It makes me feel someone stole and got caught, - Do i make my point ?<br /><br />Stephen King, You are not the King of Horror!
