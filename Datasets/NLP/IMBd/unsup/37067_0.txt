I thought it was a terrible movie! Helen -- begging her teacher's husband to kiss her? Early 20th century moires??? Are you kidding??? This was a huge flaw in historical accuracy. I see the point of showing that handicapped people are no different there than so-called normal people, but that was too much! <br /><br />Granted the time has come to show something other than the time in Helen's life when Annie comes to live with her and teach her, but this is not the way to go. Could someone please reread "The Story of My Life" and try again? There's plenty of tension and conflict there to make an interesting film without resorting to Helen's begging John Macy to kiss her.
