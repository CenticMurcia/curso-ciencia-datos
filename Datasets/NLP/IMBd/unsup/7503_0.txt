One of the most beautiful pictures ever lensed. Rhythmically elegant, unashamedly sensual. An erotic interlude in the lives of Anais Nin, Henry Miller and his wife June is fashioned into an exceptionally compelling screenplay, brought to exquisite life by a truly gifted filmmaker. Philip Kaufman's genius is without peer, and "Henry and June" ranks as the very best film of the 1990s.
