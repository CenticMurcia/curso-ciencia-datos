This is without a doubt, one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. I had high hopes for it based on the cast and the Oscar buzz it received. It was indeed beautifully shot and the set dressing was perfection. However, that was as deep as the movie got. It was as superficial and stilted as a 50's commercial endorsement. Are we actually supposed to buy that people spoke and behaved in this mannequin-like manner, simply because that was what the era "dictated"? So much could have been really done with this subject and nothing was. A real pity.
