He's the best anti-hero in the history of cinema and ALWAYS has the last laugh. He just doesn't care. All Americans wish they could feel this way but Snake...he's just conscience free. The only person he looks out for or cares about is himself. And he's an ex-soldier too. The action scenes in this film are few and far between but it has a strange feel to it. It's gritty film-making. Much better than the cheesy(but still good) sequel. Check this out whenever you can.
