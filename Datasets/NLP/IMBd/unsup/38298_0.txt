I really disliked this movie for many reasons. First, the effects are horrible and laughable, the acting is horrible (Robert Patrick and Bo Hopkins were not very good in this one) and so on... This gives no honor to the first in any way, they should have stayed with the first and the third to make the perfect duo. The part where the guy is attacked by a bat in his car is so funny! Oh my, it just looked like a plastic toy that someone threw at his windshield. This film is not by any means a popcorn B-movie... it's worse! With such a low budget and with this director, you can't build a well filmed good action sequences with a lot of explosion and stuff. The first is one of my favorite action movie but this one is just... awful.<br /><br />Rating: 1.4/10
