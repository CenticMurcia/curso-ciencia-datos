this movie was technically made well... in terms of quality of picture and audio... the lighting in some scenes could have taken more thought and effort however on to the story...<br /><br />it pretty much portrays the theme of saw where people are being punished for sins they committed in the past... most of it takes place in a parking lot where the people come across supernatural/horror creatures to finish them off...<br /><br />the dialogue got a bit annoying in some places and they never seem to execute the suspense very well... all in all.. a fair effort... writing and directing doesn't always work for everyone...
