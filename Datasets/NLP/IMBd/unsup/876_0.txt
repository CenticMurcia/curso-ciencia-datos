This film analyzes the creative impulse for advertising & finds it in a asylum...<br /><br />Don't worry: it is not a psychological study but a comedy. The only problem is that I don't laugh often: maybe with the taglines of the ads, the performance of David "Hello" Paymer...<br /><br />How much the leading actor (Dudley Moore), the endless casting of J.T. Walsh as a bad guy, or a bad script (I didn't see much insanity from the patients) have to do with my dozing, it's hard to tell.<br /><br />In conclusion, an average movie where the only flavors are its 80's spirit in America and Hannah in a romantic character.
