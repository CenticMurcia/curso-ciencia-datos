I can't believe people are saying Roselyn Sanchez was good in this. Granted, with all the things wrong with this film, not much would have made it better, but a competent lead actress might have helped a bit. I know white boys from Iowa that could play a hardcore barrio chica better than her, and as far as being a gambling junkie - gimme a break. She's utterly unbelievable, unsympathetic, unlikable, and her acting is as flat as a railroad track in this film. The rest of the actors' poor performances have been adequately covered elsewhere here - the only worthwhile performance was from Angus Macfadyen as Tenderloin Tony. If you can see it for free, go ahead and watch it as an example of how not to make a film, but by no means pay to see this one.
