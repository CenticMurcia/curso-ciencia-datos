I remember walking through Blockbuster and seeing this on the shelves. The thing is, I knew I couldn't take this movie seriously. The acting is laughably bad. But, that didn't stop me from enjoying it.<br /><br />The movie revolves around Jack(Aaron Gaffey) who has a severe addiction to drugs. He injects drugs into his arm where you see a huge massive pus-filled infection. Whenever he pours alcohol on it, lots of pus comes out of it. It is not for the faint of heart. Anyway, two men find his hideout and ask him where the money is. Apparently, he owes money to these guys. When he doesn't pay, they inject him full of their special cocktail of drugs. Amazingly, it doesn't kill him. It just awakes him. He grabs a jackhammer and starts killing. The film is very bloody and gory which is what I loved about it. The special effects are horrendous though.<br /><br />If you like B movies where you like gore, then pick this up.<br /><br />I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Excellent B movie!
