It's informative, all right, but after a very short while you realize that all you're watching is a bunch of clips of junk exploitation pix & mostly fatuous comments on them. OK, so Tarantino (we're not on a first name basis) was blown way by the outrageous idea of having an almost nude woman as a hood ornament on a car. So what? Some tastelessness is highly enjoyable (most of Tarrantino's work is) because of style, panache & great dialogue. With rare exceptions, the Ozploitation stuff shown in this pic is not. It's just juvenile & I'm old enough to be sorry I wasted my time watching this one. Most of the reviewers have disagreed or will disagree with this comment. Well, that's Show Biz.
