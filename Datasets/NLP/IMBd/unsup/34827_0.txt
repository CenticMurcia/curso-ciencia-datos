why the bloody hell is this site so incompetent as to label Dandy Nicholls as Una Stubbs in one of the main images, posters, which is all over Google? OK, apparently, my post needs more lines why? I am trying to fix a glaring error, which must be obnoxious to Una Stubbs who is still living, I hope and also to Dandy Nicholls, who may not be still living, but I remember watching as a child - but it may be to her family! OK, it needs 10 lines of text *sigh* my husband loves this film...being a Cockney himself. I love Una Stubbs in many films, such as 'Summer Holiday,' and love her as a very warm-hearted person. I am very much looking forward to watching this film - having laughed at the T.V. series, even though a young child I could grasp that it was not serious.
