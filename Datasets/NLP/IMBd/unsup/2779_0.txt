...just unbelievable how these old jokes keep me laughing, the cast is absolutely packed with big names even down to the smallest roles. I just wonder how they got all these stars to play this stuff, kind of unusual for the German film scene to do some stuff just for the fun of it and produce it well. I've never seen this combination The Soundtrack is nice, no wonder considering who done that part. i'm pleased to see that _entertainment_ is possible and easy with a film like this, far above the "comedy"-hype here in Germany. well done, Otto and all the others. i watched with my girlfriend and it's -two thumps up- just 9/10 because maybe some other movies try to top this
