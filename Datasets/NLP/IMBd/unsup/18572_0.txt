I find that the previous comment misses not only the subtle nuances of the film's plot, but also completely underestimates the quality of the actors and, especially, actresses (such as the stunning pathologist) that star in this cult classic. Furthermore, the film tackles some difficult, contemporary issues, through an exciting and thrilling storyline, such as men struggling to come to terms with their sexuality, alcoholism, bestiality, amputation and most importantly medieval sorcery. These topics are subtly woven into the rich tapestry of the plot and I was left not only captivated and deeply moved, but it has also led me to reassess my outlook and attitude to life. I am disappointed with the poor reception that this stunning film has received on this website, and I urge all to view this cinematic triumph.
