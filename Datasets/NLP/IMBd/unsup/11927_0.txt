This movie is not as terrible as the third one, but not as good as the second, not to mention the first. Where did the other monsters come from? What are they? Hybrids? Aliens? Where were they until now? Why are they killing people? Is it a sport? Hobby? We didn't knew it from the third part and we still don't know from this one. The third part was disgusting and stupid. This is simply stupid. Including a lot of blood, some monster and disgusting scenes doesn't make a sci-fi. It makes horror of the worst kind, that is not real horror, just a crap with some horrifying scenes. In this film Tom (Ben Cross) loves Miranda (Helena Mattsson) as his daughter. What will be in the next part? Will the human and the alien get married? Will they have children as well? It should be a remake of "Amanda and the Alien" with Nicole Eggert, and it could be called Species V: I married a (Human-Alien) Hybrid. Though, if I remember well, there are some movies with titles like this (I married: a monster, a werewolf, a vampire and so on). And of course they should live happily after killing their enemies. This movie wasn't that bad but I liked to know what happened to the people walking away to the woods at the end of the third part.
