I watch "Fire Sale" at least 3-4 times a year and each time it gets better, very similar to "Where's Poppa", which also demands multiple viewings. While "Where's Poppa" has one extremely funny story line, "Fire Sale" has two. The insurance scam running parallel to the basketball player / adoption are absolutely two of the funniest ideas in any film. My only criticism is that Alan Arkin lets several scenes run on entirely too long. Nevertheless, there are moments of hilarious dark comedy throughout. "And don't forget to put my beer back", measuring a "live corpse", etc. This is one of the greatest comedies ever made, and will achieve instant cult status if ever released on DVD. - MERK
