A1 acting and casting. Story-line excellent but slightly unbelievable as to the "special effects", such as the escape capsule. Highly rated, nonetheless. Harrison Ford, as per his norm, does a magnificent and highly believable job in his portrayal of the President - Some day we might have a president that is so action-oriented - but I doubt if we would in my lifetime.
