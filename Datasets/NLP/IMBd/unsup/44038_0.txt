I've seen a lot of trashy horror films, but this film is maybe the worst picture I've ever seen. The movie makes absolutely no sense at all and has the production values of a home movie. The worst part is when the main characters daughter participates in the killing of a woman freely, but is apprehensive about consuming her flesh. One of the other children remarks "but it's good try it" and she's like "okay" and dives right in. That sentence makes it sound almost comical, and maybe in the right disgusting, deplorable film it might be, but there is no entertainment value to be found in this picture. The movie manages to cram many adult deaths, a rape scene, and the slaughter of all of the children into the movie into 90 minutes, with not even one moment of it actually being scary or terrifying. For those that walked out the theater, I'm sure it was because of boredom and a general disgust at the subject matter over feeling truly disturbed at any of the hokey stuff that goes on in this garbage movie.
