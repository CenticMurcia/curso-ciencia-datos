Well, where to start? I want to start off by saying that this movie was pretty bad, but the gratuitous nudity was comforting. This movie runs about 87 minutes, which is amazing considering the plot.<br /><br />First of all, how teenage girls get trapped in two story house with a basement and a garage is beyond me. Time and time again these girls absolutely refuse to leave the house even though there is a driller killer on the loose and they are "afraid" for their lives. Makes no sense. Of course, if they just walked out the back door or the front, they could just leave. I guess that makes too much sense. I guess I'm the idiot.<br /><br />The acting was abysmal. The killer was ridiculous and his reasoning to start killing was just laughable. The connection between why he was killing these girls and how his crazy uncle committed suicide and how he was picked on by these girls is just dumb. I have to admit some of the killers bad acting and corny lines were funny. Perhaps if I was in a more tolerant, comedic mood, I could laugh at this junk and give 7 out of 10. But I wasn't.<br /><br />Positives about the film...some good kills. Just to name a few: electrocution by way of dildo, stabbing with real estate sign, and drill to the gut. The special effects were good enough to get the point across. There was one part where the killer was drilling a victim and it was clear that the drill was not touching the stomach. The close up shot revealed a 2 to 3 inch gap between the drill bit and the victim's stomach. Apparently there wasn't enough budget to edit this part out. I understand why. No one put any time and effort in to this movie from beginning to end. And it shows.<br /><br />So with that said, the movie sorely lacks in every area imaginable, except for nudity. There was enough there to pass the short time the movie actually played. There was very little redemption about this one. The movie epitomizes the over-saturation of low budget, slasher films of the 80's. It is the very reason why movies like these went direct to video and died. Too bad, because I'm fan of slasher films, just not this one.<br /><br />3 out of 10.
