This is one funny film. The chemistry is just so great. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluis were meant to be together, just as Laurel and Hardy or Abbot and Costello. And Jack Elam. He is an American original. But the secondary big named talent is just as great. Roger Moore spoofing his James Bond character, Jamie Faar as an eastern prince, Mel Tillis and Terry Bradshaw. Farah Fawcett's clueless seriousness is right on the money to make it even funnier. The other single greatest pairing is Dean Martin and Sammy Davie Jr. Director Hal Needham has recreated the great American classic road race here. You just have to watch out for the dirty tricks. Relax and have fun with this one.
