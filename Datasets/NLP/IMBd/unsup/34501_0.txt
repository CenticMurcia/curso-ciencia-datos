The only reason I gave this movie 2 out of 10 instead just 1 is because I found acting pretty solid and good old "jumpy" effects a la John Carpenter copied pretty well (like she is walking back and bumping into someone - simple but still scary). Solid camera and good editing in that way. Everything else about this film is a cheap and extremely stupid Hollywood mishmash of the horror ideas exploited much better at the beginning of the last century. Girl babysitting a boy-devil that eats flash of baby-sitters is the prevalent idea of the whole movie. I saw more intelligent horror ideas among the 7 year old kids. I wish I disregarded the comments I read.
