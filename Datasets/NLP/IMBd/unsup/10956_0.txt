And I really liked Brothers McMullen too! I was looking forward to another Ed Burns written project after seeing that film he was in with John bonJovi (forgot the title of that one), but this effort was way too bare of any believability. It came across as another neurotic, speedy, male-sided, foul-mouthed, sex crazed "relationship" fighting venue with no real felt treatment of emotion.<br /><br />It was fodder for amateur acting. I felt like it was a rushed run-through. It reminded me of Woody Allen's latest weak effort "SmallTimeCrooks" with much less charisma.....too bad. But I still respect him (Burns) for trying. Oh well, maybe next time.
