There is nothing in this movie that I already haven't seen. These two people go to this lodge in the middle of the forest and there is some creepy guy and then he ends up being more than a creep. It is so predictable that I could just say what was going to happen before it ever happened. It was pretty cool that the little girl ended up being someone unexpected but I've seen that in other movies.<br /><br />The end was just like the end of "House of 1000 corpses." It was pretty cool but, again, I've seen it already. It was a very boring movie and predicable and there are other movies out there that are so much better.
