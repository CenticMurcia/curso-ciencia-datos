This movie takes a giant backstep in concept and evolution by replacing our Rangers' powerful Zords (animal attack vehicles) with cheap looking, souped-up cars...and worst of all, the Rangers now wear atrocious looking headlights and reflectors on their heads!<br /><br />"Turbo" unfortunately has little going for it. With cheap production values and a boring plot, this big screen vehicle runs out of gas fast...Although the original Power Rangers (Jason, Kimberly, and Tommy) were in it, this film gave them little room for much needed character development. The only good scene in this film was when Rocky (Steve Cardenas) performed a goofy martial arts move that injured his back, and having his place in the martial arts tournament replaced by our heroic Red Ranger Jason (Austin St. John).<br /><br />I have to admit that the new Blue Ranger (a little boy) performed better than his predecessor, but overall, as most sequels go, this film bites the dust. Avoid it like the Black Plague!<br /><br />Movie rating: 1* out of 10*.<br /><br />
