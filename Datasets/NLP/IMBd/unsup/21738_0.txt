Finally got to see this movie this week, and loved it, if that's the appropriate thing to say. I can appreciate that it would be hard watching for the family members of people with autism. For the rest of us, it's a well-needed window into their lives - created by a director with personal experience to draw on, so grounded in reality. From my knowledge of friends and a cousin with autistic children, the absolute unpredictability of autism, sitting in contrast with the autistic person's need for stability in their surroundings, does make for a challenging family life. I found the scenario unfolding in this movie credible and compelling, with the central role of Thomas, as portrayed by Rhys Wakefield (only otherwise seen by me in a local soap opera), a strong lead. You go through the roller-coaster of emotions with him, and can empathise with him as he faces the "Ã¿ou're the spastic's brother" routine from his peers. For any country, it is good to hear your accent on film, and to see your streets. Especially when it's done this well.
