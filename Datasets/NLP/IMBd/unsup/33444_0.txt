What the heck was this garbage? This was the worst stinking movie I have ever seen (Redneck Zombies a very close second). What kind of writer decides that an anthropologist, or whatever he was, is going to go into a cave, come across a paper mache mask glued to the wall of the cavern, and witness the "obvious" Christmas tree lights turn on behind the mask's eyes and hear the infamous words..."AAAahhhhh... you will serve me in blood!" and proceed to turn into the Creature from Hell. I rate this movie a negative 23 on a 0 to 10 scale. Don't waste your money folks... it's better to go out and buy a "tickle me Elmo" doll because, at least, you can punt this baby around your yard and feel good about it!
