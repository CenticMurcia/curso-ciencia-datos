I saw 'Deadly Target' in a hotel room in Zhuhai, China. Evidently, Cinemax Asia has no budget for films that have been made by anyone actually in the film business. 'Deadly Target' is an instant classic for those of us who are connoisseurs of terrible films. The name itself is a give-away as to what is in store: atrocious acting, directing, writing, fighting, etc. etc. 'Deadly Target' may be the actual nadir of film possibilities. I loved the train-wreck of it all. The best part is that the usual homoerotic undertones of buddy-cop movies are so misplaced in this film that the sexual chemistry is hotter between the mismatched police 'partners' (pun intended) than between the pseudo-Adonis Aussie and his unattractive female Asian lover. It would have made a great gay-friendly comedy. Sadly, we have one less good comedy and one more crappy Cinemax hotel offering.
