Uggh! This is the first truly awful episodes of Star Trek--even worse than the "Charlie X" episode!! Now THAT'S bad!! The biggest problem is that the character of Lazarus is just dopey and boring. He rants and raves and lies and just annoys the daylights out of the audience. Plus, despite all the cheesy over-acting by Lazarus, the pay-off just isn't worth waiting for at all! In so many ways, this episode looked either like a "throw away" episode or perhaps one that had been written and re-written again and again and just wasn't perfected. Regardless, the episode has few thrills or excitement and no laughs. In fact, unless you are a huge Trekkie, it isn't worth your time.<br /><br />FYI--If you want to see the worst episode, there are still probably two or three that managed to surpass this one in lousiness.
