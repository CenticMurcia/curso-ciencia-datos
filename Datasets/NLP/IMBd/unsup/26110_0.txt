This movie was based on the murders of the three civil rights workers in 1964. Attack On Teror really gave a better view in story line, than Mississippi Burning. These three workers were jailed by the Deputy Sheriff on a speeding ticket. After they were released, they were on their way South out of town. Later they were followed by the Deputy Sheriff along with Ku Klux Klan members. On a country road they were pulled over shot and killed. The blue station wagon was burn't. The three were found buried in a Dam yard. This was world attention, in the news. It was all about hate not just against blacks, but also a Jew. Personally I hate the Confederate Flag. It's a symbol of hate, white supremacy and of course the KU Klux Klan. I like only the American Flag and the Christain Flag. There was no excuse for the murder of these three men. They came to investigate a church fire. No matter whether it's a white church or a black church, burning down the Lord's house is wrong. I likewise didn't like Gene Hackman's brutal tactics in this movie. Where he took the razor, from the Barber gave the Deputy Sheriff a shave, cutting his face, then dunking his head in a sink full of water. That's not how law enforcement officers should act. I would encourage you all to get the real facts and watch Attack On Terror. You will get a better story, than this low budget movie.
