I enjoy this film to my own surprise.While I'm not a child or a fan,I find the animation simple and easy on the eyes.You feel sorry for him when his own father can't look at him the same way now that he's a robot.After he leaves Metro City, he finds his human friends and through them,he gets to find and learn about love and companionship.Then he takes on the evil President Stone,who has become a huge monster himself,threatens to destroy Metro City and everyone else in it.My brother claps in delight as Astro Boy discovers his hands can turn into cannons and guns stick out of his butts.The touching scene where he sacrifices his life is enough to even brought a tear to my eyes.Luckily,he is saved and finally finds his destiny,and it's to help protects the world.It's a movie with a lot of heart and hope.Definitely a kid's film.For an adult,the cartoon characters may be a little childish.Overall it's a great animated film,good efforts on the voice overs and entertaining awesome sequences.
