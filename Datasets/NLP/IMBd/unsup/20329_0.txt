Back when cable TV started, there were tons of softcore porno movies being released to late night cable. Most of those movies were borderline retarded, and they were put together just to show lots of women prancing around topless and engaged in bedroom scenes with each other or guys. I later discovered (from reading about it on the internet) that many hard-core porno movies would also shoot an alternate soft-core version for cable TV, and these movies would be released with different titles. Sometimes even the names of the actresses would be changed, so that the porn actresses could build up a resume in non-porn movies. Since it is often the dream of many porno stars to break into mainstream acting, I guess that made sense.<br /><br />So what was the motivation behind Dead Doll? Apparently this was never an alternate take on a porno movie, so it was just what it is, a horribly bad T&A movie. At least if I knew that Dead Doll was just the leftover exploitation of some cheesy porn movie, I would understand why Dead Doll is so awful. Unfortunately, Dead Doll is the creative expression of someone's mind. I hope that guy got some therapy. As a soft core porn, it is not bad if you fast-forward through most of the movie. I saw Dead Doll in about ten minutes, and that was only because I actually stopped to watch and listen to the dialogue of most of the scenes. That was a big mistake. You can probably watch Dead Doll in about three minutes if you fast forward through everything except the T&A.
