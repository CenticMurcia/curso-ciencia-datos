Here's the problem I have with this film. It basically focuses in on one seemingly unrepentant pedophile priest and explains how he was put into that position and protected by the church. It is all stuff we've heard before and really offered me no new insight into the problem that has been made public before. Really, this entire movie could've been condensed into a 10-15 min segment on 20/20 or Dateline. But instead it is a long, drawn out affair that repeatedly bashes you over the head with the same themes and stories we've all heard before. The victims are constantly being thrown in your face so you can sympathize with them and understand the gravity of wrong doing by this priest and the church. Enough already, we get this. If I had watched this film in a theater, I would've definitely walked out on it after 30 minutes or so. Only reason I sat though it was because my sister and brother-in-law chose to watch it.<br /><br />Don't waste your time unless you've been in the dark about this sort of thing for the last 20 years.
