Two seemingly unrelated murders have taken place; police doctor Chet Walker (Richard Denning) discovers that the killers are themselves in fact dead, and are being manipulated, using radioactivity, to commit various nefarious deeds.<br /><br />An early variation on zombie movies, this is fun, likable stuff from the mind of Curt Siodmak, the legendary, prolific writer behind such memorable fright fare as "The Wolf Man". The script is intriguing, albeit full of the technically loaded exposition common to films of the era. You've certainly got to give the villain of this story credit for coming up with such an ingenious idea, and it provides for some nice touches (the villain uses a TV to see what his unwitting killers are seeing).<br /><br />Director Edward L. Cahn moves it at a steady pace (one thing I love about many of these old movies is that they were often over in record time, with a refreshing lack of filler); it's breezy, humorous genre fare that benefits from its stolid cast; handsome Denning is an engaging lead, with nice supporting turns by S. John Launer as his good friend (Captain and "Uncle" Dave Harris), Michael Granger as the cold-eyed, vengeance-crazed gangster Frank Buchanan, and Gregory Gay as the brilliant scientist in Buchanans' employ.<br /><br />This all leads to a fairly memorable climax where the impossible-to-kill assassins are battling the cops. It's the perfect capper on 70 minutes of straightforward B-movie entertainment.<br /><br />7/10
