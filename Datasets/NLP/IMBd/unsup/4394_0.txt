Okay, well maybe this film is "a fun-filled romp" and "an action-packed thrill ride." But somebody says these things about nearly every movie, and they don't do Why We Had To Kill Bitch justice. This film is unique, to say the least.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of seeing this film in the largest screening room in Pittsburgh, twice. First I saw it at the world premiere, which drew over a thousand people for the best turnout of any indy film in Pittsburgh history. By the time I saw it again a year later at the DVD release party, the film already had a dedicated cult following.<br /><br />This is a film which doesn't take itself seriously, and that frees it up to be really, really funny. From the witty banter, to the zany, over-the-top yet familiar characters, there is an utter lack of pretense that really lets you know how much the filmmakers loved this project.<br /><br />I loved the characters (you know someone like each one of them), the acting, the silliness, the randomness, the way the humor hits you in so many different ways, I LOVED THE ENDING (which I won't ruin), but the thing I loved most about this film (and this is very important in my opinion) is that it was funnier the second time I saw it! I can only hope that more great films like this come out of Pittsburgh. I highly recommend that you check it out if you get a chance. If you have any sense of humor at all, you'll want to play it again as soon as the credits roll. But stick around for those. The credits are one of the best parts!
