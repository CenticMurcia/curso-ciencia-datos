Some articles or short biographies about Peter Bogdanovich that I've read assert that his career has not amounted to as much as it could have. His 1985 masterpiece "Mask" should disprove that. It tells the story of teenager Roy L. "Rocky" Dennis (Eric Stoltz), who suffered from craniodiaphyseal dysplasia that left him with an enlarged face. He and his biker mother Rusty (Cher) do what they can to live their lives normally, understanding that it will be an uphill climb.<br /><br />One of the impressive parallels is the relationships that they develop. Rusty is involved in a relationship with fellow biker Gar (Sam Elliott), and they're pretty much the same kind of person. Rocky attends the camp for the blind where he befriends Diana (Laura Dern); she can't see what he looks like, but she accepts him for being a nice person.<br /><br />So this is definitely one that I recommend. It not only shows the triumph of the human spirit confronting adversity, but affirms the talent of all parties involved. Really good.<br /><br />Also starring Estelle Getty, Richard Dysart and Harry Carey, Jr.
