If you have the two most popular horror stars under contract what do you do? You team them up. "The Black Cat" (supposedly based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe) was the first and arguably the best of the seven Karloff/Lugosi collaborations. In this one, they both have parts of equal importance. In subsequent teamings, the size Lugosi's parts would gradually decrease.<br /><br />Newlyweds Peter and Joan Allison (David Manners, Jaqueline Wells) are traveling by train to a honeymoon resort when they are joined by a mysterious stranger, Dr. Vitus Werdegast (Bela Lugosi). Werdegast is on his way to visit a former army colleague Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff). (Notice the play on the name "Poe" in Karloff's character's name.) In a driving rainstorm, the traveler's share a bus, which as luck would have it, crashes just outside of Poelzig's home.<br /><br />Werdegast and the Allisons are given shelter by Poelzig whose "modernistic" house has been built over a mined former military installation. We also learn that Poelzig had betrayed Werdegast during WW1 and caused him to spend the last 15 years in prison. Werdegast has returned to gain his revenge. It seems that Poelzig had stolen Werdegast's wife and murdered her and their young daughter. Howver we also learn that the evil Poelzig, who is also a satanist by the way, has "married" the now grown daughter of Werdegast.<br /><br />Poelzig takes an unusual interest in the comely young Joan Alison and plans to keep her and her husband prisoner. Werdegast believing that both his wife and daughter have been murdered by Poelzig, attempts to shoot him but is suddenly terrified by a black cat passing by. Finally Werdegast finds the body of his just murdered daughter, becomes enraged and confronts Poelzig and............<br /><br />Boris Karloff was still being billed as "Karloff" at this time. His make up consisting of slicked back widow's peak hair gives him a particularly sinister look. Lugosi gives probably his best post Dracula performance. The performances of David Manners and Jacqueline Wells (aka Julie Bishop) though adequate, are dwarfed by those of the picture's two stars.<br /><br />The direction by Edgar G. Ulmer is crisp and effective. He is aided by Universal's atmospheric sets, including Karloff's futuristic house, as well as the low key lightning. The final sequence though played off screen, is nonetheless terrifying.<br /><br />Not to be confused with Universal's "The Black Cat" (1941) in which Lugosi also appeared.
