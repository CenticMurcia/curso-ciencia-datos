Fantastic cinema - thats what truly describes Kal Ho Naa Ho. The film probably signals the arrival of Nikhil Advani, a new member of direction fraternity. The film is a well-balanced blend of typical Karan Johar bonhomie and the modern hip-hop culture and the result is a delightful treat-to-watch. <br /><br />The USP of KHNH is its brilliant star-cast and trendy music. Thats where the film signs off in style. The film is good enough to go down as one of the best ever ( probably the 6th in SRK's kitty)<br /><br />ACTING: SRK (shah rukh Khan) shows that he is getting better with age. After delivering some of Bollywood's biggest blockbusters like DDLJ, KKHH, DTPH and Baazigar, King Khan makes another significant contribution with KHNH. His portrayal of Aman, is poignantly done and weighs romance, style and flair on an equal footing. If SRK is the king of the film ,Preity Zinta is the undisputed queen. The dimpled darling's increasing demand in Bollywood is natural after she delivers such good performances. Her role as the central character in the story- Neha Katherine Kapoor, is strong and likable. Zinta shows all the variants of acting - from poignancy during death hours to rocking vibes in the song Its the time to Disco. Saif too has a great role in the film as compliments the King Khan beautifully. <br /><br />MUSIC : Rocking, youthful and yet melodious. Watch out for the moving title track.<br /><br />A must see , specially for all SRK-Preity fans
