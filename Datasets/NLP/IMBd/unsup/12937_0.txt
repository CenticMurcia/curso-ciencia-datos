This film is indeed one of the best of 2007. The Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra has make this film a pure entertainment. Amitabh Bachan's performance is speechless , Sharmila Tagore's appearance in the film was quit intelligent. Vidya Balan returned after Pareenita with Vidhu. Saif Ali Khan'z role was one of the most questioning role of the film its deserves an two thumbs up ! And the song is more than great one song in the film and this film is great even with that song. Chanda Re was one of the most relaxing and peaceful song of the year with Sawanad Kirkire's lyrics. The moon song is just the best there is no one like this one and its really unique like wee say. Everyone's acting was really credible this film should get an nomination to the Oscars
