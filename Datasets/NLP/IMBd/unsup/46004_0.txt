I can't believe the Director of this film came from such groundbreaking projects as SCTV and Kids in the Hall. He should be ashamed of himself. The screenplay sounds as if it were written on the back of a Denny's napkin and the actors play it off like a high school melodrama. It's obvious that during its filming, everyone was aware how awful this movie was, as no one really shows any pride in their performances (with the exception of Tom Arnold - I'm convinced he thought this movie would put him on top). Tom delivers his lines with such confidence, he's never been more in his element. . . this is not a compliment.<br /><br />We can all feel a bit reassured that this film placed an iron nail in the coffins of each participant's career and no one was able to buy a boat or pay for college with their checks.<br /><br />After watching this film, you may reconsider how harshly you've criticized other films. By comparison, Ghostbusters II was a marvel in screen writing, Yahoo Serious is a comic genius, and Pauly Shore belongs in the Director's chair.
