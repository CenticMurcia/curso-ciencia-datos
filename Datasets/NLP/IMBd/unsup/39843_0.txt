So you signed up to do a sequel, but you just really don't feel like it. What to do? Don't worry, just shove some footage from the first movie in a new box and someone will actually see it. The plot, and I use that term loosely, is about the little brother from the first movie (played by a distractingly horrible Eric Freeman) sitting in a room telling his life story through flashbacks. Which include the beginning, ending and every single death scene from the original. He wasn't actually you know, there, but those are details. Then there's new footage of him taking his girl to the movies and the movie playing is you've guessed it, "Silent Night Deadly Night". At last he goes crazy and kills a bunch of people while moving his eyebrows a lot, because apparently that's what crazy people do. The final fifteen minutes of this movie are entertaining, sadly this thing is much longer than that.
