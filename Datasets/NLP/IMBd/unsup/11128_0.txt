OK, I was bored and there was nothing on at 10pm, only thing was Life Size. I swear, it was the STUPIDEST movie ever-wait, i've seen worse- and Lindsay Lohan did a horrible job acting. Everyone did a horrible job acting, and the story did not make any sense at all. I don't realize how Casey tried to "resurect" her mother with a spell and accidentally gave her doll a human life. Huh? Tyra Banks was OK, but shouldn't have done it- someone else smaller in fame should have. And after seeing Parent Trap, I would have expected much, much more from Lindsay. Basically, never watch this movie because it wastes time. A LOT of time.
