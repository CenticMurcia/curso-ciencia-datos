My observation listed at the end here, may be a spoiler, but not really sure about that as I could be imagining something that wasn't really there. How's that for a save? I found this film to be a variation on The Longest Yard as much as it is similar in plot to The Running Man. Then again, the respective story lines to those films are pretty much the same. It doesn't much matter though, as this really is fun visit to a theater. There are few action/adventure movies made these days with an original theme. It's a moot point being that this is a re-telling of the original film of which I also enjoyed. What no one here has mentioned is Frankenstein. I believe the voice of Frank (pre-opening crash) is that of the original Frankenstein - David Carradine. He's not listed in the credits, but then again...no one is listed. A fun little homage if I'm right about that voice.
