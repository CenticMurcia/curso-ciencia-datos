I watched this movie on VCD in the home of a local couple on a very remote island in Indonesia. No idea how they got a hold of it, but it's pretty typical of the type and quality of movies popular in Indonesia. We watched an original English version with Chinese subtitles. This couple spoke about twenty words of English between them, and I'm certain they don't read Chinese, so the dialog must have been lost on them, but maybe it's better that way. They laughed all the way through it, and so did I! I remember the exact title being "Steel American Cyborg Warrior." I do like the sound of it much better in Spanish though, as seen in the graphic. Guerrero de Acero has such a ring to it.
