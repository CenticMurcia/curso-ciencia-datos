One of the best comedies. It shows very interesting people: gangsters, but from an other side, they are shown from the man within them. The story is simple, but good enough to hold the characters, which are one of the most interesting ones, I've ever saw.<br /><br />The dark pictures, the music, everything makes this movie to be satiric and funny together. The story follows the main character, who is stupid enough to get with "gangsters", he has nothing to do with them, expect that they have something with him. Everybody like to save/kill him, but these people have bigger problems with themself.
