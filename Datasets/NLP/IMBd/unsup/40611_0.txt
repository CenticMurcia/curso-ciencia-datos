When one considers Hollywood stars whose careers have gone down the tubes, Eddie Murphy is one of the first names that pops to mind. Dr Dolittle 2 is a sequel to Dr Dolittle which is a film very loosely based on the Rex Harrison musical (only in the whole "talking to animals" aspect, there is nothing else that is in any way even remotely similar). Recently, Murphy made another "unfunny sequel to an unfunny remake" with Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps. Eddie Murphy simply isn't funny any more. It's a shame since I loved Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places, and Coming to America. But since the 80s, Murphy has offered only bad B movie comedies that will go down with such stinkers as Police Academy 4. Don't waste your money on this one. 1/10
