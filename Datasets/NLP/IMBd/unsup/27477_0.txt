Like the Valentine's Day episode of Charlie Brown, the Easter special is a lot of fluff regarding the members of the Peanuts Gang. It's not nearly as good as the Halloween episode (which is seems to mimic) or the Christmas episode.<br /><br />In this episode, the Peanuts are getting ready for Easter, and Snoppy becomes the equivalent of the Easter Bunny. The episode is very mundane with a lot less to offer when compared to some of the previous Charlie Brown films.<br /><br />Not terribly good. I would recommend that you see the Christmas episode or the Halloween one. Only watch this if you really are a fan.
