I wasn't expecting much from this Jean Arthur comedy vehicle, and as a result, I was pleasantly surprised by it.<br /><br />Arthur plays a woman married to the best friend of her dead husband, who's mighty surprised when her dead husband turns out not to be so dead after all. Now she's got two men fighting over her, a state of affairs she settles back to enjoy, much to the dismay of her father, played by that terrific character actor Harry Davenport.<br /><br />Jean Arthur is absolutely adorable, even if she is a bit of a brat in this. You want to hug her even as you want to see her kicked in the seat of her pants. Fred MacMurray plays the back from the dead husband, while Melvyn Douglas plays the best friend. I felt MacMurray straining a bit at the screwball comedy antics he was asked to tackle, but Douglas navigates the material expertly and probably gives the film's best performance.<br /><br />I will say that the film is utterly unpredictable -- I could not guess how it was going to turn out right up until its closing credits.<br /><br />Grade: B
