I remember watching Cannonball run when i was just a child, the opening sequence with the black Lamborghini simply blew me away, and i have loved that car every since. That sequence simply sets the tone for the rest of the film.<br /><br />OK so it's dated now, and probably isn't very appealing to todays generation, but this is the original road movie epic and is crammed full of cheesy gags, road rage, fights, great characters, sexy women, sexy cars, and even the odd super hero (Dun Dun Darr - it's Captain Chaos) Oh i forgot to mention the all star cast - Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, Farrah Fawcett, Roger Moore, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jnr, Jackie Chan; Oh! Sod it there's too many to name, just watch it and see for yourself.<br /><br />Terrific Fun 7/10
