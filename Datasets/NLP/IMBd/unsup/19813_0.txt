This movie was a terrible mistake. The beginning is promising (Hopkins explaining his philosophy to reporters while using one of his contraptions), but the script goes nowhere. An otherwise admirable cast looks like they are trying to do something with it, and might have had a good time making it, but Alan Parker just didn't know what he was doing. I've seen other of Parker's films - admired many of them - and am just stunned at how badly this was put together.
