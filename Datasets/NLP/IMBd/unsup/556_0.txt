I really did enjoy this movie. I still do the costume of horny the clown is the best iv seen in a while the music was great. I don't care what others mite say but I hope a 2nd one does come out to entertain my friends and I again. It mite not be the best ever but it is a great film to watch with your buddies. From the comments on the movie that I have seen is just awful how they say thats the movie has so much thats wrong with it but to me I think this movie is attracted by the younger community rather the older. Iv had a few of my friends to watch the movie and they feel the same as I do and we are excited of the thought of a drive thru 2.
