Why follow a bad sequel with another even worse one ? GREED!! 3d was lame .. Only relation to JAWS are Chief Brodys sons. Mike now works at Seaworld and Sean shows up to visit his brother. No references to Amity or their mother or father . No originals appear in this movie which is a blessing . And once again as in Jaws 2 is continuity problem , Mike and Sean are considerably older than what they should be . This movie is supposed to take place 8 years after Jaws . That means they should be 13 and 18 . Instead actors Dennis Quaid and John Putch are in their twenties . Oh well , lousy movie anyway.
