I don't normally watch regular TV. Most of it, to me is boring and mundane. Besides, between digital cable, VHS and DVD rental possibilities and regular movies in theaters, why waste time with stuff full of advertisements and, for the most part, dumbed down? But as a fan of the Sopranos,I thought I would look at a ripoff of that show, for at least one episode. I wasn't sure then if I liked it, but watched the next couple of episodes, and by then I was hooked. It may be like the Sopranos in that it is about a modern crime family, but except for that is quite different.<br /><br />Kingpin is well written, well acted, and unlike most movies or series, actually causes you to think about it after you've watched it. I certainly hope NBC picks it up as a regular series.
