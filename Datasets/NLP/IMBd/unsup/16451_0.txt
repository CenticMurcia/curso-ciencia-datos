On the eve of the opening of his first gallery show, a photographer remembers that special summer that he spent with his somewhat older cousin, the feelings that were awakened, and the unexpected turn of events behind his "best" photo.<br /><br />This picture may be a short but it contains a lot of true moments. Having been at about the same age as the young man in this film, the memories that the film-maker shows, re-awoke a few memories in me as well.<br /><br />The image of the older cousin in those then-hip now-hideous, calf length athletic socks... That image alone made this film worth while.
