Oh my God....this movie so terrible. I love movie violence and all that, but this movie was too bad to describe. I registered just to say how much I HATE this movie. I watched it last night and I almost put my head through the T.V. It was on Superstation and it ran 3 hours long. GRRRRR. I can't believe I watched the whole thing. What the hell was with that South American drug lord guy??? His eyes were as big pool balls and he looked so damn relaxed through-out the whole movie I thought he was going to turn into a liquid. The start was bad....the ending was bad and overall it was a huge kick in the nuts. I got so angry and stressed over watching the movie that would'nt end that I am scarred for life. I WILL NEVER watch another Delta Force movie again as long as I LIVE!!!!!!! I'm getting angry just thinking about it.<br /><br />P.S Is it just me...or did that drug lord guy..whatever his name is play a drug lord in every Norris film ever made. I also noticed that all Norris does is fight South American drug lords. I wonder how many drugs this guy was on at the time?? GOD!!! I hated the 80's...still do and always will!!!!! ahhh...that felt better.<br /><br />Worst lines ever in the movie: (whispers in a stupid voice) lesson one (hits the guy) lesson two (hits him again) ...Schools out....<br /><br />AHHHHHHH....SOOOOOOO BAD!!!!!!!!
