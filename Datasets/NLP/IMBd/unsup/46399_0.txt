Chicken Little could have been excellent. The idea of the falling sky on the chicken and the chicken running helter-skelter informing everyone about what had occurred while the people do not pay any heed to his pleas is based on a children's fairy tale.<br /><br />But alas, Chicken Little, was just a bland, silly story which has a abominable ending, with half-baked side stories that are not focused upon. The chicken is always bullied and ridiculed by everyone who think that he is formulating his own stories about the sky falling down.<br /><br />Though I missed a part of the starting, it wasn't that much important. They show the town running everywhere but then realizing that the Chicken Little had just imagined that the sky was falling and had mistaken it for an acorn.<br /><br />Then there is a dramatic dialog about the father of the Chicken who is embarrassed and tells his son to not keep high hopes and the Chicken agrees and goes off to school where he is bullied by his classmates.<br /><br />He has a few friends like the Ugly Duckling, a Pig and Fish out of Water. He decides to sign for baseball where he is always told to take the bench while his nemesis Foxy Loxy becomes a star. This happens until the finals where the Chicken Little is responsible for the team to win and is respected and the people of the town forget about his past life, that is, the trouble he had caused by alarming everyone about the sky falling.<br /><br />Then he thanks the star whom he had wished for doing something magic before the match so that the people could forgive him (sorry for not informing before) and his father too is proud of him. Then at that moment, the sky actually falls which has some properties, like it can change and adopt the color on the object on which it is placed, like it turns brown whenever kept on a brown wall, similar to a chameleon.<br /><br />The Chicken informs his friends about this and they tell him to inform his father but he feels that if he tells his father and is father thinks that he had gone crazy again, he would be mocked and ridiculed. So, he doesn't inform his father, even when the fish is taken away.<br /><br />He and his friends try to rescue him and succeed but are attacked by the aliens who are planning to destroy earth by entering the planet from the broken fragment of the sky. The chicken alerts the town about the aliens but the aliens leave before he could give them the proof, and so, the chicken is ridiculed again for wrongly alerting them. Even his father loses trust in him.<br /><br />The chicken, therefore, is depressed until he finds the baby of the aliens who is, by mistake left back on the earth. Therefore, the aliens attack the earth to search for their baby and Chicken little, his father and his friends deposit the baby to the alien baby to his parents and they forgive them and don't destroy the earth and go back. At last, a movie is made on Chicken and the town celebrates. In the middle, two or three scenes are inserted showing the attraction between Chicken and Ugly Duckling.<br /><br />The things I liked about the movie are: (1) I liked Chicken Little as I found him cute and his voicing was done well (2) I liked the way they showed the part of the sky falling and the properties of the sky.<br /><br />But, sadly, Chicken Little fails to impress you. Its side stories, like the love between Chicken Little and Ugly Duckling, are shown blandly and you don't sympathize with any of the characters. It has a weak script with bad dialogs and nothing that funny or captivating and has referred other movies in it, which is sadly stupid and unnecessary. It has one of the worst and the most hurried up endings. Therefore, in the end, you do not feel that Chicken has suffered much and endured a lot of pain before achieving success in the end. The adult aliens are just so stupid, and are shown to be lovable at last. But before that, they were busy destroying planets? <br /><br />I would give this movie a 4 out of 10, and would not recommend this film for people who have high hopes with Disney and Pixar.
