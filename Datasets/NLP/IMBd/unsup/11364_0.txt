Johnny Yune stars in this rather unhumorous yet abundantly silly comedy spoof of Martial Arts films. For the most part this is just downright stupid and sometimes vulgar and distasteful. Still it is certainly better than anything Adam Sandler ever did.<br /><br />There are two scenes I liked...early on in the bar when the "I'm an Oriental" line gets carried a bit too far and later when Bruce imagines himself as the real Bruce--Bruce Lee. Also the women Margaux Hemingway (what's she doing in this?!) and Pam Huntington deserve points for at least trying. There are a few clever lines here and there as well.
