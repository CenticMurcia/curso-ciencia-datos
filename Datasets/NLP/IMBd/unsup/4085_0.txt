This is a truly awful movie and it reminds me of a part of American history that many of us would rather just forget. Yep, the time when Disco forged an unholy alliance with roller skating! This craze lasted about a week and a half and spurred on the creation of this terrible film. The movie is less a musical and more a teenagers save the roller disco from the evil corporation--all set to a disco beat. Linda Blair seems to try hard enough, but the horrid script, direction and the idiotic supporting actors they paired her with doomed this movie to oblivion. BUT, it's so bad, it's good. In other words, it will provide hours of laughter and the ineptness of the film.<br /><br />In addition, you should be aware that 1979-1980 also gave us perhaps the WORST musicals ever--not just Roller Boogie. Can you remember the horrific and big budget mess that was XANADU (Gene Kelly's body is STILL spinning in his grave for having appeared in this film)? Or, perhaps the West German sci-fi disco religious musical THE APPLE (where the good hippies were saved by a Cadillac driving Jesus at the end of the film)? Well, my advice is watch these terrible films to relive your past OR watch them so you can laugh at your parents who actually paid good money to see them!
