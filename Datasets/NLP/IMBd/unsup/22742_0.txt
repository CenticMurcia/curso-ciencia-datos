Although most were expecting a lot more from this film , for me this film did not disappoint. This film is for people who are looking for something different in a bollywood movie.If you are one of those who want to experience something new and exciting and different, then do watch this film. this is a beautiful and amazing work by SLB .I rate this as the best movie of SLB as iv being a fan of his movies since his debut with hamoshi each and every movie is different from one another and from all other movies made in bollywood .. when he remade decdas many tried their hands with umrao jaan , don and sholay but no one succeeded becos its not that everyone can make a great story into a great movie.as for the time its only SLB who have done this. and for the people who could not find a plot from this movie than better watch this again or read the short story White Nights.
