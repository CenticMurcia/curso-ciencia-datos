This is probably one of the best spy/action dramas ever made. It tells the history of a heroin junkie who has incredible killing capacities and fakes her death for becoming a government assassin. Luc Besson's Nikita has all: It has action, it has drama, tragedy, and even black humor (Victor the cleaner says it all) It is with a good script (few holes) a very good direction, excellent performances in everyone, thrilling music. It's the thing that James Bond never did Classic<br /><br />Just one of the best. This shows while it then had an American version, but it's not worth it. The character of Nikita is golden build, as the others, and the performance by the leading actress is amazing.<br /><br />Nikita<br /><br />Just Nikita
