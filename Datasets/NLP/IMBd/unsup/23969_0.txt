Wow! What can I say about this masterpiece. I have never seen a film before that when I first watched it, it completely blew me away - something that has never happened before. If you love high-impact action movies strung together with comic interplay then you'll love this. I bought the special edition, director's cut version with the extra 15 mins of film on video - and all I can say is it is much better than the TV version. Mark Dacascos and Kadeem Hardison (who are both my favourite moviestars) both shine as their characters and so do all the other stars. The on screen partnership is one of the best around. I have never seen martial arts action as good as this before - move over Jackie Chan - Dacascos is after your crown if this is anything to go by. The great thing about this film is that you will never get bored with it - I've watched it over 50 times now and it still doesn't let up. On a scale of how great this film is compared to others my 10 votes is probably too high but among all the great action films it fully deserves 8 votes. It has a great soundtrack (which I can't find anywhere), a decent plot, good acting, good characters, passes expectations and it certainly didn't win two awards for nothing!
