Like its predecessors, this series hits the high notes extremely well. Everything you love about the first two films is here with Motoko and the gang facing new threats in a world that's almost a mirror image of our present-day society. It's not hard to realize that technology in GITS: SAC may someday become a reality rapidly, but onto the series itself, as Roger Ebert once stated "it's unusual and challenging sci-fi aimed at smart audiences", that statement alone clearly describes it all. I must say though I enjoy the series, however the plot is a little confusing and complex but upon repeated viewings I appreciated it even more. Not too many anime series have that kind of depth and replay value which is why I'm not a huge fan of anime in the first place; this series grew on me and I'll be looking forward to seeing more of this highly engrossing cyberpunk universe that our heroes dwell in for years to come. Highly recommended if you like deep and thought-provoking high quality stories and art.
