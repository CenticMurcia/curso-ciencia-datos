I was intrigued by the storyline, as I was surfing the cable channel late one night; an apocalyptic tale of two lovers trying to escape to Antarctica to avoid a nuclear holocaust! What entailed, however, was one bumbling misstep after another by two young lovers who were not exactly the sharpest tacks in the box. How I made it through from beginning to end in itself was a Miracle! Don't waster your time on this horrible flick unless you are being paid large sums of money to watch it!
