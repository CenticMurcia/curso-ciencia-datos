I was a fan of the series even into '97. This movie made absolutely no sense. When I was 9, I thought it was cool to have a kid be a Power Panger...now I look back on it and cringe...they must've been desperate to keep people interested. And I do believe that we've already had a classic animated series in the '80s featuring cars turning into giant robots and it has a hit movie out now with Shia LaBeouf (Shia, if I spelled your name wrong, I'm sorry) called...I don't know...(cough)TRANS-(cough)-FORMERS(cough)! Bottom line, this movie would have a tough time surpassing Jaws 4...there I said it, as ashamed as I am to say it. (aside: I use Jaws 4 as a comparison to other films that are worse than bad to try and give an idea of how bad a film really is).
