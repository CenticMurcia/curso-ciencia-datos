Hey, can't I give this stinker a zero. I really hated to give it a one. Typical hollyweird ultra-left, lunatic fringe liberal crap. Production values seem good, cinematography okay....it's the story that's awful. My gosh, I hope and pray that our military is better trained and will carry out their orders better than depicted in this bilge. I've never been so disappointed in a movie in all my life. James Earl Jones, Rip Torn, Powers Boothe, Rebecca DeMornay, and the late Darren McGavin, the cast reads like a who's who of actors/actresses I've always liked and admired. I just downgraded them to my "B" list from now on. For me, the most ironic scene in the movie was when Rebecca De Mornay asked Powers Boothe "Did we do anything right?" My answer is NO!
