If there is a Hollywood blockbuster looming on the horizon, it is guaranteed there is an Asylum rip off already stocked at your local video store. Just look for any cover that hopes to ride the coattails of whatever is currently playing in theaters, and it is practically a given that the Asylum produced it. Not to say that this practice is necessarily a bad thing. Where would Fulci's Zombie have been if not for Romero's Dawn of the Dead? But it is the consistency and frequency that the Asylum cranks out these rip offs without any true artistry, integrity, or even any value for the genre. For example, if not for Jaws, Corman would have never produced Pirahna. But, whereas Pirahna was created as a fun, tongue in cheek, little thriller that knew to cleverly mock its source material all the while winking at the audience, the good folks at the Asylum only wish to cash in and worry about product quality later...much later. which brings us to King of the Lost World. Seeking inspiration from the dual sources of Doyle and Jackson, this film falls amazingly flat, real fast. Lacking any coherence, intelligence, and sophistication, the film plods along unveiling each special effect without anything really special. As for production value, the filmmakers really didn't care, since they were probably scouring the most recent issue of the Hollywood Reporter for their latest inspiration. Dull, cheap, and thoroughly boring, the only time this film attempts to wink at the audience is in the hopes that you'll come back for the Asylum's next feature.
