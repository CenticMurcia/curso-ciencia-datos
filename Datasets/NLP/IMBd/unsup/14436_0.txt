Some might say this is a "hard gore thriller". but i think this is not even a movie. The director said "i cut out some scenes to make audiences talk about this movie after watching it" but that means this movie doesn't make any sense. hard gore? it's not even a gore movie...just shows some mutilated bodies..that's all...it's not scarier than "silence of lambs" . Of course it can't be compared with "s.o.l (the master piece of this genres)" I think this is the worst thriller I've ever seen...If you want to watch this movie...why not try some trash-horrors...That would be much better...I'm surely a Korean people..but that can't be a reason to say this movie as a good one. this movie is a shame of all of us Korean ...
