Oh I certainly agree with the comments here, it was a beautifully done movie almost like a Shakespeare in Love type....its a theatrical setting put together on the silver screen. And since I am a stringent critic, I think the movie was a home run all the way. My rule of thumb is that i don't watch any new actors because they simply cant act and make the movie unbearable to watch, BUT the rookie Kapoor's were amazing. They acted like seasoned actors, especially Sonam (I think she could be the Kajol of this era), the Direction was just SLB perfect and even with the simple story line the plot was very elegantly and intricately developed (except the quick ending). And lastly yes I think its best if you watch this movie in a theater to be able to see all the intricate details of the set and etc....truly this movie in the theaters was an EXPERIENCE.<br /><br />And lastly if the movie had a better ending or a more developed ending, I would say that this perhaps could have been the best Indian Movie i have ever seen...but still i think its second to SLB's Devdas!!!! Enjoy!
