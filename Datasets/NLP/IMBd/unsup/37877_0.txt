There has to be something wrong, when you start to sympathise with the second leads instead of the two leads, which is the main problem with Griffin Dunne's mildly amusing, nasty, mean and cruel romantic comedy about obsessed and crazy ex-lovers Matthew Broderick and Meg Ryan combining their powers to separate their past lovers Kelly Preston and Tcheky Karyo from one another by playing tricks on them. While Dunne does everything to keep the audience entertained, Broderick and Ryan have nothing you could call chemistry. Karyo does heavy comedy in ridiculous slapstick scenes, which is not really the worst thing in this charm-lacking flick, and Preston is surprisingly tame, compared to her terrific support as bitchy ex-girlfriend of JERRY MAGUIRE (1996). That said, the solution is predictable and disappointing. All in all, rom-com average stuff.
