I should have known from the title screen onward that this was a bad movie. Come on... this cheap public domain horror font is used on amateur Halloween cards but not in the opening title of a horror movie. The best in this movie is the beginning of a girl in an asylum that goes nuts and rips out her eyes. You won't see any equally gory scenes for the rest of the movie. Basically it starts out with an asylum and some strange experiments and misuse of the inmates, one of them a tall guy with a deformed face (you never see it anyway) who soon escapes and goes on a ridiculous revenge ride.<br /><br />The first part with the asylum and the experiments is the central idea of the movie which gets picked up at the end again. In between you got a real lame take on the Halloween/Friday the 13th theme with a masked tall killer stalking victims and then killing some. No suspense here, the killer gets an uninteresting back story (which is the only link to the movies title) and talks some poetic gibberish and stalks a woman that you never quite understand why he is around her.<br /><br />It just is a really lame movie with some ideas thrown in a pot that just don't fit. The psycho killer character must be one of the most ridiculous in movie history and the acting is most of the time pretty bad. The only good scene in this movie is in the beginning, so basically you can save a lot of wasted time if you stop before the opening title appears.
