Contrary to the defamatory statements made by so-called Our Gang critics Hal Erickson and Leonard Maltin, I found this to be an amusing film. I especially enjoyed the scenes of Buckwheat, Big Shot, and Smallpox the dog, the phone booth, Buckwheat covered with ice, and the talking animation of the dog at the end. I found this film to be funnier than so-called Little Rascals' classics such as "Dogs is Dogs" which I did not find to be funny at all. Give these MGM episodes a break. Release them together with of all of the other 88 Hal Roach talking episodes in packets of DVDs. While I'm at it, maybe somebody will find all of the missing films of the silent Our Gang episodes. That way, all 221 of them will be ready for packaged release on DVD. What a collection!
