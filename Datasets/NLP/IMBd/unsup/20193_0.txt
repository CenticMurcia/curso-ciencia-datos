We sense the movie's love/hate relationship with all things flesh very soon. It's bodily fluids, food, animals, the dead and repeat. To any of these the film applies a perversity, and a fascination in their spectacle if carried out disgustingly. The film is a presentation, albeit an occasionally funny one, of human's ugliest and basest instincts  so much so that maybe even the humor is part of that cycle.<br /><br />All of it gets old very fast. The concept is just a creepy fetish, saying about human existence as much as flower power kitsch. It can be argued that the film is directed with a certain style but to me the mise en scéne seemed self-serving, a signpost of this being art. More importantly though, the film is constantly condescending towards its characters and though the purpose was probably to blame all the ugliness on our existence or on Communist states, finally the condescension and bestiality is all Palfi's.
