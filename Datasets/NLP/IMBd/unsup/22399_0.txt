I give this show 3 stars, because: 1 star.- It's the worst rating a show can get here.<br /><br />2 stars.- It helped me to realize how intelligent, hardworking, respectful, thankful and proud I am.<br /><br />3 stars.- Those girls, as stupid as they are, are SO FUNNY!! Those spoiled little brats get whatever they want just through crying, making they look miserable, crying, yelling swear words, crying, etc... I would say "poor parents", but it's their fault. No "poor parents" in this comment! <br /><br />In some episode, this girl was SO UPSET because her mommy gave her as a gift, a FABULOUS car, three days before the girl's birthday. She got ridiculously mad, crazy and furious, calling her mom a stupid, "what's her f---ing problem?"- she said, I mean, "babbled".<br /><br />Some random person Tina, I think her name was- posted that we, the ones that critic those kids, are jealous of 'em. Seriously, I don't feel jealous of kiddos with no respect for anything including them, no manners, no good-looks (do you think one of those children are at least decent-looking, SERIOUSLY???), no responsible parents, no true friends and the list goes on BUT they're SO FUNNY when they're all like "I'm the princess of whattheheckville" or "I'm the king of brainlessrichkidditown", like people REALLY gives a... care about 'em. Please. Their "friends" don't go to their parties to celebrate a sweet sixteen. They go because it's free, there's going to be delicious food and some hip hop star guy will perform there. I bet half of the guests don't know who the one turning sixteen is. I bet half of 'em doesn't know it IS a sweet sixteen party. Never mind. Even I would go to that party. And I would be one of the last mentioned.<br /><br />Still, I watch the show because it's SO bratty that it keeps me entertained for some half hour. Does it make sense? Not for me, either. But it's true. I deal with it.<br /><br />It's a funny show with funny kiddos and even funnier arguments -"I'm the perfect gal/guy, so my party has to be perfect". "I'm a princess/prince so my party has to be like royal". "I'm like, a cute hot kinda girl, like, my party like, has to be, LIKE like cute and hot".<br /><br />When I was younger, I never thought that people like that spoiled red-haired girl from "The Power Puff Girls" were real. Boy, I was wrong.<br /><br />Don't watch it if you are hard-working and humble, and don't like spoiled kiddies that think that everyone on Earth worships them. Watch it if you are hard-working and humble, and don't like spoiled kiddies that think that everyone on Earth worships them BUT you wouldn't mind laughing at the lack of brains on their brains.<br /><br />Kisses and hugs.
