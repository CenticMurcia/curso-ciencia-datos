The sense of derivation runs strong within "Madman", as the essence of the "Friday the 13th" influence is all that this movie seems to promote. Yes, here is more campground mayhem from the early 80s, really no different than the Crystal Lake massacre or Cropsy's rampage. A group of young person's at a remote campsite are picked off, one by one, by a deranged maniac inhabiting the dark woods. The beginning story teller describes the killer's crimes in detail - he was a farmer who butchered his family one night and now murders anyone he can get his disfigured paws on. His name: Madman Marz. As much as I enjoy summer camp slasher films, "Madman" is just a terrible attempt to cash in on the success of the time, and really lacks in every aspect. The concept is basic, even for this type of film, the gore is below average and the nudity is absent... Marz is a cool looking character at times, but the majority of the movie is just down-right dull with people slowly wandering through dark areas with flashlights. Very unnecessary since it is obvious who is going to live from the start... Very lousy slasher flick.
