I have to admit I didn't sit through the whole ghastly long presentation of the Oscars, but I think the fact that I found myself utterly unable to watch if all says enough for me to be able to comment. The whole thing was completely boring, totally unfunny and looked like it was barely keeping the audience interested, let alone me. Billy Crystal was not a good host. Well, he was confident and everything, but nothing he said was funny (although to be fair somebody else probably wrote it). I'm not sure if the audience has no sense of humour, or if they just felt obliged to laugh so as to not be rude (most likely). The laughs started to wear thin though and it was embarrassing to watch. It made me cringe. Okay, so there were some highlights: an emotional tribute to Gregory Peck, a nice interview with Keisha Castle-Hughes, and some great winners (the main four: Sean Penn, Charlize Theron, Renee Zellweger, Tim Robbins) and Johnny Depp being present. Unfortunately though, there were some crap presentations (a hideous Scarlett Johansson wears too much make-up and informs us that make-up can make us look gruesome...quite ironic...John Travolta and Sandra Bullock, both of whom I like, had to give some stupid speech about rehearsals and being earlyÂ…ha ha?). All the Lord of the Rings New Zealand jokes were rather lame and I don't think Return of the King deserved to win all of those; it just did a clean sweep because it's a well-made, huge-budgeted and fantastically-promoted blockbuster. Overall, I would have to say that the Oscars are highly recommended if your idea of fun is to watch rich arrogant twits in fancy clothes pat each other on the back and make totally lame and cringe-worthy attempts at jokes.
