Josef Fares had a success (in Sweden) making "Jalla, Jalla!". That film was a little overestimated, but it put some humour into the immigration questions in Sweden, although still being serious.<br /><br />"Kopps" is mostly childish, telling the story about the village police station getting closed and the local policemen trying to make crime statistics much worse than in reality. Sometimes it's embarrassing, including gags on the level of some 15-year-old director.<br /><br />They say Hollywood has bought the script and probably this can be done much better there. Josef Fares seems to have had a much too easy ride after "Jalla, Jalla!"
