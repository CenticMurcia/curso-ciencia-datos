Amazingly weird (or weirdly amazing?) movie of an odyssey of Spanish conquistadores through Central America 1582. Beautiful images, unseen collection of freaks and outcasts, strong and sometimes disturbing episodes. The plot has a few flaws, but this is a visual movie:<br /><br />Werner Herzog meets Fellini in the Mexican jungle, definitely worth seeing.
