This movie came highly recommended by nearly everybody. Thus, perhaps my disappointment was a result of high expectations.<br /><br />The movie is original in the way that the life of Amelie (and her friends/family/acquaintances) is presented; However the novelty wears off after an hour or so, and all that's left is a trite, highly predictable movie that I wound up turning off. 3/10
