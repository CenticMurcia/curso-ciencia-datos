This is the second film by cult, independent film-maker Kevin Smith. After the success of Clerks gritty, realistic story, Kevin Smith was given a budget (still small) and more respectable actors to work with. <br /><br />Unlike his debut however, Mallrats takes a similar premise and aims squarely for the teenage comedy market. Hence a heavy dosing of slapstick and crude humour courtesy of Jay and Silent Bob amongst others. Mallrats centres around Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) and T.S. Quint (London) as they try to win back their girlfriends at the local mall. Simple, barely original storyline. But at least it gives Smith the chance to flex his writing skills yet again.<br /><br />Jason Lee is great in his first major movie role and he easily makes the most of his dialogue. The rest of the cast are average and simply do the jobs they are intended to do. As for Jay and Silent Bob (Jason & Kevin), they yet again steal the movie simply by dropping in and out of the main story. One batman gag here, one dance scene there and the film is theirs. Playing a slightly more central role than in Clerks, these two are still great.<br /><br />Overall Mallrats is an acceptable second offering from Smith that he would later better with Chasing Amy. Watch Mallrats expecting crude, entertaining teen comedy and feel satisfied. If you feel like more afterwards, move on over to Chasing Amy and give that a whirl. Either way, Kevin Smith has continued to build his cult via Mallrats.
