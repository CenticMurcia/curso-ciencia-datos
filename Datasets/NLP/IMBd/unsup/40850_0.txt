Alright, maybe I shouldn't have expected much from a film called "Anita: Swedish Nymphet". Still, I was very disappointed by this Swedish softcore romp. The only reason why I watched it was because of Christina Lindberg. I'm a big fan of "Thriller: A Cruel Picture" (which remains the single greatest Swedish exploitation film of all time) and Mrs. Lindberg was truly revelatory in that. Shes hotter than all hell, combining a childlike face with a truly voluptuous body. In addition to being a major babe, shes a pretty decent actress as well. She can create sympathy and lend depth to her often depraved characters.<br /><br />With a title like "Anita: Swedish Nymphet", I was hoping Lindberg would appear naked a lot. Unfortunately, the film seems to want to create a serious study of "nymphomania", a symptom which has largely been proved to be nonexistent. So a lot of screen time is devoted to pseudo-academic talk and character exposition. If I would any of the characters remotely interesting, this could be bearable. However, the film becomes largely dull - it should have injected some life into the proceedings, gone over the top, and become a campy softcore romp. As it is, it isn't even good for unintended laughs.<br /><br />Still, the film is worth watching for Lindberg. When she does get naked, you can't take your eyes off the screen. Also, she does a good job with an uninteresting character. The film is worth watching if you were a fan of her work in "Thriller: A Cruel Picture", but don't be expecting too much. (4/10)
