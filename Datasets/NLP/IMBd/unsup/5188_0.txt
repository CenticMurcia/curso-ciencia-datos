I liked Adam and Eve because it is a nice romantic comedy which contains college humor as romance ass-well. It maybe just gets a little boring, and the relation between Adam and eve does not really develops true the movie, but maybe that was the whole point? I thought the acting was nice but don't know much about it, why does this review has to be 10 lines?<br /><br />To all who are saying this isn't National Lampoon enough: Does it has to be? What's wrong with a nice Romantic Comedy? For all those who just want 2 C something fun new movies Sex Drive and The Hangover are very nice, also Yes-Man is a good one if you want to have a good laugh.<br /><br />Conclusion: NICE movie, watch it. I enjoyed watching it and I give it a 7/10.
