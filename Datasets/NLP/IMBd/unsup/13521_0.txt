This movie was excellent. I have seen lots of sad movies, and movies to invoke the human spirit, but this was one of the best. The tragedy these boys feel is so powerful. The loss that is felt at the end can be shared by millions of people who have lots someone that close to them. I think they did a great job writing staring and producing this movie. I know it is like 6 years old I have just finished watching and plan to add it to my collection to watch again. If there is anything that I would like is maybe more history, not only on their characters but maybe their mother as well.No matter what any one has to say about this movie I believe it should be a classic for all times.
