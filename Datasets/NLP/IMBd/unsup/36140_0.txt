An average tale of a guy who, out of desperation, chooses the wrong drinking buddy and gets into trouble. Estevez is great in this movie, and the real laughs start when he gets busted by the cops. Before that, the parties looked boring and the partiers acted like they were trying too hard to be cool. Many situations were predictable for me, I knew he would get busted on the rooftop as he was about to kiss the girl and I knew he would get held up right after he said he was 50 feet from the police station. At times I was having more of a time picking out who I recognized from other films....the wanna-be pimp was the gas station attendant from Dusk Till Dawn, the drunk at the bar was the head of the jail from Bad Boys (Sean Penn flick, NOT the Martin Lawrence one with the STOLEN name), the bartender is a bit player in many films. This movie reminded me somewhat of Blind Date with Bruce Willis in that everything was going wrong on his night out too and he also ended up getting busted.
