Man, this movie sucks! I watched it for Linda Blair and she does nothing but whinge and scream. She doesn't want to be in the house in the first place and her character does absolutely nothing. The other characters are a lame love interest guy and two typical horror movie staples, the horny, drug taking soon-to-be-dead couple who do nothing but have sex until they die. Hell Night is a series of rather lame characters not doing very much interspersed with a couple of rather lame deaths committed by a rather lame maniac. <br /><br />You learn everything you need to know from a two minute speech at the start of the movie (the bit where the guy explains the history of the house) and from then on the story is at a stand still. People wander off and die every now and again until eventually it's just Linda Blair and the monster guy. She doesn't even try to kill him, she's trying to run away. There is no character development at all. This is the kind of film that gives the horror genre a bad name. It's stupid, childish, boring, badly acted, terribly written and I'm not even convinced the director was looking through the camera.<br /><br />If you want a classy old slasher film, I recommend Black Christmas. Inventive, scary, funny and well shot, it's everything Hell Night isn't. Hell Night doesn't even appear to be trying.
