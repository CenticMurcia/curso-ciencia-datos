Thankfully not a lot of people saw this movie, but it's scary that a film like this could be made in 2006. I enjoy politically incorrect movies when they make fun of people's ignorant perspectives, but this film was flat out racist. How many Asians are really represented in the film industry on or off camera. Here you have an unlikeable Asian character who has a "chip on her shoulder" because the "white man" won't let her in the film industry. She's poked fun of like the director's saying "take off the training wheels- you're just untalented." But, let's pose this question: is it really unjustifiable for her to have the perspective that the industry is a closed industry. Open your eyes and look at the amount and quality of work that's out there for minorities, especially Asians. Go to the DGA or SAG and get the facts. It seem like the director is saying that the industry is not closed- people make it on their own talent. If Asians are underrepresented, is he saying they have no talent (just look at Ang Lee, Zhang Yimou, Gong Li)? Why mock a person with no talent and make her Asian, who belongs in Chinatown to a buffoon-like family of kung fu artists. The fact that this director is Jewish and has no ability to make reference to being a victim of prejudice is hypocritical and plain idiotic. It seems like he had his own personal vendetta and made this horrific picture. How would he feel if people thought every Jew in the industry is working because of nepotism.
