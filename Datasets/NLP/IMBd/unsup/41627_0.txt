Van Damme made a couple of terrible movies after the success with "Bloodsport", and this one is without doubt one of them. Although this is said to be a sequel to "Masters of the Universe", I really don't understand why, because I have problems in finding any connections between the two movies. Then, over to this movie. In fighting movies, I usually don't care about story at all. But here, I just had to. It was so bad that I just couldn't believe it. Things seem to happen without a specific reason. For example, I never could figure out why the bad guy (Bender) was bad. He just did what he did, without proper explanation. The fighting is bad too. Many of the fight scenes include use of knives, it was too much of that in my opinion. And when it comes to the final scenes, that was so typical B-action. It was also so extremely bad that i sat and laughed through it. That's really not a sign of quality, especially in a movie that totally lacks self-irony.
