This is such a powerful movie. Without revealing any of the plot details, I will just say that at the "preclimactic" moment I thought it was anyone's guess as to which way the chips would fall... I was literally holding my breath in anticiaption. <br /><br />The movie was beautifully shot, artfully written and skillfully acted. I can't shake the image of the characters as each realizes the life-altering consequences that their behavior had on themselves and each other. <br /><br />I saw it at the Stony Brook Festival (July 2005) and hope it will be released nationally although I'm not so sure it's a film that will appeal to a wide audience. I admire Campbell Scott and his production company for making the film. I hope at the very least that it successfully plays the "art house" theaters and has a big DVD distribution. I think that word-of-mouth will take this film far among true movie lovers.
