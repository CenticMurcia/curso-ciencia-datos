X-Men was the movie that started the modern comic book movie craze. While some of those attempts (Ghost Rider, Superman Lives) were totally inept, this X-Men falls into the good category. This movie works well as an introduction to the characters in the story. Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) started a school for mutants. In his care are Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry), and Jean Grey (Fahmke Jansen). Through a series of unfortunate events, they meet Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin). On the other side is the Brotherhood, led by Magneto (Ian McKellan). On his side are Mystique (Rebecca Rojmin Stamos), Toad (Ray Park), and Sabretooth. What I liked about this one is that the movie explored the flip-side of having super powers. In a way, they are powers the mutants love and hate. Their is a bad side to them. Cyclops can never look at someone with his own eyes. Rogue is isolated, living in a world where she cannot touch anyone. Also, there is conflict within their own ranks. Wolverine, always being the maverick he is, does not know which side to join. He does not trust anyone. Another strength is Ian McKellan who plays Magneto with such charm. His a sympathetic villain who uses questionable means for his gains. For him, it is much easier to sacrifice others than himself. I also liked the commentary in the film that did not hit us over the head with the shovel. It is obvious the corrupt Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) was inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's paranoia and Fundamentalism that has ostracized the homosexual community. I did have a few gripes with this film. Except for Magneto and Wolverine, there was not good character development. Also, the movie was a bit short, which is was prevented the deeper character development. However, overall, X-Men was a good start to a good trilogy of the 2000's. These mutants only got better from here.
