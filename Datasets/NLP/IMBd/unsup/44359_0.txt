I read and loved the book. It is a gripping story of perseverance.<br /><br />I could not watch this whole movie. Seconds turn to minutes then before long a couple of hours are gone and you'll start thinking that you should have spent the time fixing the dishwasher or washing the dog. Each climbing scene takes a couple of minutes then it is off to another "personal account" interview with the actual people who the story is about. It switches back and forth very regularly and it eventually drove me crazy and I had to leave the room. My wife wouldn't let me fast forward through the boring parts. She liked the movie. I was hoping for some dancing girls or car chase scenes to liven things up.<br /><br />My score is raised a little more than the above description might lead you to think because the mountain scenes with the actors are filmed really well. I could easily imagine myself there with the climbers. It was very realistic. I guess it is hard to squeeze 15 minutes of content into a 2 hour movie so I shouldn't be so hard on them.<br /><br />If you know the story then the prolonged agony portrayed by the actors doesn't create any suspense like it might if you didn't know the outcome. The key word is "prolonged" which pretty much describes it.<br /><br />Read the book. Forget about the movie.<br /><br />Daddy Dave Fort Collins, CO
