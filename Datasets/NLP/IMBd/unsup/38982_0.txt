Almost eleven years ago, I saw the movie 'The Being". Beginning, story, end, plot ? None of these were present in the movie. I remember that at the beginning you couldn't hear or see the players. But I noticed very soon that it wasn't worth to watch this movie any further. So, I stopped the movie after +/- 50 minutes. This was enough !!! Was this a movie from the early 80's , CAN'T BE, I THOUGHT. It seems it was more a movie from the early 50's or 60's. By the way, it's more like a humor-movie. PLS DON'T BEGIN TO WATCH THIS LIKE A GOOD HORROR-MOVIE, BUT ACCEPT IT AS A HUMOR-MOVIE. IT'S FOR SURE THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE !!!!!!!
