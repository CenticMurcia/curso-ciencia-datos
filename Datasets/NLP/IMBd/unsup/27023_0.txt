I loved this movie from beginning to end. In the beginning i thought it was gonna be just another mindless violence movie which would be fine by me cause i like those a lot, but the point is that it caught me by surprise with a great plot about national security and actually good drama too between the stars. Natasha Henstridge does her first "real" acting in this movie as the girlfriend and is great. Andre Braugher is as good as he always is. Lou diamond phillips fresh off of Bats joins this movie as the FBI agent and does a great job. The guy who plays harry takes the show though, i don't even remember his name and i'm too lazy to go look here for it, but point being he is a really good actor and i'll look for him in the future. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies with substance or just good movies. Enjoy.
