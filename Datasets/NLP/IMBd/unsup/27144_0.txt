OK, I must say, this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Not because it was meant that way, but because it was really bad. The electric effects looked like they were put in with ''paint'', a standard windows program. A sword came from nowhere, and even in the final ''fight'' you could see a part of the shadow of the camera man.<br /><br />But if you don't take it too serious, it'll be a funny movie. At times I really laughed my ass off. I've shown the movie to all my friends, and watched it myself about 3-4 times.<br /><br />I just loved the hand. It was just too funny as it crawled around. The woman, can't remember her name, been a while since I've watched it. was hilarious too. <br /><br />If you don't take things too serious, this is a movie worth watching, but don't watch it because you want good action.<br /><br />note: some people might hate this movie, which is logical, but they shouldn't take it that serious.
