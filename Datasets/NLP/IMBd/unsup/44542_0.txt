some pictures are stupid, other's are fun. Wayne's World is so stupid that it becomes funny. but you'll have to be in the mood for a comedy if you watch this. especially with a comedy like this one. the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was boring. in fact it is. you see the stupidities of two young men who are trying to have a television show. it's predictable that someone will notice them and give them a chance, which will lead to giant mistakes or jokes (if you may call it a joke). in fact, it is a joke. it's one big joke and it ain't funny. if someday the devil will make you choose between damnation or watching Waynes World II (because there really is a sequel on this), what will you choose? I know. I will choose...
