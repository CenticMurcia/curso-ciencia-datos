I liked this movie much better than Schindlers List. To me that movie was way too violent. Plus I really like Kirsten and Brittney. It's about this rich girl who doesn't want to celebrate the Jewish holidays with her family and drinks to much wine at her aunt's house. When she is asked to open the door for Elijah she goes back in time to learn about what really happened to the Jewish people. What was really sad was how her character died to save her friend that was sick and was said to be sent to the gas chamber. I think it is very sad what they had to go through. Much worse than what blacks had to go through and you don't hear them whining. I would recommend this movie along with The Diary Of Ann Frank. You won't regret it.
