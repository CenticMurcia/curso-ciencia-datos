A faux documentary about home buying. A mockumentary. I'm sure real estate agents won't appreciate it, but at least it's not an actual documentary and they can get a chuckle or two. All acted, nothing real, though the scenarios feel real enough.<br /><br />Great acting carries the film, which, while it has an interesting starting concept, pretty much depends on the interactions of the characters to carry it.<br /><br />So, in short, a good idea half thought out and rescued by the acting. As a short or part of a 2 part film that doesn't require the parts come together it could work. The problem may also be that there were some of the clich√© Hollywood scenes that seemed to be built in after the fact for the sake of wider audience appeal, leading to less audience appeal.
