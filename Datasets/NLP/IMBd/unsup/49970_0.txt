I love movies, and I am very forgiving of most of them. (I usually like thriller/suspense movies.) But Nightwatch I gave a 1. I never give movies a 1. It's especially odd in this case as I usually LOVE Ewan McGregor. But even he (and all of it's other big-name stars) could not save this poorly written, badly executed, gross, retarded-plot movie.<br /><br />A law student has a whacked out, bored best friend, a really nice but under-defined girlfriend, some sort of poorly outlined, difficult childhood past and then gets a job as a nightwatchman in a morgue to pay for school. (This involves checking to make sure that the bodies are okay each night.) The plot just gets worse from there. I won't go into details, but realize that it's set in a morgue (just go with that image for a second), involves really icky mental disorders, hookers, bored twenty-somethings and a serial killer.<br /><br />Perhaps Nick Nolte's worst role EVER. Ewan McGregor just looks embarrassed, as do Josh Brolin and Patricia Arquette. Filled with gratuitous nastiness and gross-out violence, this movie, rather than being redeemed by such a good cast, serves only to add a black mark to their career resumes.<br /><br />As I said, I love movies and rarely, rarely, rarely diss them this hard, but I honestly believe that this is the worst movie I have ever seen.
