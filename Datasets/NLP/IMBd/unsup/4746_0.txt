*May Contain Spoilers*<br /><br />I found "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" to be entertaining, funny, and cute. I saw it in the theater with my sister and friends and we all liked it. I found the plot to be original and the acting was good. The characters were also realistic.<br /><br /> "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" is a twisted tale about Andie Anderson, who writes "How To" articles and Benjamin Berry, and advertiser. Andie Anderson is writing an article entitled "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" and Benjamin Berry made a bet with his workers/friends that he can keep a relationship with a girl for more than ten days. Andie and Benjamin meet and fall in love and then the action happens.<br /><br />I suggest that everyone should see this movie because it really is funny. I give this movie 9/10 stars.
