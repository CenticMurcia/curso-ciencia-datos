Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this trite comedy, but it seemed to me to be all over the place. Hedy Lamarr plays a silly woman, who, neglected by her astronomer husband, William Powell, believes an astrologer who tells her that she will meet another man at a certain time. She does, and it turns out to be the neighborhood air raid warden, James Craig. She then announces she's leaving her husband, to his consternation.<br /><br />The heavenly body refers to Lamarr, of course, who is absolutely gorgeous in this movie as usual, if not much of an actress, also as usual. She did have one of the most exquisite faces of all time, though. The heavenly body also refers to Whitley's comet, a comet to be named after her husband.<br /><br />Powell handles the comedy well. It's a good cast, mildly enjoyable, but in the end, there's not much to it.
