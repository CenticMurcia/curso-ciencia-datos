A romantic movie, with the O'Connell's usual humor. If you liked Tomcats, you'll LOVE this movie. Amazing twists and turns with an overall awesome romantic storyline of what love and everything about love really is about. Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder) was, as usual, a great comedy actor, and we got to see his oh so nice butt, again in this movie! Kept me in a laughing riot, as well as a romantic 'aawww' feeling. All in all, I would definitely recommend this movie.
