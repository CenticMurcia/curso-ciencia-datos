This film seems tailor-made for Ms. Crawford and her persona. A controlling housewife, Harriet Craig, she controls all of her husband's life, (portrayed well by a kind-hearted Wendell Corey), who you may also recognize as the long suffering husband in "No Sad Songs for Me".<br /><br />Harriet is a desperate housewife, whose own father abandoned her. Her mission in life is order and control, of the house, her husband, and his career. She refuses to have children, and conceals this from her husband ( unheard of in 1950!).<br /><br />Crawford looks lovely, is a beautiful woman, but people have problems relating to her. She is not an accepting person. Eventually her scheming and attempt to thwart Corey's trip to Japan disgusts him, and he decides he can carry on his life in a more normal manner with someone, anyone else.<br /><br />Crawford and her hauteur are classic, there are some small scenes which are almost amusing as she obsesses about a vase, and scolds a young neighbor boy. Overall a do not miss. 9/10.
