i've heard of this movie, but i've never really paid attention to its review, for those who enjoyed this movie...by golly, i don't know how you guys manage to but we all have our differences.<br /><br />this movie as most other recent HK martial arts movies (with young unexperienced actors when it comes to chinese kung fu movies) is too dependent on CGI, what's the point in watching a movie filled with CGI's??? (Computer Graphic Images), the actors gets to do nothing, the viewers is watching a bunch of incompetent scenes. they should just make the whole movie in animation, there's nothing great nor close to decent in these kind of movies (talking about Legend of Zu, Legend of Tekken, all bunch of crappy CGI movies).<br /><br />now if it was wire fighting, it would've been better (like yuen woo pings movies). enough of how bad the movie is, let's move on to the plot of the movie<br /><br />so Hero's parents are murdered and he decides to move to America, his wife becomes pregnant on the night before he moves and the wife and her brother decides to look up Hero to tell him the good news, on the day that she concieves her twins, one (the daughter) is taken away by a corrupted chinese guy co operating with the japanese ninjas that are looking for a duel with Hero and his master Pride. his wife passes away, and Hero is told to be "born under the star of death" which basically means all his dearest will meet a tragic end, which the movie has successfully implied. so he decides to stay away from all his dearests and live a lonley life.<br /><br />the movie either intentionally leaves some of the things incomplete for whatever reasons or it simply forgot to explain what happened to Hero's daughter. this movie reminds me of a chinese fantasy movie because of Shadow<br /><br />Shadow depicts the same character in that fantasy movie as he is armless and carries an identical mask to cover his face and his fighting style is based on footwork and his ponytail. anyhow all in all this movie is really bad, if you absolutely find NOTHING to watch or do then fine go ahead and give this one a shot, but beware of it's absolute ridicule plot and directing.<br /><br />0/10, i'd rate it even lower if it had negative.
