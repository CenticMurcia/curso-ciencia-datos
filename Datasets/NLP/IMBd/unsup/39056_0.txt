Potter must indeed be an "aquired taste".I found this mini-series really hard going.I recall the 1930s and the traveling salesmen who led a hand to mouth existence,maybe unpleasant memories were evoked? The music held my attention-sort of swung along...I was glad to see Arthur swing in the end also:-)I'm probably not a Hoskins fan.He always seems to try to hard. I thought Cheryl gave a very polished performance .From the moment she appeared the viewer could sense a repressed self bursting to get out! (Quite a surprise when her alter-ego Bonnie Parker emerged,eh!)<br /><br />I must see the movie version,maybe a change of principal actor might make a difference.It is not a memorable tale in my opinion.
