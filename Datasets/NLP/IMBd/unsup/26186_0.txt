A definite film of the macabre again proving that there was no one like Geraldine Page for these neurotic, vicious parts.<br /><br />In this one, Ruth Gordon takes a job as a maid in Page's home under false pretenses. It seems that Gordon had a disagreement with her long time domestic, played by Mildred Dunnock. In a huff, Dunnock walked out and went to work for Page.<br /><br />Seems that Page has quite a history. Once she finds out that her maids have no family, she does them in quite neatly.<br /><br />Throughout the film you constantly are hearing Page yelling Mrs. Dimmock to maid Gordon, as she begins to suspect that Gordon is no usual maid.<br /><br />The film takes place in the desert of Arizona which seems to place a peculiar and effective aura to the film.<br /><br />The ending is an absolute knockout.
