After watching this, I decided to read about Teddy Roosevelt. Wow! The movie captures him perfectly - as his wife Edith says, "a force of nature". And then I watched the movie again, and Wow! After reading, I know that Teddy and these Rough Riders were right at the front starting the USA on a course to joining the world powers. So, this is historically important stuff. Furthermore, from what I have found out so far, the movie was factually honest. Furthermore, the movie moved right along, was entertaining, frightening, and uplifting, all at the same time. Lastly, if Teddy had not come back alive, I would have proposed to Edith - what a gorgeous gorgeous lady. This movie is now one of my favorites.
