Comedy Inc is the worst sketch comedy show I have ever seen on television in my entire life! The sketches they do are awful (or I guess I should say the sketches that they did do because thankfully this show has finally been taken off the air). It is shows like Comedy Inc that prove to me that Canadian television is really sick and the industry as a whole needs to be fixed somehow, because if this is the kind of crap that the comedy channel and CTV will turn out again and a again they clearly do not care one bit about the quality of their programs, they obviously want to just make whatever is cheap that fits the "Canadian made" bill, and in which case I think they should just pull the plug totally and we can just watch BBC or an American channel. It makes me sick that my tax dollars etc are going to give jobs to people like whoever produces this horrible show.
