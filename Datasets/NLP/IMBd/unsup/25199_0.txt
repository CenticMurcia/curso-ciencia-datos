This is another Chan period film with a "revenge for killing my master" plot. Chan has more of a central role in this film than in his previous films. There are several fights in the film involving Chan, but most of them are limited in scope until the final six or seven minutes in the showdown sequence. Then we see one of the better Chan fights amongst all his earlier films. The dubbing isn't the best and the plot is nothing new, nor is its execution. This is a good chance to see Chan in one of his earlier efforts where he has a central role, unlike many of the films where he has a smaller supporting role. There is no sense of humor here either, as Chan's later films have. Overall, typical of its kind, not up to later Chan efforts. *1/2 of 4 stars.
