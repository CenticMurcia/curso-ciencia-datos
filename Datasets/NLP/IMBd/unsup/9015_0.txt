All in all, this is probably in my top 5 books-turned-movie. I absolutely loved the book when I read it while I was in gradeschool. Its one of those eye-opening books that makes you look at humanity in a completely different way, and so I was incredibly excited when I found out that it would be adapted into a movie. About 90% of what happens in the movie happens in the book, and the remaining 10% are things I would consider improvements to the book. While many people complain about the "lack of action and adventure", the movie kept my interest the whole time, and there was more than one scene that caused me to hold my breath--sure, there were no gory fight scenes, but there was plenty of suspense. I would definitely recommend this movie for all ages, as it has just the right balance of mystery, suspense, and comedy, as well as lessons that can--and should--be taught to everybody.
