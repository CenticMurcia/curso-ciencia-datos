"Thos. Cat," the night watchman, is too sick to go to work so he gives his cap and flashlight to his little son.<br /><br />Soon, the mice (they look more like rats) see the little guy, find out he's subbing for his dad, and then go to work devouring all the food in the building's kitchen. How they eat the food, from bananas to olives to pretzels to watermelons, etc., is very funny.<br /><br />The mice even start cooking some steaks and the little tabby tells them, "Hey, fellas, please don't eat all the food. I'm supposed to protect this place." They tell him to scram, put on a quick floor show and then punch him out. <br /><br />The little mouse's guardian angel gives him a pep talk and things begin to change.<br /><br />Not bad: a cute little cartoon.
