This is a bad movie. Everything is wrong with it. Just, everything.<br /><br />Technically the director constantly "crosses the directorial line" and the cinematography is often not carefully composed and the scenes are poorly light.<br /><br />The dialogue is terrible. Its as if the script was written by a student. Because the dialogue is so terrible, the performances are just as bad. The two leads have no chemistry. And the plot, apparently based on a Shakesperean play, is ridiculous in a modern setting.<br /><br />That said, I did like the premise of the film. The film is a satire of Bollywood films, which in itself is an interesting ideas, but unfortunately it is not executed well.
