This entire movie just felt entirely too rushed. The opening sequence where Stepmother gets her hands on the wand happen all in the confines of a song about how in love the prince and Cinderella are, and then we're OFF! The songs were terrible for the most part, the plot seemed to keep inventing new parts of the kingdom out of nowhere (suddenly it's a seaport town), and the action was at times even too cartoonish for a cartoon. There was also entirely too much time dedicated to the prince and his father who are both, frankly, completely uninteresting characters. The movie also creates an entire subplot about another character that was left completely unresovled save for a brief glimpse of a picture of what may happen to her, and the end credits put over snapshots of the happy couple seemed entirely too smarmy for a movie that's supposed to be "Happily Ever After THE END". The voices were almost all completely wrong, Gus and Jacques' new voices made me cringe, and Anastasia sounded like one of the Animaniacs. Of course, there were a few good things, it was always fun to see Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) appear on the screen and when she left you wished she would come back, and the movie would be entertaining enough for a child, but it sadly doesn't even scratch the surface of the true classic, the original Disney's Cinderella.
