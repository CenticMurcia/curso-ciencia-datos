Not bad for a lower-budget fantasy drama. Actually written to be a comedy of sorts, LEGEND OF THE BOG has a 2,000 year old warrior washing up perfectly preserved in a rural Irish peat bog. A greedy real estate developer orders the 'bog-body' to be secretly disposed of. He rises from the dead and goes on a rampage. The developer, an archaeologist , their drivers and a young couple of girls find themselves lost and taking refuge in the rustic home of a hunter. They all have independent dark secrets that the 'bog-body' by legend seeks vengeance on their secret past misgivings.<br /><br />I can't imagine this not going straight to DVD. Also starring are: Jason Barry, Adam Fogerty and Shelly Goldstein. If this was shown in a theater it would have to compete with the refreshments.
