I am a big Rodney Dangerfeild fan and this was the worst movie I have ever seen. This piece of c**p does not deserve the minimum rating of 1 that I gave it. The biggest disappointment is when the screen says "The End" and its not over, there are 20 MORE MINUTES!!!! Not only was this movie not funny but a half hour into it I was hoping all of the characters would die so I could stop watching. I thought it was a good use of symbolism casting Joey Budafoco in this movie because just like him this movie is TRASH. If I were presented with the choice of watching this again or renting 8 minute abs with special guest host Janet Reno. Im gonna Renosize.
