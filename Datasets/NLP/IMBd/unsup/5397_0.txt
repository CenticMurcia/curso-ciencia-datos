I am among the many who would like to have a copy of this movie. Imagine seeing a made- for-TV movie just once, and never being able to forget it. I had read the book beforehand and found it to be an excellent novel (which led me to read more of Searles' books). What a thrill it was to see the movie so beautifully express this excellent novel. It's a real drama, the characters are real human beings, and it's a very moving story, without car chases and explosions, so unlike most of today's movies. I suppose for that reason, it will never be released on DVD. But I keep hoping.<br /><br />Cliff Robertson is a great actor, and it's a miserable shame that he should have been "black- balled" by Hollywood. If you like him, you might enjoy the wonderfully melodramatic "Obsession." <br /><br />This may have been Angie Dickinson's best performance, although she was also terrific in in "Dressed to Kill." <br /><br />Both Obsession and Dressed to Kill are Brian DePalma films which have a particular flavor all their own. I recommend them.
