John Goodman as Santa Claus? Pleeease. He gives Santa's from any movie, TV special or mall a bad name. Well for the exception of the movie "Bad Santa". He was even worse than ole Billy Bob's Santa. He was unkempt and resembled a alcoholic version of his character. I think the director and writer were going for the opposite of the animated version, because that is what they got. Too bad John Goodman never saw the original. His comment in an interview was to make him a "grumpy old bastard". How in the spirit of Christmas is that comment. They didn't let Delta Burke use her own southern accent, and yet listen to Goodman, and he is anything unlike has ever been heard from a Santa. The original had Mrs. Claus, Jingle & Jangle more prominent. They should have left it that way and left Goodman's part minimal, very minimal, or just chose someone else to do it. He should stick with animated voices like "Frosty". The character of "Sparky" (Chris Kattan) should have been left out. He was annoying. He & Goodman should have just stayed in their trailers or where ever bad actors go. Eddie Griffin & Ethan Suplee did pretty good for the scripts they had. It is hard to make bad material good, but they did good. Delta's part was way too small but she did do pretty good as well. The producers, director and writers should be a shamed of themselves for putting such crap out their. It is worse than anything I have ever seen.
