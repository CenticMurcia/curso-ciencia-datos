I know nothing about the reality of the supposed true story it is based on. But someone came up with a great first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes, and then promptly did a runner, leaving their abandoned 5 year-old daughter to finish it off. Yet another appalling screenplay that is far more painful than any brutality inflicted on screen. There is presumably a crowd of people who find this lowbrow fodder food for thought. Fine. But what is left for us grown-ups is way too stupid, crass and plain unforgivable. I suggest you watch the intro, then do something more useful like counting the hairs on your forearm, and make sure you set your alarm to ensure that you don't miss the ending. If this was an essay, I'd give it D+ and note that if they had written more than 4 lines, it would have been great.
