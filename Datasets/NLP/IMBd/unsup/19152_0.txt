Three years ago when I was watching the Cartoon Cartoon Top 5, and first place went to an episode of the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy named Night of the Living Grim. I found it funny, and I have been watching the show ever since.<br /><br />A happy-go-lucky boy named Billy (Richard Steven Horvitz) and a cynical girl named Mandy (Grey DeLisle) own the Grim Reaper (Greg Eagles) because they won a limbo match against him (the bet was placed over the soul of Billy's pet hamster). The show accounts their many adventures, which range from problems that most kids their age face to situations involving supernatural creatures.<br /><br />One of the reasons why the show is so funny is because it depicts the Grim Reaper as a childish, washed-up individual. Another reason is because the only intelligent human in the show is Mandy, while everyone else is either stupid or insane. The only reason why I don't give this a perfect 10 is because there are a few flaws to the show. First of all, Billy, although funny, can get annoying occasionally, and sometimes the show overuses potty humor.<br /><br />Warning: this show is not for everyone. How much you like the show will depend on two factors. The first is how much you can tolerate the potty humor used in the show, and the second is how much you view the characters Billy and Mandy. You will either view Billy as an annoying, disgusting idiot who uses Grim like a toy, or you will view him as one of the funnier characters of the show. As for Mandy, you will either view her as a spoiled, manipulative child who only thinks about herself, or you will view her as a semi-Gothic girl who steals the show.<br /><br />Grade: A- (Fantastic)
