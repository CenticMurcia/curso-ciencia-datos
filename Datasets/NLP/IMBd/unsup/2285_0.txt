I agree with the others who say that All Passion Spent should be made available commercially, I vote for a DVD. It has stayed with me since I saw it on Masterpiece Theatre in the '80s. It is a perfect piece. The performances, the cinematography, the music, and the sometimes poetic script combine to provide a very affecting experience. I have an old tape that I made from TV, it isn't very good quality and each time I watch it I worry that it is going to disintegrate. While on a tour of Hampstead, I came across the house that was used in the film as the house that Lady Slane bought, it was quite exciting. I pray that somehow this moving, gentle, inspiring work of art will be re-issued, so that it can be enjoyed again by the many who love it and enrich the lives of those who have yet to see it.
