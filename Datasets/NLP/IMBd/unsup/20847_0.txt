The only people who find this show funny are teenagers, Anglophile Americans, middle class people who think this stuff is cutting edge and people with questionable intellect.<br /><br />When this show first appeared, it seemed to be genuinely making an attempt to be fresh, interesting and relevant to modern Britain but it quickly became apparent that it is, in fact nothing more than an 1/2 hour Carry on film, only with less subtlety and innovation.<br /><br />If you want cutting edge British Comedy then go for Blackadder, The Day today, i'm Alan Partridge, Brasseye, Spaced, The Fast Show, The Office or the excellent Peep Show.<br /><br />If on the other hand you want silly, surreal yet still very funny British comedy then go for Garth Marenghi, The Mighty Boosh, The IT crowd or Even dare i say, Red Dwarf.<br /><br />Little Britain may make you smirk from time to time but essentially this is the most god awful piece of crap imaginable. People who think this is funny, will look back in ten years time and feel embarrassed and ashamed of themselves. Most likely, they'll claim they never liked it at all. This isn't just a step backwards in the history of the magnificent British comedy scene, it's a jump <br /><br />Avoid at all costs.....it's total, utter crud!
