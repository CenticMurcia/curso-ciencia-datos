Long ago,the deities were sent to the heavens and hells.The major deity,Rudra must refresh and cleanse the world per every 4,000 years.Four races appeared,the wise Danan espers,the moist habitat-dwelling Mizushu people,the boastful reptillian Hahchu-Rui people and the tough-as-nails Kyojins.But now that humanity became the major race of the bunch,they must save others,discover the secrets,interact with each other and most importantly,encounter Rudra and it's/his creatures.The most interesting thing of this is that the characters can litteraly spell out magic spells,which are for hereby called "word essences".<br /><br />A very beautiful game by Squaresoft,whom brought us the Seiken Densetsu/Secret of Mana,The SaGa series,Chrono Trigger and the lesser-known Treasure Hunter G and by CROWD (Amemiya's company),whom made such hits as Zeiram,Hakaida and Tao no Tsuki. Wonderful,yet brooding storytelling,likeable characters (especially Surlent and Pipin),great soundtrack and wonderful scenario scenes.<br /><br />I wish Square would team up with more companies,so they can make more wonderful RPGs like this one!
