This was my first look at a David Cronenburg film. Impressive and similar in style to Paul Verhoevens stylistic use of explicit sex and violence. But its not the horrid make up effects that make this film special, it's its ability to take you inside the mind of these characters to a point of being uncomfortable, going inside our deep seeded obsession with vanity. Not only a horror film, but a tragic love story, The Fly melds genres like no other film i've seen. These really are some of the most disturbing notions made in any horror film i have ever seen since 'Alien'. The film is a masterpiece of psychological sickness, bound to make even the most hard core horror fan weak at the knee's.
