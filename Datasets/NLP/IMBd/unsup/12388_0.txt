James Allen (Animal) goes to prison for armed robbery for almost a decade while leaving behind a legacy as a cold-blooded killer. But more importantly he leaves behind his young son (Terrence Howard) who follows his father's footsteps. When James returns after becoming enlightened by an old black revolutionary, he attempts to instill his new beliefs in his son. The conflict between Rhames and Howard relates to the way many African-Americans perceive themselves and their places in society after centuries of slavery/oppression. This is a powerful film with a terrific story and superb acting, especially by Terrence Howard. He gives another astounding performance that will prove to people why this guy is one of the most underrated actors working today. If you want to see realism portrayed at its best, check this one out.
