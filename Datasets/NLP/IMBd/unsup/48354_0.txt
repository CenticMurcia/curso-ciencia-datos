- The Monster Club is a three story anthology held together by Vincent Price and John Carradine. The first story is about a wealthy, pale faced creature with few friends who falls in love with the hired help. She turns him down and must face the consequences. The second story is about a modern day vampire hiding out from modern day vampire hunters. The third story concerns a town of the beaten path inhabited by nothing but ghouls.<br /><br />- Story 1 - 5/10 - It's not bad, just very predictable. With better writing, this story could make an entertaining feature length film on its own. I found the pale-faced creature to be unique and interesting.<br /><br />- Story 2 - 1/10 - What utter garbage. The story goes for laughs and fails at every opportunity. All of the humor is incredible obvious and, as such, I found it insulting. It's a shame that a talent like Donald Pleasence and Britt Ekland were wasted on drivel like this.<br /><br />- Story 3 - 6/10 - Easily the best and most chilling of the stories. While the ghouls are not particularly scary looking, the continued and relentless attacks are effective scenes. The ending is a good piece of irony.<br /><br />- The In-Between Bits - 1/10 - How embarrassing for Price and Carradine to be stuck in a mess like this. You can buy better looking monster masks at Wal Mart. The music that played between each story was especially rancid.<br /><br />- Take the four rating, add them together, and divide by 4. The result - 3/10.
