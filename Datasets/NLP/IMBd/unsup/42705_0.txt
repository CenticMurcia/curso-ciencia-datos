Yes it is a classic, and yes I own it. Why the four star rating let me explain. I own the movie for one reason "the sorcerers Apprentice". That segment alone makes it a classic. This segment alone is an example of what was the great thing about cartoons in the 1940's, no speech amongst the characters, which allows your imagination run wild and the music went right along with the cartoon. With exception of the narrator there is no speech in Fantasia but, unlike my comments about the "Sorcerers Apprentice" this hurts the rest of the movie for the animation on the rest of movie just doesn't grab you and with the classical music playing in the background I am always put to sleep.
