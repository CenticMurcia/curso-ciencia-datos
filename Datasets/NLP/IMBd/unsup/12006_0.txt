I don't know why people actually liked this movie just for a bit? Maybe because of the big breasted teens? There is NO plot, almost nothing is happening and it drags on and on. I'm a big B-movie fan and I don't care if the acting or the fx are bad (sometimes it makes movies even more fun!) but nothing is happening in this movie. So AVOID this one! I warned you!
