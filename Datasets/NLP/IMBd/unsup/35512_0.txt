I just happened to be channel surfing and caught the show about Jesus and the Bible. <br /><br />It was a joke. Any serious apologist would have torn them apart in seconds. Heck, I could have done it and I don't even know that much about apologetics.<br /><br />I had to laugh when they take the stack of Bibles and start reading the damning quotes from the Bible "in context". Every one was out of context. No cultural or historical context was even mentioned. <br /><br />The show seemed to be an incredibly biased piece of work by two guys with a chip on their shoulder. If the rest of the shows are like that one, (and from many of the reviews, it seems like they are), then this show is flat out drivel.
