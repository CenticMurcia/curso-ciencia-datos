Boy, there must have been a real dearth/scarcity of film fests back then!? (Not that being Nom'd for the Palme d' Or is chicken feed!!) But no others? Very odd!<br /><br />Re: whomever's comment about Clu being "demented," he didn't seem that way to me, although I guess he had somewhat of a rep as an actor. Numerous actors who really care about their craft and/or are simply real people do have such days (or weeks, or years), so...!? His interview on the DVD of "The Killers" is very lucid, although it may have been rehearsed? No idea! <br /><br />But this is a really terrific short film; it's worth renting "Geogre Washington" just to watch it, imo!!!
