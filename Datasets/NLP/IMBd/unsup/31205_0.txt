I just watched this on my own last night and it certainly made me think twice about going to bed. I only found out afterwards that it was made pre Blair Witch which makes it even more appealing in my book although I didn't fall for the "this is the real film footage" line. However as a film I really enjoyed it, yes the acting isn't brilliant at times and the effects aren't great but the real joy comes with the suspense that the film generates. There are moments in the film, especially when they go upstairs for the first time to look for the alien where the suspense is almost unbearable. This is also heightened at times just before a crucial moment when the film halts and a message appears to warn you about the following scenes, very effective. On the downside the aliens aren't particular scary and remind me of the ones in scary movie 3, and also the so called experts are pretty wooden. However, the premise of the film is excellent and the fact that it has convinced so many people that it was genuine is a tribute to the film maker. Its a shame that this didn't enjoy similar success as Blair Witch because between the two, Alien Abduction is certainly more scarier.
