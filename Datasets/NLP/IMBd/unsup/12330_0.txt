3 deewarein(3 walls)stands out as the best acted movie in Indian Cinema.Such fantastic movie & its so underrated.Way too underrated.Brilliant performances from all the star-cast.<br /><br />Nasarudin Shah is a legend.I always expect these kind of performances from him & i always get such great returns seeing his movies.Juhi has made a great comeback after a very long time.Awesome performances too from Nagesh himself(the director) & Jackie Shroff.Gulshan Grover has too given a terrific performance.Such calmness in his acting in this movie that its so refreshing.<br /><br />Nagesh has directed this very well.The script is also very good.This movie surpasses all Indian thrillers.Even you can say this movie is the Shawshank Redemption of Indian Cinema.<br /><br />Epitome of performances with a great plot & a terrific surprising ending makes 3 Deewarein a class movie.
