save the last dance(1)was such a good movie. the story was awesome and the cast was great. THIS MOVIE... The cast was completely redone and it was a real letdown. No one can replace Julia Stiles as Sarah Johnson--angry ballet dancer with the hot black guy chasing after her(ha-ha) The only reason I sat thru the whole movie was because Columbus Short was in it. Hes gorgeous and he saved the movie. No offense to Izabella Miko but she killed the role of Sarah and NOT in a good way. The story was a bit lame and really the movie shouldn't have been made unless it was with Julia Stiles. (of course we could keep Columbus Short in it because hes hot). But other than that...someone should have really stopped production on this until they got the original cast back. I say we call a do-over.
