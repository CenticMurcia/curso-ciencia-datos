Historically, this film is a heap of hooey. If Robin Hood ever existed, he would have lived about 150 years after the period in which the film is set. Modern historians are of the opinion that good King Richard and bad King John should be the other way around. This film should be thus regarded as fantasy.<br /><br />The fact that so many Robin Hood films have been made since, and not one of them remotely measures up to The Adventures of Robin Hood shows just how good the film is.<br /><br />Favourite scenes? Well, there's the scene in the great hall at Nottingham castle where Errol Flynn gives cheek to everyone. The escape, the ambush and the final showdown with Sir Guy of Gisborne. (Basil Rathbone makes a superb villain.) I'm very impressed with the sharpshooting. This was done by Howard Hill. Howard Hill appears a few times in the film. In the escape from the great hall he is the only archer among Guy of Gisburne's crossbowmen. In the archery tournament scene, he is Owen the Welshman (in spite of what it says in the credits at the end.) It has been said before, and I'll say it again: Errol Flynn did not play Robin Hood; he is Robin Hood.<br /><br />Performancewise, the cast are superb, with hardly a poor performance among them.<br /><br />I did at one time think that Una O'Connor was hamming it up a bit. However, I have recently worked in Buckinghamshire with a woman with exactly the same accent and - yes - exactly the same laugh. (Absolutely true). Therefore, Una O'Connor, who plays Marian's servant who resembles Chaucer's Wife of Bath, is brilliant!
