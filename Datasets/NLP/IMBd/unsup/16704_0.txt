If kids shows were actors, this show would be Johnny Depp. A cut above the rest.<br /><br />The jokes were crazy, fast paced, hilarious and frequent. The plots were imaginative and absurd. The haphazard, child-like style was masterfully used to further the feeling of unpredictability.<br /><br />I think this show is more enjoyable than Fairly Odd Parents, and on par with Fillmore, which is quite a statement.<br /><br />I watched it until I was 15 when it was canceled, and still thoroughly enjoyed it. Anyone younger who didn't like this show needs to loosen up.
