Harriet Hilliard stars as a prospective band singer. On her way to an important audition, she meets Gene Raymond. When she gets her high heel caught between two train cars, Mr. Raymond is smitten; he tries to pry her high heel loose. They find themselves playing out their cat and mouse romance at the same hotel. Joe Penner and a host of comedians become involved with the couple.<br /><br />Of particular interest; Ms. Hilliard (Harriet Nelson, of course) in a musical comedy performance more reminiscent of later "Lucy" than later "Harriet"; her "Let's Have Another Cigarette" is an ironic highlight. Ann Miller brackets the film with a couple of tap dances, but has no film role; her finale is another highlight. And, Mr. Penner's infantile funnyman antics are a precursor to Jerry Lewis. The film's story is somewhat difficult to follow, weakening several situation comedy possibilities. <br /><br />**** The Life of the Party (9/3/37) William A.
