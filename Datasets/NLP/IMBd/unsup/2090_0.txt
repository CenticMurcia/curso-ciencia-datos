There are two scenes in this excellent movie that make me cry every time. The first is when Candy's dog is put down. We had to put down our beloved dog about a year ago, and it was a most difficult thing to do. Of course the movie just heightens the emotions here, as Candy realizes he is also getting old and is not as useful and vibrant as he used to be. His regret later in the film about not doing the deed himself just makes the whole situation sadder. Then there's the final scene, with George knowing what he must do, and Lenny, still with a child's innocence, talking about the hope filled future where he can tend the rabbits. He can really "see it", but we and George know it's not to be. As sad as parts of the movie are, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The two leads are fantastic as are the rest of the cast. Grab this one and have the tissues ready.
