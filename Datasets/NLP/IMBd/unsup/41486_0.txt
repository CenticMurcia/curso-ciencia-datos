This movie is of course about a crazed doctor. He was in a mental hospital, but he escapes and he goes off to do some surgery. He finds a girl who suffers from some sort of heart ailment and this reminds him of his mother so he wants to help her. Along the way you get to see him kill people in rather stupid ways to get their hearts. Had potential, but ultimately this one gets to goofy at times for its own good. Some scenes though are rather gory such as the flashback scene where they show how the kid managed to escape, but in the end these scenes are too few and far between. If you see it you may want to watch it just to say you saw it if you are a fan of horror, but nothing to really search hard for.
