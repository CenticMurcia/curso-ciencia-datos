Oh God where to begin, You ever hear about one of those movies/books/shows/etc. that is so nice and cuddly that people cant stand it ? This is one of them. This is, w/o a doubt, one of the worst movies i have had the undignified honor of viewing, and boy, it was a piece of...well..s#!t doesn't even give you an idea. it starts with main characters, who are so repulsively nice (to the point where it will make you question the sanity of the person who directed this abomination) that they made a gang (4 people = a gang ?) that does nice things. And all with Christian undertones that are as subtle as a blue whale being dropped on your house. One of the 4 leaves and goes to Chicago, becomes bad, comes back, wrong crowd stuff...wait...i get it this is supposed to convey a point, and NOT make the people watching it vomit. Look, I'll put it bluntly, its like an after school special that tells you what 45 % of the other ones do, be nice, hang out with the right crowd, blah blah blah, its not different, its not "cool", its not nice and happy but serious, its like the town they live in is perfect, thats it. Only 3 or 4 real "trouble-makers" (probably just egged a house, or stayed up past curfew) it has no meaning, and when i saw it, i was part of its target group, that was 2.5 years ago, thats how bad the suckiness of this movie stuck in my head. If your a die-hard Christian, even this is to much for you and your kids will be traumatized by the sickeningly overjoyed atmosphere of this tiny town which also evidently doesn't have any sort of Police Department, just the gang itself.<br /><br />1 out of 10 AVOID AT ALL COSTS, DO NOT LET ANYONE TALK YOU INTO SEEING THIS IT'S JUST TO BAD, TO UNLIKELY, AND MOST OF WHATS THERE WANTS TO BE LIKE REAL LIFE, BUT ISN'T
