I am shocked to see so many good reviews on a movie so generic, so boring, so uninteresting. This movie doesn't feature great drama, great acting, or great character depth. Everyone here is just so princy with all their fluffy costumes and such. The plot is quite simple, Daniel Day Lewis can't be with the adulterous slut)Michelle Phfeffer or however you spell her name) because he is engaged with Winona Ryder. You would think this outline would cause people heartbreak, people to fight, people to run away in tears or something emotionally involving. No, no , no, just fancy costumes, gallerias, and everyone just acting proper and not letting their real desires and emotions come through. The ending is horrible, I mean really. I thought the performances were quite good, if only they did something worth caring about. I will never watch this overrated picture again. Watch The Basketball Diaries, The Crucible, or even<br /><br />Bram Stoker's Dracula if you want to watch a drama with emotional depth were things actually happen. 4/10.
