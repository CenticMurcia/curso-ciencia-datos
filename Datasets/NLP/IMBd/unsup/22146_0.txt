Received the DVD as a Christmas present, and only have one complaint (and it's not even the movie's fault) -- I wish the aspect ratio were widescreen. A movie as inspirational as this deserves that "big screen" look, especially for the numerous (and well shot) football sequences. Funny that the trailer appears to be widescreen. Hmmm.<br /><br />Well acted, and believable, there were several touching moments in the various character's journeys. Lacey Chabert and Nick Cornish have a good on screen chemistry, while Terry O'Quinn is perfect as the perfectionist coach. I thought I could predict how everything would turn out. I was wrong -- and I love that in a movie!<br /><br />Also nicely done: the background score. (Wish the audio was 5.1, but the Dolby Pro Logic was quite adequate). Dan Haseltine and Joe Hogue are to be congratulated on creating a nice "high school" feel during the many action sequences. The quiet scenes are are rendered nicely, reminding me of the excellent score from "Remember the Titans".<br /><br />For it's sound focus on quality drama, moving moments, great sport shots and without trashy language, I highly recommend this film.
