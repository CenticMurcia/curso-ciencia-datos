Considering all the talent involved in the making of this movie (Mike Nichols, J.J. Abrams, the cast), one would have fairly high expectations of it.<br /><br />One would, however, be horribly let down.<br /><br />It's a hackneyed, shallow, almost insultingly lame movie. Harrison Ford's performance is just okay; I was particularly amused by the "slicked-back hair = evil guy, floppy hair = nice guy" idiocy perpetrated in the personal styling of his character. <br /><br />I kept wanting a story that felt real, relatable, or genuinely touching to develop, but the whole thing was just painted in such broad strokes that the result was laughable. <br /><br />The message of the film ("Sometimes it takes getting shot in the head to change you from an @- hole to a great guy!") is cheesy and obvious. This crew of folks is capable of producing much more complex art.<br /><br />Sadly, this ain't it.
