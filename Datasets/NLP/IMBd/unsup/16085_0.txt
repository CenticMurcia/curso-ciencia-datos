I saw this movie on about 3 hours of sleep and was desperately hoping for a pleasant surprise to keep me awake. I snickered when I saw the horribly dubbed Japanese and the debut of Godzilla, the spaz in a rubber suit. I tried to appreciate the nostalgia but eventually my eyes started to glaze over. This is why I gave the movie a 9 instead of a perfect 10.<br /><br />Then followed the excitement. Yes, everyone tries to destroy Godzilla. I don't want to spoil the movie, so I'll just say that with everything they threw at Godzilla, practically for the rest of the movie, constantly, it was extremely fun to watch. I could've skipped my next night's worth of sleep just seeing Godzilla get pounded. However, if you can't appreciate that, this movie's not for you.
