The 1980's were the decade when many film studios decided to use their new freedom from petty censorship to convince everyone that eye candy in the form of a little nudity was an essential pre-requisite for any modern romantic comedy. Although I have a great respect for eye candy where it is used effectively, many of us need only think back to the unending sequence of films from the Confessions, Porky's, Spring Break and similar stables to be thankful that this phase was not prolonged into the nineties. EGAE probably deserves respect as one of the films which, I assume deliberately, helped the industry to turn their eyes to other things than just candy. Other than this it would be hard to respect it for very much today, but it is still easy to enjoy it on its own terms as a totally zany romantic comedy with a story in which anything goes. It also claims credit as a work of sci-fi and as a musical - both of these claims are pure baloney. Today it is hard to find many moviegoers who regards it as more than a historical anachronism, and a plain bad film. But a significant proportion of these same moviegoers would rate it as an enjoyable film that they would be prepared to watch again. Its creators would probably be very happy with this consensus, they were not attempting to create a future classic - only to create a comedy which would succeed when it was released and would give them a great deal of fun whilst making it. We can still share much of this fun today! My rating is 4 stars
