This has to be the best Jack Scalia outing I've seen in terms of budget ... which might not say much ... just like the story. It isn't worth a breath of air and neither is any mention of the cast. The F/X are passable for a low density movie of this order, but the entire contraption is void of anything mildly redeeming. The whole secret agent scenario is clich√© and recycled and the characters might as well be talking color bars. It wouldn't have made a difference.<br /><br />My one wish is that I had a briefcase like Jack Gracy (Scalia's character). In the movie his has a red light that when it goes off he know an unauthorized entry at a Russian Nuclear missile silo has occurred. Mine would be slightly different. It would still have a red light, but it would only go off when someone made a really good memorable action movie. This is not one of them.
