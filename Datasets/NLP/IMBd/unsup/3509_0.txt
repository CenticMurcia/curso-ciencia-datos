I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This is more of what Black America probably wishes to see. These are the types of movies that keep it real for African Americans and it allows dreams to come true. We see enough of fake "Black" America on the news. This was one of the best movies I have seen in a while. And I go to the movies a lot. Kudos to Malcolm Lee and his thoughtfulness.
