This movie is terrible. How else can I put it? At least American Pie was entertaining and the comedy was raunchy yet interesting. This movie is a disgrace to the motion picture industry. How was this atrocity released? I spent 4 bucks on this trash! Holy crap I could have spent that money on a quarter pounder with cheese and had some sort of temporary satisfaction. There's not even a good sex or nude scene! The acting is just BAD, the story is just Clich√©, the directing is just CRAP. There's nothing funny about this at all. I can't believe you IMDb users gave this a 4.8, why? Why is this not sitting on the bottom 100? Did you think it was cute? Oh my lord.....why? 2/10
