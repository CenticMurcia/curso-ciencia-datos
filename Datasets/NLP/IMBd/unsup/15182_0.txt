This movie really pleasantly surprised me. I expected that its sole redeeming feature would be the eye candy, as was the case with the original. But it was well written, capably directed, and Verraros, Hand, and Kochan gave good, hysterically funny performances. I wouldn't have guessed the latter two had any talent based on Eating Out, but it seems that was all Q. Allan Brocka's doing rather than the fault of the actresses. Working with Bartell's words and direction they're a delight to watch. Brett Chuckerman isn't quite as charismatic as Ryan Carnes was in the same role, but he does a good job. And Marco Dapper... is very, very good looking. (Hey, just because it turned out to be a good movie doesn't mean they forgot the eye candy...) <br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a funny, sexy movie to spend some time with.
