This film begins with a tribe of angry cave women running around with primitive weapons. However, there really only seems to be about a half dozen ladies--hardly a tribe as they put it. All the women have permed hair and look little like primordial beings, but no matter.<br /><br />When they meet the men, they mostly beat the crap out of them--sex seems to be the furthest thing from their minds. Eventually, nature takes its course and you can guess the rest of the story! The men, oddly, live in a tribe of only men--which begs you to ask "how did these people get born if the tribes never interacted before this film?"--a very good question indeed.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, the characters all speak in cave man talk but there is a cheerful narrator. Unfortunately, like all cave men epics, its hard to maintain any sort of pace when the people mostly fight, grunt and fight some more. There's really only about 10 minutes worth of material here and stretching it out to over an hour makes this very low-budget film tedious and sleep-inducing. At no point is the film fun or interesting--just a lot of silly ranting.
