OK, I live in Texas, grew up here. I have been to every part of it. No place in Texas will you find the kind of lame events that transpired in this stupid film. They do not dress like GQ models in West Texas. They do not talk the way those people did. They do not have towns that neat and cardboard. I literally became sick watching this film. It is like watching one of those old time films about Texas where the actors used these outrageous Southern accents and showed every<br /><br />where in big ten gallon hats. Just too stupid. By the end, I did not care who left Dancer, as long as I was one of them. This just tries to pull at the heart strings in every scene. It just gets so old, it is like Jerry MacGuire out West. The director wanting you so badly to get emotional. But you are just illl. Yuck, hated this film! Hated it!
