It was pleasant to attend a film that did not spew forth buckets of profanity and expletives. There were some pretty rough scenes that could disturb the youngest in the audience but the pleasant ending with a good moral message was uplifting. It did not dwell on the differences between evolution and creationism but delivered a nice message packaged in a well laid out package. It was hard to determine what background scenes were real locations. Shame, they looked like places I would love to visit. Even the vicious scenes were tame and free of gratuitous blood, guts, and gore. This is one that will end up in my home video collection.
