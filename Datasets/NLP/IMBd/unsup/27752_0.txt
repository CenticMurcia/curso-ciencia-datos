I have screened this movie for the 4th time.<br /><br />Watching Demi Moore makes it hard to remember she is not acting (re. suspension of disbelief). Jeff Daniels' character plays a good neurotic.<br /><br />On the pro side, I found the direction fair to midland and the supporting cast excellent.<br /><br />The screenplay is sweetly romantic and sentimental.<br /><br />I did not find the theme overtly pro-homosexual. Rather, it was a mature look of life and love and it's happenstance. I would enjoy talking with my youngsters about the film as it embodies life's essentials.
