being a huge Steve Buscemi fan i was estatic to hear that he had written and directed (as well as starred in) this film and immediately went out and rented it.<br /><br />the movie, while low key, is well written and one of the better and more sympathetic profiles of alcoholics that i've seen in recent memory. they are given surprising depth by Buscemi's well written screenplay and the actor's portraying these drunks.<br /><br />if this is any indication of future movies written and directed by the multitalented Steve Buscemi, then we're in store for a lot of great movies.<br /><br />rating:8.5
