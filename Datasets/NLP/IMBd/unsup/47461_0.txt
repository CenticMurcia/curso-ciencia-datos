I am perplexed, baffled and confounded by the GLOWING user comments for this movie.<br /><br />It completely falls flat. It is at times even awkward to watch. The chemistry between the lead actors is non existent. Martin Short phones his performance in. I also believe he was confused about who his character was even supposed to be. He went from cad to caring and back again SO many times I couldn't keep track.<br /><br />I think "David" acted like a jerk and didn't understand why "Kathy" would want anything to do with him.<br /><br />There is NOTHING funny about this movie. "Innerspace" made the same year is a much better choice for a Short flick.
