Wow! I have never seen a movie as screwed up as this. I'm not sure if it was really bad editing, really jumpy screenplay or if the director was just stoned. In "I Dreamed of Africa" get ready to be confused. You will see one scene and then you will see another scene, and the two will have nothing to do with each other. This doesn't just occur once, but through the entire film. And the scenes themselves are way to predictable. The viewer knows what's going to happen before the movie does. The acting is hit & miss. Sometimes fairly good, but when deep emotion comes in, seems forced and unreal. The script is cheesy and sometimes just stupid. A some moments you feel like you're getting to know and like the characters, but then you get shot into a scene that is totally different from what you've just seen. Which causes you to get to confused or just tired of trying to keep up. Overall I give a 4 out 10 (would be 3&1/2). So, unless you're really bored and just want to see Kim Basinger's naked back for a brief moment, don't watch this film.
