Film Noir at its best and Bogy better than his best that I've ever seen. Certainly this vehicle gives him play to develop his moods and attitudes which served him so well when it came time for him to work as Captain Queeg in "The Caine Mutiny" (1954). A much more than cameo appearance by Basil Rathbone's Dr. Watson, meaning Nigel Bruce, adds to the country-bumpkin rural nature of the plot. Alexis Smith is elegant while Barbara Stanwyck exudes just the right combination of believability to carry off a difficult role brilliantly. One will readily recognize actress Isobel Elsom from her later, excellent roles in "My Fair Lady" and "Love Is A Many Splendored Thing". This is a Bogart masterpiece which, until after you've seen it, will leave you with a deficient attitude towards Bogart's greatness as one of the most versatile actors Hollywood ever produced.
