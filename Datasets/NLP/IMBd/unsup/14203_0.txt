I am surprised that some reviewers are a little disappointed with this great film. I found it to be hugely entertaining, with many surprising twists and turns. OK some of the accents are a bit questionable, for example; most of the lead actors playing German officers use an authentic accent, whilst others in minor roles don't bother with one. The only two pieces of casting I have a slight problem with is using quintessential Scotsman Gordon Jackson as Omar Sharif's colleague and an American unknown actor as the German news-reporter. Sharif himself is excellent as the dogged, principled investigator, but it is O'Toole who dominates the film. He is simply chilling and quite believable as the withdrawn, intensely private, psychotic 'Butcher' of Warsaw. Well worth watching.
