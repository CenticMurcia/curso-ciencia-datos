This was 79 minutes of my life that I will never be able to get back.<br /><br />The movie is absolutely terrible, I don't have the faintest idea how somebody could watch this nonsense and actually appreciate it. The filming is terrible, the special effects utterly suck (and I've seen my share of low-budget movies), there is no storyline - absolutely none - and even if there was then the utterly crap acting would make you instantly forget any storyline.<br /><br />The movie is filled with absolutely pointless "deep thoughts" that do little else than annoy the hell out of you, accompanied with annoying bell sounds that will slowly drive you nuts.<br /><br />If total boredom won't make you run away screaming, then please take my advice and stay as far away from this movie as possible.
