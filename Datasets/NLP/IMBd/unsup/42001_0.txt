This movie lacked well...just about everything. Anything from the soundtracks to the acting without southern accents was enough for me to just simply laugh at this film during the whole dreadful ninety-six minutes. Mickey Rooney, I will admit was good and one woman actually had a southern accent, but otherwise it was a waste of money. When I look at a documentary type movie, like this, I think they should have historical accuracy, real acting, a basic understanding of some type of plot and emotion. This film also had flashbacks to scenes that either happened twenty seconds ago, had no significance, or weren't even in the movie to begin with. This movie is surprisingly dull for a 2005 release. The director and production company should be ashamed that they actually made something worse than the recently released Bratz movie, which I was dragged to see by my girlfriend. I guess this is why you rent a movie before you buy it, so you don't waste your money on something worthless. My ultimate idea is that every disk of this movie should be destroyed in a fiery grave, so that no one will have to endure its torture ever again.
