I am not a fan of movies about people who live their lives in a pointless way, and when given the options to act sit like zombies and let the river of life float them downstream. People like this-our main character-are as interesting to me as those pieces of flotsam. <br /><br />I gather the Director is trying to say something deep about loneliness and isolation, but this movie is nihilistic garbage. What are we supposed to make of a man who, when given options to change his situation, simply sits and waits for the inevitable to happen? Whatever the movie is trying to say is lost in the aimless vapidity of the story, the long pointless scenes, the stilted dialog are all reminiscent of Robert Bresson's work, and he leaves me cold as well, as does Samuel Beckett.<br /><br />I'll let the artsy fartsy crowd giggle and moan and dissect this piece of crap.
