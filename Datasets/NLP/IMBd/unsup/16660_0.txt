First this was a successful Broadway play. Then came the adaptation under the direction of Herbert Ross. Woody Allen had only directed a few pictures before, but it's curious he decided to let Mr. Ross direct this one, at all. Woody Allen was still in his first phase as a director, not having gone into his Igmar Bergmann period yet.<br /><br />"Play it Again, Sam" shows a restrained Woody Allen acting on his own material. He presents us an Allan Felix, a man so neurotic, he could probably pass as the real Woody Alen any time. Allan is a nerdy movie fan who doesn't know how to keep a woman. It's clear his first marriage to Nancy has been a failure.<br /><br />As in other Woody Allen films, we have the well intentioned couple that wants to see Allan happy. In this film they are Dick and Linda Christie, successful people that regard this friend as capable of being reformed by letting him meet interesting and sexy women. The film is dominated by the mystical figure of Humphrey Bogart, who wants Allan to get "dames" with a technique that he tries to teach him throughout the film. Those scenes between the fictitious Bogart, and Allan are one of the the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />The interplay with the movie "Casablanca" makes an interesting contrast with what we watch at the beginning of the film, which is the crucial conclusion of the Michael Curtiz's film. The concluding sequence of "Play it Again Sam" mirrors the classic model in more ways than one.<br /><br />Woody Allen is perfect for playing his own material. He was at the height of his comic genius in this film. His humor has a nervous edge that translated in one liners that come too fast, at times, for us to savor and relish. In fact, as directed by Mr. Ross, Woody Allen responds well and makes a great appearance and contributes tremendously to the success of this film.<br /><br />Diane Keaton, who plays Linda Christie, shows an affinity for what would follow later as she became an invaluable collaborator of Mr. Allen. Her portrayal of this character shows also the same neurotic qualities we see in Allan. Tony Roberts plays Dick Christie, a role that parallels that of Victor Lazlo in Casablanca. Susan Anspach is seen briefly as the woman who leaves Allan at the beginning of the film. Jerry Lacy as Humphrey Bogart with raincoat, fedora and cigarettes, is the perfect pal anyone could ask for.<br /><br />"Play it Again Sam", is a film that surprisingly, has aged well as it doesn't have a dated feeling to it. The movie will not disappoint, but the viewer must stay alert for those witty Allen's one liners.
