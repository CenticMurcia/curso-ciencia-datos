I found it slow in places but this was compensated for by the fact that there were some very honest politics, not something we are used to seeing in American films, at least not here in the UK. On the up side the script was sharp, with some great one liners, and at least the main characters were talking to each other rather than grunting at each other. The script was also very straight forward, carrying the viewer from one situation to the next without having to work out where things were at that point in time. The photography was very good, given that there was not a lot to work on; the factory, the house and some landscapes on the road. It was probably this naturalistic use of settings which gave the whole film much of it's credibility. In fact my only real problem was that, on first watching, I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between Meryl Streep and Cher.
