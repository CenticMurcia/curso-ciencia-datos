This film seems to have worked a little spell on me.<br /><br />After I watched it for the first time, I just sat there, thinking, not feeling blown away, truth be told.<br /><br />Then, before I knew it, I'd been sitting there in my recliner for about 45 minutes or so, absolutely still.<br /><br />Then I wanted to watch it again for some reason - which I did, very late that same night. And it was then that I felt myself being tugged, and, eventually, almost overcome at its conclusion. But I really don't know why - and still don't.<br /><br />But I have a strong feeling that's a good sign, that this film is not done with me yet. Because I kind of want to watch it again.<br /><br />But be forewarned that this film is very very different from the norm. Then again, nothing about it's presentation screams out to be noticed, really. Like it is meant to draw you in, standing at the door and smiling, like somebody you think you know - but don't, really.<br /><br />Must be something to do with how simple and subtle Mr. Holden has made it. Becaus3e it isn't at the end of the day. At least it doesn't seem to be.<br /><br />Hmmm...
