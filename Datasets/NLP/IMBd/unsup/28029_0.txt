I loved this show!<br /><br />Every Saturday morning, my sisters, my brother and I would be waiting outside the Odeon Cinema for the doors to open. It only cost 30p for a good 2-3 hours entertainment. There were cartoons, Children's Film Foundation films and, of course, Chico the Rainmaker. Every time I saw that little head, I would smile. When Jill played the pan pipes and Chris played the drums, you knew Chico was about to do something magical. The story lines were straight out of the Enid Blyton school of writing, the acting was at some times funny, at others dreadful, but this show never failed to amuse and delight us.<br /><br />It's almost 30 years since I last watched Chico, but I still remember the theme song after all this time. Chico will stay with me as a very happy memory of my childhood.
