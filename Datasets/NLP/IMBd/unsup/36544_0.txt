This film had a lot of good things going for it. Based on Ray Bradbury's novel, with the equally talented Richard Matheson doing the screenplay. A top notch cast including Rock Hudson, Roddy McDowell and Darren McGavin.<br /><br />So where did it go wrong. Well, first, the cheap special effects. I think they went with this because this was the post-Star Wars Science Fiction craze, but Star Wars had so raised the bar on special effects, that the tired models on wires method just wasn't going to satisfy anymore.<br /><br />Second, Bradbury's novel is a collection of short stories strung together with a common thread. Some of the stories were published previously, and Bradbury included them in an overall book. Matheson decided to play up recurring characters in order to give the story more of a narrative, including Hudson's character.<br /><br />Overall, it doesn't work. Bradbury's ornate writing doesn't translate well to the screen despite the best efforts of Matheson and the actors.
