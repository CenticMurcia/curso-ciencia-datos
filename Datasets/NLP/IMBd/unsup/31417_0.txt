Doom Generation is an intelligent satirical look at American youth culture and its relationship with the media. It's one hell of a journey into oblivion - pure teen angst on speed. With an excellent debut performance from Rose McGowan and nippy guest cameos including Perry Farrell and Parkey Posey, we are taken on a voyage into mayhem. The film has a collection of the best socially inept one liners ever-used on celluloid. It will have you repeating them in the most inappropriate of places... I was particularly blown away by the art direction - the settings are twistedly beautiful and the lighting evocative of a west end stage musical. Greg Araki's (dir) treatment of American culture and his comments on misguided but very normal youth are of astute importance. Check it and enjoy it.
