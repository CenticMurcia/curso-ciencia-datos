This was probably the best VMA's since 1992. Fallon was a great host first of all. Why do i say that? Even though Fallon is not the standup that Chris Rock is, but Fallon actually seemed to be having fun...it wasn't a bunch of written one liners pieced together to move the show along...it was Jimmy Fallon having a great time being part of a great show. <br /><br />Point two is the the show was well divided between the genres of music. You had a few pop acts, a few hiphop/rap acts, and a few rock acts. I'm not a huge pop or rap fan...but eminem and the others put on great performances...white America is a great song...the stage set up rocked.<br /><br />Point three is obviously guns n roses...axl rose honestly puts everyone else on earth to shame as a performer. he is as real as it gets. he may not hit every note, but its always pushing it to the edge and when he does hit it right it is legendary...and people will remember the 2002 vmas just for that reason.
