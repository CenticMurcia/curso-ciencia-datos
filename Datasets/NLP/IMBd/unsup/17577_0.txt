Vic Morrow, as Coach Turner, gave some of the greatest lines..<br /><br />Morrow to his young little league team in the dugout before the championship game, I don't want to talk to you about winning. I want to talk to you about losing....because if you lose you are going to have to live with it for the rest of your lives.<br /><br />Morrow to his son, the pitcher...Joey, if you don't start pitching better than you are hitting, I'm going to take you right out of the game.<br /><br />Morrow to semi tough kid Jack Earle Haley..This place is for ball players, and nobody wants you around here.<br /><br />Morrow to opposing coach Matthau..What are you, one of those sadists or something? Joyce Van Patten to everybody..They win one game. Next they will sue to play at Dodger stadium.<br /><br />Morrow to his son the pitcher after he strikes his son to the ground, Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me. You tried to hit that kid.<br /><br />Joyce Van Patten tries to kick Haley's motor bike after he throws a lit cigarette at her after she tells him to get off an unused part of the ball field.
