The leads are the best part of this "film." There is potential in their performances and hopefully they can find work in more films with better material.<br /><br />But the biggest distraction of the movie is that it is shot on mini-DV (digital video). When projected (I saw a 35mm blow-up) 95% of the shots were out of focus...hence I was constantly rubbing my eyes. It should not hurt to watch a movie. And at a reported production budget of $70,000.00 and shooting schedule of 4 weeks...you'd think if the filmmakers were smart enough, they could have shot on film (16mm or 35mm).<br /><br />Plus the "film" went on about 15 minutes too long...this is a grade-z "KIDS."
