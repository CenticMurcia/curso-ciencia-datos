This film is awful. What keeps it from being a 1 (1-10 scale) is the lack of a zero choice for such movies as Robot Monster, Best Defense and Fair Game. The editing is terrible, the script is worse and the acting is the very worst ("You don't wanna know me." -- Another stupid attempt at starting a catch-phrase).<br /><br />Gretchen Mol had the good sense not to have her name on this mess.
