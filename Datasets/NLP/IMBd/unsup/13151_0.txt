This is one of the most innovative sci fi series lately, as many of the commenters here noticed already, but since it is a Sci-Fi Channel production, I guess their best interest is to make it into a series. So they got this great idea, they expanded it into an interesting mini series, and then left it open ended. Which sucks, but if they do turn it into a series, it could work, and that's tantalizing enough.<br /><br />Someone here coined before me: this is like a superhero movie for objects. You have these every day objects, all coming from a motel room that now doesn't exist anymore, and each of them have weird powers, ranging from opening any door anywhere to boiling eggs or putting people to sleep. The reason for the main character to do stuff is because he lost his child daughter in a kind of limbo and he has to get her back.<br /><br />Bottom line: a very nice Sci-Fi mini series. It promises a lot and I would hate to see it turn into one of those Lost/4400/Kyle-XY series that say nothing and do nothing and prove nothing. I would have preferred a more solid and thought through ending and I am willing to bet other people would have, too. By losing quality in the last episode they lost potential audience to the series, but this is the bottom line: watch it.
