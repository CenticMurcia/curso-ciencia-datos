I first saw 'Social Misfits' under the recommendation of a friend. I was expecting your usual independent film, filled with plot holes, script errors, and cheesy cliches, but I am glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised. One of the best things about the movie was that it took a piece of society that usually isn't dealt with in Hollywood, and presented it honestly and realistically, without any icing on top. It is the story of a group of problematic teenagers, sent to a non-governmental, privately-funded rehabilitation camp. It is the camp's intention to bring the teens face to face with their problems, although in a rather unorthodox manner. This is done by forcing them to spend 48 hours together in one room. Straightaway, it is obvious that there will be clashes and tension between the characters, all with their own ethnic backgrounds and beliefs. The film presents a good mix of races, classes, and behavioural problems, all of which come to light with a self-confession from but one character. Certain events bring them together and help them to put their differences aside for the sake of moral decency.<br /><br />The young actors all did a good job of representing their parts in a manner that is both believable and well-fitted. The movie was well cast in the fact that they actually look like they're teenagers, without glamourous effects to gloss it over. To say the very least, the movie is to the point, runs almost at times like a real-life documentary, and it neither repetitive nor boring. The plot has a bit of a twist at the end with one of the character's revelation of his problem, which adds a sting. I definitely recommend if you want a piece of true life youth in America, without the sugar coating. The movie's tagline said it well, "A wake up call for America."
