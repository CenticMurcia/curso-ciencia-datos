Some of us have never been to Disneyland, so they can make all the rides into movies they want, we'll never know. That said: The movie was very well done. Some parts were overly predictable, while the story flowed rather easily. It's another, "been done before plot" with some added special effects and humour, all of which added together equal a movie worth seeing. Eddie Murphy is Eddie Murphy at his usual sillyness, reminiscent of his "Beverly Hills Cop" style of acting. All supporting cast do a wonderful job and the direction gives it those scenes that'll make you jump then laugh. I would not recommend this movie to children under 13 as some scenes may frighten them. Should have been rated PG-13 instead. Other than that, good movie. I would rate this movie a 7.5 out of 10.
