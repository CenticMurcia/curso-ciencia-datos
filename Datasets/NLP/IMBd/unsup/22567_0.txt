Jakob The Liar is an excellent film, I could not see it at the cinema last year as the film was not on at many cinemas and if it was shown it was not on for very long. I rented the film out the first day it came out for rent and have seen it about 6 times already. This film did not deserve the awful criticism it received. It is a film that has everything, sadness, some lighter moments and history and like Robin Williams said people should be reminded the awful going ons of that time. Robin Williams's performance in this film was wonderful and he deserved more praise than he got. But I have to say I did not like seeing him getting beaten. Well done Robin.
