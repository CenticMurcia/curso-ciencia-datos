What a terrible film, it looks like neither the visual effects staff or the sound staff have any experience in the industry. The acting was "satisfactory* but the zombies and dead bodies where out of date, as in they looked like they were borrowed from a film made in the 70's. The visual effects look like something off a scary 80's series. The storyline doesn't make sense and is no way original as it babbles on about some sort of curse where unless they kill someone they will die on the 13th hour or something.<br /><br />The cover image of the DVD looked good but when i finished the film i realised that quote; "never judge a book by its cover" is true<br /><br />To be honest, i got half an hour in and skipped through the rest. I also understand why this never made it to the big screen.
