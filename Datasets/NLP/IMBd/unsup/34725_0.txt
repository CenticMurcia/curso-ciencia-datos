This movie was horrible. The story was ridiculous. In it some German soldiers surrender, but the platoon that finds them does not accept the surrender and torture and kill the Germans. these Germans then get infected by some insects and come back to get revenge on the American soldiers. they somehow get over to America some 50 years later undetected by anyone. from there they kill the American soldiers, but not zombie style. they shoot them or blow them up. when they shoot the guns no flash or bang goes off, the actors just twitch backwards to show some kickback. The last soldier is then running for life with his 8 year old grandson, a cop, and a supernatural cop. the zombie is then not even after the now senior citizen soldier, instead they want to thank him since he stood up for them. In the end the cop falls in love with the supernatural women, then u find out, duh duh duh, she's a zombie too, but she takes medication so she's not a full zombie. the acting was horrible, there are absolutely no special effects except for two explosions, and the storyline was horrible. the only thing i liked was that the only way to kill the zombies was to use a weapon that was around during world war 2. In conclusion i highly recommend everyone not to waste their time with this movie.
