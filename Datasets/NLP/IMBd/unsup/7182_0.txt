I just received a DVD of J.T. from flashbackdvd.com to give to my wife in time for Mother's Day. The quality of the DVD was superb. I can't believe that CBS wouldn't want to sell this, but they have never released "The Children's Film Festival" either. What a loss to the children of today! My family and I watched J.T. last evening and my three children, ages 8, 10 and 12 were riveted. The youngest was in tears by the end and so was I. It is a stark, loving portrayal of a single parent black family eking out an existence in Harlem. J.T. has to make some very important decisions about life at a young age, which he is able to do thanks to the love of his mother, grandmother and a stray cat. My kids asked many questions about J.T's world after the movie; it showed them a slice of life that they had never before seen. I hope that it helps make them more empathetic to others in the world around them.<br /><br />My problem is that my wife and I independently remembered a different climax to this story, seen almost 40 years ago. I only saw J.T. once, but I remember that J.T.'s cat was hanged by the two bullies. I clearly remember the scene when J.T. discovers the body hanging in a doorway. I was very surprised that the cat was hit by a car in the DVD I watched. My wife says that she remembered most of the movie as she watched it last night, but was also surprised that the cat was not hanged.<br /><br />This scene was very intense for a 9-year old in 1969; I have never forgotten it. Neither has my wife. Was there an alternate scene shot for the cat's death because the hanging was too horrible? Or are my wife and I recalling a different movie from the same time where a young black boy's pet cat was hanged? I can't believe that there was another movie like this. I hope that someone can help with an answer.
