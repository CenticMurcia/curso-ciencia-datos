This film begins extremely well and you are looking forward to an interesting and intriguing plot. Instead this film is too confusing, and you do not feel satisfied or entertained at the end. Ryan Phillipe portrays the character Simon extremely well, and his performance is worthy. Although I do not understand why directors insist films be so complicated we actually loose the simplistic enjoyment film audiences require. I found this film to be extremely disappointing and didn't fully understand the meaning of the text? This is actually the first film I have watched and thought what?? Very Very Disappointing! I recommend watching twice with a pen and paper in order to take notes and then you can maybe begin to understand the over complicated story line. I would recommend this movie for Film/Media Students. I like films with complicated twists but this was not the best. I recommend you watch Butterfly Effect, it is a much better attempt of this genre.
