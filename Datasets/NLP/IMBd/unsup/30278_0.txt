Poor photography, at least as seen on Showtime, and a rather coy use of close-ups are the only things that spoil this photographed stage presentation. It is faithful to the spirit and letter of Arthur Miller's original script, and it is acted with sincerity and feeling. Willy Loman as victim is presented in straight-forward manner with no attempt to excuse the "system" by hints of madness.
