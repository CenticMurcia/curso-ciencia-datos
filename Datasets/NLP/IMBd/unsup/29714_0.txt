I was seven years old when my parents took me to see "Wings of the Navy" in 1939 at the Vogue Theater in Montebello, CA. I believe this was the first movie I had seen. At least I don't recall any movie before this one. I remember sitting near the back of the theater with my parents. I really like the flying scenes and I remember the sounds of the airplane engines. The love scenes did not do anything for me of course. Boy that is amazing I can remember those details. I remember calling the movie Wings of the Avery. Does anyone know if there was ever a DVD or Video made of the movie? I have looked everywhere I can think of with no luck. If someone knows where I can get a copy of it I would be one happy guy.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Charles Field
