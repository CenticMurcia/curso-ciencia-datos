I hated this show when I was younger, but to see it now it is so cute and many situations come to light and are dealt with in a fun and dignified manner. I love the '60's and '70's fashions. You get to see some of the greats in their younger days too. Don't take anyone's word check it out for yourself. Fred Williamson's first appearance on this show was in "Dancer I The Dark", an episode that was written by Hal Kanter the creator and producer ofthis series. Many actors are featured in the show...I love it! <br /><br />There are some negative things, but in all this show is fun and upbeat. I love the old style of acting they had back then. Even Cesar Romero was in a few of the episodes. Also Don Ameche, Jimmy Steward, Stu Gilliam, Bob Hope, Sugar Ray Robinson, Jack Soo, and many others made appearances on this show. Also If you are looking for copies of the Julia show in colour I have seen themon ebay on 16mm film and VHS. Do your research. I really love the style of acting in this series, it's old fashion and wonderful.<br /><br />I love everyone in the cast they are good actors and Betty Beaird as Marie Waggedorn is excellent. A very earthy mother-like feeling comes from to mind when I watch her.
