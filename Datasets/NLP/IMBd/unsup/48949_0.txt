This film is a classic example of an arty film on a hallowed novel which gets brilliant reviews but is unapproachable and dull to the majority of the movie going public. Unless you have read the novel and are au fait with the subject matter, even the intelligent viewer will be left bemused and quite frankly bored to tears. Only for the die-hard Virginia Wolfe fans.
