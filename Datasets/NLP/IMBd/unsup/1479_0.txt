Awful, slow, boring, lacking plot, a painful experience and an utter waste of time. See it at the cheap theatre, anymore then a few bucks for this is hi-way robbery. Over an hour before anything happened that was remotely exciting. I can't express how repulsed I am by this movie. I liken it to Chinese water torture; I just wished it would end. I fear when the next poorly delivered line would come. Ruby is hot in her bikini. The only bright note.
