Wow! Not one of Fulcis best! Actually quite dreary, devoid of suspense and atmosphere. I should also say logic, but thats not to be expected from a Fulci-flick. Its sad because the locations look quite good, and this could have been an effective movie if he'd had the skills. There is virtually no buildup of tension, the music is boring and the dubbing of the kid is annoying. There are some attempts at foreboding images, like the picture of the house and the mannequin, but they are not enough to sustain interest. The subplot with a little girl from the past is poorly handled and the Freudstein ending is totally laughable. Even a movie with nonlinear and dreamlike structure should have some focus and coherence. Fulci managed that in his effective "The Beyond" but here it is completely absent. For fans only.
