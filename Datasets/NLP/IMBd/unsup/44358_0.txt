It really is time to bring this to a close. This is set in the sixties. It began in 1992, so the regular actors have now aged 15 years in a series that is supposed to span 10. Gina in mini skirt and boots, trying to dance in 60s style just looks ridiculous now. Alf, Bernie and Oscar are well past their sell-by dates and the whole thing is tired. Please can it now!!! By the way, I used to think it was a really good programme - especially the music. Just as an aside.......... Now that smoking is banned in places of work in England, they won't be able to smoke when making the programme. So, no smoking in the Aidensfield Arms, no more roll-ups for Alf in the police station - over 40 years before the ban came into being!!!
