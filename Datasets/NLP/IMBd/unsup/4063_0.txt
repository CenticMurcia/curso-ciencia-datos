So many things made this movie great.<br /><br />This movie made Bruce Willis immortal. He soaks up this character so well, it was him. The wise cracking cop who is entertaining because he is sarcastically funny not uttering stupid catch phrases. He is a cop who looks like a normal guy, middle age, loosing some hair with wife problems. (no faked up pretty face with shaved chest and oiled muscles). He is cool without pretending to be cool. He manages to thwart the bad guys while barefoot, man that is a great twist.<br /><br />The plot is great because it does not fall perfectly in line for the hero. He stumbles, gets stuck and survives only by last minute thinking. It has plenty of action without getting ridiculous.<br /><br />And the bad guys are great, smart sinister and well acted.<br /><br />It is one of those movies that could play every weekend and would still be watched. Is one of those top 10 movies every guy should own.<br /><br />Die hard 2 was OK but not as good as the original, I wish they would have stopped after 2. Die Hard 3 is poor.
