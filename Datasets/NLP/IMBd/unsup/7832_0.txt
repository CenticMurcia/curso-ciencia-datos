Overall, this movie was okay. But the acting for the lead character, Susie Amy i think, was horrid! She was so stiff, and something about her grin instead of a smile, just seemed unrealistic, and it just rubbed me the wrong way. Gerard Depardieu was amazing in it, as usual. And, if you're like me, and are still young or even old for that matter, the guys, especially Casper Zafer(Gaston) and Nico Nicotera (Etienne) and some other young Musketeers are very nice eye candy :)! I liked John Rhys-Davies in it, as he is one of my favorite actors, but he must have still been in his Gimli stage when doing it because he came across with that sort of Scottish accent of the dwarf. I had trouble with the actors who played the original musketeers but that was no fault of the actors, as they were good, but I grew up on Disney's version with Keifer Sutherland, Oliver Platt, Charlie Sheene, and Chris O'donnell as the main characters. At times the movie seemed dull, but the fight scenes were good, but not bloody. Perfect for children, kinda lacking for the older crowd. But none the less, this movie wasn't too bad. I would recommend it for renting, but don't waste your money on buying it!
