I can't add much more then what's already been said about this lost treasure. I saw it when I was 9 or 10 and have never forgotten it. Over the last few years I have been wondering about it. I couldn't remember the name, and no one I asked knew what I was talking about, not even my mom! I started searching the net a few days ago and found this site, then found out where you get a DVD. You can get an 8-10 quality DVD transferred from the original VHS from flashbackdvd.com I just ordered mine for $20+$5 shipping. He claims to have the best quality of this in circulation.I will have it in a few days and will come back and give you my thoughts.
