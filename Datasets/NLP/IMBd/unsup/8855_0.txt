I love this show, not only for it's good and cozy criminal stories, but also for the new perspective of a criminal story; during war and is actually being affected by it. Great directed, good actors and actresses, nice storyline and atmosphere/environment. 9 out of 10, because I don't think it's perfect. If it had been perfect, I couldn't live without it and I can. I do recommend it though, especially for a nice quiet evening with hot chocolate and other cozy features.<br /><br />(I've managed to see as many episodes as possible and tonight I just saw the last one and was devastated to see that this is the end of Foyle's War. I will as soon as possible write to BBC concerning this and ask why it had to come to an end and insinuate my opinion.)
