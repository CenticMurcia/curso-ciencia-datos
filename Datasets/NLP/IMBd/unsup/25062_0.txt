been watching the progress of this movie since i first found out about it on the view askew web board and knew i needed to see it.... after watching the trailer i knew it was going to be one of the greatest movies id be allowed to see by the evil gnomes who choose my movies very carefully.. the type of movie this is really isn't done enough and the quality of the writing will amaze you... its tough writing a review for something while not saying too much about it but i really hate to spoil movies for other people, as i hate having them spoiled for me... let me just say to you.... awesome frickin' awesome <br /><br />check out Kisses and Caroms, you surely will not be disappointed...
