This curious, good-looking version of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" was promoted as faithful to the original work - and, although is follows events much more closely than the familiar version, its changes make it a more different, distant work than you might expect. The overriding theme is not man creating artificial life, and the consequences of this action. Instead, this film is about Kenneth Branagh (as Victor Frankenstein) desiring Helena Bonham Carter (as Elizabeth). As he is unable to consummate their relationship, the sexually frustrated Mr. Branagh goes crazy and creates a artificial, monster man.<br /><br />Both are drenched in goopy embryonic fluid, with Branagh displaying his chest most prominently.<br /><br />The created Robert De Niro (as Frankenstein's Creature) wants to mate, just like his creator. But, when Branagh is about to have sex (finally) with Ms. Carter, Mr. De Niro interrupts. After a near encounter with De Niro, Carter expires. Then, she is brought back to life, with the same face gashes De Niro displays. By the way, why do the creatures have these face gashes? Anyway, now you have two sexually frustrated men vying for the same, once pretty "Bride of Frankenstein" - and, they don't care how she looks anymore! Will Branagh (or even De Niro) ever get to consummate with Carter? Two dizzying hours later, will you care?<br /><br />**** Frankenstein (1994) Kenneth Branagh, Robert De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter
