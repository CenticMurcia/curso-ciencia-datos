The first movies in this series all had a focus in Sweden, and in Swedish culture. This last instalment leaves the Swedish focus, and makes it in to a European thriller instead. While this can lay a basis for a far greater funding, it also makes the film less appealing to Swedish viewers, in that it sets it self up for comparison with other movies with far greater funding, for instance the Bourne Identity. I am sad to say that the story is confusing, the audience laughed quite often when there obviously was no humour involved. And, worst of all, around me people fell to sleep. And this was during a quite loud action movie. If you really want to see a good Swedish movie, see `Smala Sussi', or `Ondskan', better still, see both. Keep away from this movie until you can see it for free on TV.
