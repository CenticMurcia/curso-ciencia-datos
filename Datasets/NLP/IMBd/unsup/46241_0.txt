This is based on a comic book, and such movies tend to be stupid. Still, I thought that the plot seemed interesting. And it is. But that doesn't mean this film is good. The whole thing looks a bit cheap, and it was a surprise for me finding out that it went to theatres in 1990. It really looks a bit low-budget, that's for sure. When a helicopter crashes, for example, you only see the the tail after the explosion. Where's the rest of the wreck?? I usually think that Liam Neeson is a good and interesting actor, but in this one he acts like he's on his first audition ever. I guess he portrayed Darkman the way he should, but I would have liked it better if he was even more vicious against his enemies. Overall: An interesting movie poorly made.
