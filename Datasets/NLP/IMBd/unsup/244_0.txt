i was at the new Orleans film festival and saw this horrible movie. I'm not sure who directed it and seeing all the user comments, i'm wondering if these guys are just friends of the filmmaker. This is not a witty movie but rather boring and slow- paced. The story is really not compelling and I never believed in the characters. Rather, i was looking at my watch. The visual is "artsy' and 'pedantic". Just a waste of my time, really. This is not a comedy! People think that the story line is witty, I guessed all the twists and plots ahead in advance and I'm pretty gullible usually. But this film didn't do anything for me and I totally forgot about it after I left the theater. I guess it's a bad sign. Two thumbs down.
