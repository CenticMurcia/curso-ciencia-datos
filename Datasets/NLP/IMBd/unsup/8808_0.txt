Razzle Dazzle I'm not sure why this film is called a mocumentary. It should really be called a Spoof, as it seems to steal from that many other films that it starts to become unfunny. Waiting for Guffman, Strictly Ballroom, Mad Hot Ballroom, even a little feel of Bring It On and the main offence is just swapping teens for kids check out Drop Dead Gorgeous. There are some funny moments in this film. It just that we have seen it done before and done better. This film could be fun for twelve to fifth teen year old's who would not have seen the above films.<br /><br />The two redeeming factors in this film is the brilliant acting of Kerry Armstrong. Her one-liners are fantastic. Also the kids all seem to not of over act and do a pretty dam good job.<br /><br />2 stars for Kerry Armstrong 2 stars for the Kids
