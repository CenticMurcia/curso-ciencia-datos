This has to be one of the funniest films ever. This was also my first exposure to Jack Benny. I loved his dead-pan delivery. I saw this film some 6 or 7 years ago on TV and have been looking for it on DVD (to no avail) almost ever since. Maybe I had a major case of the giggles that day but, I swear I about fell on the floor laughing at almost every Benny line. Interesting story and just extremely funny! I would highly recommend that anyone who hasn't yet had the opportunity or good fortune to see this wonderful comedy..see it. Of course you will have to see it on VHS as that is the only format it is available in at the moment. The fact that I still remember well the movie after seeing it once about 7 years ago should tell you it made quite an impression on me, as well as my funny-bone! Don't miss it if you haven't seen it yet.
