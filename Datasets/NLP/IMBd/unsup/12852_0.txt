I saw this movie at sundance and was really quite charmed by it considering that it is a "romantic comedy" of sorts which is not my genre of choice. The actors were all serviceable if not excellent in their comic, yet quite human, roles. margaritte (sp) is a spellbinding beauty who has always captivated in her film work... she had lost her voice at the screening, but even squeaking out a few words afterwards, she had me so in love with her. Beyond this, there were some pacing issues for me and the occasional clunky scene, but all in all, this was a smart and well-rounded sort of character piece. I don't agree with the reviewer who says it's not for "eastcoasters" since I live in NYC and felt that this film worked on many levels that resonated with me, in spite of the geographical differences. This is a fine piece of film-making that can work on its own terms and still fall into the framework of a good romantic comedy, so I hope that some genius out there picks it up for a direct to video release and it can deliver some punch on the home market. Margarritte needs to be a star and this movie proves she can deliver the good and the director holds the piece together with confidence and grace. Oh, and it was shot on DV and it looks like film. pretty cool.
