This boring british video is long on talk and is really hard to figure out. It has something to do with experiments on mentally ill people and a drug that opens the mind to parasites from another dimension( I think). There are some bloody scenes that liven it up a bit but this movie is so slow and disjointed they don't help. Maybe a bigger budget and script rewrite would have helped.
