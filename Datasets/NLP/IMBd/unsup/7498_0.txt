4 human beings whose talents came together to make a beautiful film about the paradigm of love.<br /><br />So many others have done excellent analysis of this film that I would wish to mention the ABSURDITY of the whole ratings system.<br /><br />This was a film crafted to appeal to adults seeking a mature theme portrayed with elegance and grace. Philip Kaufman, does anyone remember just how handsome a man he was at that time, triggered performances that still haunt me to this day. YET, the ratings board, a calamitous holdover the dark dreary days of the Hays Commission, virtually KILLED the box office for this film. Adults, couples, who wanted to see something fresh, and challenging were DENIED that right due to the lack of venues.<br /><br />Eighteen years later has anything really changed? We still have suits and ties deciding what is "safe" and what we shouldn't be allowed to see.<br /><br />Censorship is truly an evil. Grab this one on DVD and see what a man of integrity, an artist, was able to conjure.
