You just know that when a supposed 'documentary' begins with the comment "Oil is the excrement of the devil", that it will be an educated, well informed, unemotional and unbiased presentation....yeah right. Please...<br /><br />This was clearly produced by a bunch of extreme activists on an agenda and is very one-sided. Just more fear mongering...as is the trend today unfortunately. The public is taken for fools once again because of the actual shortage of intelligent people out there. Do we need to start heavily investing in alternative resources? Absolutely, but the situation is not as dire as these clowns claim it to be. It was good for a laugh anyways....<br /><br />If you enjoyed films like 'Loose Change' and 'An Inconvenient Truth', Then you'll love this little gem.
