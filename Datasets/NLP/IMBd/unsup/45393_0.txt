I decided to watch The History Boys after firstly seeing a trailer depicting a seemingly innocent story of the quest to academic excellence and secondly hearing that it was an excellent adaptation.<br /><br />What my girlfriend and I discovered was a sickening portrayal of homosexual promiscuity made even worse by the strong suggestion that child molestation was 'just a bit of fun' with the offending character portrayed as a misunderstood man. There is no justification whatsoever for the writer promoting this kind of behaviour and the film completely ignores the misery and suffering that the paedophile's victim endures throughout.<br /><br />I strongly advise anyone looking for thoughtful and insightful cinema to look elsewhere The History Boys is like Trojan horse, on the outside seemingly fun and innocent tale of adolescence and academic but underneath is a dangerous and sickening endorsement of child molestation spearheaded by the writers vile sodomite agenda.
