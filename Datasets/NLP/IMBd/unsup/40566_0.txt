George C. Scott is one of my favorite actors and I have loved most of his movies. However, I thoroughly hated The Last Days of Patton! It was tedious, uninvolving and completely unnecessary! They should have just let the story end with the original movie Patton. Or, perhaps they could have re-released the original movie with a much shorter version of The Last Days of Patton as an epilogue.<br /><br />Think about it for a moment, just days or weeks after the end of what happened in the movie Patton ended, the general was critically injured in a freak auto accident. He remained paralyzed with a vice-like device screwed into his head for a short time until he died as a result of these injuries. All this, plus a couple flashbacks are the entire basis for this movie!!! Dull, depressing and a waste of time!
