Don't get me wrong, this movie had the potential, but then lost me somewhere in the middle. Most of the Cowboy Bebop episodes are fast paced and have an underlying sense of style to them. This movie did not. I love the characters frm Bebop but they were for the most part unengauging in 'Heaven's'. The best character was the purple haired chick who Spike meets. Jet did 'jack', Ed was more annoying than usual, and all Faye did was give us the most insane tease of her tits. I could have done without all the boring buildup until the last 2 fight scenes. We never empathixe witth the bad guy and they don't stress enough that Spike is after the bounty. They make him just a dude who's bumming out.
