I bought this movie on a DVD. After a big promotional campaign and not that bad scores on IMDb (normally quite accurate)I felt it would be worth the couple of bucks this would cost.<br /><br />O my GOD. It is not even worth one cent.<br /><br />As so many times before in dutch TV and Cinema the old trick of casting some young soap actors and/ or (local music television) presenters has been used to promote this movie. Mostly they have no talent what so ever. Take Johnny the Mol. He is the Dutch Torry Spelling. Father is a billionaire TV producer. But he can not act to safe his live. As a fact I have not ever seen any talents in this kid what so ever. Still he is very popular with young girls and some young boys I am sure.<br /><br />So someone is pushing the right buttons.<br /><br />I must say that this also did work for this movie. It has been all over the press. -Must be some good PR team for this one, maybe the same as Johhny?.- Anyway. The story, the actors, the dialog the, plot, the effects, the directing is all so cheesy you will not believe. I could not bare it for longer than an hour.<br /><br />If you buy or want to watch this movie anyway. Be prepared to be disappointed. For this will happen. "Vet Hard" zelfs and that's a guarantee.<br /><br />If you do watch this movie. And hate it, as I did. Please help to spare others the disappointment and vote. Also give input for the reviews that are honest and not from the producers and other makers. <br /><br />For in my mind there is no other possibility than this for some of the good reviews up here.
