Whoever passed this film in Hollywood should lose their job. This film has it all and keeps you engaged with brilliantly unexpected events. The first hour was spent with a smile on my face. The kid actors were very charismatic, and still kids. Some beautiful scenery shot in Arizona. I couldn't imagine another plane in the picture, it really worked. The storyline was not "a gimme". You don't know where it's going with a couple twists. The audience at the film festival was 'ohing' and clapping. With the exception of two words, and only one gun, this film can be thoroughly enjoyed by 10-110 year olds. Glad the title was changed from Sky Kids. Nothing but good things to say about this inspiring movie of a return to entertainment. Great job, Rocco!!!
