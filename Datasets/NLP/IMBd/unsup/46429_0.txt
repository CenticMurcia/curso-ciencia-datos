This is the live action film of the popular Hanna Barbera cartoon about the stone age family. There is not that much good comedy, it is more emotion and family based, but it is quite good for some reasons. John Goodman plays Fred Flintstone, husband and father of the famous stone age family. He is exactly as ignorant and fat as the the cartoon version. Elizabeth Perkins plays Wilma Flintstone, she is quite pretty, but she is not as worrying as the cartoon version. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Rick Moranis plays the cartoon's best character Barney Rubble. He is giggly and a bit dumb, not quite as good as the cartoon though. And Rosie O'Donnell as Betty Rubble is just not right, she is meant to be thin and attractive, not fat and quite loud. Also starring Kyle MacLachlan as Cliff Vandercave, Halle Berry as Sharon Stone (probably meant to be irony, but they did originally want the actress of the same name), Elizabeth Taylor as Pearl Slaghoople and Richard Moll as Hoagie. Not all people who loved the cartoon show would bother with this, but it is still quite fun for the family. Halle Berry was number 99, and Dame Elizabeth Taylor number 77 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was also number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses. Okay!
