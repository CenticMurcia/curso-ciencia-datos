I just finished watching The Restless and I must say that I'm stunned by its beauty. If you really want to enjoy this movie please leave all of your expectations somewhere and watch it with a clear mind. You'll see that there is a lot to like in this Korean fantasy flick.<br /><br />To make the picture more clear I have to make some comparisons. First of all this movie is not better than Shadowless Sword in action or swordplay department. There are some nice CGI filled fight scenes but as I said before there is not as much as action as in Shadowless Sword.<br /><br />This movie is mostly a romantic fantasy movie with some swordplay thrown in. The sets are awesome and all the effects, costumes everything looks beautiful except two things: 1-The main hero's hair. I really wanted to enter the screen and give him a more charismatic hairstyle 2-Main actress expression. I wonder why she looked so scared like there is a monster or a ghost looking at her. That really ruined most of the film for me.<br /><br />To sum everything up I have to say few thins: 1-There is less fights and action than Shadowless Sword 2-There is more romance and sadness than Bichunmoo 3-Effect are the best I have ever seen in such Korean movie ever 4-I would recommend you to watch this movie if you liked Shadowless Sword,Bichunmoo and The Legend of the Evil Lake 5-Koreans must make this type of fantasy swordplay movies more often. I really like their ones over Chinese fantasy swordplay films
