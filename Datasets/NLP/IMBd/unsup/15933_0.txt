So you thought that Norma couldn't make a hit without Thalberg, huh? Maybe Marie Antoinette didn't make a trillion dollars at the box office, but today film lovers treasure it to make up for this. Ty Power is gorgeous, as is Norma, in the gorgeous costumes and wigs, and the sets are magnificent. This movie is so sad and tragic and beautiful that it makes you cry by the time Marie is jailed with her family and has her son testify against her in court. This is Norma's "last best" movie.
