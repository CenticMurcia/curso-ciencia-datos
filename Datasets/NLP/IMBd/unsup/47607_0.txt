If you are curious about watching this movie, be warned. It's a stinker and it is so obvious that even my wife could guess what happens next. I'm always looking for a solid ghost story, I happened upon this one from the IMDb and it sounded like a good chiller. I hunted this movie down, finally got a copy and told the wife it was a good one. I had to apologize to her after making her watch this. This movie offers nothing that would be even remotely considered scary, not even to little ones and it has nothing to do with gore or slasher shock value. I've watched countless no budget b movies and have found many gems, this is a stinker even for early 70's. <br /><br />There is no real sense of danger or fear because the lackey who plays the "ghost" is ridiculous. Not to mention a bumbling, incompetent misfit even for a ghost. I didn't know if this movie was directed by Benny Hill or Monty Python by some of the chase scenes bordering on the absurd. Can't forget about the complete lack of any time/space relationship between point a and point b. A classic ghost story this is far from, but if you have 35 minutes to waste and want to get a chuckle at something really sad this could be your movie. However, I warn you...it might say 35 minutes running time, but it feels like 200. Maybe that is the scary part.
