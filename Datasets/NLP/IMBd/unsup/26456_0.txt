"In modern-day China, an American is about to be punished for the ultimate crime his innocence. Richard Gere stars in this electrifying suspense thriller charged with lethal confrontations, raw passion and international intrigue. On the verge of signing a huge business deal, attorney Jack Moore (Gere) is on top of the world. But, his elation soon comes tumbling down after he spends the night with a beautiful woman and is then accused of her brutal murder!" according to the film's official synopsis.<br /><br />"At the mercy of the strict Chinese court system - where one is guilty until proved innocent - Jack finds himself completely alone. But, when his defense attorney (Bai Ling) unearths puzzling contradictions in the case, she acts against the court and her country, joining him in a pulse-pounding race to find the true killer while both of their lives hang in the balance!" Their pulses may pound, but you might need to check your's during most of this competently made, but unfortunately implausible and dullish, film.<br /><br />**** Red Corner (10/31/97) Jon Avnet ~ Richard Gere, Bai Ling, Byron Mann
