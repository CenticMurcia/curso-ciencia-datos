I have been watching movies most of my life. I have seen some great ones, bad ones but I have never seen a movie that slapped me with such a roller-coaster of emotion. By the time I figured out what I should be feeling I was experiencing another emotion. It was non-stop. Should I laugh or cry, get mad...love, I did not have enough time to know what to feel.<br /><br />This movie was all of this. I wanted to see it over and over again! This movie proves that we are not what we seem on the outside. Patrick Warburton has established himself as an actor that should be a "star". His acting shines throughout in every scene...even without words.Ms. Matiko is beautiful. Amazing movie!
