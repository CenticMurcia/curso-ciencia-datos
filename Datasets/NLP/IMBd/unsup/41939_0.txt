I, like many teenagers, was sucked into seeing Disturbing Behavior by the teasers on TV which despite being backed by Harvey Danger songs seemed to speak volumes: the preppies are evil, they get away with murder and they want you for their new recruit.<br /><br />Besides my total waste of $5 just so Hollywood could try to stretch enough to reach my angsty punk teenage soul, Disturbing Behavior is ridiculously condescending. It's almost like they were looking directly into my eyes and seeing how they could use me to make money. Ooh the Dawson's Creek girl has NOFX and Alternative Tentacles stickers... on the back of her pickup truck!! What followed the initial amusement was 90 minutes of boring hell as I debated whether or not to go over to the next theater and see what was playing there... Titanic sounded preferable at times.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm calling out to all of you now who want to know if Disturbing Behavior spills the honest truth about high school cliques and preppy crimes: the preppies aren't out to get you, my black-clad, boot-wearing, spikey-haired brothers and sisters, it's the big corporate producers of Hollywood teenage movies.
