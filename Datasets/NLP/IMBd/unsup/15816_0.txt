This movie starts out that there is a maniac at a drive-in movie theatre that sneaks around and kills all these people while they are at a drive in. These detectives try to find the killer but only have one too many suspects. There are so many actors in this movie that can not act and are so terrible at acting their parts in this movie that it's hard to figure out who the killer is. So the detectives try to disquise themselves as a couple in order to catch the killer and don't do a good job at it. This movie is so stupid it wouldn't even be catagorized as a B-rated cheap budget classic. It's down right terrible!!! Avoid it!!!
