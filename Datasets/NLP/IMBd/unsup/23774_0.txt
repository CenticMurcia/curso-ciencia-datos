Never watched the Horrorfest DVD; saw Lake Dead after Saw wanna-be See No Evil on the Sci-fi Channel. Between the two, I rate "Evil" nine; "Dead" flat-line zero. <br /><br />Horror movie only in its disrespecting women. How I regret not heeding the warning as I watched the drunk gal in film's first ten minutes. TA, woman held down and taped up, girl apparently in of the mentality can't do better hence putting up with a cheater. Began thinking those responsible concocting the "story" shallow perverts. Second bend over I got nauseated and angry--stop "The Making of Girls Gone Wild, the PG-13 version!" Bless the RV men with an eighth a brain; dumb fiancé and dumber frat philanderer! Not being sexist here both men and women deserved equal allocation to a special prize called commonsense. Funniest instance involving the male morons, the fiancé of one of the sisters complains eyes itching yet he dives into murky water. What too lazy to get water in close-by RV??? IMO, most interesting characters were the killers; I don't like feeling this way watching a horror film. More importantly looks STILL don't carry a plot less film and horrible acting but so far.
