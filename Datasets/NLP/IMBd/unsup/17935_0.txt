Sure, this film is a classic romance, but the treatment is refreshing. The acting is splendid (especially by at least three of the Bastounes family), the witty dialogue rings true, and it's a pleasure to get involved with characters who aren't Ken and Barbie clones. However, it's the music that is especially beguiling. Even non-aficionadi of the opera will surely enjoy it.<br /><br />I also liked the way the blue-collar background of the main character, George, is juxtaposed with the high-falutin' milieu of the art (i.e., opera) world. Scenes featuring the opera house's gorgeous stage sets and five-star hotels are nicely contrasted with Southside Chicago neighborhoods.<br /><br />The filmmakers are obviously from the indie scene and received help from movie notables. (I noticed Woody Allen is thanked in the credits.) But this film was made three years ago. What are they up to now? (I hope the Weinstein brothers are listening.)
