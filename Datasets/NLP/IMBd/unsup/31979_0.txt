This was one of the worst and stupidest movies I have ever watched. And completely sans any type of ending. Was not even worth $1 theater price or a free rental. Don't waste your time or money on it. This is sure to take Tomei's career right to the dumper. The special effects were atrocious. The plotlessness was magnificent, something a high school kid might have written. The only bright spot: Craig Bierko, who did a fine job on Boston Legal as Jeffrey Koho...don't blame HIM for this one. And what was the point of this anyway?? Real crazy people are far more interesting...and at least their lives are real. Who wrote this screenplay? And who paid to make this movie? Really sorry we bothered with it.
