First a Grizzly as large as the one in this film would need a large hunting ground but yet seemed to be in a fairly small one around a blocked of toxic waste dump and has never been noticed by anyone . Second is the waste dump it self why so many shots of it when they never bothered to say why, was it the reason the bear was so aggressive/seemingly intelligent, was the bear put there to guard the dump, where did the dump come from, why has it not affected the trees and ground water to get noticed by rangers and or nearby communities as from the rusty barrels it has been there for many years. Intelligence on the people, a tire iron is not going to do much against a adult bear, going off alone over and over when as a group they would stand a better chance, not trying to make weapons such as spears at nigh they sit around 2 flash lights instead of building a large a fire as they can for light to give warning of the bear but also to use as protection not to mention to maybe signal someone that at least they were in a no trespassing area to get rangers interested. The cabin seemed to be set up as a defensible position but they don't use it or get any of the weapons from it, also who built it when and what happened to them and when, as recent chicken remains are shown but the cabin it self look long deserted. They trap the bear in the barn but they already see it is getting lose but they just walk away with out trying to reinforce the trap or kill the bear that escapes and kills them leaving no one left alive. Alas your left just siting there going what just happened and why did a watch this.
