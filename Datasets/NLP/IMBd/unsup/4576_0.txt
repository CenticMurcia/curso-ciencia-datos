This is a compassionate, beautifully acted drama of human emotions and desires, amongst a well-educated, middle class British family and their aacquaintances. Made in 1991, produced for the BBC and WNET, and telecast in the United Kingdom on June 24, 1992, this is one tv production which deserves to and will undoubtedly last a long time. <br /><br />Heading the cast is Angus MacFadyen as a sensitive young man who is well adjusted with his lifestyle, and who can express himself intelligently, and carry himself with dignity. A look at MacFadyen's career roles is surprising, with this film marking his debut. Between '91 and '00 he has played an impressive number of widely varied characters, from Orson Welles and Richard Burton to Hitler and Zeus, surely the mark of a gamely actor! <br /><br />Eileen Atkins contributes a sensibly realized portrait of a knowing wife and mother, and Sean Mathias and David Leavitt's script is quite perceptive, based on Leavitt's original novel. A very well crafted tv production. ###
