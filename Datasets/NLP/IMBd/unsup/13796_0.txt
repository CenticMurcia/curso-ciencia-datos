I have no idea what the point of this film is. Its like a poor 1950's space film done in the late 1960's early 1970's. Its starts off in one direction and then heads off into another.<br /><br />The plot has a spy discovering the Chinese have a device which may very well destroy the earth by causing an atomic chain reaction inside the earth. Meanwhile a space mission to Venus is being prepared. Suddenly half the crew is replaced with women and the rocket is launched ahead of schedule. Once in space the crew watches as the deice destroys the earth, Stranded in space the crew has to decide what to do next.<br /><br />Very dated, even by 1972 standards, and very silly (The spy gets into a top secret center by throwing a cat over a wall and I won't talk about the press conference) I'm not sure if I'm suppose to be laughing or taking this very seriously. Clearly its another the commies are out to get us film released about the time that Nixon was going to China. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to have a point, or at least an ending since the picture sort of stops with a conclusion out of left field. Simply put its a mess.<br /><br />Intriguing enough, in a bad movie sort of way, to keep me watching to the end I arrived there with a great deal of disappointment that that was all. It doesn't add up to much in any real sort of a way. Actually the film sort of spirals out of control after the Earth is destroyed.<br /><br />Worth a look for bad movie lovers and those wanting a movie they can laugh at while debating the sanity of the film makers. All others stay away.
