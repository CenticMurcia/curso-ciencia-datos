***SPOILERS*** Illogical and over plotted thriller that has so many twists and turns in it that it leaves you lost in the woods halfway into the movie without a compass to help you find your way out. Robbing their own bank four bank employees take off with 10 million dollars in cash but have one of them the crazy and vicious Kendell, Lori Ann Triolo, badly wounded in a shootout with the bank guard.<br /><br />Finding this mansion on their way to the airport, where the four robbers plan to make their getaway, the head hood former bank manager Beckett, Andrew Divoff, decides to spend the night there until the heats off and the rain, which is pouring down like a tropical monsoon, stops. to Becketts and his gangs big surprise they find out that the mansion, which he thought was deserted, has new owners the Sawyers.<br /><br />Moving into the mansion just that afternoon the Saywers Rodney & Jennie, Mario Van Peebles & Holly Robinson, don't know who to call or turn too for help and are quickly overpowered by the hoodlums with their son Malik, Michael J. Pagan, hiding upstairs. Rodney who at first went outside to check the hoods car is startled to find the wounded Kendell in the back seat with a gun pointed to his head.<br /><br />Malik who saw what was happening sneaks downstairs and takes off with the 10 million in stolen cash but later stupidly hides the money in the fire place having the millions, and the only reason that Beckett & Co. kept his parents alive, go up in smoke.The movie gets really nuts when Rodney's friend and local lawyer Pendelton, Hal Lindan, pops in to check if every things all right. Pendelton is secretly told that it isn't, with Rodney using some kind of sign language which should have had he leave and call for help. The big jerk instead of getting help or calling the police on his cellphone after he's allowed to leave by the hoodlums bursts in like he was a member of an AFT assault team and gets himself shot to death for his brainless effort.<br /><br />Playing for time Jennie puts on a Doctor Kildare act in trying to save Kendell's life only to end up killing her because she had no idea of what she was doing, which has her. Kendell's lover Beckett then goes crazy with the two, Annie and Rodney, taking off in the confusion together with the now out of hiding Malik and barricade themselves in an upstairs bedroom.<br /><br />Meanwhile Beckett is slowly going insane hallucinating that he's now the man of the house which makes his two fellow bank robbers Sykes & Henley, Vincent Gale & Dean McKenzie, a wee bit worried about his mental condition. the two start to feel that it would be better to take off with the money, they still don't know that it's been burned to a crisps by the absent-minded Malik, and leave him to flounder around in his own fantasy world.<br /><br />Hard to take ending with the three remaining hoods being knocked out by a falling chandelier with Beckett rushing to the garden thinking that the 10 million is hidden there and getting both his feet caught in a number of bear-traps set all around the house by the mansion's handyman Billy, Josh Holland. It turned out that Billy just happened to be Beckett's lovers, the dead Kendell's, brother!<br /><br />There's so many plot-holes as well as illogic action taken by both the Sawyers and the bank robbers, turned kidnappers, lead by the out of his bird Beckett you need a road map to just follow the story. Even if you want to enjoy and watch the movie "Killers in the House" as a decent made-for-TV thriller your brain short-circuits your emotions by not being able to make you overlook the fact that the film, or the people in it, make absolutely no sense at all in what their doing!
