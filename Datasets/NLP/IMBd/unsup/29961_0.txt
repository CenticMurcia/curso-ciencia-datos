I have just finished watching this great movie....fortunately with the English Subtitles. I think its a masterpiece by Theo. Beautiful story, strong characters, captivating scenery, breath taking music and ultimately of cource great production.Its a long movie and the start might be a bit boring but as the story progresses it will hold your attention<br /><br />I recommend this movie if you are looking for some sensitive piece of art. Though there is quite a lot of tragedy in it but it does give a glimpse of the life of Greek immigrants of that time and the horrors of war.<br /><br />Two Thumbs Up...........
