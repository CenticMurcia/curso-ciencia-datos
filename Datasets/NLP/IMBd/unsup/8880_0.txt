Well, Jaques Tourneur is a great director. I saw many films by him. I liked most of his works for they are smart. They all have something inside, more that one can expect. This 1943 film is a great detective psychological film. It has to do with a narrow circle of people who are investigating the deaths of several women in New Mexico. They think that the ran away black leopard is killing people, but more they investigate the more they get to know that someone close, who is killer. A lot of cemeteries pictures are here. This film has good suspense and music. I would recommend this film for people who are fond of Hitchcock and black and white surrealism.<br /><br />Andrey Grachev<br /><br />www.myspace.com/neizvest
