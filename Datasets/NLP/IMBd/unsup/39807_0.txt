One of the worst home videos that someone dared to make copies of and tried to distribute. This movie (if you can call it that) is full of 2 things -- ethnic stereotypes and racial slurs.<br /><br />There are no actors in it (and therefore no acting to speak of). There is no storyline or plot so if the direction was sloppy it didn't matter much. It is supposed to be about the tension between newly arrived and settled immigrants with regard to their lifestyles, habits, and so on. And also perhaps about the generation gap between 1st Gen. parents and their 2nd Gen. (or Gen. X) US-born-and-raised kids. Had it been thought out and skilfully done, it could have examined/explored a whole variety of issues confronting immigrants of every size, shape and color. And in so doing, transcend racial, ethnic and other divisions. But it ended up becoming a caricature of US-based Indian expatriates, and a ghastly one at that.<br /><br />There are many decent-to-excellent options in the low-budget/indie film category that can be viewed as an alternative. A better name for this movie is "Where's the Potty Yaar?".
