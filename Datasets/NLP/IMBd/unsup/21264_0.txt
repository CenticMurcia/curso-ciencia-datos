Joan Crawford is an ageing Southern socialite (by marriage) who revels in dominating her extended family - like a "Queen Bee". As the film opens, cousin Lucy Marlow (as Jennifer Stewart) arrives; providing Ms. Crawford (as Eva Phillips) with a new victim - and viewers the opportunity to see "Queen Bee" Crawford bring another person into her hive. Drones include boozy husband Barry Sullivan (as Avery) and lady-killer John Ireland (as Jud). Betsy Palmer is very good as nice niece Carol.<br /><br />Crawford creates an astonishing character, and the film is very well-photographed. The supporting players really operate in Crawford's shadow, which is to be expected. The film's weakness is a story that lacks depth in its characterizations, and doesn't live up to their potential. In the end, the film wastes its leading actress' effort, with a story lacking substance. <br /><br />******* Queen Bee (1955) Ranald MacDougall ~ Joan Crawford, Barry Sullivan, Betsy Palmer
