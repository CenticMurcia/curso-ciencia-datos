What was Sharon Stone thinking. To see her in this sorry excuse of, well anything, is truly a terrible offense. The once sexiest woman in Hollywood starring opposite Billy Connely, (who, supposedly is very funny?) in a movie that doesn't know what to do with itself. One cliche after another, but the worst part is the acting. Gil Bellows, the guy from "Ally McBeal" is plain terrible, he singlehandedly ruins what's left of this fiasco. So there is absolutely NOTHING even remotely good about this crappy movie. Never should have rented it! 3/10
