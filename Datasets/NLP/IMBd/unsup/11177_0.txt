I saw "The Road Home" more than a year ago, and the film, its themes, and its content, have stayed with me. This movie moved me deeply, and there are times I still think of it fondly. It had moments of intense humor, and moments of deep sadness. The emotional roller-coaster this movie put me on was one very few films can achieve, let alone sustain throughout the length of the movie. "The Road Home" is a movie that should be seen by masses. It is an exceptional film, one that deserves to be shown to the public at large. Drew Johnson has the markings of a major-league film-maker and with this movie he hits one out of the park!
