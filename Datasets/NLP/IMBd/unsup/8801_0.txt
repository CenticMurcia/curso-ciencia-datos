I just rented this film after looking at the cover for weeks at Blockbuster. I was curious because I remember seeing Jason Yee fight on cable back in the 90's. The story is decent, about a guy just out of prison that becomes a suspect in the murders of his old gang members. It's good to see Asian-Americans like Jason Yee being proactive by producing his own movie; it's amazing what he did on a low-budget. It was refreshing to see decent hard-hitting action with no-strings or CGI but, I wish there was more. Definitely a good film to watch for aspiring filmmakers, the behind the scenes on the DVD are cool because you get an idea of how hard film-making is. I think Jason is a good actor, especially for having to direct the film at the same time and do his own action stunts. He was able to deliver decent production values with a decent story, I enjoyed it.
