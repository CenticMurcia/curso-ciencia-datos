There are so many really great comments on this movie, that I really can't add anything much better. Except to tell you that you really owe it to yourselves to actually find a copy and see it. It WILL be worth it. It is perhaps one of the all time worst movies ever made, but so bad and because it includes the Governor of California in the all time worst performance of his career well, its just priceless! After you watch this you will never again be able to watch Arnold doing anything without a feeling of complete awe and respect. That the dumb body builder who played "Hercules" could possibly end up where he is today...........<br /><br />(If you had been watching this movie in 1970 and somebody had said to you, "that guy is going to be a great star AND the future Governor of California" you would have laughed until you peed yourself!)
