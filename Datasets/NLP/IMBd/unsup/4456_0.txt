Thomas the Tank Engine has sentimental value to me. I watched it all the time as a kid, and the stories just entranced me in such a way. Especially the older episodes. The older episodes...was storytelling at its best. As the show went on, it withered and lost its depth. But it never came to this.<br /><br />Thomas & the Magic Railroad is a full-length film that is a complete disgrace to Thomas. The focus is not on the trains, but on the conductors (who don't even move in the series), and features a villain, which the original Thomas series never had.<br /><br />The story is really terrible. It features magic in it, which was not part of the original Thomas, and all the voice acting is so bad. Diesel 10 is the closest to the original Thomas tapes, but all other performances are so bad. They used to be narrated by one person, and in this one, each one has a different voice actor. Other performances are bad as well.<br /><br />I really can't begin to describe how shameful this film is compared to the original Thomas. As a stand-alone movie, not connected to the show, it still stinks, but man...it kills Thomas in a way I've never seen before. 0.1/10.
