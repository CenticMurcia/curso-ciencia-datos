John Candy is always funny to watch, but Michael Moore's anti-Americanism was really coming to the fore in this movie. This was released after Candy's death, and so Canadian Bacon is notable for his fans in that regard. Dan Aykroyd's cameo appearance as an RCMP trooper is priceless and other parts of the movie are well done. Stomaching Moore's tripe is another matter. From his typical military-bashing (embodied in Rip Torn's General Panzer) that he refers to these days as "supporting the troops" to mocking the Western position against Commumism (of which Canada was a fully-supporting member in the fight), Moore hasn't changed much. His premise that the good old USSR wasn't so bad (note the "Peace through Fear Since 1947" signs in the factory the President visits) runs parallel to his position today that Al Qaida isn't such a bad bunch of chaps and that, in Moore's words, "there is no terrorist threat." Moore has since "graduated" to creating fictional movies disguised as documentaries in order to profit from the suffering of others (Columbine, 9/11). In retrospect, perhaps Moore should have stuck to comedy.
