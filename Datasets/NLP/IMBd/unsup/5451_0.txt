I can't believe people did not like this movie. It had its share of scary moments, above average acting, and the story line flowed pretty well. 4.0 at its current rating on IMDb as I'm writing this comment, is much too low for this movie, and I would encourage anyone that has not seen this movie to check it out. Oh and did I mention the girls in this flick are totally hot. Please don't be fooled by these people that are more or less dissing this movie. I know a few people that enjoyed this much more then The Exorcism of Emily Rose (which is another way underrated horror/Drama movie) I found this movie at my local Hollywood Video store, and hopefully you won't have too much trouble finding it. With so many horrible b rated movies out there crowding the video shelf, you won't be to disappointed by picking this one up.
