This film is dreadful. Wasn't this a good opportunity to kill Jason off once and for all? I would have given 6 out of 10, but the last few seconds of the film dropped the rating to 1. Awful. A waste of 1 hour and 45 minutes.<br /><br />The first film in 1980 was brilliant. We've then had another 11 (inc. Freddy vs Jason), plus this one, and they have just got worse each time.<br /><br />Some good acting in this movie but it's a shame it ended like it did.<br /><br />I'll certainly not be watching the next one! I can't believe that over 2,000 people have given this movie 10/10.
