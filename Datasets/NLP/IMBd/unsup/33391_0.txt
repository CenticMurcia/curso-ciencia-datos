Maybe I wouldn't rather go to the dentist, but this film still isn't very good. Nothing about will shock you like it wants to, after the first victim is swallowed by the CURSE, you'll know every line, every plot point, everything that's going to happen. Whoever wrote this must have just watched about a million old cheesey horror films. Not worth the celluliod it was made on.<br /><br />On a scale of ONE to TEN, THE CURSE gets a 3, because the guy from Stand by Me is in it!
