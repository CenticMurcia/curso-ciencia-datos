I saw this movie, and I use that term VERY loosely, in one of my film classes. As an example of what NOT TO DO. LAND OF THE COLLEGE PROPHETS is bad. Really, REALLY BAD. And not a "fun bad", either. Painful, angry, why-are-you-making-me- watch-this-type of bad.<br /><br />Where do I begin? It claims to be directed by about eight different people and it shows. It also shows that not a one of them ever went to school, either. Very simple, first day, Film School 101 rules are completely ignored and it shows off that the people doing the thing are nothing short of amateur and the whole thing really comes across as a public-access show. <br /><br />It claims to have a script, but can't see how. The story, another term that I use very loosely, is all over the place and extremely ponderous. It tries like the dickens to tell the story of the world coming to an end on some Lucas-Spielberg-Jackson-type scale. Except no one told the rest of the town- traffic runs as normal, college students wander freely during the numerous badly choreographed fights between the (cough) heroes and assorted grade-z hell-spawn. Attention to any kind of believable detail is simply non-existent. <br /><br />And I certainly don't want to hear about this thing had no budget. EVIL DEAD had no budget. DEAD ALIVE had no budget. HALLOWEEN had no budget. Need I continue? Having no money is simply no excuse for making something as purely DREADFUL as LAND OF THE COLLEGE PROPHETS. If even the slightest bit of care was given to this thing when it was in idea phase instead of the "hey, mommy, look at me! I'm making a movie!" phase, then maybe, just MAYBE, something even remotely watchable could have come out the "Hale Manor Collective"'s efforts. Instead, a bad idea was made even worse by being made.<br /><br />Whatever you do, AVOID THIS MOVIE. Do not believe a single positive review about it (as they obviously are coming from the less-than-no-talent hacks that were involved with this turkey), because anyone with DNA will be not only bored to tears by this thing, but downright insulted.
