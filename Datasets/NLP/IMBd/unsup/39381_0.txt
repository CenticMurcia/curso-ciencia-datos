The question you have to ask yourself after sitting through this turgid piece of utterly uninspired cinema is "why did they bother?"<br /><br />Nothing more than a series of clich√©d set pieces and more ham than a spit-roasted hog. Even The League of Gentlemen's usually excellent Steve Pemberton notches up a performance as excruciating as Lenny Henry doing Frank Spencer.<br /><br />Maybe I'm getting carried away, after all it is for kids, but even when compared to the Elizabeth Taylor Lassie films this just doesn't cut it. A lazy effort all round. The dog out performs everyone, including Peter O'Toole.<br /><br />Save your money and wait until it's released on DVD. It'll just about look OK on the small screen, maybe.
