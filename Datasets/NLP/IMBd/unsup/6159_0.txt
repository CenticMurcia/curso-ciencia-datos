This is one of favorite pictures and I view it often.<br /><br />Minelli wanted to create a trio of movies about Hollywood. The Bad and the Beautiful was the first and Two Weeks In Another Town was the second. I believe a third was never made.<br /><br />Bad is a terrific movie, right up there with Sunset Boulevard when it comes to movies about Hollywood. Kirk's performance is really so good, that I always wished that I could have been Jonathon Shields. The vision of him in his white dinner jacket, black tie untied, collar open, holding sleeping Lana Turner and then the camera moves back to show that it's the edge of the pool and then...he drops her in...it's a priceless scene. As is the scene in which he plays poker to get a job.<br /><br />His argument with the director Von Elstein about interpretation and humility is very strong.<br /><br />This is by far Lana's finest work...better than any performance she ever gave, including The Postman Always Rings Twice and Madame X. It's the most natural behavior and she looks sensational. I also always enjoy Barry Sullivan's performance.<br /><br />The score by David Raksin beats his Laura score by miles...it's very modern...sinister at some points, melancholy at others...even upbeat and humorous at others.<br /><br />Much of Minelli's tricks in this picture end up in the second...Two Weeks, including scenes from Bad and scoring from Bad.<br /><br />I never miss a chance to see either film and those who are still around who were a part of it should be very proud of its enduring power.<br /><br />The video is available and Rhino released the complete score including alternate theme takes.
