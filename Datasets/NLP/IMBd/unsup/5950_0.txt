I gave this movie a 9, but I don't rate movies in the usual fashion. I don't think horror movies should be rated against all other types, just themselves. It's a much more raw form of entertainment and it often fails to deliver. I think the director, Paul Anderson, summed it up effectively in this quote, "We tried to put into the movie that constant sense of dread and foreboding. As you play the game, as you're walking around, you're terrified as to what might happen next. That's the kind of tone of the movie." He is correct. I do not hang onto people during movies, yet I had my husband's left arm in a death grip for more than half of the flick. I may be biased in that I feel there is no other concept scarier than zombies-beings whose ONLY objective is to kill you by eating you. Very loudly. Ewww. I have never played the games, since I'm a chicken when it comes to horror games, and my brother had. I asked him what the plot was to get a feel for whether or not it was an accurate depiction. He had very VAGUE ideas about the plot. I was able to fill in the blanks. I know more than he does because I believe Anderson set out to clear some things up. I believe it only makes the movie better. Sure there are one-liners that aren't stellar, but it IS horror. You have to expect a little cheese with your flick. I honestly don't think the ending could've been any better. I was very entertained. If you check out my other reviews though, I'm no major critic. I go to the movies to be entertained, and I usually pay matinee price, as I did that day. I can't say I would've loved it as much if we paid 6 more bucks to get in. As I always say, sit back and relax. It's just entertainment.
