******CONTAINS SPOILERS****I watched the movie for the first time when I was really young and remembered it being really gripping and intimidating(especially the bug scenes). Having re-watched it again over easter, I must say I was just bored and confused when we got to the second half of the movie. I still enjoyed the first half of the film up until they leave the leper but after that the pace gets strangely confusing. Episodic and disjointed as some say in their comments. I was lost as to why we spend 10 mins watching McQueen living with this Indian tribe running around with this half-naked woman. How much time was that supposed to be? Why do they all disappeared suddenly? I even thought maybe he's hallucinating or something.<br /><br />I kept trying to think maybe I should give the movie some slack as it is from the 70s. It must have been a very elaborate production at the time with such exotic set. The casting I must say is a total flop though. McQueen and Hoffman are great actors but why them? Shouldn't they be French (or at least have French accents)? Why are the rest of the prisoners Americans? And why are the "bad guys" (i.e. guards) English?? It makes things pretty confusing I must say.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the production but as a movie it is not at all coherent and convincing. Let say I enjoyed the Great Escape a lot more.
