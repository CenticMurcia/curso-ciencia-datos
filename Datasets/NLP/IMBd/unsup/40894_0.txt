When I read an analysis of the music video, I thought the ripping off of skin part would look cool. I was extremely disappointed. Since then, I have not liked any of Robbie's work.<br /><br />The video is also fairly unrealistic. If the chicks aren't impressed by him taking all his clothes off, what the hell makes him think that ripping off his skin does? And why did the people involved in this even think about a video with this plot, especially since he's supposed to appeal to a young audience? God, the things that ruin pop music and their videos...<br /><br />If you want to see a music video where a sleazy drug addict rips off his skin to impress chicks, then go ahead, watch this video. Parents, if you don't want your children (especially if they already like him) to be traumatised, please, please, please don't let them watch this video. If it comes on at all, go in the room and turn off the television. I don't care if it's censored or not, just don't subject them to this video.
