i liked this movie, it was something different, something new and i totally loved Thora Birch( one of the coolest actresses around) as the protaganist. The only thing that was lacking was the ending, i found it too symbolic, because it was saying that enids life had not yet begun and her getting on the bus was the start of her life- meh. Besides that i gave the film a seven. Scarlett Johanssen also is pretty cool.
