The people who made I Am The Cheese disregarded the atmosphere of the original novel. The movie is bright and cheery. The interrogation scenes take place in a well-lit, normal-looking office. The doctor is basically nonthreatening. The drama of Adam's situation is underplayed and subdued, and the movie insults the book by adding an ending that fits the movie's sanitized view of the story. A new version of this film would be really cool, if any studio had the initiative to take on the project. Since the cast is so small and the story requires little in the way of special effects, an independent production could work out very well. Today's audiences would probably react well to a version of I Am The Cheese that stays true to the style of the book -- dark, threatening, and mysterious. It's a shame nobody's bothered to dig up the rights.
