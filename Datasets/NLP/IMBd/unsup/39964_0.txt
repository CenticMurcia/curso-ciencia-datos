There is much hype surrounding the release of les Ames Fortes in France due to the starring debut of Laetitia Casta as the main character.<br /><br />We can understand very well what has appealed to the 23 year-old model: the movie, freely adapted from a Giono novel, tells the story of a peasant girl who will discover and use her personal attraction on men and women as she goes to town.<br /><br />What could have made a good story turns very boring as Ruiz lacks a sense of tempo and seems unable to craft a good end to the movie.<br /><br />This movie is not worth two hours of your time, even if you are a Casta fan.
