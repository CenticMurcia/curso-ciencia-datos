Saw this with a group of friends on DVD and thought it was great. I was quite sorry I didn't get to see it on the big screen, because most of the Australian movies I saw last year were pretty crappy. This is the funniest one from 2003 by a long way. I agree with some other comments about the scene with Micalef in his political ad. Absolutely classic stuff. Its a bit similar to some other Aussie comedies, like Castle and Crackerjack, but just as good. How has it got such a bad rating on this website? Must be a lot of people with bad taste in movies. But then again a lot of people watch Rove, so go figure. I can really recommend this film.
