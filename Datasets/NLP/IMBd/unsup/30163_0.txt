Death 4 Told, an Indie of limited funding (just sounds better than low budget) was well written, directed and acted. The four subtlety linked stories, reminded me of Creep Show, with each tale covering a piece of the horror genre.<br /><br />I felt the stories were properly sequenced, with the weakest link (which still offered a satisfying level of creep) at the beginning and the strongest as the closer. The resulting buildup easily held my attention through the plot changes. The cast, most of which are newcomers to the screen (as would be expected of an Indie) played their roles convincingly well, that, or casting did a great job.<br /><br />Judging D4T for what it is, an Indie, not a major motion picture, I found few flaws, and those that were there were forgivable.
