This is a tough one to describe, maybe noirsploitation? Maybe if Billy Wilder were to remake Preminger's Laura as an exploitation movie after dropping six tabs of acid and watching Eat The Schoolgirl, Arsenic & Old Lace, and a Joe D'Amato flick... and doing it in a mix of English, Greek, and French. Singapore Sling is a dark and twisted neo-noir black comedy about a mother and daughter with a special kind of relationship and the introduction of a new man into their lives. So we get some disembowelment, murder, sex, incest, bondage, puking, urinating, electro shock, a good helping of nudity, and lots of other fun stuff. It's been a while since I've seen a good bizarre flick like this, it's right up there with Visitor Q and Penetration Angst. Good stuff!
