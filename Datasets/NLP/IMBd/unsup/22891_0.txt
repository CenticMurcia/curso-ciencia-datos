I saw this movie when I was a teenager and I absolutely loved it. I remember that I cried like a baby. Like so many others, I only saw it once, and I have since scoured everywhere looking for a personal copy to keep. I have just watched Love Story with my daughter, and I was telling her how good "Sunshine" was, compared to Love story. We both want to see it now, me because I loved it so much originally, and her because I've told her about how great it is, and how sad it is, and how its the type of movie that never leaves you, once you've seen it, it just touches you. I recall seeing it with a boyfriend in Perth, and we both walked out of the cinema crying our eyes out. He was a very blokey (macho)man, very tough, and I think its the only time I ever saw him cry, not only over a movie, but over anything. I just want to see it again. If anyone knows where I can get a copy, please put a message here. I will be eternally grateful. If anyone reading this has the power to get it on to DVD.... please do so. I imagine there are a lot of us out there who are waiting to see this fabulous movie again.
