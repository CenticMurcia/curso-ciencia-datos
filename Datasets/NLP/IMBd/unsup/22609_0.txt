I really enjoyed this movie - the characters were sophisticated and the relationships complex. I especially enjoyed that this movie treated me as an adult, it did not spoon feed me; rather, the movie left me thinking, so I could reach my own conclusions about the relationships between all four characters. The movie was extremely well done and I look forward to other work by Eric Byler.<br /><br />
