First of all, my son brought this movie home and said that I would like it because there are songs by the Dead Kennedys and Devo - these are two bands that we both love. The cover art had a very interesting retro 50's look that also made me inquisitive. We put the movie in and saw one of most ridiculous, unreal and somehow touching movies I'd seen in a while. I don't know how Rusty Nails (the director) managed to mix film noir, horror and science fiction and make it all fit together into a workable, though experimental film, but I liked it. There are definitely some gross moments in the film but they're not mean spirited - more just gross out humor - though more funny than gross. The soundtrack and score were terrific mixing punk rock and an intense symphonic score... again - very interest but it works. A movie that a punk rock kid and a rock and roll dad can love. Bravo Mr. Nails Good Job!
