fine, i was wrong, i admit it. in fall of 1994 i went to the theater and sat thru several hours of what i believed at the time was complete nonsensical garbage. the initial impression made by 'natural born killers' was one of overkill...literally. several years later i had the chance to revisit this film with the directors edition, what a difference it was. i still do not know whether it was seeing the entire movie as stone envisioned it, or if it had to do with seeing the nineties play out as a decade obsessed with celebrity, prizing infamy over fame. it was hard for me to come to terms with juliette lewis's style of acting. one has to admit that she is unlike any other to come before, or will probably come after. it is the same intensity that she brings to every role that makes her a star, and an annoyance when in the wrong mindset.
