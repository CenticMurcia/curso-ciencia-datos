Want to know how to get funding for a movie ? It`s relatively simple , just turn up at a sales pitch and say your screenplay is a cross between ALIENS and PREDATOR which means the producer will jump at the chance of making a film that`s a cross between two massive blockbusters . Don`t worry if he can`t do your script justice with a hundred million dollar budget because he`ll save a massive amount of money by filming in the nearest forest pretending it`s darkest Africa . And don`t worry if this is totally unconvincing because that`s the audiences fault for having no imagination . And no doubt the producer will cut other corners by using the alien costume from ENEMY MINE , the Borg costumes from STAR TREK:TNG , cast off corpses from LIFEFORCE and employ actors no one has ever heard of . And don`t complain either , you`ve got your foot in the door and with any luck your next screenplay will be produced with a budget ten times your debut movie . It may even be made with a six figure sum <br /><br />!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!<br /><br />What`s that you`re screaming ? Isn`t there such a thing as copyright ? Yes but in order not to receive a copyright writ make sure that you have a ridiculous ending in the last ten minutes with the alien being a good guy who`s actually being trying to save the humans . Despite copying ALIENS and PREDATOR scene for scene for the first 80 minutes the producers of these two films won`t be able to sue . Another tip is make sure the anti hero has family issues like a long lost brother who he hates so that when he dies the tough macho anti hero starts weeping like a big girl . This is what`s known as character development, and a scene like this didn`t appear in ALIENS or PREDATOR so once again you don`t have to worry about court appearances . And make sure one of the characters is an ethnic women because not only will Halle Berry be kicking herself she missed out on the role but all the women and ethnic minorities will be able to identify with her , especially if they`re good at martial arts . And since Tarantino style post modernism is fashionable make sure you steal lines from films like SPLIT SECOND or JAWS because the critics will think you`re a genius . And make sure your climax is very exciting , this can only be done by having the hero defuse a bomb . Contary to popular perception size is very important in these situations so make sure it`s a thermo nuclear bomb . Don`t worry if there`s no logic to this because the audience will be too excited to notice.<br /><br />A big thank you to the makers of CODE RED for showing us how to make a movie<br /><br />
