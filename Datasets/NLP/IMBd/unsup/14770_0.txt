Okay so it is a story about a young kid trying to set his father up with someone because daddy has been lonely. Mommy is gone. So where does this boy and his band of innocents turn? Where else, a hooker! Horribly unbalanced, unentertaining, and downright unwatchable. Featuring Melanie Griffith at her whiniest and most annoying yet. Ed Harris' performance was, to put it kindly, forgettable. Avoid this one.
