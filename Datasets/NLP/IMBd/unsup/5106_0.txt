This is a movie close to my heart as this was one of the movies I used to watch when I used to go to my Grandma's house. This movie is absolutely perfect. What makes it so perfect is that so much is packed into one film, there is action, comedy,drama and so much more. The plot was not original but how it is packaged is extraordinary.<br /><br />The story, for those who don't already know is about three brothers who get separated from their parents and how their lives intertwine. One is brought up by a Hindu, one by a Christian and the other by a Muslim. Years later they meet when they give blood to their real mother (they don't know that yet). Their Father(Kishenlal) is seeking vengeance on Robert, who he blames for separating his family. Coincidentally he is also bringing up Jenny, Robert's daughter who he stole from him. Cues heaps of fun for all ages. <br /><br />The songs also deserves a special mention, all of them are perfect. My personal favourite was the title song. This was a huge hit when released and it my opinion remains of Manmohan Desai's best films. All the three heroes performed well, however on the downside there was not much scope on the heroines. Another downside was Jeevan,in my opinion he is not good as the main villain. Pran and Nirupa Roy were superb as the parents. Coincidentally 4 years later Manmohan Desai made Naseeb, another one of my favourite movies. Wonderfully done, well done Manmohan Desai.
