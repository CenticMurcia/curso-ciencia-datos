If there's anything worse than the teen flick, there's the aging teen flick.<br /><br />I caught this in the 1980s on cable TV and it's representative of the Meatballs and Porky's generation of films.<br /><br />What this film has in common with Star Wars and the X-Men is the fantasy of magical powers.<br /><br />Even if some nudity will amuse you, there's not much about Zapped! worth seeing.<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- nobody<br /><br />I'll give Zapped! a 3 out of 10.
