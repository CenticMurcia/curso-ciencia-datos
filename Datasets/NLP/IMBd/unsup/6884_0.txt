I'm not a fan of crossword puzzles. Despite being musically talented, and in one of the professions (IT) that the film cites as containing people who do well with puzzles, I just find them frustrating and annoying. If they're too easy, I get bored; if they're too hard, I give up.<br /><br />That being said, I liked this movie very much, largely because I was drawn to the people from the film who create and work puzzles. These are not the beautiful people of the world, Bill Clinton aside. They're the geeks, the underdogs, the people who calculated Pi on their slide rules in high school for fun, the ones who could recite every ounce of baseball trivia, but never played a single game.<br /><br />They are also a warm and loving community, even in competition, that support, nurture and celebrate each other. They believe in knowledge and success for its own sake; in striving to be better than you were -- not better than others.<br /><br />The film does a great job of painting a portrait of that community, and treats each person with affection and compassion. It has a great structure, that surreptitiously built and drew me along to the climax without effort.<br /><br />The film was successful in that it touched my heart, and challenged my mind. It made me want to be part of the community -- but only if I didn't have to work the puzzles.
