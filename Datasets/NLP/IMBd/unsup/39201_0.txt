1 out of 10, only because there are no negative numbers on the scale. I'm going to split the bashing of this film into 2 categories: Science, and The Rest<br /><br />Science: Ill only cover a few things here, I bet someone could list 100 things wrong, but lets hit some random ones (limit to 7) 1: the ship has 6 compartments, 1 is crushed, 5 are used for nukes, and 1 is used to return home... therefore 6 = 7. Try and solve that, apologists. <br /><br />2: If that "geode" were to have survived, its pressure inside would have to = that outside, in short, they would be all crushed like bugs stepping outside. <br /><br />3: A pigeon cannot break plate glass, even if it tried. <br /><br />4: Any hacker who could do half of what are hacker can would have either been locked up, or would be in control of the whole bloody world. <br /><br />5: Gravity does not act perpendicular, it works VERY vertically, and it would keep anything IN the core from coming out, especially anything propelled by a minuscule nuke's shock wave <br /><br />6: It does not matter if you start in the marinara trench or the top of everest, the difference is irrelevant compared to the radius of the Earth. <br /><br />7: Throwing reactor grade plutonium next to a weapon is NOT going to make it more powerful (otherwise, they would be doing it already!)<br /><br />If you want more on the 'science' read the other reviews, and the Intuitors insultingly bad movie physics page (google it)<br /><br />Now, for the rest, which is to prove that this movie is bad even IF you have the IQ of a walnut and don't "care" about science. <br /><br />1: Bad, BAD acting, not one character is believable, they evoke no sympathy, their backgrounds are so stereotypical, and their dialog is purely contrived and occasionally "slap your face I cant believe he said THAT" bad, full of clich√©s.<br /><br />2: Speaking of stereotypes, every character is completely "by the books" predictable, the 'smartest' ones seem to die, except the hacker who is the worst character of them all, annoying, contrived, insulting, I truly had hoped he would have died.<br /><br />3: Lets talk entertainment, not for one moment was I caught up in this movie, I did not have one shred of emotion, this movie has no substance, no deep moments, and the 'climax' and ending are just plain stupid. If you want an ending thats equally as stupid, watch Star Trek Voyagers: Threshold.<br /><br />4: The plot is a dime a dozen, people off to save us from our mistakes and sins of some kind or another. Don't believe me, count how many movies you've seen where nukes save the day?<br /><br />I could go on, but thinking about this movie is infuriating and probably damaging my braincells.
