Dennis the Menace is a great hilarious movie. The music composed by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith is perfect especially for the scene when we fist see Christopher Lloyd. The cast is great and it was great seeing Llyod and Lea Thomson in the same film again ala the Back to the Future trilogy.Walter Matthau,Joan Plowright,and Paul Winfield were very good and I think it was a fine choice of putting Mason Gamble for the menace job as Dennis. The film has non-stop laughs especially the scenes with Matthau and I just love the scene when the end credits are playing.If you want to laugh look no further than Dennis the Menace!
