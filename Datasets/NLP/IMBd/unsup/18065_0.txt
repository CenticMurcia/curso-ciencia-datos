First of all people who rate this movie by comparing it to the Godfather, are just plain idiots. A comedy is valued on the laughs it produces and this movie delivers funny scene after funny scene. Most comedy based movies ruin the one really funny scene by showing it over and over again in its trailor. This movie has too many gut blasting laughs to spoil any one part. This is easily my favorite comedy on pure pound for pound most laughs. Favorite Scene= Lloyd sells petey to the blind kid
