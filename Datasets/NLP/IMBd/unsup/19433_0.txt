First don't be turned off by what you see when you Goolge search this Anime title. The show is very well done. Even though there is a tone of violence (I'm talking extreme R rated gore) and nudity (not sex related) the show is very well done. If you are knew to anime this is also a good show. It is more 'down to Earth' then most other anime. Not having magic, flying, super heroes in space, etc. Though some imagination is required.<br /><br />Again don't be turned off by what you see when you search on Google Image, the show is very deep and well done.<br /><br />The Enlgish voice acting is well done also.
