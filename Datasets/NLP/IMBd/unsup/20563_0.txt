Minority Report is a fine example of well told science fiction. The Sci-Fi genre has often been ridiculed because of the great number of hacks that have infested it, but fortunately there are often refreshingly intelligent and well-related stories like this one is.<br /><br />It deals with some time travel paradoxes, which is always a strong cornerstone that provides an enormous amount of creative license for the writer. This movie taps those resources with ingenuity and vision, and takes the viewer to a futuristic world where a crime is punished before it's committed. This unique premise gives the writer room to explore social issues and implications of this practice. Certainly a metaphor for our current justice system is hidden just below the surface.<br /><br />As far as plain entertainment value goes, it delivers here also. The action never stops, the plot unfolds with precision, and innovative camera shots are utilized for both stark and surreal imagery.<br /><br />The only beef here is a weakness in the casting. Most of the cast are up to their roles, well enough to make the hackting of Tom Cruise less of a distraction than it might have been, considering he plays the lead. It seems in most of his movies, the director makes sure to have accomplished actors to counter balance the Cruiser's dramatic shortcomings. He has almost become invisible in his own movies, which can only be a good thing for the movie makers and audience.<br /><br />In spite of the poor lead actor, this is an outstanding film. Highly recommended.
