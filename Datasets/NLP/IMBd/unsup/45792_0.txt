Highlander: The Source takes place in the near future, in Eastern Europe that is going to hell with crime, gangs and riots.<br /><br />The first thing that comes to mind watching this movie is that is must have been a fan-flic. And not from fans of the actual movies, but rather from the series instead, which was mildly entertaining but had no real story to it.<br /><br />The same goes for Highlander: The Source. It's mildly entertaining, and has no real story. The whole concept of the previous highlander movies is bypassed, but thankfully they still keep enough sense to not mess up the time line for the other movies, of which one is set in the future. Of course this also means more predictability in the already thin script.<br /><br />The acting is far from convincing, there are some decently choreographed, but poorly executed fighting scenes to be found, and a very unlikely scenario sketched, to force a reason for this movie, that follows up on a series that, well, is already pretty much done and finished. The story has been told, making stuff up "along the way", especially the way it is done for this movie, doesn't really make for a very convincing or interesting movie. A low scorer, and not recommended for anything but maybe a matin√©e movie to entertain some adolescent kids..
