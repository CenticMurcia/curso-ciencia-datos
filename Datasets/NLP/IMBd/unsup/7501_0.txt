Well, the first time I've seen this film was 7 years ago. I actually watched this film around 5 times. This is my favourite film ever. I love Maria Medeiro's performance, she's a very good actress. Uma Thurman was incredible here as June. A film full of erotic experiences, Anais and Hugo, her husband, then with June, experiencing a lesbian relationship and finally with Henry... She was eager to have new experiences, and she did it. But what I was enjoying the most was music as well. A very interesting film and a very attractive soundtrack. I really like as well how they captured that interesting and bohemian atmosphere. By the way, what is the name of the song at 1h and 28m ??? Many thanks!
