In the wake of destruction, the world falls into silence, and memories of those lost flicker across flames, whispers in bleeding hearts, and love taken rises up to heaven to tell of how they lived and how they will never be forgotten. But how do you live after something like this? How does the heart heal, and how do you let go? How do you live, and would you ever be able to love again? <br /><br />Love is the perfect memory that clings to your heart when the world is brought to its knees, and life refuses to surrender. Jagged pieces of what would never be again cuts deep, but time fights to pull it back together. And the world finds a way to rise up once more, and the heart rebuilds. But love might be denied, and love lost may be found. And the strength of one woman in her darkest hour lights up through the tremendous talent of Michelle Williams, and the fires of drama burn bright. And the intensity of the heart grips us deep in this chilling movie, Incendiary.
