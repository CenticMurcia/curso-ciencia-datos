Roger Adams (Cary Grant), a newspaperman, meets and falls in love at first sight with Julie Gardiner (Irene Dunne), a young woman who works in a record store. A whirlwind romance follows shortly thereafter and eventually the two end up quickly marrying before Roger leaves to be a foreign correspondent in Japan. Soon we learn Julie is with child and all seems happy until something unexpected takes that away from them. Shortly thereafter, the couple returns to the USA and Roger starts publishing a brand new newspaper in a small country town but they still find something sorely lacking in their lives and ultimately decide what they need is to adopt a child which presents many unexpected challenges and hurdles by no means easy to overcome.<br /><br />This soap opera/romance is one that's sure to appeal to most female viewers but really everyone will be able to relate. Music plays a key role here working as a sort of trigger to our heroine's memories which establish each new setting and unique emotional challenge that awaits our newly married couple in their desire to start a family. The music is very well chosen and accentuates every scene in which it appears. In the end, this one proves a real tearjerker and if you're something of a softie, it may cause the tears to roll down your cheeks so some may want to have tissues on hand if they watch this. Cary Grant, actually nominated for an Oscar for his role here, and Irene Dunne both prove superb leads who very effectively get the audience to really care about and feel for what happens to their characters. I have to admit, I'm not usually one attracted to this type of movie, but finding a copy of it relatively cheap, I decided to check it out and I was very impressed with it in terms of the attention paid to establishing romantic settings, building character relationships, presenting realistic hurdles and challenges for our lead couple to overcome and most of all for its ability to send an audience through a real roller-coaster ride of emotions.
