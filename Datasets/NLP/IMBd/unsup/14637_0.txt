The most sensitive romance enacted by Bollywood. Fanaa is the epitome of elegant love story brought alive by the two world class and best ever actors in Bollywood, Kajol and Aamir Khan.<br /><br />All the scenes by Aamir and Kajol, which represents the majority of the movie, are worth repeating watching on the big screen. Their scenes tugs your heart in happiness, regrets, hopes, sadness, helplessness and so on.<br /><br />Little flaws in the narration of the movie (which are basically negligible, compared to other Bollywood flicks and even many of Hollywood flicks) are forgiven by the powerful yet very subtle act by the two actors.<br /><br />Excellent, go watch it.
