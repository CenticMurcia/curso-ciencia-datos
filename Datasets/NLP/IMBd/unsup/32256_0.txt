Well, this movies doesn't have stolen scenes but they do have some stolen ideas from other movies. So here we go...<br /><br />A doctor in the movie finds some bones but a mad scientist wants to clone it so he can create a perfect war-machine. The beast is inside a cage like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. And the dude who is taking care of the computer system is a black dude smoking just like Samuel L. Jackson in JP...<br /><br />Then the beast escapes. It looks like Alien but it can do everything that Predator can. You see? But the best part is the helicopter scene. Man, I laughed a lot, the worst special effect ever!!<br /><br />Rating 1-10: 2<br /><br />A bad movie but I really recommend this movie if you like b-movies. :D
