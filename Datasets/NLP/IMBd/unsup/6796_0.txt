Before you start viewing an early Chuck Norris flick, you certainly don't have particularly high expectations; you just want to kill two hours painlessly. "Forced Vengeance" is an utterly predictable, formulaic, often boring action film, yet it generally accomplishes its mission. Norris is as stiff as ever, of course, and there are plenty of hokey fight sequences, often filmed in slow-motion, although I can't quite understand the necessity of that "gimmick".
