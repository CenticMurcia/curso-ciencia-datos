This is quite an accomplishment for a no-budget film. Good acting (not a common no- budget commodity), beautiful, intelligent and 3-dimensional women and quirky philosophies that really make you think.<br /><br />You should check out this movie for yourself, especially if you like CLERKS and guy-trying- to-figure-life-out-while-sleeping-gorgeous-funny-women-along-the-way type films. A funnier, fun SIDEWAYS.<br /><br />In sum (10 lines required, here): It's funny It's smart It's inspiring to filmmakers who believe a good story, along with support from competent actors and DP's and friends and crafty, is all you need.
