I didn't think it was possible, but "Evil Dead II" surpasses the original in nearly every way. It's scary, it's gory and lastly, it's hilarious. It's pure, inspired comic mayhem and madness for 80 minutes straight! It's no secret director Sam Raimi loves to torment star Bruce Campbell, putting him through the most grueling experience an actor should ever go through. Essentially, it's a sequel/remake of the first film, and Ash (Campbell) is once again battling the forces of the dead, which have been resurrected by the reading of passages from the dreaded "Book of the Dead." But unlike the first movie, the "Three Stooges"-type humor is rampant and outright, and it makes this entry deserving. The funniest scene of all is Ash having to sever his possessed hand, of course after it literally beat the living crap out of him. Not to be missed. 10/10
