Judy Berlin is a unique independent film and stands out also because it was the final film of the late and great Madeline Kahn. <br /><br />Filmed in black and white and directed by Eric Mendelson, I was actually an extra in the diner scene with Edie Falco and Aaron Harnick. You don't actually see me, because Iam far off from the scene. I met Edie and she was very nice. A good friend of mine is her first cousin. I was hoping to finally meet Madeline Kahn, but she wasn't in the scene they were filming that day. Even Edie was disappointed she didn't have any scenes with her in the whole movie. The rest of the cast is so great. Bob Dishy, Barbara Barrie, Julie Kavner, Anne Meara and the rest all are a pleasure to watch. It was filmed here in New York, all over Long Island. The film is funny and so bittersweet. It played all the film festivals in 1999 and was officially released in 2000. Madeline Kahn passed away in December of 1999, so it was released 2 months after. Even though she didn't live to see the year 2000 she has this one remarkable film for her only movie of the 21st century. If she had lived, she may have won an academy award for her outstanding performance. Watch it and you see if she wasn't Oscar worthy.<br /><br />The DVD has some great deleted scenes too. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should really give it a try. Its not a big budget comedy or drama, just a small independent film with a big name cast of pros. I have to say though this is the perfect film for us to remember the wonderful and beautiful and the very multi-talented star Madeline Kahn.
