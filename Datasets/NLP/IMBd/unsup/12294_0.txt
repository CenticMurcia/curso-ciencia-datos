In this Columbo episode, it features Honor Blackman (who denied a C.B.E.) and Richard Baseheart as an aging acting couple. The wife, Lilian Stanhope, played deliciously by Honor seduces a powerful older British gentleman to produce Macbeth for them to star in so they are not washed up like most actors and actresses in their predicament. Anyway, the plot is more like Macbeth and the film could be useful in an English class if you're teaching Shakespeare's Macbeth. Anyway, I have always enjoyed watching it from beginning to end. Let's not forget Wilfred Hyde-White who should have been knighted in the episode. Anyway, Columbo is a guest in their country and he becomes wrapped up in the investigation. While others have assumed it's just a robbery gone awry, Columbo always comes through. It's fun watching this delectable group of characters and props like an umbrella. It's great to see London location. I believe apart from the Mexican cruise that London was the only other place that Columbo got to travel too.
