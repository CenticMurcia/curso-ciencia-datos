It is neat to share in Holmes' American adventure and Watson's observations of American life. A historic view of Washington buildings is also interesting. Can watch several times.<br /><br />I particularly enjoy the scenes on the train in the US where Holmes determines the location of the various people while Watson acts out who they are.<br /><br />I also enjoy the way the story deals with the aspects of the British courier/ secret agent, Alfred Pettibone, of Parlow, Nash, Parlow. The scenes at his apartment where Holmes figures out why they need to go to America, the scene where Pettibone is getting on the plane and when abducted on the train are well done and entertaining. I thought the story moves along better than most of the others in this series.
