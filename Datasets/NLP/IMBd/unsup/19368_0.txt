If you like silent movies & watch a lot of them, you'll probably enjoy this masterpiece made by movie icon Charlie Chaplin...I bet even non-Chaplin fan would like this movie.<br /><br />With all the problems he had on & outside the set, we have to give Chaplin the credit he deserves! He was going through a divorce, had to stop filming...& even hide the film to avoid his wife to destroy it. Even the set was destroyed...How lucky are we ?!<br /><br />City Lights opens with some kind of weird talking so I enjoyed The Circus even more because it's the last silent film Chaplin made. The last scene really is something to remember. You have to see the emotion on Chaplin's face! It's like if it was Chaplin himself who was there instead of the little tramp! We can feel his sadness through the screen, this is incredible! Every time I watched it, I feel this is the last time we see The little tramp as we know him!
