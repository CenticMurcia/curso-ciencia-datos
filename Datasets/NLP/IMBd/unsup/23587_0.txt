Although the acting is, as you would expect, excellent throughout, one scene stands out for me. Lookout for Ed Harris's reaction at the funeral when he learns the truth about Terry. This film also shows what Gary Oldman could do if he sticks to his promise of not playing any more one dimensional bad guy roles.
