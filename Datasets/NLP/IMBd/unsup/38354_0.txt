First off, someone needs to teach Billy Zane what a Canadian accent sounds like.<br /><br />His character is supposed to be from Windsor Ontario, about an hours drive from where I grew up. I don't know anyone who speaks in such a manner.<br /><br />When he does research for his parts, he should go visit the "hometown" of his character to learn the way people speak. He uses the typical "Canadian" accent you see overdone on bad comedic TV.<br /><br />Rest of the movie is standard good guy/bad guy/hero/villain/bungling henchmen movie set in WWII.<br /><br />the special effects are OK for most of the movie, except for the airplanes in the first half of the movie. Should have used real planes instead of CG ones.<br /><br />4 out of 10. I didn't turn it off, but it's not something I'd go to the theater to watch. Good to fill a bored late night, or slow afternoon with.
