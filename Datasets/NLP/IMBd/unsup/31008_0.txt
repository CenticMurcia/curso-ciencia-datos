Let me get straight to the point: 1) This movie is not funny.Nor do its actors 2) This movie is tasteless. In one scene, there is a blonde bimbo rubbing her body with a hamburguer. 3) This movie is plot less. It's a number of re adapted scenes from other movies. 4) AFter seeing this movie you may suffer some health problems.(explosive diharrea) 5) Your sanity may not be the same. 6) You may also feel the worst person on earth, just for having seen the first twenty minutes. I won't say: "don't see this movie". Do as you want, but before doing it, you may consider to check into a nearby hospital. As my title states : "as funny as a high school shooting". Well, that pretty summarizes this horrible, awful, tasteless piece of garbage.
