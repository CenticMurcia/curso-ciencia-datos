I love this movie. It is so cute and heartwarming. Mimi Rodgers's character is sort your everyday average person, as they always are in movies like these. She is also a little aged and has sort-of given up on ever having the life she always wanted or dreamed of. That's what makes it so Christmasy. You get happy and excited for her when her life finally starts unfolding. Of course this movie is cheesy but you can pretty much watch it no matter what mood you're in . When I first recorded it off of ABC or Fox family, something like that; I watched it at least 2 times in a row.I'd love to own it on DVD but they don't even have it @ Best Buy and they have EVERYTHING there!
