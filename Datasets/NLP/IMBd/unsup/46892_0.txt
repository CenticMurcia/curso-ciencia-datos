- I don't know who Alejandro Sessa is, but the Executive Producer on this piece of trash was Roger Corman. Amazons is just another example of the garbage that Corman allowed his name to be attached to in the 80s. Why Roger? Why? <br /><br />- Amazons is almost devoid of any real entertainment. It's boring, dull, and lifeless. The dialogue and action are ridiculous. The "acting" (and I put that word in quotes because I'm not sure it's appropriate to call what these people are doing "acting") is abysmal. And the plot is pointless. The real plot is about having scantily clad women run around with swords - end of story.<br /><br />- So, why do I rate this a 3/10 and not lower? Regardless of how bad it is, I have a soft spot for these 1980s Sword and Sorcerer movies. No matter how bad they are, every four or five years, I rewatch 'em. Sick, huh?
