spoilers ahead!<br /><br />Death Wish is one of those movies about New York in the 70's,when the city was a toilet. Other movies in that era are "the French Connection" and "Taxi Driver".<br /><br />Death Wish is a movie about revenge. Charles Bronson plays Paul Kersey,an architect and a liberal,whose wife and daughter are attacked by muggers(a young Jeff Goldblum!) in a vicious rape scene.His wife dies and his daughter turns into a vegetable. To get away from it all Paul decides to go to Tucson for a job where he meets Jainchill,a redneck from the country. There he shoots a gun or two and on his way home he gets a present from Jainchill,a gun. Back in the Big Apple Paul wants to get even with the muggers and goes on a crusade in New York at Night. He kills muggers in Riverside Park,in an alley,in a subway train and at 8th avenue station. In the Meanwhile inspector Ochoa(Vincent Gardenia) tries to catch this mysterious Vigilante. In the end he catches Paul and orders him to leave NYC.<br /><br />Although the moral of the story is not my way of thinking and although the end is pretty psycho(let Paul loose in another city),it is a very good movie about New York in the 70's. The shots of 1970's New York at Night are beautiful and Charles Bronson gives away a fine performance as an innocent man who becomes a killer.<br /><br />My favorite part about the movie is the soundtrack by Herbie Hancock. each scene has it's own score and doesn't look alike. The rape scene has a dramatic almost horror score while the scenes of Night New York are very quiet and gloomy<br /><br />A shame is that Charles Bronson got a stigma on playing a Vigilante(4 sequels,from which only part 3 is not bad. The others suck.). In the end Death Wish is one of those very good movies that where made in that period,don't look at it from a political point of view but from a movie watching point of view. Then it will good evening entertainment! 9/10
