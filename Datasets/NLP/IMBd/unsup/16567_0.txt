Senseless plot, forgettable characters, and no redeeming value. The only reason it gets a three in my book is because I saw it on a date with the love of my life. Indeed, this is proof positive that even bad films can spawn relationships that last a lifetime! The very idea that someone could actually forgive someone for cheating simply because she sees him riding a horse is simply crazy at best, if it were that easy I'd have bought a horse eons ago! Also, some of the camera angles were interesting at first, but as the plot and the overall content of the film left much to be desired, the angles began to really get on my nerves after a while. Had the film given more in the areas of plot, content, and believable, likable characters, I probably would saying what a innovative genius the director was. Anyways, pop this this one in at 2am after you've missed several buses to dreamland. I guarantee you'll be on the the next bus.
