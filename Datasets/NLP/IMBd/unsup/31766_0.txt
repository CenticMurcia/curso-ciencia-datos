I admit, I thought this was going to be a throw-away film. I have an all-you-can rent membership with Hollywood Video and this was the only new release left on the day I rented this title. I'm a pretty harsh critic of films, so I just knew this was going to be awful. I hadn't read much about Lindsay Lohan (sorry, not of that generation), but I knew she'd been in the news in a bad way some time ago. For the people who rate a film mainly on the actor/actress involved - get a life. Please. Don't troll here. This was a GREAT film. Take a look at my ratings history and you'll see I don't rate movies highly.<br /><br />It's not Grindhouse. It was a lot better. It was almost Memento good. Really. I recommend going into this film with an open mind and you may also end up being pleasantly shocked.
