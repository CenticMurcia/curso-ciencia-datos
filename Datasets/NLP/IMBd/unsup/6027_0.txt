An excellent cast and directing make The Racket a must see for the Silent Movie fan and fans of gangster movies in general. Starring Thomas Meighan as Capt. McQuigg, a no-nonsense police officer in Chicago who does not back down from the Mafia's "Big Boss" Nick Scarsi (played by Louis Wolheim).<br /><br />Nick Scarsi is the leader of the Chicago Mob who has every politician and judge in his hip pocket, and in return for fixing the local election, Scarsi is apparently immune from the long-arm of the law, much to the chagrin of Capt. McQuigg.<br /><br />However, it is a woman named Helen Hayes(played by the beautiful Marie Prevost) that is the undoing of Scarsi, whom refers to women as "poison" several time throughout the film. Helen proved to be the final dose of poison for this underworld boss as she gets him to admit to the killing of a couple of people in front of Capt. McQuigg and the District Attorney.<br /><br />The acting and storyline of The Racket is excellent, and the cast brings believability and conviction to the characters they play.
