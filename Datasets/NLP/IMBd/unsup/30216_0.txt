I saw this short film at the Telluride Film Festival. It was shown in a section with other short films and this was by far the audience favorite. The audience roared with laughter and gave a standing ovation at the end (the ending was really special; the story made sort of a crescendo to the end). It's amazing to me that the writer could tell such a funny story in 10 minutes. Bravo! The story is a very witty take on the age-old adult "peep show" places. The story should not be offensive at all, for men or women, but the humor is geared to adults who have some knowledge of these sorts of places. It's a very funny movie. If you are looking for a hearty laugh, I strongly recommend this one.
