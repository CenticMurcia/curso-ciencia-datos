Wow, this movie can not be described easily.<br /><br />While it is sometimes way too pathetic (american soldiers die too easily), at the very heart, this movie is breathtaking and really painful (due to it's statement) to watch. Between the scenes of war, dying and gore it works well with claustrophobia and the inevitable (you see your fate coming)... And while it gets down to a very personal level, it says so many things about humans, the desire to live, anger, desperation, motivation and war in general .....<br /><br />*Tech* One things that really blew my mind: the tunnel-scenes could have been done by anyone at (almost) no costs!! (Students around? Learn from that, no major explosions needed!) But yet, those scenes where among the most intense, the most unpleasant, painful, desperate and bloody scenes I have ever seen.<br /><br />*War and technology* Besides that, the tunnels and the jungle give a fairly well impression why no technology (so far) was a major help in such a fight - when it came down to man vs. man.....<br /><br />Resume: not your average good-night-movie! + In a movie-theater it soon becomes quite claustrophobic!!
