Well two out of three can kill you these days.But The Rose was set in the late sixty's or early seventy's where drugs were all she really had to worry about.She diden,t.If your a fan of Bette Midlers or Janis Joplin you should love The Rose.Bette Midler Gives an Oscar worthy performance (she was nominated,but Sally Field won for NormaRae)in her first major film role.Rose Foster is a major star in the rock and blues music world But being a great success with a voice that most of the world would kill for is not enough to fill her emptiness.Shes on the booze in the first few frames,the drugs soon follow.Recently relesed on DVD,The Rose is not the feel good movie of 79 or any year but Bette Midler,her voice and her acting talent make this film well worth watching.
