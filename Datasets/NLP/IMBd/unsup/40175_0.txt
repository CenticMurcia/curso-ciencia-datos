I Think yousef shahin should stop making films! I'm afraid he must hang up his boots, i.e, stop rolling. I saw portions of this film, not all of it but its the usual Shahine clich√©s. Shahin still insists on using songs & dances in his films which alienate viewers from the serious continuity of the film, when it exists. The scene where Yehia(Ahmed yehya) is angry and shouting at his mother Ginger(yousra) after finding out his real father is Egyptian (his looks aren't exactly American or Caucasian either) is just another example of cementing notions in the psyche of the audience. Another scene where Yousra-Ginger is confronted by a racial burst of venom that's only to inflame the inferiority complex of many. Some bits seem distant in nature & do not fit but then that could be just me. Casting the new comer Ahmed yehia wasn't a good choice. He can dance but cannot act. The other new comer Yousra Louzy seems quite promising but will she drift into the mainstream Egyptian cinema scene or will she break the mould & do something inventive? only time will tell. Shahin should have stopped those auto biographies years ago, it was OK for a film or two but now it's really boring & tedious. If there aren't any other interesting topics that fascinate him, then his health is obscuring his vision & must stop making films, at least not his biography anymore.
