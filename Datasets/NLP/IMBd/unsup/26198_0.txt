We have only recently discovered this lovely children's show and I am very disappointed to find out it was canceled. What a perfect show for children, I am surprised it hasn't won more awards or acclaim. All the colors and animations are simply and brightly colored. The characters are gentle and well spoken. The world they inhabit is imaginative. The music is perfect. Oswald, the main character, is a large octopus much possessed of patience and kindness.<br /><br />My three year old retains so much from this show I was surprised. She even remained her favorite toy "Catrina" after the baby butterfly. She normally doesn't pay much attention to many shows. If you are looking for a quiet, kind show for your child, I can't recommend it enough.
