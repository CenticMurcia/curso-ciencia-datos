After hearing about this documentary on the right-wing radio show, Steve Brown Etc., I thought that I'd take a look. Was I ever impressed. Essentially, the movie sets out to expose problems within the gay community and their "pride events" in relation to charities. The concept at first glance can make gay people very angry about airing their "dirty laundry" and rightfully so. Robert Labby (one of the main characters) was trying to do a religious activity in the middle of Sadom and Gamora and failed. What I thought was most important was that this seemed to be a continuing theme. In the lesbian wedding segment we see the preacher from the Joy MCC church conducting the ceremony, after himself admitting that he too is gay. I don't know what the filmmaker's intentions were, but inadvertently he's created a wonderful illustration of how lost homosexual culture is, even beyond the typical stereotypes of drug abuse and sex addiction. It shows the culture to be apathetic and having the misplaced arrogance of a petulant child. There is nothing about the movie that reaches for situations where homosexuals illustrate how misguided their lifestyle is, all of it is natural and undoctored.<br /><br />surprisingly, Robert Labby, the gay promoter documented in the film, was the guest on the Steve Brown Show, not any of the filmmakers. This made me curious to see what the movie was about. How could a gay man fighting for gay rights come down so hard on his own people? The answer is very clear if you see Selling Queer.<br /><br />I highly recommend this picture.
