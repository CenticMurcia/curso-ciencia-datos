Yes, what a great adaptation. It really captured the essence of the book; long winded tedium. Well, at least it didn't have the kid wearing flair-pants jeans like you would expect from such drivel that finds it's macram√© sensibilities from that inane decade; the seventies. If it wasn't for the appearance of Jan Decleir -Who is like the only classically trained Actor the Benelux has- I actually would have risen from my seat during the screening, and cried: What am I doin' here! (I viewed the movie-screening with some friends who asked me along) This book stole precious hours of my life, and now I murder time, that I could have spent in the pub. Oh, yes. Alsemus is a wimp by the way, I mean who gets himself killed by a bunch of kids. And if my kid would deliberately loose a soccer match, I would give him high praise.<br /><br />Now I'm going to watch "Lionheart" which is a far superior film about a young man confronted with the harsh realities of the crusades.<br /><br />Yes,of course it is a better film, it's not dutch.
