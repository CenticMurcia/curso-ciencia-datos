who is Set??? i know about Seti and Seth but no Set. Is he even real? this movie doesn't follow history its been proved that Tut was hit in the back of the head and it killed him plus Tut was buried with his his death mask on. Also all pharaoh's were thought of as gods just like Ramses II who declared himself a god. They all thought of Ra as there father. i think if u wish 2 make a movie at least make it the right way. Has any one ever heard of the emerald tablet? i sure haven't. Please correct me if I'm wrong but this movie makes not sense. it like the Da ViNcI cOdE only about Egypt. And what it up with the hellfire council? what is that about? if anyone can tell me email me or I'm me at brat_mya_zoey@yahoo.com
