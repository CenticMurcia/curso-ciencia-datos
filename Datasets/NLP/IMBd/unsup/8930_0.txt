Okay I realize my title is silly, but this really is a terrific flick. Excellent characterization, fabulous script, good build-up of suspense, and really cool/creepy/gross creatures. Since the filmmakers had very little budget, they wisely don't show the creatures in much detail. This makes them all the more horrible and unnerving.<br /><br />Now, I was prepared to like this movie. I LOVE killer rat movies in all their forms, from the really wonderful Willard remake to the godawful but hysterical "Rodentz." But this went WAY beyond a killer rat movie, a zombie movie, a disaster movie, or even a horror movie. It's just flat a GOOD FILM.<br /><br />Go see it while you can!
