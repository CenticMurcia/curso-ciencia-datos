I really enjoyed viewing this film. Although it is in a completely different language and you have to follow it by subtitles, the morals of the film are still clear. The film is about a gay relationship between two men; Yossi and Jagger. They are in the Israeli army and sneak away on several occasions to be together. This changed my opinion on gay relationships completely. I, being a straight person, had never really understood much about gay relationships until I watched this film. The relationships which they form is beautiful and it's only when something tragic happens, Jagger is about to die, that Yossi expresses all his feelings for him. This film will really make you look at a lot of things in a different light as it explores a number of different issues; Gay relationships, unrequited feelings and grieving. I recommend this film to teenagers because there is a lot of different opinions on gay people and it really does make you look at it from a completely different angle.
