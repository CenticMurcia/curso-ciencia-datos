i rather enjoyed this movie, but thinking about it afterwards i thought it was a rather disjointed and hollow movie. <br /><br />woodcock is a teacher, whose teaching style borders on child abuse you see him picking on the small kids, the fat kids and other less than athletic kids. <br /><br />which is fine by me, child abuse is a good subject for a serious movie. bullshit author and victim returns home and learns things about him self and makes teacher see the error of his ways sounds like a good serious movie. <br /><br />turn the child abuse into 'tough but fair teaching' and throw in a few gross out larf scenes and it would have made a good revenge comedy. <br /><br />BUT this movie tries to be both a comedy AND a serious movie, and fails in both guises it fails to be a comedy because the subject is way to serious, and it fails to be a serious movie because woodcock is exonerated at the end of the movie.
