This film turned out to be a happy finding. The creators of this Mexican movie seemed well attuned to the modern way of life in the big city. Not having a clue as to what to expect, it turned out to be a good way to spend an evening in which all other film prospects didn't seem interesting enough.<br /><br />Susana and Carlos have been married for a while. They have two children and both work. Carlos, whose job involves long hours, hardly has time for his family. As the film starts, everything comes to a head when he arrives home late one night. No sooner is he in, when his cellular phone rings. It's his boss calling. Susana, who feels Carlos spends too much of his time at home talking to his boss, takes his phone away from him. As things get uglier, Carlos agrees to leave. It appears that as a couple, they have come to a dead end because Carlos believes his job is too important.<br /><br />Carlos, who has taken a small house, realizes he can't do anything on his own. Most of the work at home is done by Susana. Carlos is assigned a new assistant who evidently thinks she can take him to bed. Susana, on the other hand, is encouraged by her colleague at work to see other men. When she agrees to do so, it turns out that the man she has chosen is gay. Both Carlos and Susana come to realize, that in spite of their differences, they were meant for each other.<br /><br />Rafael Montero, the director of "Cilantro y Peregil" did a marvelous job with this quick paced comedy. The writing is by Cecilia Perez Grovas and Carolina Rivera, two women that have an ear for the way people live in these frantic times.<br /><br />Damian Bichir, who we had admired in other Mexican films, does an excellent job as Carlos, the harried executive whose life is altered when Susana asks him to leave their home. Arcelia Ramirez makes a wonderful Susana. She is a resourceful actress with a dark beauty that matches her character. Rodolfo Dehesa appears as a psychiatrist who speaks to the camera about modern relationships with humor and it shows he can't even help himself.<br /><br />Rafael Montero shows a talent for his direction of this sunny comedy.
