This show never caught on and I'll never know why. The writing was crisp and witty. THe cast was excellent and it was only 30 minutes long. Their half hour has been replaced by news which to me shows the lack of interest in keeping daytime television especially dramas like Ryan's Hope on the air. Claire Labine who lives in Brooklyn, New york was one of the major writers of this show. I don't recall it ever being outrageous but it reminded me of the British soaps where it was only 30 minutes long and there was a bar. Helen Gallagher played the matriarch and she is still a fabulous actress who has done television, stage, and films as well. Other cast members were Nancy Addison who passed away so young and Ilene Kristen now on One Life to Live. The show is gone but not forgotten in my opinion. It was one of those shows that should have gone on forever as well but I guess ABC thought it was expendable. Too bad, people out there would have enjoyed a nice written show like this. Since they were set in NEw York (big cities as settings don't fair well on soaps except Bold and the Beautiful), they also went out on the streets of the city to shoot. It was great to see.
