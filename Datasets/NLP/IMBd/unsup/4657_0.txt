Every now and then a remarkable small film is made. The recent "Venus" starring Peter O'Toole is one. Irina Palm is also one.<br /><br />This is a story of a middle-aged woman (Maggie, played by Marianne Faithful) worn down by sadness. She must get hold of a substantial amount of money. Forced by necessity and desperation Maggie does something that is at first utterly alien to her, but may yet become an awakening and salvation, a route to an identity she does not know she has and to new love.<br /><br />Marianne Faithful's central performance is hugely affecting in its undecorated stillness and simplicity. This film is a cut above so many bigger releases. If you like a small story well-told it is for you.
