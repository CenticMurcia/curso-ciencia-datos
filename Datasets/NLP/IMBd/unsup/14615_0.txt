I have been neglecting my reviewing duties and so haven't gotten around to doing one for the finale until now. And wow, what a finale it was. *bows to the creative genius of Kripke and co.* The reintroducal of Ava and Andy was brilliant, and they worked brilliantly against the two new characters also. This is one of those brilliant but oh so sad eps. We got to see Ava and Andy again, but then had to say goodbye to them *sniff* I totally didn't see the whole evil Ava coming....and neither did Andy it would seem. Ava was a great special guest, which is why i was sad to see her go too, even with her new found evil character self. And if loosing Andy and Ava wasn't enough, we also had to say goodbye to Ash!? I loved his character and took it pretty hard. Excellent use of him brining in a big secret though, and then dying before revealing it. A definite way of keeping the mystery about the show. And the hands down saddest moment of supernatural so far.....Sammys death. We all know he was going to be brought back to life because you know, whats supernatural without dean AND Sam?! But it was still one of those heart wrenching moments which had me in tears (im a girl, its OK to cry at supernatural....saying that though i defy even a boy to not cry at that scene!). Especially that heart tearing 'SAM' from Dean. Got me right in the gut that one. oh before i go, i loved the whole dean having a vision thing, and his whole 'bring me some pie' routine in the beginning. It reflects the brilliance of the supernatural team when even during the most tense and saddening finale, they can still manage to inject some humour to keep things from becoming emo sad. (no offence meant) also round of applause for Jensen's comic timing which turns brilliant writing into fantastic delivery! awesome, that is the word i would use to sum up All hell breaks loose part 1! XsarahX make sure y'all watch it!
