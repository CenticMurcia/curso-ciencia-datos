Where do I begin talking about a show that was unrelentingly bad on so many levels ? The characters seemed to be motivated by Brownian motion. The series pseudo-science made no sense (space sonar ?! Sonar, by definition is based on sound waves, which cannot be propagated through the vacuum of space). Even the Star Trek fans were mocking this one.<br /><br />Linda Hunt was supposed to add some gravitas to the cast . Poor Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was asked to act but was given only a costume, not a character. <br /><br />This series was so bad I was expecting the credits to say "A Bialystock Production".<br /><br />I forced myself to watch all 4 episodes that aired in the US. When I'm lying on my deathbed I'm sure I'll wish I could have those 4 hours back.
