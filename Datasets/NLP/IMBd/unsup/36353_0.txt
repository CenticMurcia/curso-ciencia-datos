Recap: Life is looking good for Robinson and his fianc√©e Elizabeth. But one day everything changes. Elizabeth is out riding in the hills and witnesses the brutal murders of a whole group of young women by trafficking mobster Dolan. Dolan is known for getting rid of all competition and threats but Elizabeth is determined to witness. Despite getting protection from the FBI Dolan manages to murder her and Robinson goes on a quest for revenge. But Dolan's car, a Cadillac, is a fortress in itself, armored and bulletproof, so Robinson must think of something special.<br /><br />Comments: A rather bad movie that actually is rather hard to put into a genre. It got a little action but not enough to make it an action. It is probably supposed to be a thriller, but it doesn't got much of suspense. And it certainly isn't a romance, comedy or drama. It got a little of everything, but it is nothing in the end.<br /><br />The story is very simple and divided into three parts. First, the setup. Show the happy couple, kill the girl and give proper motivation for Robinson's quest. Then, the plot. This is where Robinson plans his special revenge, which plays out by him working as a road-worker. Not very exciting at all. And last, the revenge. Which is not very exciting either, because it is very single sided. Oh, I'm sure Robinson got a kick out of it, but to watch it. Nah.<br /><br />Unfortunately, but not very surprising, the acting is nothing to remember either. Well, I suppose there wasn't much to do with the material at hand, but still. The cast is mostly unknown, to me at least, with the exception of Slater. I have higher expectations on him, although his recent work doesn't promise much. Vaugier was the only one that showed some promise, and I hope she gets another shot.<br /><br />In conclusion, not a good movie, but not too bad either. Nothing to remember, and there are many better movies out there.<br /><br />4/10
