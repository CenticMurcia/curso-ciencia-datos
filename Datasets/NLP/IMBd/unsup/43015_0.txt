This film is more or less waste of time to watch. It has such a thin and simple storyline that it is an insult to any person over 3 years old. The character building is non-existing, with some of the actors trying so badly to make up for the lack of dialog or decent scenes, that it is just painful to watch. 95% of the film takes place in about 300 sqm area, mostly all within one building. The inconsistency in regards to how the "Ghosts of Mars" actually operate or affect people is obvious, making them anything but scary. What I would like to say though is that based on what the actors had to work with (horrible script, compressed location, undefined enemy etc.), Natasha Henstridge and Ice Cube did a pretty good job. But seeing a great actress as Pam Grier in this was sad - and I wouldn't be surprised if she will remember this as one of her worst career choice ever! However, the biggest problem with this film, is that you don't care about anyone or anything in it, which in "horror" movies is a must. I give it 4 out of 10 but only for some good visual effect, and due to my love of sci-fi films in general.
