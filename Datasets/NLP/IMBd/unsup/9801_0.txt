As an evenings entertainment this film is intriguing viewing, as a valid look at what happened on 911 this film flounders in a mire of its own making.<br /><br />The point of the film is that something other than the official story occurred on 911. According to this film the planes that hit the World Trade Center were not the planes we were told, that a missile hit the Pentagon, flight 93 was shot down, that some or all of the planes were off loaded and the people may still be alive, the collapse of the twin towers was the work of demolition not the crashes, and that there is some grand conspiracy behind it all.<br /><br />Its an intriguing idea, or series of them. The problem is that not a great deal of it really hangs together, at least not in the way that is presented here. Could it be possible? yes, but not with what we are given as evidence.<br /><br />There is little real expert testimony. We only get snippets from other sources. No real expert in any field is interviewed. (which is important when it comes to construction of the Twin Towers since they were unlike any other building that they are compared to when they talk about fires in steel buildings) We are only given statements, usually one line from someone, we don't know anything about other than a title, about things they may or may not know about.<br /><br />Every person who saw anything is accorded equal weight (a woman who appears to be watching events from Brooklyn or lower Manhattan, far from the towers, is heard to say that the plane crashing into the tower isn't American so therefore its not American.) Everyone is seen to be telling the truth at all times. A miss quote of President Bush is seen as proof of something other than as a mistake. The filmmakers also take every news report as gospel truth with a report of the blowing up of one of the towers roofs being portrayed as true when the footage shows its not There is no room for any error in any news footage, its not an error but signs of the conspiracy.<br /><br />The evidence in one sequence of pictures is forgotten when discussing another so that the evidence of the planes that hit the towers being commercial airlines from some shots is dismissed because its not clear in others. (also the phone report of one eyewitness that is contradicted by photographic evidence is given a great deal of weight) And at times the film throws things out-like the off loading of passengers, but gives no evidence as to why this may have happened or what happened to the people. You can't make claims if you don't back them up. Likewise unexplained is talk of a conspiracy that it has no shred of evidence as to who or what is behind it. You need to tell me more than just "they are behind it". Tell me who "They" are It really annoys me because as long as you don't think about what the film is saying or the inconsistent stories its spinning this is a really well done piece of film making. Frankly I could almost believe its stories, except that none of them make any real sense when you stop to think about them.<br /><br />Worth a look, with a large grain of salt, simply because it lays out the alleged conspiracy many people feel is real. Fortunately or unfortunately it fails to make its case because its evidence is severely lacking.
