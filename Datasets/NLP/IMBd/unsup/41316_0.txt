Where to begin. Firstly I would like to point out that the "spoiler alert" will spoil nothing as it was already spoiled when it was made.<br /><br />SUMMARY Overall this movie is defiantly NOT WORTH IT! I would NEVER watch it again. I would NEVER recommend it to anyone either. DO NOT be fooled by the tittle or cover.<br /><br />PLOT This movie is not entirely bad. I think the last comment wrote on this said it was based on a book. I'm not too sure about that but I do like the idea of the film. It was a good storyline. Although it seemed to me like the film would have only run for about 40 minutes but they decided that instead of adding more on they have just drag everything out. There was little dialog through the film and when there was you almost wish there wasn't. The whole film was almost like a bunch of kids had done it. You can't really blame the actors when the actual script is that bad.<br /><br />CAMERA QUALITY As soon as the movie starts you can tell it was not properly done. The filming quality was very poor. The movie dragged on and on. Considering it only runs for 80 minutes it feels a lot longer then that. <br /><br />GORE When I picked up the DVD the title and the cover was rather catchy. I love gory movies and I am interested in cannibalism. I was extremely disappointed to find that the movie merely touches cannibalism and the gore was Extremely fake! The "blood" has literally stuck to her face. It was way too thick and didn't even drip. The body parts were also very fake. My boyfriend works on films, particularly war movies so its not like I have no clue what I am on about. I've seen a lot of blood work they have done and it is so much better then this. Where to begin.
