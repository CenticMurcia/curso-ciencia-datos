"Witness the Resurrection"-Alien:Resurrection (1997)<br /><br />"Herbie's back in a Brand new movie!"-The Love Bug (1997)<br /><br />The tag lines of the worst movies of '97...with the same meaning.<br /><br />The first thing what I want to say, I am A REALLY BIG FAN of Herbie 'cause I was grow up on his films, I loved the jokes the tricks, the music and the characters-even the evil ones-and I'll love the "Herbie Movies" as long as I live.<br /><br />But NOT THIS waste of celluloid. This movie is stupid, pesky, and bad as "Alien:Resurrection".<br /><br />Why? Because the story is VERY stupid, the characters are simply idiots-professor Stumpfel(?!)-and the theme music is pesky, just like in "Alien:Resurrection". <br /><br />And the worst thing in the whole movie: Horace, The Evil Twin of Herbie. Laughably Stupid. Just like the "Newborn-Alien" in "Alien:Resurrection".<br /><br />And, the genesis of Herbie. Stupid! I mean who's idea was , Herbie was build by a German SCIENTIST, AND HE HAS GOT HIS "SOUL" FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH OF STUMPFEL'S GIRLFRIEND, WHAT FALLED INTO THE MELTING-POT?! BAD! And of course they've needed to build-again Herbie, It's the synonym of cloning Ripley, ain't? And the music, the music, the music, where is the good old "Herbie Theme" by George Bruns? Now We get only a corny, pesky, SILLY, BAD music. And where are the good old characters like Tennessee Steinmetz(Buddy Hackett) or Wheely Applegate(Don Knotts) or anybody from the original stuff?<br /><br />THE ORIGINAL IS ALWAYS THE BEST!<br /><br />So, if you are a Herbie-fan,or you just like Herbie movies, watch the old ones.<br /><br />1/10- STUPID plot; BAD music; BAD characters.
