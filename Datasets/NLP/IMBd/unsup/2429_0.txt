My ASL teacher played this movie for the class. I am taking a 2nd year signing course in high school. When I first heard about it, it didn't appeal to me that much. You know what they say though, don't judge a film by its summary. It's the content that matters *wink*. It was rather inspiring to me after I had watched it all the way through. I found it interesting in the way the late 1930's society was depicted in the treatment of Deaf people. It comes to show how far the Deaf community has progressed in the past seventy years. The actors were excellently portrayed. I hope everyone interested in ASL, taking ASL, or late Depression films gets to see this one.
