The acting is amongst some of the worst I've seen in a while, especially from Dennis Rodman. What's that Dennis Rodman a bad actor? Yes! and as hard as it is to believe his 'hilarious' sidekick Nick is almost as bad! Not to mention annoying. I'm not just talking Jar-Jar Binks annoying here, he takes it to a whole new level! <br /><br />The one redeeming feature about this movie is that some of the action seqences are quite well done. But good action scenes does not a good movie make.<br /><br />If you like bad acting, bad dialouge and wasting your time then by all means watch this. You won't be dissapointed!
