I agree with the previous reviewers that "Mu Zan E" is the nastiest and most disturbing piece of filth made by Japanese exploitation master Daisuke Yamanouchi. The film is often shot with hand-held camera that gives it a truly dirty and slimy look. Yuki Emoto plays a reporter in search of the snuff movies. During her investigation she meets a bunch of fetish/porno film-makers and finally she herself becomes a victim of merciless snuff gang. Plenty of sickening gore, sexual violence and menstrual sex for fans of such misanthropic sickness. Still the acting is fairly good and the climax is sadistically surprising. For fans of Japanese transgressions I'd also recommend "Flesh Meat Doll" series, "Niku Daruma", "Raping My Virgin Slave", "Death Woman", "Squirmfest" and some nasty Nikkatsu pinku eiga.
