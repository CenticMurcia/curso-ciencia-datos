<br /><br />I don't know about some of you people, but this is the most interesting phantasm yet. Sure, there isn't enough violence or gore, but that is the way that it was intended to be. This was supposed to be the final fling, and its supposed to explain a,lot of things, and it has. The plot is just hard to explain, and it's very complex. It seems that some of you can't see that and just write it off as being dumb. Well, you have to have a little bit of intelligence to understand the series, so don't even try understand if you can't.
