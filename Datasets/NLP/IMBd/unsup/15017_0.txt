Hello, My husband and I and our five kids were one of the featured families on this documentary. I just want to say after reading some of the "critics" responses to this documentary if you ever wondered about what exactly a gay family is this is the documentary to see. Not because we were in it but for a very important reason. Instead of "set" ups where they asked a bunch of personal questions of the families they let us just be ourselves and to tell you the truth most of the time we had forgotten the camera people were even around. This was the first of its kind and Rosie and her wife Kelli and Gregg put together an experience for not only gay families but gay friendly families that will be in our memories for ever. Being able to cruise with our kids knowing we are safe with other families just like ours was amazing. We were very blessed to be on the first cruise ever of its kind like this and have enjoyed each year after that on this cruise. This documentary educated me as well, there were so many different sides of the gay community that people just do not get to see because the media usually portrays the GLBT community just in one light from our gay pride parades and you never see the families. This documentary gave gay families voices for the first time.
