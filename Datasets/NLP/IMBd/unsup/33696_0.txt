I love sit-coms and am always looking for a new one to enjoy. Finding "My Boys" wasn't a choice, it was hyped for months and I was looking forward to watching it. After seeing the show I realized it obviously wasn't good enough for network television and that is probably why it ended up on TBS. I usually enjoy the more intelligent sit-coms but also enjoy some of the stupid ones. I rated My Boys a 2 out of 10. I found it to be very dull, boring and disappointing. After all the hype I thought it would at least be mildly humorous but I was wrong. It was awful. The only thing as bad is perhaps Saturday Night Live during the Tina Fey years.
