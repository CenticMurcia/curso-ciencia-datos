I loved this documentary. Our people around the world are entering a new age of equality but there is still a struggle in securing more equality and retaining the gains that we have already made. This film covers that struggle in Massachusetts and documents the great efforts made by so many people in defending their right to be treated as valued and equal human beings. It's easy for an LGBT audience to be drawn into this and feel it personally. Told from a Queer perspective, the film makers have tried to incorporate all points of view in a fair and real way, showing those on both sides of the argument. It puts a human face on same-sex marriage, profiling several weddings and focussing too on some same-sex headed families. From high points when we see both lovely long-term and youthful couples exchanging vows and the election of a gay man to the Massachusetts Parliament, to low points where an elected official of that same government forthrightly denies historical injustices against LGBT people and contemporary realities of abuse, harassment, discrimination and worse, and finishing on the sad reality that bigotry still prevails in much of the American public, a bigotry which could strip same-sex couples of this right, I recommend that everyone with an opinion on same-sex marriage view this.
