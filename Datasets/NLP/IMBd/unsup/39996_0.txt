The story goes about 5 young people taking a trip to some hidden beaches in Mexico. it seems like there are some weird weird things going on at that beach, and it seems like our 5 young hero's have just landed in the middle of that...<br /><br />Just watched this movie, and i could say, its a bit disappointing... low budget and bad acting really didn't give this movie the right push. the story line was far from complete with useless characters in it. the scenes are just to messy. the camera shakes far too much witch just don't give you the change to see the movie probably. Most of the time i just had to wait till the scene was over to find out what just happened, and that doesn't have to do anything with the storyline. hence, at the end of the movie, i didn't even remember the main characters name's. The end is very strange to, its like the movie just stopped in the middle of the plot.
