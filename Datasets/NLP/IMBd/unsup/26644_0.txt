I rarely write reviews but after just seeing this, I thought that I couldn't leave the experience behind without commenting...<br /><br />'Night On Earth' unleashed the whole array of emotions for me to experience. After watching so many movies (often one or two per day) I thought I had grown numb to feel that in any motion picture.. This piece of art proved otherwise, thankfully.<br /><br />Personally I loved the New York segment and thought that it was the best of them all. That said, one of the very few negative things was Sakari Kuosmanen's performance in the Helsinki segment (the talking drunk in the backseat). He is not a very good choice to act in such a tragic piece.<br /><br />All in all, I loved this movie. It is actually probably the best one I've seen in years. So watch it.
