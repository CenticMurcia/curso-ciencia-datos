I love this film, truly I do. It's an adorable charmer, a cheery, bright, silly comedy with a tangible family chemistry and a really goofy sense of humour. I love Charles Grodin  check out his dancing, or his scream of "Puppyyyynoooo!" Bonnie Hunt is just delightful. I love Beethoven and his girlfriend watching a movie, complete with popcorn. Later, they go for a ride in a rickshaw! I love the eating contest, including the part where the film speeds up! I love Chris Penn getting his head stuck in a tree trunk. I'm laughing out loud just thinking about this stuff. 'Beethoven's 2nd' is so daft it's practically a cartoon, and that's where its appeal lies. Everyone looks like they're having fun and they all seem to be on the same page. What a corker.
