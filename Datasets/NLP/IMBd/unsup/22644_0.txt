After about five minutes of this film starting I felt compelled to empty the contents of my stomach onto my designer coffe table. No plot (to speak of). Some of the worst acting I have ever seen. It was all I could do to stop myself from destroying the video tape to prevent anyone else falling into the same trap as I did.<br /><br />Very poor indeed.
