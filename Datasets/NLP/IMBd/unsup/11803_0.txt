It was a decently good movie. Decently well put together. I mean at first I thought this was about war and terrorism, but its not, its more about the story. Its a thriller that you want to see to the end, and it got me on that, once I got past the first 15-20mins, I was interested to see what ends up in the story. It's not predicable, which is good. But the actual end scene (spoiler part) bothers me. If you have the president of the united states kidnapped in the back of your ambulance and see a kid in the middle of the street; if you know that if you swerve you're going to tip the ambulance, then you run over the kid, the damn kidnapped president of the united states is in the back of your ambulance, one kid in the street ain't sh*t.
