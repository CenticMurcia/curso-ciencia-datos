This is a fantastic episode filled with top of the line quality special-effects which introduces the crew of the Enterprise-D to a being called "The Traveler" who can manipulate time and space throughout the galaxy. The Enterprise-D crew's dilemma in this episode is that there is a warp propulsion specialist by the name of Kozynski who won't admit to the crew even the simplest details in how he can make the warp engines traverse great distances across the known galaxy (Almost infinitely instantaneous and faster than warp speed!).<br /><br />In this episode, Wesley Crusher is discovered to be more than just a mere prodigy who has the potential for a bright future due to his gifted abilities - according to The Traveler. This episode also shows glimpses of Tasha's violent past on Turkana IV, and even an illusion of Jean-Luc Picard's deceased mother Yvette. This episode really showed the great potential of things to come for this fantastic, marvelous show.
