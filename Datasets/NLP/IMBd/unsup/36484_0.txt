'Pervert!' is a mildly amusing 'sexploitation' film that delivers on it's premise fully, creating a film that will probably be hated by anyone who's not a complete heterosexual male pervert. Well, that's not exactly true because even though the film initially had me rolling my eyes over and over, by the end I was actually quite enjoying the movie, as shallow as it may be.<br /><br />On a technical level, 'Pervert!' is a complete catastrophe. The acting ranges from terrible (Mary Carey) to mediocre (Sandeen), the photography and effects are cringe worthy and nothing worth mentioning at all. However, the plot itself isn't too bad, it's just a little thin for an already short movie. I feel the whole thing could have been better suited to a 20-30 minute short piece, with all the filler (random topless women just spliced into the film for no reason whatsoever) cut and trimmed down into what was really funny and integral to the story.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, 'Pervert!' may not be anywhere near being a 'good' film, but it delivers on its shallow premise of gore and sex at least. The film wasn't as funny as it took itself, but I'd rather it was laughing at itself more than it took itself seriously. As a whole, the film is obviously pretty bad -seeing as it revolves around tits- but it at least acknowledges the fact. So in the end I don't really recommend this film in any circumstance except that you may just be looking for mindless filler for 80 minutes. Oh, and of course, it will probably help if you like breasts.
