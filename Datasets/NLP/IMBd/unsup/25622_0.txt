Not only did I see the movie twice already, I must say this is a very original version of the "usual". By usual I mean the fight fought for so long between black and white, South and North...Latinos and Americans. Sergio Arau and his wife Areli envision a LA with no Mexicans, just like the title say. Their sense of humor is fantastic to say the least. I never laughed so hard. They not only succeeded in portraying a truly "lonely" city, chaotic and all but they could also capture the true essence of Latinos which lies in these three words: Tenderness, care and RESPECT. This is not your "typical" movie. You will also love the closing scene and the nice final twist. I think both Latino and Americans alike will enjoy this. Thank you Cristina
