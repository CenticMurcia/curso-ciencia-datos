We are now at a time where every cartoon is to childish for an adult, or to mature for a child. One of the few cartoons still on that both children and adults can watch is The Simpsons, a past one is Futurama. There are some adult references, and some crude humor, but mostly Futurama is a family cartoon. Unlike South Park, or Family Guy (both great shows by the way) Futurama was still very funny, without sex or political jokes. I mean who didn't love watching Fry doing what he does best, being an idiot, or the evil Mom terrorizing Earth, or watching Bender and his alcoholic antics. From the first episode Futurama has you hooked, and you don't get unhooked until the final episode. A great show, that was taken off the air too soon.
