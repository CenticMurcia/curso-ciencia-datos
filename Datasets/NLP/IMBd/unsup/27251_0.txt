This film is offensive, but that isn't the problem. The problem is the tone. The film starts with a very sarcastic and sometimes funny tone, but when the violence starts things get so dark that the movie almost becomes unwatchable. It never earns the dark shift that the latter half, the massacre requires. The audience is suddenly asked to feel bad for these rather idiotic characters (I'm using that term loosely), but instead we really feel nothing, and that is what makes this movie so disgusting. <br /><br />*Spoiler* The death of the Bible Girl, played by Misty Mundae, is probably the worst out of the bunch. Suddenly the killers get this hard, sexual edge, and things just get to dark. When she is finally asked to insert the barrel of a shotgun into her mouth to simulate oral sex, the movie just went to far. The comedy and wit is gone, replaced by a very unnerving and perverted shock. I can normally handle this stuff, but these characters are meant to be high school students, and Misty can actually pass for one. <br /><br />If you want to be offended, you will be, but this film is a mess when it comes to tone. The shifts are to drastic, and in the end, the film just feels sleazy and cheap. I love exploitation films, but this one is a bit to much.
