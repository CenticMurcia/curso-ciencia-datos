THE CIRCUS may well be one of the best of Chaplin's silent comedies, especially enjoyable from the point where he inadvertently becomes the hit of the circus when he pinch hits for someone at the last moment. He gets all the audience laughs from that point on--and deserves it. His clowning here is among his most acrobatic, most physical, and at the same time, there's a bittersweet charm to his romance with one of the lovely circus performers--MERNA KENNEDY.<br /><br />All of the circus stunts are beautifully performed and the story maintains interest as the Little Tramp goes from sudden success to sudden failure--and then back again.<br /><br />HARRY CROCKER is good as the romantic foil for Merna Kennedy, a tightrope walker whose act is later performed with even more daring results by Chaplin in one of his best acts.<br /><br />Altogether delightful romp, with the Little Tramp as a lovable scamp!
