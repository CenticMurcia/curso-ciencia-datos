Tarantino and Rodriguez are two of my favourite directors but this film still left me cold. Maybe it was because I was expecting so much. When I was told about the film it sounded great -four rooms, four directors- two of which I loved. But sadly as is always the case when you expect something brilliant you rarely feel satisfied, and for me this was an extremely unsatisfying film.<br /><br />Out of the whole cast there were only 3 characters I liked - the 2 kids in The Misbehaviors and Marisa Tomei. For me the rest were at best boring and at worst irritating to the point of actual anger. I really like Tim Roth, normally, but his character actually made me angry, he was so irritating and slapstick that I wanted him to get killed in some horrendous way, something I never wish for the protagonist of a film. Actually he didn't annoy me throughout entirely, when he didn't speak in that stupid idiot voice he was OK, the rest of the time he was Peewee Hermin.<br /><br />This is just my opinion and is of course subject to change as maybe if I watched it again at the right time and in the right mood I may see something I missed and get what all the people who enjoyed the movie got. I don't think I could take the risk though.
