I'd like to give this 10 stars for sheer inventiveness and audacity not to mention a brilliant eye, but for me it didn't quite work totally as a film, falling apart slightly towards the end. <br /><br />That said I'd recommend doing whatever you have to to catch this film, it's certainly one of the most original offerings I've seen in a long while and hopefully it's only the second of many to come. Looking at the release dates, sadly it doesn't seem to be getting much exposure outside the festival circuit in many territories. Hopefully it will at least get a (well) publicized DVD release. <br /><br />Watching it caused me to seek out Hukkle (the first feature) and that proves easily that Taxidermia is certainly no fluke, Hungary is surely producing a major talent here.
