This movie is a landmark film. It may well serve as the most important tool available to young white males to illustrate how incredibly stupid they look trying to be black. I firmly believe that if this movie is shown in schools there may yet be hope for a future for Caucasians everywhere. Stoop Dogg was instrumental in making this film and that's important to note due to the fact that he's come far enough in his career that he no longer needs to placate young "wiggers" by reassuring them that they don't look stupid trying to act black, and has gone so far as to make them look stupid directly and make a movie about it. This film did not enjoy wide distribution due to the entertainment industry's fear that white people would stop buying C rap music and they would lose those dollars. I applaud Fox's decision to distribute this film and will make every effort to support them in all of my movie watching choices in the future.
