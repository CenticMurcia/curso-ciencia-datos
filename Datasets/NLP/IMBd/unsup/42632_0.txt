Someone actually read the script for this and then persuaded investors to put up the money? The bigger question is how did all these presumably intelligent actors get hooked into this? When did the FBI start driving black Humvees with no license plates? Some scenes looked like the camera crew accidentally left the camera running while the actors were just goofing off. What other purpose was there for the sequence concerning orange baseball or potato cannons? Come to think of it, what was the purpose of the entire hazardous spill and explosive cola? And I know any time I ask the FBI what's going on, they always have a red-covered EPA manual to give me so I can look it up myself. Note to auteur (and actor): If you are trying to leave town on your ALL TERRAIN VEHICLE, and the FBI (using both their Humvees and all their personnel) stop you at the only road across the absolutely flat, featureless desert, why not simply go a half-mile away and drive your ATV across the other-than-only-road-out-of-town terrain, like the flat desert, on which you so-desperately want to race tomorrow? But then you can always come back tomorrow and get shot, so you can ride to the trailer-house clinic in the paramedic ambulance that seems to be in every shot. A few more questions. Why does a town of 87 people have both a sheriff and a deputy? How exactly does one get promoted from deputy in a tiny town to sheriff in a larger town? Sheriff is an elective office. Why do the sheriff's vehicles have civilian license plates? The good thing about child-filmmakers is that they don't care about such things, and rich investors gleefully hand over large sums of money to make movies like this, and then lose their money. Just what they deserve.
