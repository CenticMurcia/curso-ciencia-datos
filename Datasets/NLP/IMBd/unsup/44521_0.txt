Although, I am a huge fan of dance-movies, this one was not even close to the top. First, there lead-role's actress was not appropriate for the movie. She was not convincing Â– she did not show the attitude, no feelings (happiness, sadness). And what about her hairstyle? The best of it was, when she had the shirt around her hair. The improvement must be done in women casting, because men were real! They showed how the acting is done, how to show hate, friendship and love. And the best of all about them is that they could dance. The best of girl dancers was Nikki, though she did not have to dance a lot. Returning again to the lead-actress, her last dance was not convincing. I mean, where were emotions? Where was the passion? Where was the relief that the dance was going well? No facial expressions, no feelings what so ever. No difference between the obligated dance and her chosen one.<br /><br />Thus, if you are fan of dance-movies, you should watch it for the sake of your portfolio. Otherwise, there are plenty of better movies out there about the theme.
