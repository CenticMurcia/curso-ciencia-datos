The Feeding is a terrible werewolf movie about a group of campers who begin getting killed off by a lycanthrope running loose in the woods. Two cops are sent in to bring down the beast as it continues with it's feast (no this is not a poem). The plot for this is identical to many other mindless, cheezy micro-budget monstrosities and all of the actors look as if they are reading their lines off signs a crew member is holding up behind the camera. It also contains a very clich√© moment in which two characters want to discuss a personal matter while trying to survive. The werewolf costume is laughably stupid looking and seems to be constantly drooling. Plus it's facial features never move. Just stay far, far away from this atrocious movie.
