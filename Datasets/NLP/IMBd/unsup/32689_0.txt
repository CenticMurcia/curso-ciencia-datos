this animated offering from Nickelodeon features the Wild Thornberry family and The Rugrats together.now,i know i'm not the target audience,but this is as pretty slow,lame movie.plus,it's so negative.you'd think a movie with these two families together would be pretty decent,but it isn't.i'm pretty certain a lot of kids will find it the same way,at least the older ones.the younger kids might be entertained.anyway,i was very disappointed.for a really great,funny, entertaining animated movie that the whole family will enjoy,try Recess: Schools Out instead and leave this one alone.for me, The Rugrats go Wild is a 4/10
