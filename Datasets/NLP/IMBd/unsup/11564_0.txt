A tightly woven murder mystery highlighting a brilliant performance by Mia Farrow. I first learned about this movie on the mia-farrow.com website and saw a photo from it. She is simply breathtaking in this movie as she ranges from shy innocent to the final climatic scene where all is told.<br /><br />The scenes along the nile are beautiful to behold. It is too bad that Mia did not get a chance to do more movies of this caliber.<br /><br />Nivens plays a great role also.<br /><br />The snake scene is one of my favorites, especially the reaction of the manager of the boat they are on.<br /><br />The plotting is fast paced and you really don't have a clue who done it until the very ending. It is a complete surprise. As is usual in a Poroit mystery, all of the main characters, and even the non-main characters may be the guilty party, so you always have to watch for all the twists and turns.<br /><br />Cheers indeed!
