O'right<br /><br />We've just seen the movie and OK we bought a copy one 2,5 Â€ and really it doesn't worth much more. At the end we had to check on the internet the duration of the movie because we were sure a part were missing... but actually not,<br /><br />;-) So to summarize, here we go, a sexy girl from a town want to be an actress, and once her boyfriend cheat on her, she and her best friend go to Madrid and spend all their money, buying clothes, making new tits... then she is sad because she can't be an actress so go to her boy friend, and once the figure out that he is still seeing the girl he cheat on her with she go back to Madrid crying, that's more o less the whole movie.<br /><br />I'm just so glad for not having paid a cinema ticket... I gave it a 3/10<br /><br />Sorry if my English isn't that good, I'm french ;-)
