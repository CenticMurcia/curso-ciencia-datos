Although this movie didn't do as well as expected at the box office in 1985, this by no means takes away from the energy and atmosphere of this movie. The main drawback back in '85, was that everyone had high expectations for this movie since it was directed by the same guy that gave us "The China Syndrome". The main plot of a Rolling Stone reporter (Travolta) trying to get the inside scoop of the fitness boom of the '80s from (Curtis) is the most enjoyable. The sub plot of white collar crime is a little on the boring side, and doesn't really mesh with the fitness plot. It's interesting to see all of the aerobic exercises in total '80s style, but by today's standards are outdated. Everything from the neck rolls Jaime Lee Curtis does, to the high impact aerobics which looks like it's done on a minimally padded floor, really makes this movie dated, but funny in a way. One thing to remember is that "Perfect" was made during a time when "going for the burn", and "no pain, no gain" were the buzz words throughout the fitness industry. Little did people know that trying to be a "hardbody" could land you in the hospital! If you are looking for some light entertainment, and you are a fan of John Travolta, Jaime Lee Curtis, Marilu Henner etc, then you will definitely enjoy this enjoyable taste of '80s nostalgia, legwarmers & all!
