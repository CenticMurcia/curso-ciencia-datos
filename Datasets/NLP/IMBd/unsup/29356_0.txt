A fisherman and his father set foot on the foreboding Snape Island to discover the aftermath of a massacre, not to mention a severely traumatized (and appreciably naked) female survivor who stabs the father to death. The subsequent investigation leads to the discovery of an ancient artifact on the island, and then a museums' expedition to the island to explore it further. (All of this while doctors attempt to break through the survivors' catatonia). The team finds themselves menaced by a mysterious assailant.<br /><br />I found this an enjoyable horror / mystery with a definite edge to it. Director Jim O'Connolly creates good atmosphere and tension, and pulls off a great reveal of the crazed island resident. The island is a very impressive study in blatant doom and gloom; it looks ominous right from the get go. The movie has great settings and just the right look. Doses of grisly violence, sex, and intrigue also add to the mix. The movies' little twists may not come off as all that surprising, but they're enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />The solid British cast does well at selling the material. Standing out are such performers as Bryant Halliday, Jack Watson, and Dennis Price. Both Jill Haworth and Anna Palk are quite sexy, as is Candace Glendenning in the small role of the traumatized Penny.<br /><br />Creepy, raw, and brutal horror in a nicely bleak location, "Tower of Evil" is a good deal of fun.<br /><br />7/10
