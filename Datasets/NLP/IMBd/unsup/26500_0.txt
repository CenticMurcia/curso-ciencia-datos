I watched lately this movie and enjoyed a lot. I love old French movies anyway. But this one had kind of nice storyline in it also. It was directed quite well. Picture didn't jump around and kept in line with story. It had even some musical touch and it was nice to hear old French songs. It didn't to become boredom though. It stopped singing fast enough. Movie was filmed around cities in different European countries and scenes were pretty. Also acting work was professional level and much more robust than Hollywood acting. Less sugar coating! I would recommend this movie to any Francophile and also crime movie liker! It is really fun to watch and something different from nowadays.
