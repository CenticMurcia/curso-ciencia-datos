If this movie had the actors or atmosphere of Blue Velvet, it would have been great. The acting was unbelievable, the atmosphere was like Love Boat and I could've cared less about all of the actors. Polanski's wife was annoying rather than seductive, and how could you break a leg getting hit by a truck and become a paraplegic falling out of bed? Even worse, he seems unphased by losing his ability to walk. Their punk rock phase was laughable. Shall I go on? It certainly is no Chinatown!
