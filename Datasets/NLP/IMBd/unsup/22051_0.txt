Friends of IMDb :<br /><br />i've just finished watching this movie , and i am telling you its one of the best movies i have ever seen ...<br /><br />i've noticed that there's only 197 votes till now ... is that possible ? the dialogue is amazing , the acting is heart devastating , and the cinematography is perfect ,not to mention the lovely acoustic guitar background during the movie ...<br /><br />i don't know if it would make any sense to you guys , but for me this movie is a combination of Taxi driver and forest gump ( if the latter was as intellectual as leo here )<br /><br />i believe that Fiennes tackled a tough and complex character here ... he really did a great job !<br /><br />A must see
