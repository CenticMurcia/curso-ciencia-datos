This is not normally the kind of movie I watch. I rented this movie on the recommendation of some of the kitchen workers at the restaurant where I am a waitress. I should have known better. They said it was "hilarious", "funny as s*#t", among other "outstanding" comments. The only reason I sat through till the end was to wait for the funny parts that were NEVER forthcoming. I did feel that some of the portrayals of the customers were realistic. If people were to see this movie and feel the whole as an accurate portrayal of the waiting profession, which I hope normal people would have the sense to figure out is not the case, I would be out of a job. If you like stupid, mindless "humor", see this movie. I feel that it insults a profession that I happen to take very seriously and pride myself on. This movie was a waste of my time and money.
