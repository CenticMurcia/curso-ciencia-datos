I was very impressed with the overall cleanliness of this film. Definitely something that the whole family can enjoy and nothing that a parent would have to cover anyone's eyes.<br /><br />This is an example of good Christian film making that will show that Christians can make a quality film.<br /><br />Their world view definitely comes out in this film. That view is hope!<br /><br />Keep up the good work.<br /><br />The film is up there in quality with Return of the Titans. <br /><br />It's a story about redemption, faith, forgiveness, love and team!<br /><br />Again, keep up the good work.<br /><br />Executive produced by one of the authors of the Left Behind Series.
