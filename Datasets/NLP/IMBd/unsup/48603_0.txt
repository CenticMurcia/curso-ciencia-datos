Tea Leoni is quite possibly the worst actress on the planet. She must be one heck of a person, because David Duchovny certainly didn't marry her for her potential as a mega-star. Her death was the high point of the film, we can only wish it had happened somewhere in the opening credits.<br /><br />May the good Lord rescue Morgan Freeman from ever having to act with such poor co-stars again, the man deserves MUCH better than this.
