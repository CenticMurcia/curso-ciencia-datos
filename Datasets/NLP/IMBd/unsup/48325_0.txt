This movie is the kind of indie garbage that gives right wing conservatives the moral high ground.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but if your Mom and her boyfriend are even starting to diddle your fianc√© there is a problem and no amount of next day apologies are going to make it right. Seriously, what is the filmmaker trying to say? I know she thinks this is cutting edge, but really it is just sick.<br /><br />And one more thing. If the movie is about Americans - how about casting a few - I am so sick of all these Aussie and Brit actors playing Americans - aren't there any good actors in this country or what?
