I rated this one a little high because of the nice scenery. At least this movie wasn't filmed on a set with painted backgrounds.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed films involving time travel. Some time travel flicks are exciting. A few, like BACK TO THE FUTURE (all three) border on being comical. So eventually, somebody had to make a time travel flick that is boring, and here it is, THE NEXT ONE.<br /><br />This movie has a list of cinematic giants. But in this movie, the giants take a fall.<br /><br />There are a few special effects, like the electrical storm.<br /><br />But this movie, at its high points, drags. Then, it's downhill.<br /><br />This movie sits in my collection, waiting to be used as a door stop. A real disappointment.
