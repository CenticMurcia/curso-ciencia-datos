A mysterious looking creature is purchased from Chinatown and taken home as a pet, the Mogwai comes with three rules that must be observed at all times;<br /><br />Keep him out of light, especially sunlight as it will kill him.<br /><br />Never get him wet.<br /><br />Never ever feed him after midnight.<br /><br />Naturally things go belly up and what happens next amounts to a riotous invasion of Gremlins causing no end of destruction to the small town of Kingston Falls. What strikes me the most about Gremlins is the blend of tones, the comedy mixes brilliantly with the cute factor, and then all the serenity is destroyed by the carnage unleashed. While it has to be said that some of it is fit to grace any horror movie. Playing heavily on the old urban legends of little Gremlins messing with machines to unsurp humans, director Joe Dante creates a "Spielbergian" parody that delivers royally on the entertainment front. Have fun with some of the in jokes, and enjoy the social references that the writers throw in at frequent moments within the piece. But most of all, just run with the fun and enjoy the brilliance of the creatures in pre-cgi 1984. 8/10
