Predictable, hilarious treatment of the cult video game character. The actors are obviously amateur and the acting, well hammy. They are all a hoot as the title hero and the villains, respectively--watch out for their robot like body movements and feeble attempt at shock value with the "gun in the mouth scene". To its credit, the film has adequate production design, but that's about it. For a good laugh, check it out; for good action, look elsewhere.<br /><br />The film quality is OK but the content is questionable. It plays like a video game with really really good graphics. Wouldn't be seriously considered for distribution. Scenes were basically "cut and pasted" from stuff already exists out there.<br /><br />Needs unique items to impress. Again very predictable.
