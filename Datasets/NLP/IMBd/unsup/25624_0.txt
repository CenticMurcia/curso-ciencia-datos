OK, it did run a BIT too long, but other than that, I thought this was a fun mockumentary that also made it's point - if all the Mexicans suddenly disappeared, here's what would happen to the California economy. The suppositions presented seem logical, and based on fact.<br /><br />Minor "spoiler" follows: As for the plot, well, they COULD have done a bit more with the fog than just "stay out of it". That was really the only bit that bothered me afterward - no one seemed to be doing anything to figure out just what the fog was.<br /><br />Wow - I just came here to email a link to some friends, recommending this film. I was surprised at the nasty, racist comments left by many IMDBers. Shame on you!
