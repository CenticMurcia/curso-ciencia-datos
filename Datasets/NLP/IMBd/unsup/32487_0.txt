I hate MIGHTY JOE YOUNG. I liked the special effects, but other than that the movie was downright horrible. The pacing was all off. The story was pointless. The timing was horrific. The acting, by some good actors, was downright bad. It was corny and it was lame. I mean, they just happen to come upon a big house burning down... and lo and behold, it's an orphan's home. And the drunks who get Joe drunk all act drunk like they're in cartoons with that overdone twisted way of talking like they should be in a mental hospital. And the lions were lame, and not scary. And the ending was really, really, really bad, the very ending where Joe's name is written in the clouds. And the very beginning, where the little girl, the biggest overacting child actor I've ever witnessed, is talking to some hunters, man is that a bore. This movie is downright painful to watch. And as bad as SON OF KONG is, I still like that one more; it's more enjoyable, more relaxing, and there are way better fights because there are dinosaurs and giant bears and you can at least have a good time. But this film was just pointless. It's sappy and tiresome. No on Joe.
