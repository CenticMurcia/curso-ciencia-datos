Buddies is a great movie set in Emerald, Queensland, Australia.<br /><br />Mike and Johnny are two mates who are mining sapphires in Emerald. Another bloke is trying to move in on their claim and things get ugly, but not before there are a few laughs and punch-ups.<br /><br />A good piece of Australian film making that should have done better than it did. Similar sort of movie to "Last Of The Knucklemen", another Australian movie that is worth seeing.<br /><br />It is a shame that "Buddies" never made it to video or DVD.<br /><br />If you can get hold of a copy of this movie, sit down to watch an enjoyable film.
