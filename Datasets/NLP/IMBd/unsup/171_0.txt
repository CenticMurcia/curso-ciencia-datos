This movie is a testament to the power of love. Orson Welles portrays a WWII vet who will not allow himself to ruin his wife's new life. As I watched the scene where he denies his true identity, I was awestruck by the sacrifice he made. The scene in which he met and spoke with his son was so touching!! This is an awesome must-see for Orson Welles fans. Also the casting of a young Richard Long and a very young Natalie Wood was a stroke of genius!!
