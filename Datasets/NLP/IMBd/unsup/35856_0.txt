This is hands down the WORST movie that I've ever seen, and being a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I've seen a LOT of bad movies.<br /><br />There are absolutely no redeeming qualities in this steaming pile of crap. I've seen porno movies with better plots than this. As far as I can tell, our heros just wander around blindly for the entire movie going from one fight scene to another. Infact, some characters in this movie appear out of nowhere, fight some other character that has appeared out of nowhere, and then neither are seen again for the rest of the film. This MIGHT be excusable if the fight scenes were in some way entertaining or exciting. Sadly, that isn't the case. Every fight scene is exactly the same and always seems to involve our hero being launched backwards about 10 meters from a single hit.<br /><br />It takes some of the worst acting in the world to take a script THIS bad and make a movie that's even worse, but Mortal Kombat: Annihilation does it with ease.<br /><br />Believe me when I say ANYTHING is better than watching this garbage! Avoid it at ALL costs! I'm sure being forced to watch this movie is considered torture in some parts of the world!
