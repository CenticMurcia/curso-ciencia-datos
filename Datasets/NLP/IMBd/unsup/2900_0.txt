It took me back to a time of best friends and unlimited opportunities, where the world lay at your feet waiting for you to decide what you wanted to do and where you wanted to go. A time of youth and innocence when the realities of life were still on the distant horizon. A time when your desire for something more in life made you leave the security of friends and family and race to that distant horizon and beyond, to embrace all the possibilities and make them your own. <br /><br />Well written and well shot, it definitely evoked the pace and feeling of growing up in small town America without sugar coating the experience. I loved it.
