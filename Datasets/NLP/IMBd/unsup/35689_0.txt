What's the worst movie you've ever seen in your life? Just lie back and think about it. Do you think it's really bad? No! Forget about it. If you really wanna see a bad movie, you have to watch this. Trust me, you'll wonder how a human being can make such a stupid thing. If you have a few extra bucks in your wallet to spend and the only thing to do with this money is watching this movie, just throw the money into the garbage can and walk away. Now, you can ask why do I talk so negative about this movie. I'll tell you why. We have a 50 year man, with wrinkles on his forehead, acting as a teenager. A belly dancer, who do not have any idea about acting, playing as a princess. I'll describe her performance with just one word: "miserable". And the script?!?!? It seems like written by a 10 year old boy. What can I say? Keep away!!!
