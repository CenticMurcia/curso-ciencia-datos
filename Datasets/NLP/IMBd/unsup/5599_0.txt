This movie is one I always revert to when I need some California Dreaming, so much comment a great tribute to John Milius and his superb Direction. The Characters are totally believable, The surfing sequences are only now being surpassed, twenty years later. no one has come close with such an in depth surfing movie covering so many other aspects of that generation it is also interesting to spot actors who started their careers in this movie. John Milius went on to Direct The Wind and the Lion and assist in Apocalypse on the surfing sequence. Gary Busey also to great things.Can tou spot charlene Tilton of Dallas fame and her screen consort Steve kanaly. A must see for all surfing fans
