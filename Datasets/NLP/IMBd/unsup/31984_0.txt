I think a lot of people will hate this movie, because there is no a boy-loves-girl-marry-have children-happy ending story... When I saw this movie, I thought it was an European movie, I couldn't believe it's an American one...<br /><br />I remembered "American Psycho".<br /><br />I think there's no "easy" movie to watch...<br /><br />I was horrified because the violence is very real, I live in a country with a lot of drug problems, with about 16 dead people every day (men and women and children), so everything is possible... and even me was impressed!! <br /><br />I think it's a great movie... a piece of art... fine art... a psycho-thriller...<br /><br />In 50 or 60 years, when many of us were dead, someone will watch this movie and he will say: "IT'S WONDERFUL... WHY PEOPLE DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT?"
