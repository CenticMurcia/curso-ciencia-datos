Tobor, a fifty-gallon drum with legs, must rescue young Billy Chapin, the grandson of it's creator, from the evil commie bad guys (BOO!! HISS!!!) who want to use poor Tobor for their own evil purposes.<br /><br />A movie that was way behind its time-even for 1954.<br /><br />If you want a real classic boy-and-his-robot-friend story, check out IRON GIANT, BICENTENNIAL MAN, or even MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000, for that matter.<br /><br />Rating: * out of *****
