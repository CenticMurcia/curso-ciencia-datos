Although director Able Gance became world famous after producing his four-hour epic film NAPOLEON, everything he touched was not cinematic gold. In the case of this film, it wouldn't even approach cinematic lead or cardboard! It seems that the director was experimenting with camera tricks--something he put to great use in NAPOLEON--featuring a "tryptic" view on the screen of three separate scenes in this film and many odd camera angles. In the case of this short, he tried using a very, very distorted lens that made things look like of like a fun-house mirror. The final product appears totally distorted and annoying--unless you are a die-hard film historian or you are 100% drunk! Then, perhaps, you'll find SOMETHING to enjoy about this mess. I give it a score of 2 out of charity--for at least trying something different. But the film is just stupid and insults your mind and intelligence. Nice try, but NOT one of your film successes, Abel!
