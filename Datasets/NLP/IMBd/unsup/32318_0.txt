Bob Newhart followed his first series becoming an Inn Keeper in Vermont. The setting worked out perfect as more comedy came from this sitcom than many others. Verterans such as Tom Poston got a chance to shine. So did many newcomers.<br /><br />Much like his previous series, Dick Louden (Newhart) always manages to make his ensemble into stars. This series had a lot more cast members than the previous one. It starts so slow with it's sleepy theme song & great country scenery that you could almost go to sleep. Mary Frann (Dick's wife) & others would then wake you up.<br /><br />Instead, many woke up to more genius. Larry, Daryl & Daryl even got jobs doing commercials after this show went off, they became so famous. It is amazing between this & his previous series how much Bob Newhart became a part of everyones TV viewing lives.<br /><br />This series ended on a high when (spoiler) in the last episode they tied it back directly to The Bob Newhart Show. Between the downtown setting of the first show & the country setting of this show, Bob Newhart never missed a beat.
