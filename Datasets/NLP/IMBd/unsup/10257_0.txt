I saw this film last night at the Barbican in London, apparently it hadn't been shown for thirty years, longer than I've been alive! We were warned at the beginning that it wasn't the easiest film to watch and with that in mind, I actually found it not too difficult to watch. All the chartacters were very different and I really like the idea of having people play the animals. It was pretty sad but also heartwarming in a way. I loved Robert Downey jr as the puppy, so cute!!!<br /><br />I would say that the film was pretty bizarre and I'm not sure if I could watch it again for a while but for someone like me who is interested in they ways of past decades, I think it was a brilliant peek into the late sixties. There was one particular character, the old lady who played the dog with the mange problem who I thought was brilliant, amazing styling and directing. A film that should be available to be shown.
