This movie is impudent enough to bedazzle you. A funny satirical mockumentary about the rise and fall of a dimwitted bus driver that becomes a country & western one-hit-wonder. Billy Burke plays Dill Scallion the unlikely star with his hit "When You Shared You". His gimmick is having his foot stomped on before going on stage; and his crippled dance becomes a dance hall sensation. <br /><br />Lauren Graham plays Scallion's girlfriend that is caught up in the fame game. David Koechner plays Bubba Pearl, the right hand man of the new star and wanting to reclaim some of his own past glory. Henry Winkler plays a talent promoter and a bearded Jason Priestly plays the role of county icon Joe Joe Hicks.<br /><br />Making cameo appearances are LeAnn Rimes, Travis Tritt and Willie Nelson playing themselves and Robert Wagner cameos as Mr. Llama the boot baron.<br /><br />You really start thinking this is too damn dumb to watch, but you hang in there waiting to see how silly this thing can get. I will definitely watch this again. Laugh at it and with it.
