I saw this when it first aired. It was dumped on TV over the summer after the movie came out, I guess after the Powers that Be decided not to make the series. I distinctly remember thinking that they had finally cast Remo correctly! Thin, big wrists, bad sense of humor, and a very good martial artist. (I love Fred Ward, but he was never Remo to me.) Joel Grey was a very good Chiun as well, though at the time I thought that they would never have him on the regular series, since it wasn't Broadway. Silly me. The humor was there, the characterization... the writers were much more in tune with the books than the movie was. I don't remember the details well, as it was a long time ago. I sure wish they had gone ahead with the series.
