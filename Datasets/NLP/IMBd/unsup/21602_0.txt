One Down, Two to Go may rank a few notches beneath other celluloid team-ups with these stars, but it definitlely has it's share of fun moments. Jim Kelly's character is wounded for most of the movie, but it's always a pleasure to watch big bad Jim "SLAUGHTER" Brown team-up with Fred "The HAMMER" Williamson! Especially when Richard "SHAFT" Roundtree is in the mix! One Down is no Three the Hard Way, but there's just nothing like the spectacle of the Hammer uttering the immortal line "Back off Mojo! You may know Kung Fu but I know Gun Fu!"! LOL! One Down, Two to Go is a cheesy blast of fun that goes best with favorite beverages, good popcorn, and a room full of rowdy B-movie lovers.
