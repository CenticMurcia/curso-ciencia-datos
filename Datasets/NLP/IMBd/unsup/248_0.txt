This film won't take you very long to see, but it will leave a lasting impression. It's bright, witty, and reflective of the realities of today's society with an edginess and sophistication that tells you you're in the hands of a master filmmaker. <br /><br />The actors are fabulous and the script is sharp and witty. The ending is unforgettable. I loved all the little lines and nuances that made it worth watching twice. It's a compact piece that looks like it was fun to shoot and yet has all the impact of a much larger project. I particularly liked the colorful costumes and the way they brought the innovative set to life. I thought the actors were amazing and had the pleasure of meeting several of them at the screening. <br /><br />I can't wait to see this writer/director's next story.
