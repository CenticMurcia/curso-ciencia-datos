If you are a fan of the book (who has read it and isn't?), you will not be disappointed in this version. This BBC miniseries stays true to the book where others have shockingly not bothered to follow the narrative of one of the best novels in western literature. The acting and screenplay are spot on and the cinematography is great. Colin Firth as Darcy sets the mark for others to follow and Jennifer Ehle is excellent. Furthermore, the supporting cast is excellent! Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennet, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, the list goes on; all do an extraordinary job. This is the definitive version-- Even those with the shortest of 21st century attention spans will be rapt. When Firth and Ehle are on screen together it's almost impossible to look away. A truer masterpiece of literature transcribed to the screen will not be found.
