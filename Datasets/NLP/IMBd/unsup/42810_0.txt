I cannot see how this movie was ever allowed to be seen in any movie theaters. Most spectators would probably want their money back. Robert Redford seems to like "ethnic American" movies like this one and Smoke Signals,which was at least better than Milagro Beanfield War. This movie played into stereotype characters too much but Redford wants to seem like an enlightened man who is sensitive to other cultures. This movie was a bit too racist for me to enjoy and it was not a comedy: the dumb blonde woman stereotype; the backward Mexican peasants; the White-Anglo New England anthropologist having to explain the mixture of pagan/Catholic religious beliefs to a Mexican who should already know this stuff!
