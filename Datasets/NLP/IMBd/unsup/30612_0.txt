The journalist who is the main character is an excellent portrayal of a brilliant, ambitious, thick-skinned yuppie. It is also a fascinating insight into the "press industry" itself.<br /><br />Note that to me anyway this movie is not about the drama or the so-called "terrorism" so if it wasn't dramatic or twisty enough I forgive it. It is about relationships between people, ambition and being reminded of what's truly important in life.<br /><br />The ending isn't sensational but nicely understated. It made me crack a wry smile. Frankly I really liked it -- something very 'this-is-what-happens-in-real-life' about it.<br /><br />On the downside, the answer to the mystery behind the bombings was I guess somewhat predictable, but again, I say suspense and thrill is not what this movie is about... (Although it was certainly fast-paced enough to keep me tense waiting for what would pan out). <br /><br />I don't know if this movie improves for those who can understand Swedish - probably does - but regardless I was impressed even having to read subtitles. I read all the IMDb comments before actually watching this movie and thought I'd be disappointed, but having watched it I can't help but give this a 10/10!
