This was a terrible movie with a bad plot line. They repeated the same story line as the first but with a different love interest for the same main character. The girl that they got to play Sara however was a terrible actress and was like watching a bad car crash. They had her in red gothy lipstick throughout the entire film that was distracting and unlike Sara. I can't even remember the dancing or the music because all I could think of was how bad this movie is. It totally ruined a great movie and now I am going to have to try to forget that I ever saw it in the first place. I honestly only watched it because it was on t.v. and there was nothing better to watch. It did not relay the message as the first one did. It sent out weird racial messages and was a disgusting display of how Hollywood is out of original ideas. I'd hate to be the writer of this script.
