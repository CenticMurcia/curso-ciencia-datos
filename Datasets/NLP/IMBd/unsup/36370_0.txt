They basically put parts 1,2,3 and 4 together in one movie.First of all the kills in this movie were boring and made with CGI.Second,way too much sex and nudity.I mean a little is okay but having a sex scene last 3 minutes and showing EVERYTHING that's just dumb even for a horror movie.Third,the ending was kinda hard to understand.Jason jumps out of the lake and cut,it's over.I mean that was just mind blowing and odd.On a positive note,Jason looked scary and cool.Jason looks the best in this movie.This movie had it's moments but it's just wasn't that good.I strongly suggest watching the old Friday The 13th movies.Parts 1,3,4,5,6 and 7 are the best ones.The rest are just okay.
