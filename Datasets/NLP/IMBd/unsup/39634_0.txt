Strongly inspired by Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs" and "From dusk till dawn" this movie has none of the qualities of the before mentioned. The acting is _very_ bad, the visual effects are less than average, the story is complete and utter nonsense (which you could forgive the movie if it was funny or action-packed) and characters appear and disappear in the story without explanation or reason. I am so sad I spent 4$ watching this!
