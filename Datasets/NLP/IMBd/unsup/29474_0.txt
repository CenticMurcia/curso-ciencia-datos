I wonder what was Subhash Ghai trying to do with so much money and absolutely trash story with an inane English woman speaking nonsense Hindi and a Hindi trapeze artist. I saw it just for Antonia who was the only one who some what acted in this whole movie. Sushmita Sen as usual looked awesome though she wasn't needed in the movie, Vivek Oberoi..why can't you be a bit humble and try to do some acting?? Rest everybody else is wasted. And please stop coloring new cars in to some unknown local three wheelers. The song 'tu kisna hai' is the only one you might hum later. The Greek song is too out of place ,its neither English nor Indian.<br /><br />Makeup..dresses...picturization...all substandard. Worst Mr Ghai I miss Saroj Khan and I don't want to see a village belle doing yoga on a rope. Before the movie starts there is an advertisement for some film institute by Mr Ghai. My request Mr Ghai please get yourself enrolled too.
