This sequel to the somewhat cult classic horror flick "It's Alive" just is not up to that movie at all in my opinion. Not really alive at all this movie crawls by at a snail's pace and just seems to be a less fun movie than the original. Add to that the fact they take all the mystery out of the first movie, basically spelling out how the mutant killer babies are born the way they are something I do not think really needed to be addressed so thoroughly. Granted, it may be that I would have preferred a more supernatural type origin than the scientific one so it may be just my tastes that make me think ill of this movie than anything else. I also thought they showed the babies to much in this one and this kind of made the impact of seeing them lessen to a great degree. The movie basically has a whole place of mutant killer babies to see. Though as bad as this one is they would make another one, however, it started promisingly enough with a cab birth scene, but once they showed the island and the babies I could watch no more. This one was barely watchable too as it was very boring for me to witness.
