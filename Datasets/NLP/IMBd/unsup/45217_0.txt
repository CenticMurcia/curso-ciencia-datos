This film D.E.B.S. (as seen at Cinevegas 2004) is basically a big re-hash of Charlie's Angels 2. The villain girl is even a direct copy of Demi Moore's character, and of course is beautiful enough to be the only appealing thing about this ham-fisted dud besides a mail-in cameo from Michael Clarke Duncan and some flashy visual effects. <br /><br />This film just tries too hard to be silly and the humor is far too forced to laugh at. None of the leading ladies are remotely appealing, especially the lead who doesn't seem to have any personality and isn't even all that good-looking either. The film however attempts to win over male audiences by exploitively dressing its crime-fighting heroines in skimpy Catholic school girl uniforms, but is so overtly uberfeminist and estrogen-charged that it not only alienates but probably offends a great deal of its target audience. Girls have poor role-models in the characters, all of whom are one-dimensional sex-obsessed airheads with little or no ability to reason, plan, or think outside themselves. The only one who seems to think clearly is the headmistress, who suffers a sudden lapse of judgement toward the ending, though it should be noted that by this point in the film the filmmaking and scriptwriting have devolved to the point of total nonsense.<br /><br />While the attempt is amiable - an action film by women and for women, it's nothing but a mockery of what it aspires to be, and unfortunately takes women's representation in film two steps back for every step forward.
