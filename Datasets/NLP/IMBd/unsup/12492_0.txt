People don't realize this is the first all digital shot Hi def film ever.My overtly mysterious and sexually taut appearance as the lead hit man is paid off with a stunt I did myself for this one, my violent death sequence from street to caf√©. Develpoed quite a cult following and thanks for the support of me (at the time just a new AF model) then and in my career that has followed. It really was a pleasure to work on. Top notch Hong Kong crew. Grieco although aging was really fantastic and we all know how well a certain topless actress in this film, Maggie Q, has done since. She was definitely my crush on set. If you like action and innovation this is your film. Brandon Marcel Gertz, myspace.com/bmarcel
