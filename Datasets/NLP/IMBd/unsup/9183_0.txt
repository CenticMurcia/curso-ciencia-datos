Compared to their previous live concerts (especially the sound fiasco at the Shea Stadium event, although that was their biggest performance) this album and this concert was the best this band ever made. Judging on the location (the best location to be used--above the roof) and the sound, it was awesome. I liked especially the little bits of fun they inserted here, like afet "One After 909", Lennon recites a line of "Danny Boy"... Even though it was obvious that the relations between The Beatles themselves were then too strained, they still blasted the gray Liverpool sky with that album.<br /><br />10 out of 10.
