I considered giving this pitiful, soporific comedy a 1, but settled on a 2 for some reason. That shouldn't deter you from running as fast and as far away as you can from Ski School, a bottom of the barrel celebration of immature frat life. Of course, this frat is actually inhabited by a motley assortment of party animals who pretend to ski in their spare time (why they couldn't just stay at home to party is just one of the many unfathomable mysteries of Ski School). Naturally they have a run in with the toney head cheese of the school, who somehow allowed them to attend in the first place, and there's a 'climactic' competition between the two groups at the end of the film. I won't tell you who wins, but (***spoiler alert***) the film's amoral heart is revealed when the party house, led by smirking Dean Cameron, choose to cheat in order to compete. Ski School is a foul-mouthed, misogynistic piece of trash that will appeal to those who thought Animal House was a tad too arty.
