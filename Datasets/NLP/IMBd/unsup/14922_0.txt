Dark city is one of the most original pieces of sci-fi to come along in a long time, add that to the amazing visual look brought to the film by it's director and you have a body of work that is little short of perfect. Alex Proyas may not direct many films but when he does he gets it right. It's a shame then that Dark city did not get the full recognition it deserved, I myself watched it on it's opening weekend in the uk, in cinema that had no more than six people in it. When you compare this with the box office success of a film like the Matrix which while being a good film still falls well short of the tale being told in Dark City, it seems that people on the whole don't want intelligent science fiction but the typical pap that hollywood is too eager to churn out for the masses. We need more films like Dark City and Twelve Monkeys and we need more directors who belive that their audience has a brain and is willing to use it.
