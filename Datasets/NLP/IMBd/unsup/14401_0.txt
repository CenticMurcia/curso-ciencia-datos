This cartoon starts out with Daffy Duck in J. L.'s (Jack L. Warner's) office pitching for a dramatic role. He's tired of having anvils drop on his head and never getting the girl. In his buildup of the proposed plot, he has J. L., and us, on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />This is not your typical Looney Tunes fair. It's a roller coaster ride of slapstick comedy, cameos and that special brand of humor from writer Michael Maltese, all beautifully animated by one of the best crews ever assembled. It's a welcome departure from the formulaic series that the Warner Bros. cartoon factory from this era did so well, but the recipe from this one was to be tried out again with great success in later Daffy Duck shorts (Duck Dodgers, Stupor Duck).<br /><br />
