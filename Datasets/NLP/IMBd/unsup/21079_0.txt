It's been a while that I watched a movie were you are holding the fast forward button. People on forums were recommending this flick due the strange storyline and the fact that it is OOP and never released on DVD. the storyline itself is okay, a serial killer falls in love with a vampire, the vampire disappears and a succubus replaces her. Both telling him to kill and to change into a vampire. So far so good but it is really boring. There is a lot of blah blah and the killings are all off screen. On the VHS it's been written, gore drenched. Well, surely that guy has to learn what gore is. Again before someone attacks me, I would like to state that a movie DOESN'T have to contain gore to be good. I have reviewed a lot of flicks that doesn't contain the red stuff but still deliver the horror in some way. But it just doesn't work, and the best part should be the ending, watch it to believe it, the special effects are, to say the least, special. Not my cup of tea but still some people are hunting this one down so I should be lucky to have found it.
