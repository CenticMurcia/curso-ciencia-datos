Well... I know some folks herald this as intelligent satire, but... I had a hard time with it. The only redeeming moment was when Dr. Stark, asked if he wants any pie, says "Science is my pie." That pretty much saved the movie for about thirty seconds.<br /><br />The problem was that there were lots and lots of "jokes" that were very flat. Not flat as in deadpan. Flat as in... what was so funny about it? Perhaps if I watched it over and over again it might make me laugh more, but as I had a difficult time getting through it even ONCE, I doubt I'll ever know.<br /><br />I am a big fan of horrible movies, such as "Traxx" starring Shadoe Stevens where a Soldier of Fortune mercenary turns his attention to being a successful cookie maker, and of spoofs like "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra." But I could not find the spark that makes a bad movie great in Spaceship (a.k.a. The Creature Wasn't Nice).<br /><br />Perhaps there was a lack of tension to make the characters pop? So they would seem less like they were just reading lines? Perhaps they all needed more pie, or more science. Or more Science Pie.<br /><br />The world may never know.<br /><br />Support your local piemaker.
