It's nothing like the TV series. The original series had a lot of action like the fight scenes, car chases, high speed jumps but this reunion didn't have any of it! There was only one jump scene and that was to impress the gangters that the Dukes were not losers. Hasn't the director ever seen CBS series and take some of those ideas and put it into the movie? If they're gonna make another reunion movie (which I doubt it), then they should come up with a different plot.
