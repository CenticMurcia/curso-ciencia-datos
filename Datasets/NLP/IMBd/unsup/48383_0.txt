First, I have been an Hector Lavoe fan since early 70's and as a puertorican I agree with a lot of our artists that this movie is simply awful. The acting is subpar, the editing worse and the story was a bit biased. We all thought that this production was going to do justice to the life and achievements of Lavoe. Instead it is an embarrassing account of the negative aspect of Hector's life. Yes he did drugs, yes he had many trying times, but he also left a musical legacy that many of today's Salsa singers (Marc Anthony included) can't and never will achieve. This was a chance to celebrate the artist and his contributions along with Willie Colon to our popular music. Instead we have all the dark aspects that clouded his life and show old Salsa artists to be a bunch of "junkies" and bums. Also, you can clearly notice that this is a "Jennifer Lopez production" since a lot of the "actors" in the movie are blood relatives of J-Lo. This is a low blow for these artists and I can believe Jenny to ride Marc's fame as much as she can since she can't sell a movie by herself, much less a singing career. I was very disappointed in Marc and as a puertorican I can say that ever since he got together with J-Lo he has lost a lot of ground with us puertoricans and this travesty of a movie clearly shows it. You really need to know the real story here if you want to comment on this "movie". All I saw was J-Lo's face and big "rump" more times than the actual main character of the movie. I counted about forty-something appearances from Marc and over 200 by J-Lo. Way to go girl, keep riding the bronco until it drops.
