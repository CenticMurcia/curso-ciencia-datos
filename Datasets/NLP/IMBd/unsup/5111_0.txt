Probably the best example of Bollywood cinema from the early 80's, AAA is eye catching and wonderfully acted with a brilliant score. Amitabh Bachchan truly steals the show with his over the top "My name is Anthony Gonsalves" sequence. Shabana Azmi is fantastic in a supporting role. The real dealmakers for the film, however, are Pran and Jeevan who respectively are devilishly fiendish as Kishenlal (reborn of course -- who can forget the brilliant "Sewer ka putter ..." sequence after spotting Robert on his return) and Robert, the antagonist to all. Sure the ending is over the top, but hey, this was the heyday of Bollywood. And isn't Taiyyab Ali one of the most comically genius roles of all time.<br /><br />Exceptionally done and a must-see.
