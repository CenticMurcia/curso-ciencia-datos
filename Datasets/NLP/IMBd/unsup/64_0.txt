As was noted by Cine Tiger, this excellent silent film was offered by Turner Classic Movies on their Sunday Night Silent feature.<br /><br />"Captain Salvation" was beautifully photographed, and although it does show the difference in the movie-making of that day to this day, it was a captivating journey. Marcelline Day was simply excellent in this film. My original vote for this drama was a 6 but after reflection, I raised the vote to a 7 because some of the scenes were so very haunting.<br /><br />The newly added soundtrack for "Captain Salvation" was most enjoyable.<br /><br />Plaudits all around to the restoration team, to the music composer, and to the Turner Classic Movies channel and its executives. This was a great film to restore and it was definitely an enchanting story to view on a quiet Sunday night. This movie also gives the lie to those modern cynics who say that spiritual or religious themes in movies are passe' or "old hat." Not so. Granted, this was truly a '20s movie and the 1920's had an element of resurgent Christian fundamentalism in that era, a resurgence which contrasted so very sharply with the age of "flappers, flivvers, and fol-de-rol".<br /><br />With many other classics of the '20s awaiting restoration, we can only hope for the best and for the immediate rescue of these cultural documents from our true American history !! Let's hope TCM shows this one again and again.
