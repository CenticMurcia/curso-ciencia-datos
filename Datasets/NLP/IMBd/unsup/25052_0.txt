"Kisses And Caroms" is a quirky and highly entertaining debut feature film from Director Vince Rocca. It is a fun filled and (sometimes) raunchy romp through suburban LA and the lives of two central characters (Zack and Jen), and their nutty friends and neighbors. Much of it takes place in a billiard shop which is a very colorful and appropriate backdrop to the story. The pool hall is actually an allegory about life and relationships, of how men and women play mind games and try to control one another. But beneath the shtick and slapstick, beneath the flashy pomp and circumstance, there's a really sweet story of longing, love, lust, friendship, hope, and learning to appreciate what you have while you have it. The screenplay is smart and sassy. The ending has a twist that I didn't see coming. The mostly unknown cast and bootleg/homespun feel of K+C only enhances its authenticity, bringing to mind some of the earlier works of indie pioneers like Robert Rodriguez and John Waters. Very clever indeed.
