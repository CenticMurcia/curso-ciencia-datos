This is likely the most underrated great romance picture of all time! The stars--William Powell and Kay Francis--are superb. The supporting players--Aline MacMahon, Franck McHugh, and Pat O'Brien--have never been better. The music score is a classic; the story a perfect gem. From the opening shot at a Far East bar, complete with a marvelous singing trio, to the final, heartbreaking moment, this film is the perfect 1930s concoction of great stars and a ridiculously silly plot made totally believable and palatable. Kay Francis was one of the top stars of the decade, and this is one of her best films; William Powell, also underrated, has never been more suave. Both deserved Oscar nominations for this great fiolm, as did MacMahon and McHugh for support (not a category for another few years). Kay Francis did everything during her reign as a top Warners star. It's amazing how she was able to go from fragile heroine to hard-edged woman and then throw in a comedy. A truly versatile and wonderful star rescued by TCM from obscurity. Sadly, neither Powell nor Francis would ever win an Oscar----Julia Roberts indeed!
