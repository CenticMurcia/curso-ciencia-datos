After reading the other reviewer's comments i thought i would give this film a chance, what a mistake... the films afternoon TV movie quality was only lifted by the portrayal of the psycho gangster who is running around trying to find his car full of smack. The lead character almost has an incestuous love for his rock star (nearly) sister, who sings a few ditties but is hardly hazel o Connor in "breaking glass".<br /><br />The lead character of a car theft, doesn't seem to have much one screen charisma and looks as though he is nearly falling asleep in his deliver of some of his lines.<br /><br />The smacked up heroin addict, that is his old pal and sister's boyfriend seems either cold turkey or 100% with it, and i'm sure would be seen as a poor example of why not to do heroin by people who have been through such troubled times.<br /><br />please don't bother, get breaking glass out instead!
