Where do I start? Bruce Willis should not be allowed to grow a mustache. But no, that's not my main complaint.<br /><br />The main story in the movie is that he (Bruce) has roughly 2 hrs to transport a prisoner from the cell block to the court house, yet the cops are trying to stop him. OK, good idea. I'd watch the movie based on that.<br /><br />The movie is slow from start to finish. I don't mind slow movies with a purpose. King Kong, for example, is slow in the beginning, yet I love it. 2001: A Space Odessy and The Birds are very slow, yet I find them good movies. This movie was slow because of poor writing. If you want to see some well done writing that is done in real time (1 hr video is 1 hr of story), watch 24.<br /><br />But it goes down hill rapidly. Bruce Willis plays a depressed detective that really doesn't give a rip about his job. He's always tired. He's old and run down. He doesn't "snap out of it" enough to make his character interesting.<br /><br />The prisoner, Mos Def. What the crap? Does he have mental problems? Is he a little eccentric? Is he just annoying? It's not clear. And what is up with his voice? The story was not written well. There were a lot of continuity errors. Like Bruce calls for some help, yet not only do they never show up, but they're never mentioned again. It's like it never happened. Then there were times where they acted like they had 5 minutes to get to the court house, times where they acted like they had 5 hours, and time where they acted like they'd given up on making it, or the time had already passed.<br /><br />Far too many times, the bad guys were able to guess exactly where Bruce was going, yet it seems way to perfect. Almost like, he's a white male, aged 40, I bet he went to his old friend from college that works at K-mart for advice. That's not what happened, but it was way to precise of a guess to be written off as smart bad guys.<br /><br />O, and the ending was predictable. There was a slight twist that I didn't see coming, but nothing huge. In the end, Bruce's character is still his old tired self, except he now likes his birthday.<br /><br />The only movies I've seen that are worse are, Bulletproof Monk and Sphere. Bruce, I hope you get back to some real movies soon, like Sin City, Six Sense and Pulp Fiction.
