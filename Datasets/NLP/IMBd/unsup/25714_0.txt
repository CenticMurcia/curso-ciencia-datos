I've seen many politically charged films. The one thing that always gets to me is that a cause drives a project to greater awareness of an issue or event. But what bothered me incredibly about "Amu The Film" was that the script was so benign that the history was getting a fairly weak treatment. Shonali Bose, the writer director should have stuck to directing as the handling is mostly first rate. However, the insipid dialogue, the forced romantic angle between Kaju and some horribly wooden actor playing Kabir (are we supposed to buy that she would fall for this chap?), and politics which unravel through a mystery that simply is too over-dramatic in its unfolding make me wonder if "Amu The Film" was trying too hard to please too many people.<br /><br />I was amazed by the responses here as people seem to be eating up the contrived emotions and the forced responses we are supposed to feel for these characters and the situations. While the 1984 riots is absolutely a topic that needed further examination "Amu The Film" fails miserably.<br /><br />As much as I tried to like the film, it just lacked the spirit. And the spirit is what drove me to see the film in the first place.
