I was really looking forward to this movie. I'm a great fan of Jimmy McGovern's work. But this film just failed to engage me at any point. It felt like an episode of Cracker, but without the Cracker side of the plot. In fact, the whole thing felt like a lame TV drama, despite the widescreen format. Unltimately, a disappointment.
