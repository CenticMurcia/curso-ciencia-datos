If you accept that it takes two of the characters a long time to figure out who Jake really is, even though the evidence of his past is written on his back, the film is a decent revenge film. There is no redeeming quality at all to the bad guys and you have to feel that they deserve whatever is coming to them. Hot rod buffs will drool over the cars in the film, and rock fans will love the soundtrack. It is hard to imagine today that Charlie Sheen was making movies at that age. As someone else noted, this is not Oscar winning stuff, but it is an interesting 92 minutes. But how to classify it? Drama, Action Adventure, Science Fiction or horror? It's your choice.
