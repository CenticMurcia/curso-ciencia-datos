Other than some familiar faces, this episode has nothing special about it whatsoever. I have to say that this is by far one of my least favorite episodes of the entire series.<br /><br />The episode seems to be trying to make a kind of telenovela out of a chupacabra story and ends up throwing in too many stupid soap opera elements so that the actual story that could have been told gets completely lost. There are so many versions of the story at the end of the episode that not only is it impossible to figure out what actually happened, but neither do I care. Like in "Hell Money", the local cop who is supposed to be an intermediary for Mulder and Scully to connect with and understand the culture ends up being more loyal to his stupid cultural ideals than to the badge he wears. I don't know why the writers think that just because someone is Mexican or Chinese or whatever that they will end up being corrupt in the name of culture and tradition and honor and blah blah blah. The story didn't even try to explain the actual myth behind the chupacabra at all other than translating it to English for those who don't speak Spanish. The actors, who supposedly are Mexican and speak Spanish as their first language, have less convincing Spanish accents than I do and I'm a hamburger and pizza lovin' gringo. The main character, who I've seen in a number of other shows and have enjoyed quite a bit, does not work well in this episode as the chupacabra. His acting is TERRIBLE! I know that this wasn't his first job, you would think the director could at least done a little directing and done some retakes or something. Ugh! The worst part is I might actually be able to enjoy the episode if there was an obvious attempt at parody here. But there isn't. It comes across as being totally serious.<br /><br />I think I'm done. Other than some pretty cool special effects this episode was lame and not worth watching and I give it a 3 out of 10.
