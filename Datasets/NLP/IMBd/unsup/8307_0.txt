I think this movie is just a fun ride -it's not meant to be a "thinking mans horror film" as I've understood it, as it probably wouldn't have had so many goofy elements -it's supposed to be an entertaining fun ride. it twists and turns, but, as the previous review mentions -nothing that will make you lose track of what is going on- which is a strong point for the movie -not against it. Something Fightclub couldn't manage, as it always fails to hold water upon further inspection. Seth Green does it well as the goofy "sidekick" you're not sure you can trust, and the rest of the cast is equally eccentric. Not a film for the fan of mainstream flicks, but if you want something a bit out of the extraordinary, this might be the film for you.
