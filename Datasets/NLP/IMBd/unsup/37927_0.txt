I made the mistake of watching this and buying it. I have a lot of stuff to say to make this movie seem like junk and it is. <br /><br />Marilyn was never forced to have sexual relations with any of her casting directors. The studio names were messed up, the modeling agency she was at was not named the same. It's full of nudity and Marilyn didn't do anything like that until Somethings Got To Give and the famous Playboy issue. She wasn't raped by a police man. All the none sense about the "Whamo ammo" girl trash is all false. The names are wrong, except for Norma Jean Baker, that seems to be the only thing Larry Buchanan could spell.<br /><br />I hated this movie and if anyone wants to disagree with me and say its good then they're wrong and wasting their time.<br /><br />I'd give it 1/2 out of 4 stars.
