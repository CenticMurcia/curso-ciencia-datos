I was one of maybe six people who've ever seen this thing. I sat through it mostly out of respect for Blank's prior film 'Sex, Drugs and Democracy', which was interesting. This was not. The Zappa kids looked embarrassed to be there, Thicke looked lost and the script... um, was there a script?<br /><br />I did like the idea of a TV station takeover ('Tapeheads' did this better), but the idea is wasted here.<br /><br />Skip this - rent SD&D instead if you can find it.
