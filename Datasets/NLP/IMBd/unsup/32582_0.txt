I have rarely seen a worse movie than this one. What a disappointment from this cast. The production values alone are cheap cheap cheap! They couldn`t even afford proper makeup for the lepers, who look like they are suffering from acne, not to mention bad acting. What a waste of great talent Martin Sheen, Alan Arkin, and Ralph Bellamy. The sets are atrocious, most of it is painted back drops. Who would think of riding a horse through the desert? We never even get to see the face of Jesus, one can only assume he wouldn`t show his face in such a poor production. The music should also have been canned. Do not waste your time on this crap!
