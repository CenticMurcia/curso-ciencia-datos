This is one of those Looney Tunes cartoons used by Warner Brothers not mainly to entertain kids, but to educate them about the USA. In other words: Tell the children how good and brilliant and important the USA is and how many good and brave people died for 'this great country'. This is why Uncle Sam tells a dreaming Porky Pig to learn his Pledge of Allegiance. That's obviously the educational part of this 9-minutes long film, logically would be to start with the entertaining/funny things now, but in 'Old Glory' there is no fun. There isn't even an attempt made to be funny! As if the creators forgot that Looney Tunes cartoons are supposed to be witty or spoofing or something, but this particular one is tasteless in it's lack of entertainment what so ever!<br /><br />In the era this little film was made, it wasn't unusual to promote the greatness and beauty of the USA or to make the USA-enemies look dumb/stupid. For instance in 'Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips' (1944) Bugs blows up several Japanese with exploding ice-cream! This all happened during the Second World War and although it's immoral to influence children the way it's done in this cartoons (and other Looney Tuners), you have to admit it's smart to use the Looney Tunes for this purpose. The cartoons are funny ('Old Glory' being the exception to this rule) and kids (and adults as well) adore Bugs, Daffy, Porky and all the others.<br /><br />And that is why we see Porky Pig in 'Old Glory' studying and dreaming of the greatness of his country. With Uncle Sam explaining him (and the unknowing little viewers) all about how important loving the USA is. In an immoral, joke-less, spoof-less, un-witty cartoon.
