Saw this on cable and the information page said something about a "mutant bear", so immediately I knew I had to watch it. Turns out, no mutants, no over the top insane events, just a disappointing movie.<br /><br />Featured and filmed in Manitoba, Canada (the scenery might be the best part of the film), four kids out of high school live it up as they go joyriding in the wilderness. When they run over a bear cub, things get hairy, as mama bear wants revenge! And of course, they HAVE to run into all sorts of additional car troubles and other hand-wringing episodes.<br /><br />Overall, a trashy movie with terrible acting. Worth watching if you find bad movies hilarious. Kate Todd, young notable Canadian actor, is the only character that stands out...and only for her looks.
