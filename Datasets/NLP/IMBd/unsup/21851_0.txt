I cannot believe this film. The acting was laughable and the characters were so shallow that I could not have care less about them. I was hoping the vampires would swoop in and end this painfully weak flick. Jason Lee is a bad rip-off of Wesley Snipe's Blade character. Jason London was just plain terrible. His attempts of being the "humorous" character fell flat. I was surprised that such a seasoned actor as Roy Schrieder would even appear in this movie. I was looking forward so much in seeing Rutgar Hauer as Dracula, needless to say I was also disappointed. Not at his acting itself (it was probably the only decent acting worth noting)but to wait until the end to see him, and his 10 -15 minutes of screen time was not worth sitting the previous torturous 70 minutes to get to him. He had a certain kind a Jack Palance thing going for him, but it worked for me.<br /><br />My best advise is to stay away from this bomb. It's a waste of 90 minutes when they're so much other things to do with one's time. This series should have ended after the second movie, it did not bring any closure for me. It just made me want to go and get Blade 3 and forget this bad movie.
