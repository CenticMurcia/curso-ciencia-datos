this movie wasn't about the interesting part. The story was rather boring. The costumes were very appealing as well as the make up. In this version, Elizabeth is battling Spain. Spain is trying to conquer the world. King of Spain, Phillip is Catholic, and Elizabeth is protestant. Elizabeth has a crush on Sir Walter Releigh whom has returned from the New World. She becomes highly upset when learning one of her court maidens is having his baby. Also, Elizabeth survives an assignation attempt by rival Mary Stuart, whom wants the throne. The conclusion is the famous battle between the Spanish Armada and the Brits.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Not that great. Only for history buffs.
