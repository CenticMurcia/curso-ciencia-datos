Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase reunite for "Seems Like Old Times," a 1980 Neil Simon comedy that borrows heavily from the Cary Grant-Jean Arthur "Talk of the Town." Hawn is an attorney and ex-wife of Chase, and she's now married to DA Charles Grodin, who's about to be made Attorney General of the state. Chase is forced to take part in a robbery and is on the lam and shows up at her house and several inopportune moments - like when she's entertaining the governor. She feels compelled to help him, but there's nothing unusual there - she has stray dogs, cats, and paroled defendants overrunning her house.<br /><br />The actors are excellent, as is the funny supporting cast, and there are some hilarious scenes as Chase hides out in a room above the garage and, while under the bed, his hand extending a little, Grodin stands on his finger as he argues with Hawn.<br /><br />What bothers me about this comedy is that there aren't any around like this anymore. The "comedy" today aims at the lowest common denominator - Woody Allen uses the term "crass" to describe them - and for someone of my generation, what passes as comedy today just isn't funny. Today these situational comedies are written off for some reason in favor of stupidity. I don't get it. I lament the days of "Arthur," where you missed some of the jokes in the theater because the audience was laughing so hard, "Night Shift," and "Seems Like Old Times."
