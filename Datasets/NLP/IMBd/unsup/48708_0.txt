To be honest, this film is basically a very poor rip-off of Finding Nemo....<br /><br />and is no where near as good, funny or entertaining, nor is the animation up to the same standard.<br /><br />The plot is roughly the same, although this time he doesn't go after his parents - even the voices sound alike!<br /><br />I really recommend that you don't go and see this film - even little kids who have seen other animated films (such as Finding Nemo, Shrek, Shark Tale, Over the Hedge, Madagascar, etc) may turn up their nose at this one.
