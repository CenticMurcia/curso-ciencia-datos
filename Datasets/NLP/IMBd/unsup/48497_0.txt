This film may have earned a couple of extra stars if it was not for some distasteful content in the film. The manner that this film dealt with the specific key turning point in the lives of the 3 main male characters at which point they change their feelings towards the baby girl is alien to me as a UK westerner.<br /><br />What starts out as a mild comedy, turns in to horror and disgust, when these 'so called' lovable guys shouted "bitch" at a crying baby girl after which they dump her outside a church where she almost drowns and dies! It's not that I am not used to seeing shocking scenes, but these 2 scenes were completely out of context from the flow of the rest of this film, and left you with nothing but disdain for the 3 main characters and their transformation in to lovable caring father figures.<br /><br />Totally tactless on the part of the director.
