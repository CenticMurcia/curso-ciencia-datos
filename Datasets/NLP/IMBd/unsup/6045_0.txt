It's not the worst movie I have seen, but I'm sorry to say it was a GIANT let-down compared to its predecessors.<br /><br />They should'vie stayed off making it. Or at least saved up a little bit more material before having another go.<br /><br />There are a few serious pokes in the general direction of various American famous people and it's hard not to enjoy them. I laughed hard when I realized they were going do do a remake of the "Tom Cruise jumps in Oprah Winfrey's lounge" but my laugh got stuck in my throat quickly as they overdid it.<br /><br />They stretched almost all material too thin. It's sad because I thought the previous Scary Movie movies were good fun.
