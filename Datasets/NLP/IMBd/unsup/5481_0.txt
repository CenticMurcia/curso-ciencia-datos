DAY OF THE BEAST is a film that I've had in my possession for quite a while but just never got around to. Thanks to the prompting of a few adamant friends, I finally threw this one in. Having only seen de la Iglesia's ACCION MUTANTE (which I wasn't a real big fan of...) and PERDITA DURANGO (aka DANCE WITH THE DEVIL - which I did like very much...) I wasn't sure what I was in for with DAY OF THE BEAST. I must say that although flawed, it is one of the better horror/comedy hybrids that I've ever seen.<br /><br />It's Christmas-time, and a priest has learned through his studies the day of the anti-Christ's birth. His goal is to invoke the Devil by performing whatever bits of Satanic mayhem he can in order to eventually "realize" his goal of summoning Satan and killing his spawn. In his quest, the holy-man calls upon the knowledge of a death-metal obsessed record-store clerk, and a cheezy talk-show host to further his cause...<br /><br />A truly funny and well-made production - DAY OF THE BEAST is a fun and twisted black-comedy that should appeal to most horror fans. It's not a graphically gory or sleazy film - but the solid performances, excellent camera-work and solid story-line should keep your interest. The ending is a big anti-climactic which was the only real drawback to me. An otherwise great film that should be at the top of your list...8.5/10
