Loved it, pretty hard edged. Lot's of profanity. Not every bodies cup of tea I guess. Aimed squarely at the Playstation generation. If you like Grand Theft Auto then this film is right up your alley. I'm certain our mum will hate it. I doubt your dad will like it either, but if you're a young guy, and have a twisted sense of humor....rent it now. The way they made it is amazing, shot half the film in one day. Steadicam shots are totally amazing. Some takes are nine minutes long. Lead actors are all brilliant, the dialog's very natural, almost feels like adlib. That takes real talent. Dry Cleaners scene is legendary.
