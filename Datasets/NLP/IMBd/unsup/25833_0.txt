Wow. This really is a lousy movie. There is not one single instance in this film where it doesn't feel like a comedy trying to pull itself off as a thriller. And we know what happens then, don't we? Complete with 2D-characters and single-minded acting, some grotesque details and stupid dialogue, "SÃ¶karna" slithers at the bottom of the heap of bad Swedish movies. Looking back at this film feels like looking back towards the end of a very long tunnel - even though it was made as late as '92.<br /><br />Well...I hear of a sequel. And unless the guy with the skinned fox on his shoulder (yes, you heard me) is in it, I won't go see it.
