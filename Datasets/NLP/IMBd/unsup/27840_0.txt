This film, as a whole, is poor. Things begin well enough, though, with two brothers meandering through life. They like to steal cars, get high, and ask each other pointless questions, some of which are actually funny. Their world is in shambles. They have no friends, their hometown is a dump, and their family is a rather pathetic lot, even if they're presented in a positive light. All of this makes the brothers' oblivion to the world somehow attractive. The other characters in the film are equally ridiculous - corrupt cops, karaoke nuts, and vulgar nouveau riche types. It's fun to laugh when the brothers' pranks catch these folks off guard.<br /><br />However, the film takes an ugly, brutal, and somewhat sadistic turn. Jokes develop into murder, and comedic situations into depictions of suffering. In principle, I don't have anything against murder or violence in films, but these elements spoiled this particular film. In addition, only a small percentage of the jokes are funny to begin with, and you must have a very discerning ear to sift through the strong Welsh accent. The box cover bragged of a tie to Trainspotting (I can't remember how). The film is nothing like Trainspotting.
