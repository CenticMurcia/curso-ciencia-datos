I loved this movie especially the the third segment featuring Pier Angeli. She really did her best portraying a suicidal widow of a Holocaust victim who becomes a trapeze artist after she is saved from drowning by Kirk Douglas's character. I am pretty sure that she relied on her own childhood in Rome for inspiration. She grew up in Rome when World War II was occurring. Her emotional scenes were the best. I can see why Kirk Douglas fell in love with her. It is hard to believe she was only nineteen when she filmed the movie. It is the first color film she did. I think it was be remembered by devoted Anna Maria Pierangeli fans for years to come.
