OK, I love seeing Danny Trejo in films. I didn't actually see him in this one, as he was the voice of El Charro. El Carro (Andrew Bryniarski) was too busy swinging a machete to speak, I guess.<br /><br />Maria is a neurotic mess whose sister committed suicide and is being stalked by El Charro because of some wrong done by an ancestor. She joins her friend Christina (Heidi Androl) and two other girls on a trip to Arizona. Good that they had Tanya (Kathryn Taylor, Miss Kansas USA) along to handle the cop when they got a speeding ticket.<br /><br />Best performance in the film was definitely KellyDawn Malloy as a goth chick who did a shower duet with Tabitha Stevens.<br /><br />Great looking slasher, but the appearance of Archangel Michael and the ending left a lot to be desired, as did the rednecks the girls hooked up with.
