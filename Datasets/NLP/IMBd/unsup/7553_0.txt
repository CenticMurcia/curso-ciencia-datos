It was interesting to see Shaft taken out of his surroundings (NewYork),as he is coerced into taking on an international mission going to Africa to help crack down a slavery racket (Africa to France),and the man at the top. The plot left something to be desired as it came across with some lulls. There is plenty of sex and violence and if that's your bag, then Shaft in Africa is your movie. The bad guys know he's coming as Shaft snuffs out numerous attempts of his life as he carries out his mission. Richard Roundtree does a good job of portraying the indomitable John Shaft. Frank Finlay plays the main villain (Vincent Amafi), who heads the slavery racket. The women of John Shaft are the educated and beautiful Aleme, (Vonetta McGee) plus the alluring and one track minded Jazar, (Yugoslavian actress Neda Arneric). McGee plays the daughter of the Emir, who hires Shaft, and is Shaft's main love interest. Arneric is Amafi's mistress, who offers her assistance to corner Shaft by "diverting his attention". Arneric steams up the big screen with her provocative seduction scene as she entices Shaft aboard the slave smuggling ship. Shaft senses this is a trap as he makes sure the coast is clear and interrogates Jazar, before he finally relents to her persistence and they make love in her cabin. The movie does have a strong ending as Shaft makes his way to Paris and saves the day,as he shuts down the slavery racket. There were other books written by Ernest Tidyman however this served to be the last Shaft movie made during the 70's.
