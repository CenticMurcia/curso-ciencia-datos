This movie is very enjoyable. I loved every minute of it. The story line is very interesting. They bring the fantasy to a very believable state and the acting is great. Loved this movie. Freddie Highmore did a great job as August Rush and made every second of the movie enjoyable. Once you sit and watch this movie you will get hooked and wont be able to get up. As it goes back and forth from the past to present it is very understandable. It makes you understand why the actors are doing what they're doing. When I went to see the movie, the theater was packed. The movie was 100% unpredictable. It is a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone!
