This movie bored me from the overly long intro. None of the women in the video are exceptionally attractive and Mariel Hemmingways height and nose bother me quite a bit, though in some scenes she does look rather foxy.<br /><br />Of course this isn't porno(sure, sure, just tell yourself that) or even porno lite. It's suppose to be a sex comedy that just utterly falls flat. Mike Binder really can't act/write or produce this movie into anything worthwhile or entertaining. He even has a character making a joke about Brunch. It seems Mike is trying to be a cross between Jerry Seinfield & Woody Allen, but he doesn't even have 1/100th the talent of those two aforementioned peoples.<br /><br />The only reason I give it a three is because of some semi-hot woman on woman scenes that you could probably see on TV nowadays.
