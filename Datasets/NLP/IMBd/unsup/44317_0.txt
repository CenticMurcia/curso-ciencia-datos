Well, the story is nothing new here: two girls wish to join a sorority and are asked as their final pledge initiation test to stay in a house known to be haunted(after licking sandals with chocolate sauce and being spanked with a big paddle labeled Daddy). The girls who are testing them and their boyfriends go to the house later that evening to scare them. Trouble of course comes to all when a girl, with an inhuman build and deformed body, starts terrorizing all of them(plus the obligatory pizza guy and a homeless man). Butchered is a bad picture all the way: with actors with virtually no range, hokey special effects, crude plot devices shown on film such as vomiting, a grade z budget, and a story that has been done in some form or fashion many, many times. But the makers of this film weren't trying to do anything else but show a lot of bloodletting, smashed heads and faces, eye gouging, knife cuts and slashes, and the typical devices used in a film of this ilk. We also get a "ghost" with braces. I'm not a gore-hound by any means, but if seeing plastic heads repeatedly slashed at is your thing, then you will be in for a treat. None of the characters are compelling, the plot is threadbare, and there is virtually no humour. Usually a film like this makes fun of itself in some way. What does it have going for it? All of the female cast, except Rebecca and the redheaded ghost with the braces, are very easy on the eyes. Susan Smythe in particular is an eyeful. Only one of the female thespians disrobes so don't expect too much in that area either. The other big plus is that the film lasts only 76 minutes. And as a final plus, I can say that for a bad film, Butchered is at the very least watchable. I didn't have to fast-forward, but rest assured I will not invest another 76 minutes to ever see it again.
