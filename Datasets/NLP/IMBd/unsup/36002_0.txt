The title of this comment is as original as the writing of this programme, what is disguised as witty, alternate comedy is in fact old sitcom rubbish reinvented to create the illusion of decent new age comedy.<br /><br />What the hell is this!? surely channel 4 can put their money to better use? this really is the definition of lazy script writing and poor acting. Terrible, being a fan of "The Mighty Boosh" starring guest star of "the i.t. crowd" Noel Fielding I decided to tune in to watch this garbage. That was my first mistake, after the pilot I hoped it would get better, that was my second mistake. Don't waste your time. If you want to watch alternate popular comedy watch Garth Mareghis Dark Place or Mighty Boosh, steer clear from this.
