Westerns have never really been my cup of tea, I usually feel bored or I just turn them off. However, this Thai western was awesome. There's a good amount of comedy, heart and violence. I never thought I'd be seeing a western from Thailand, but maybe that's what made it better for me. This one is big time fun.<br /><br />The filming and camera work both seem very amateurish and it takes away from the experience a bit, which is the reason I didn't give this movie a 9. The acting is a little iffy at times but good for the most part. Everything else is great, the comedy, the romance and most of all, the bloody violence! <br /><br />See it now or I'll come to your house!
