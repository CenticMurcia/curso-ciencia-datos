Minor Spoilers<br /><br />In Copenhagen, the yuppie Kresten (Anders W. Berthelsen) has just married Claire (Sofie Gråbøl), the daughter of his employer. While in his honeymoon, he is informed that his father has just died. He had omitted his origin from the country and the existence of his family, composed of his father and his mental-ill brother Rud (Jesper Asholt), to his wife and his father-in-law. Claire wants to travel with him for the funeral, but he says that it is not necessary and he would travel alone and be back to Copenhagen in a couple of days. Once in the simple family's farm, he feels the need of a housekeeper to help him with his retard brother. The young prostitute Liva Psilander (the gorgeous Iben Hjejle) applies for the job and is hired by Kresten. Liva brings her troubled brother Bjarke Psilander (Emil Tarding) to live with them. Meanwhile, Claire arrives in the night without previous notice, and when she sees Liva drinking wine with Kresten, she returns to Copenhagen. Kresten is fired by her father and she asks for the divorce. Kresten and Liva falls in love for each other, and Rud and Bjarke becomes friends, forming a weird family. This Dogma 95 film is a delightful Danish dramatic romance. The story is very nice, without being corny. The title of this movie is a game of samurai between Kresten and Rud, and a homage to Toshirô Mifune, the Kikuchiyo from `The Seven Samurai'. The beauty and the smile of Iben Hjejle highlight in a movie without any special effect or lighting. Another great example that it is possible to make a great low-budget movie. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `Mifune'
