Although this movie received a lot of negative press, I was pleased to have seen it. The plot, as with the book, is in my opinion a little dull but the acting I thought was great. Di Caprio and Carlisle can always be expected to do wonders with any part they play. Although I have watched the movie several times, I will be adding it to my DVD collection.
