I'm usually very wary of horror films that centre around a fairy tale basis but this was a brilliant movie. The cast was brilliant (bar from the cop.) The actress who plays Erin has a very Fatal Attraction Glenn Close charm about her and has the ability to go from sweet and innocent to dark and menacing in an instant. The script was remarkably well written. It was very chilling movie and kept you on the edge of your seat. The artistic direction especially the illustrations used to tell the story are breathtaking. I am really hoping that there will be a sequel to this. It also deserves more recognition than. Hats off to everyone who worked on this movie.
