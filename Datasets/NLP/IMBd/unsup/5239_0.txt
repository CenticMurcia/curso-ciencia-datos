The film is a real light one - but I found it very funny. You get to see a bunch of well - known German actors that tell a story that is foreseeable, but the good thing of the film isn't the story, it's how it's told. The quality of the actors that take part in this movie was only possible because they are friends in real life and didn't see the movie as a commercial product in the first place. They did it for fun, and so get to see an uncomplicated movie played by actors you usually wouldn't see in such a movie - and in such a concentration.<br /><br />Gangsters that threaten gangsters, policeman chase all the gangsters, some want money, some want vengeance, some just want to have fun.<br /><br />The acting is very convincing, and the behavior of the characters is sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. Furthermore, the type of the characters is very different and sometimes quite extreme.<br /><br />I like the movie very much. It may not be perfect, but after all I always like to watch the film when it's shown in TV every few years.
