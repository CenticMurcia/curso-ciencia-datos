Not even the Miklos Rozsa Oscar nominated score (a mediocre one at that) can save this boring, Grade B western. Despite Mr. Maltin's high opinion and despite Claire Trevor's desperate attempts to act, this is pretty poor stuff. Albert Dekker is a boring Bat Masterson and Barry Sullivan is his befuddled rival. The girlfriend they share - Trevor - tries to get Bat to give up his guns and take up journalism. This is not a very exciting plot premise. Avoid this one unless you have insomnia.
