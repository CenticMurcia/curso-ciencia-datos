Another day, another bad movie from the "Chilling Classics" boxed set... "Haunts" has a somewhat interesting premise (as other reviewers have stated, overtones of "Repulsion" abound): Ingrid (May Britt) is haunted by the repressed memory of her mother's suicide; she lives on a farm with her hulking uncle (Cameron Mitchell, who once again lends his seal of badness); there's a masked assailant killing local girls with a pair of scissors (in one hilarious moment, he attacks in full view of 2 policemen), and she's just met a poor-postured creep at choir practice. You see, she's a Puritanical girl who shudders at the notion of having her womanly plane violated by a sinister male ("Repulsion" again). There is a ghost-story twist to the whole thing, explained in about as heavy-handed a way as the filmmakers can muster (but still manages to make little sense). By the end of "Haunts," I was confused and apathetic...this might have had something to do with my lulling in and out of sleep while watching. The score by the usually-reliable Pino Donaggio is undistinguished and unmemorable, which is indicative of the film overall.
