I thought D-Yikes was a pretty decent South Park episode.It has Mr Garrison changing once again.It's really funny, at the beginning of the series he started off as a straight(maybe in the closet) male, then he comes out of the closet as a homosexual male, then he got a sex change operation and became a straight female, then in this episode, she becomes a lesbian! After she becomes a lesbian, she visits a bar where lesbians hang out called "LesBos".But it is being bought by Persians and as a spoof of the movie "300", the lesbians fight the persians while Garrison finds a secret of her own about the persian leader.It's alright but not the best South Park episode.
