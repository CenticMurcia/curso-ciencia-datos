This story was so unbelievably corny, this is one of the worse pieces of crap I have seen from the fifties. The dialogue was brightly phony, Lauren Bacall and Robert Stack must cringe at the thought of their appearances in this movie. And the opening title song, Vic Damone crooning as they show various scenes of Lauren Bacall massaging Robert Stack's shoulders and neck! What was that all about??? The film was beautifully done in color (for 1958) but the storyline so bad- what was she doing, trying to train the adopted girl to become her husband's concubine after her inevitable death? I could not stop watching, it was like being at the scene of a disaster. This is definite high camp from the fifties.
