I'm not sure why people keep saying that EMERGENCY SQUAD is merely "above average." This one blew me away, and it's probably the great Stelvio Massi's finest work. Not only do Milian and Moschin turn in outstanding performances (and Milian actually LOOKS much different than he usually does in these Italian actioners), but the shot design is fantastic and understated, with FRENCH CONNECTION-inspired hand-held camera stylistics that left my mouth agape.<br /><br />EMERGENCY SQUAD is a violent, cleverly written, expertly acted poliziotteschi that demands to be seen by fans of Italian cop/crime films. If you enjoy this sub-genre, you owe it to yourself to seek this one out.
