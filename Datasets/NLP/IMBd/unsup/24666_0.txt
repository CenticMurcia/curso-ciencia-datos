This is very moving film, that needed to be made. It shows the inhumanity of slavery from the point of view of those who lived it. With the visual help of Ed Bell, Edward Bell, and Thomas Lennon ,the stories from former slaves that were recorded long ago are brought to life through narratives by some of today's top African-American actors and actresses.This film touches on common aspects that occurred in the everyday lives of slaves. All of the narratives were recorded all across the U.S when many of the former slaves were very old in age.All of the stories were then put into an anthology on which this film is based.This is indeed a film everyone should watch and learn from.
