OK, here's an all-too-familiar story. Following the end of the US-back Shah in Iran, Iraq and Iran subsequently became embroiled in a pointless war. The US, mindful of Iraqi business, supported them for the first few years, but then sold weapons to Iran to counter Iraq's growing success. Profits from these sales went to the Contras in Nicaragua, thus the Iran-Contra scandal begins. After the Iran-Iraq war ends, the US pays Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to combat the Iraqi threat. Here we are today...draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />What a story! Think of the possibilities if some competent screenwriter could make a film adaptation. Alas, this movie isn't anywhere near as engaging. It's Mel Brooks material like 'High Anxiety', any cheap shot that can be taken is taken. What Kubrick had in 'Strangelove', above all else, was research. This is as well-researched into its topic as the 'Left Behind' material or a made-for-tv movie.<br /><br />I don't like Chevy Chase, his method of humor is both unsophisticated and dated even for the 80s. All his expression is in his eyebrows while his voice remains the same.<br /><br />Friedkin hasn't had the best track record. He doesn't keep up with the times, thus he loses his edge.<br /><br />Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud
