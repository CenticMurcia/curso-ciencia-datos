Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday opens with Jason being blown to bits by a S.W.A.T. team at Camp Crystal Lake. That's right...He's done. Oh, but wait! His soul begins to pass from body to body, and he continues his violent killing spree in this manner. Oh, I know it sounds stupid but in reality its...No, you're right. It's stupid.<br /><br />This movie tries to give Jason so much back story that it can't even handle it. We've got the inclusion of Jason's half sister (I'm guessing a rip off of Halloween), and the fact that Jason is immortal because of some device from the Evil Dead series. It turns out that the only way to really kill Jason is to stab him with a magical dagger that only works in the hands of another Voorhees. Apparently that doesn't even work due to Jason X and Freddy Vs. Jason as well as the upcoming sequel. Oh, and the only way he can take back his original body is through a Voorhees. This causes some problems.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are all retarded. They all seem like they're there for comic relief. There's not one serious role in the whole film. The addition of all the mythical b.s. takes all the accountability out of the series...Or whatever accountability was left. There were two parts of this movie I liked. One was the opening. This film opens like a classic Friday the 13th and gives you some hope that it will be okay. Then of course, Jason is blown to bits, just like the movie's plot. The other scene I liked was the end where Jason's mask is lying in the sand after he's been sent to hell, so Freddy Krueger reaches up to grab it. This of course led to 2003's Freddy Vs. Jason. This is a terrible movie, and should only be viewed by true Jason lovers.<br /><br />2/10
