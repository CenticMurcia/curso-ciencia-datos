Excellent film for fans of swords, heros, monsters and beautiful demons. <br /><br />The Angelina Jolie character is sooo sexy. The scene where she seduced Beowulf was excellent.<br /><br />The violence is NOT cartoon-like and this film cannot be recommended for any young children - it WILL give them nightmares.<br /><br />The CGI is very realistic, except for the eyes.<br /><br />Bad things - the accents/voice acting was a bit weird - you had Grendel doing the Old English thing, Beowulf sounding like he was about to ask why Grendel hadn't bought his tool to the fight, etc. <br /><br />I also query why they got squeamish about having Beowulf fight naked, but not show his todger. Either let him wear pants, or let it all hang out... the Austin Powers-like covering his naughty bits with other objects all the time was just silly - having the hero fight naked worked perfectly in the recent Eastern Promises, with Viggo Mortensen giving his all. If he can do it, I don't know why a virtual Ray Winstone has to be shy.<br /><br />Overall, a good film, and well worth a look.
