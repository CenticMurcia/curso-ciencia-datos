In fact they are all spoilers, these ITV "miss Marple" Americanized recasts - spoiling most work of Agatha Christie. Also this one looks like something dragged in by the cat. Complete with a false blond, French-styled womanizer sporting a thin mustache, cozy police inspector John Hannah who appallingly enough gets the (false) blond, in stark competition with, yes folks, a Hollywood movie star version of an American WWII fighter pilot (from Brooklyn), still in his leather jacket! Albeit, even set in 1951 a bit late, one might think (rather than the original early thirties). All these people gathered incidentally as if there was nothing else around to be put in the stew. Griff Rhys Jones as the family doctor for instance, as if straight from Not the Nine O'clock News en route Three men in a Boat, David Warner, as aged landlord of an odd variety of penniless heirs, from Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde, and  amazingly  daughter Emma/Niamh Cusack from Wallace & Gromit! Add a couple of kids from Harry Potter's School of Witchcraft to make it complete. <br /><br />So it's the wrong set and time  and the wrong war from which Christie so skilfully found people to die and disappear in and cook entertaining mysteries of. Here are no mysteries at all, just cannibalizing on a famous brand name, still selling heaps of untampered paperbacks to be found in most bookstalls. Please read them, instead of wasting time on this crap!
