I've seen a lot of these women in prison films, but I don't know why I keep watching them because I've hated every one that I've seen. Jess Franco seemed to enjoy making them, however, as this trash makes up a large proportion of his filmography; and women in prison flicks are probably one of the main reasons why a lot of people's overall impression of the prolific director is not good. 99 Women came fairly early on for this genre, being released in 1969, and as such the film is not as racy as some of the other genre entries. This is not really a benefit or a hindrance, however, as 99 Women is just as boring as most of these films anyway. The plot is just your usual women in prison theme - bunch of girls in jail trying to escape from the awful prison guards etc. It's a shame that this is just another entry in an overpopulated genre too, as the film features a good cult cast - Rosalba Neri is one of my very favourite actresses, and the film also features the likes of Maria Schell and Maria Rohm, as well as the great Herbert Lom; but the cast considered, this is still a rubbish film and I wont be recommending it!
