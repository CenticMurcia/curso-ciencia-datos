I wouldn't call this flick a rip-off of the hokey, nostalgia-soaked 2000 film "Almost Famous" per say, but it's certainly far from being one of the better movies released in recent years to use the free-wheeling, anything goes time period that was the 1970's as the background setting for it's main story. Adam Goldberg, Jared Leto and character actor Darren E. Burrows (probably recognized best by audiences for his role as Ed on the 90's hit sitcom "Northern Exposure") give what are about the best performances here as what little screen time each has is at least somewhat amusing, and to be truly honest the only moments of the film that got me to crack a smile. Other than the aforementioned actors comic relief turns in this flick, the delightful eye-candy that is the luscious Anna Friel and an uneven soundtrack with a small handful of classic 70's rock ditties that still make me want to hold up a lighter even to this day I just can't bring myself to say that "Sunset Strip" is much of a movie, and certainly not one that comes highly recommended to anyone! I've personally never really enjoyed those whole day-in-the-life-of/intertwining stories films that are so popular anymore, and this one in particular didn't really appeal to me based solely upon that said type of plot line alone. However though, I'm still an unabashed and devout sucker for flicks from and or set (which is this one's case) in the 1970's no matter how poorly made, overlong, demented, disjointed, incoherent, lame etc. they may be! It was in all honestly about the only thing that initially caught my eye about it because had the film taken place in any other time period besides the 70's I might have just happily skipped over it altogether, which would have really been the smarter thing to do in the first place!
