Kudos to Channel 4 for showing this amazing comedy but damn them to Hades for not releasing this sooner. This comedy really will divide opinion, those who don't get it REALLY don't get it but for those that do, you really are in for a treat. Hammy doesn't do justice to the acting! Horrendous would be the best thing you could say about the story, dialogue and pretty much everything else about this.<br /><br />But before you run away, stay and watch just one episode and you'll see what a genius Matt Holness is and what a find this comedy is.<br /><br />10-4 (You'll get it after!) PS Why does the DVD of this keep getting put back?
