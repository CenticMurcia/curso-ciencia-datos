i've seen thousands and thousands of films, and this is THE WORST. it's rife with bad sexual puns (oh no! he's a vampire with unusually small FANGS), thorougly disreputable writing, some of the worst acting i've ever seen outside a student film, repetitive jokes and running gags that weren't funny the FIRST time, much less the fiftieth, unattractive people and stomach-turning art direction. When i rate films to my friends, i rate them on a scale of 1-1000 Polish Vampire in Burbanks. SO YES, you should WATCH THIS MOVIE and UNDERSTAND. This is a movie that EVERYONE should watch at one point or another in their lives. Suddenly everything else doesn't look half so bad. Mark Pirro has truly, truly achieved something noteworthy and lasting in this flick of his. I suppose that if you've got to make something bad, you'd better make it REALLY REALLY REALLY bad. "Curse of the Queerwolf" was rather dreadful, but it just doesn't hold a candle to the eternal awfulness of PViB. It's a lot like pro wrestling-- it can be entertaining, in a disgusting sort of way, as long as you watch it with friends, and hopefully while inebriated.
