As I kid back in the glory days of movies before TV invaded everyone's home, a double feature almost always included a "B" oater along with the main attraction, not to mentions shorts, a newsreel and a cartoon. As a kid, I loved those old Westerns where you could get 42 shots out of a six-shooter, the horses running through the same settings and a confrontation at the little cabin in Corriganville between the bad guys and the good guy. Alas, this oater does not rise to the standard of late Gene Autry, Tim Holt or Lash LaRue. It's frankly boring. Alas, the story of three bank robbers who daringly rob a bank of $30,000, slip the posse only to come upon a dying man who was shot for a scant amount of money who begs them to "bring his wife back to him." These 3 bank robbers forsake an easy escape to chase after the most nefarious outlaw since Black Pete of Micky Mouse fame whose spurned girlfriend, who's part of the gang, vows to kill the poor young captive widow. The chase take place in "wild country" down a well groomed road with ambushes and attrition on all sides. Toss in a dysfunctional posse, a prat-falling cameo by George Kennedy, who's in it for the paycheck, add some corny music, amateur night at the local opera acting, not much of a story-line-- except for a maudlin flashback of the hero's psychological wound-- and Voila! Sadly, I note that my wife and I laughed our way through most of it. If you're up for a good "B" oater, check out a Tim Holt,Cisco Kid or one of those other guys' movies. You'll likely be glad you did.
