Richie havens, Joan Baez,country Joe and the fish, and ten years after Alvin lee were great, all the footage made great documentary of the first and only real rock concert. repeats can never be made, the footage of the original event can never replaced, including waiting on line for phones to call home. never happen today, with the cellphones, and could never be repeated. Crosby stills and Nash were also great, along with canned heat. with the rain chant and the arlo Guthrie stating the thruway was closed. todays youth want to repeat this event but the Vietnam conflict enraged this nation, and this was an event involved with and about the Viet Nam war. with 56,000 us soldiers and other killed in Vietnam this is an historical piece what ever your opinion about the war, it is still a tragedy to lose 56,000 to the war.and to this day makes you wonder why?
