Movie adaptations of popular TV shows is not a trend unique to America. The Japanese have been doing it for years before. Odoru Daisosasen (Bayside Shakedown) is but the latest attempt to bring a popular Japanese TV show to the big screen. Based on Fuji TV's popular and hip cop show starring pretty boy Yuji Oda, Bayside Shakedown basically delivers what fans of the TV show expect and want. All the formulas that made the TV show such a hit are all well displayed here. Just as with the TV show there is the right blend of comedy, drama, action and even some bureaucratic intrigue in the mix. Unlike recent American attempts at updating TV shows such as Mission Impossible, The Avengers, Wild Wild West, Mod Squad and the upcoming Charlie's Angels, Bayside Shakedown has not altered or revised it's look (granted Bayside Shakedown is a relatively recent TV show as opposed to the examples said above). All the characters from the show and those actors that played the characters on the TV show are all here. This is basically your equivalent to a TV Movie or `Reunion Show' albeit one geared towards a theatrical release. All that being said, Bayside Shakedown will definitely please fans of the show, but for those like myself who are not really fans it leaves somewhat of a mixed reaction. The story is not all too exciting and the action is somewhat tame for a movie. Bayside Shakedown succeeds solely on the efforts of Oda and the cast and their interactions with each other. There's a lot of flash and style but it might have as well been a direct to video release than a `road show ` movie extravaganza. A nice try but could have been better.<br /><br />
