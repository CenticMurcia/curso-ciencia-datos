This is one of many so-called "educational films" of the 1930s that were really sad excuses for sleazy low-budget producers to make films that could slip nudity and banned material past the censor boards. Starting in late 1933 and early 1934, the Hays Production Code was dramatically strengthened to eliminate nudity, extreme violence and decidedly adult far from movies. Believe it or not, before this time, all kinds of taboos were relatively common in films coming from reputable Hollywood studios. However, after the Code was strengthened, perverts and the curious went looking for seedy material and found it in educational films that were really just excuses to show boobs and talk about sex and drugs. As educational material, some states DID allow these films to be seen, though I seriously doubt that parents went to them to learn how to better raise their children! <br /><br />In this film, a nice but extremely stupid young lady moves to a new town and gets caught up with the wrong crowd. Every time she is offered temptation, she always refuses but then tries EVERYTHING she is offered--making me wonder why they didn't call this film THE GIRL WHO COULDN'T SAY "NO"! As a result, it's obvious she's a total idiot and she graduates from trying smoking to drinking to kissing to doing "the nasty" to ultimately getting an abortion and dying!!! All this is told in a very heavy-handed and moralistic manner that MIGHT have worked had they also not shoved a few gratuitous scenes of ladies with no clothes on or in their underwear! All in all, this is a very bad film but it is a bit more watchable than the standard sleazy exploitation film. Worth a look and worth a laugh!!
