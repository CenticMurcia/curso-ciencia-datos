When thinking about German resistance against Hitler, most people can think only of one name: Stauffenberg. Klaus-Maria Brandauer reminds the world that a humble carpenter tried to save the world from the horror of WW2, all by himself.<br /><br />A great movie, full of suspense, with great actors - especially Brandauer himself. <br /><br />Especially impressive is the way Brandauer as director managed to show the atmosphere of Nazi-Germany immediately before the war, and atmosphere of fear and mistrust that forced Elser to go to extremes in hiding his plans.
