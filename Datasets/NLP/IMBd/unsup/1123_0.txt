I just rented this movie last weekend, and I can't understand why it only was NOMINATED for a Razzie. That's crap. This movie, by far, was one of the funniest movies I've seen, and it was well worth watching. Eugene Levy was great, Samuel L. Jackson was great, even Kathryn Greenwood, from "Whose Line is it Anyway?", played the great flight attendant. This movie is full of hilarious lines, which I'm sure you'll be quoting, and some incredibly funny situations. From slapstick to serious comedy, this movie has it all, all wrapped up into a great story that will keep you rolling and crying. I'm surprised no one has seen or even heard of this movie, but I say it's good. Oh well, just watch it, and you'll agree with me, I guarantee it.
