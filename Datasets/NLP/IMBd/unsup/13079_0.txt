I've lived few a number of long term relationships and the marriages of the two couples here rang true to me. Particularly the realization that when a marriage evolves into one dealing with day-to-day responsibilities of bringing up children and the daily business of our lives, the marriage seems to suffer.... but, the difference between the two couples is that one decides to stay together and cope with the realities of life, while the other couple looks elsewhere to recapture the adventurous feelings of new love with a new partner. The question becomes: Do you stay for the long haul and have the day-to-day routine become part of a richer tapestry, or do you leave to find fresher new stimulus each time the honeymoon phase is over?
