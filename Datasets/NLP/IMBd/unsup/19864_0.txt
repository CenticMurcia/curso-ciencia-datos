The received wisdom is that sequels don't work but against that we need to consider French Connection II, Godfather II etc. That's Entertainment II works in the sense that for musical buffs a That's Entertainment XI would work if it offered MORE clips of musical movies even of the most dubious quality. This sequel rightly makes the point that 'entertainment' is not exclusively words and music and backs up the point by including snippets of comedy and drama at which MGM also excelled. Although in my book Astaire leaves Kelly for dead, always has, always will, it was still great to see them getting the lion's share (ouch) of footage as co-hosts even if - as more than one poster has stated - they were saddled with some of the most inept and cringe-making parody lyrics. A welcome addition to the genre.
