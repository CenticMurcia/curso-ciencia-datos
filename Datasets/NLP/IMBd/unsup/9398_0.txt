Boris Karloff stars as a Greek general in 1912, trapped on an island in quarantine with a house full of people trying to avoid the plague. And is there an evil spirit at work also? This film is a horrifying journey from reason and faith to superstition descending into madness. Wonderful performances by all, but especially Karloff, help to carry this movie. But the setting and the camera work do wonders as well. From a gritty, yet realistic and lighter background initially to a much more dark and Gothic atmosphere in keeping with the story line and the characters' mental state, reminiscent of the subtle, yet terrifying atmosphere of Cat People, the mood of the film is both effective and frightening.<br /><br />I can think of few things worse than being quarantined after exposure to a deadly pestilence with limited medical resources...relying only on hope to save me, which quickly turns to despair as those around me fall into the darkness. Or the horror, which would almost certainly drive me mad, of being buried alive.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and will definitely watch it again.
