('Til today I thought TDK was going to the best movie of '08.)<br /><br />Make no mistake about it this is David Fincher's best film! ...Button has all the power of Seven but for entirely different emotional reasons.<br /><br />This is a warm, thoughtful, thought-provoking, heart breaking, uplifting example of what happens when great writing meets visual artistry.<br /><br />The only thing I'll say about about the story is that it is about the love of Life & Death & Love. Those of you who --like me-- who were looking for the ultimate Twilight Zone episode will not be disappointed. It is a love story. It has a love of language. It is complex. It is beautifully acted. It breathes (it is nearly 3 hours long because it had to be). It uses lightning as a punchline over & over again to great effect.<br /><br />Fincher has always been a Michaelangelo, a Rembrandt, a DaVinci when it comes to visuals & he at the height of his powers here. If you are not seduced by what you see then Button may bore you. There are frames in this film that I could stare at for long, long minutes rather than the few seconds that they appear on screen.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />No movie works if the story doesn't grab you. Obviously this one has it. Visuals aside, it is a delight to listen to as well as look at.<br /><br />The performances from a large cast lead by Brad Pitt & Cate Blanchett are wonderful.<br /><br />I've read some early reviews that the movie is ultimately cold --a common Fincher rap. It has Fincher's trademark intellect (if he hasn't trademarked it yet, he should). IT IS NOT COLD. It has the emotional power of a tugboat bring in a wrecked liner.<br /><br />Others criticize Button for being too much of a good thing & that it has too many elements & it does. And I'd rather have a film try too hard then try too little.<br /><br />You had to wonder why they waited until Christmas Day to release this film. The answer arrives when you see it because it is the only day they could have released it. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is Santa's (and Fincher & crew') present to people who truly love movies.
