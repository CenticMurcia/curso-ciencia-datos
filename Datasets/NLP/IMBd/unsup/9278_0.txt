Here in Mexico, Cantinflas is praised as one of the best mexican comediants of all time. And with good reason! This is one of his first films and, in my humble opinion, his best. Maybe it turned out to be so good because in the time this movie was released he wasn't a big star yet.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to everyone who speaks spanish. People from other countries may not get it because this is SO mexican, that even non-mexican spanish-speakers may have a hard time getting all the jokes.
