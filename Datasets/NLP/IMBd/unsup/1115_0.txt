This film gives you an unusually good look into the creative process, along with frank discussion of the problems and sacrifices that most artists have to deal with and accept in order to keep their creative channels open. The casual use of the cameras facilitates the conversational feel and the directness of the artists communication. Ultimately it allows us to share the experiences of a some great artists in their search for true expression, which is really a universal human need and it certainly evoked some empathy in this writer. Of significance is the clear communication that dedication to their art form, the performance and sharing of their music is much more important to them than the money they earn.
