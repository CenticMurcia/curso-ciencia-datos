Camp is a great film. It's entertaining, funny, an I don't even like musicals. It explores the challenges outcast drama kids face during adolescence. Some kids deal with the questionable sexuality, others deal with complicated friendship, but they all bond together through their love of musical theater.It's a wild ride but it's very entertaining, and the best part is that the cast is actually real drama kids. They are not typical Hollywood kids and they do their own singing. The acting is not all that great, but it's totally worth watching. The wardrobe is pretty much hilarious. It reminds me of all the people in my drama club a little weird but cool if you get to know them.Give this movie a chance!
