I highly anticipated this movie, having enjoyed the book. Was very disappointed, as the movie either left out most of the exciting parts of the book or completely changed them. If you have an interest in the Titanic or in spy/action novels I highly recommend the book, but not the movie. Might be watchable if you haven't read the novel.
