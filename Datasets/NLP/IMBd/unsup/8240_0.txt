MOUSE WRECKERS (1948) is my second favorite Warner Brothers cartoon (after the delightful FEED THE KITTY). Thankfully, a few years later, Warner decided to bring back the goofy mice from MOUSE WRECKERS, Hubie and Bertie, and the results are just about as terrific as the previous film.<br /><br />The cartoon begins with enormously fat mice (Hubie and Bertie) leaving a cheese factory. They have eaten so much cheese that now they can't stand the thought of ever eating it again. So, they decide that life now has no meaning and they want to kill themselves by giving themselves to the cat to be eaten. But, just as the cat is about to eat them, he realizes that they mice MUST be poisoned--why else would they give up so easily?! So, he becomes phobic about eating mice--refusing ever to eat another. And, in the cat's case, too, he realizes life has no meaning without eating mice so he tries to get the dog to eat him! And, predictably enough, the dog is now afraid to eat cats because he thinks they are poisoned and most of the movie consists of the mice and cat doing terrible things to try to force them to be eaten! It's a real laugh riot!
