The reason this show works so well is that unlike certain other ghost hunting shows it is not full of believers. There are only 2 presenters, Chris Fleming and Gail Porter. Chris is the 'sensitive' with the gift of being able to communicate with, feel and 'see' the dead. He has been developing his talent since he was a young boy and is definitely one of the best I have seen. Gail Porter on the other hand is a skeptic and needs a bit on convincing. Together they travel America looking for the spirits of the 'Dead Famous'. They are both rational and don't freak out at the slightest little noise which is where I think a lot of paranormal shows are going wrong at the moment. They are willing to admit when they don't find anything and this makes the show refreshing and unfake! An excellent show.
