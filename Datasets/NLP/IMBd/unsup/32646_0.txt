Van Wilder 2 does not have the character 'Van Wilder' from the first film in any scene. One would expect such a film to be bad. What is notable about this film is that it is not only bad, but it is as bad in relation to the rather low quality first film as this fact would imply.<br /><br />Van Wilder 2 is a clear cross between the first "Van Wilder", and the classic '80s college frat film "Revenge of the Nerds". Since "Van Wilder" (1) had a poor plot, a person might expect that this could be an improvement, but the crossbreeding is driven solely by the lack of creativity in the writers. Beyond a cursory plot, the film lacked dramatic tension, has poor plot detail execution, a distinct 'gag' or prank shortage, and inherently weak and under-characterized supporting characters.<br /><br />I had high hopes of Kal Penn, and in fact I cannot fault his performance (as opposed to his choice of roles) but the film, and his role is so weak that this counts for little. A film of this sort requires interesting, if often two-dimensional supporting characters, and while Lauren Cohen, the female lead, does a creditable job, the rest of the supporting acting is rather bad.<br /><br />To sum up, a very poor film, and a nearly humor-free comedy.
