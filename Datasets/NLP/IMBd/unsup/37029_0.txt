"Spies Like Us" to me was a movie that could have been so much more. Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd together is a combination that has so much potential. The movie did put them in some pretty funny situations. Chase with the Russian interrogators was a humorous moment in the movie. I just felt like there could have been more. Both are very good at spurting off one-liners, Chase especially, but even their one-liners in this movie seemed like they needed some work. This is one of those movies that was good to watch, but I'm not sure if it will be one that I'll always remember.
