This film is just one banal art-house cliche after another. Through its gruelling 2.5 hours, there is not a single original or challenging idea. It's formulaic approach suggests it was made to appeal to the middle-aged NPR/PBS crowd (Rashomon-like multiple viewpoints, struggles to come to terms with one's sexuality, exploring the fabric of a generic working class community). For the right-brained among us, there is little here to appeal to the intellect. For the left-brained, the clumsy writing and hammy acting brings you little more drama than you would find in a Lifetime movie of the week. There are so many good films available on video - ones that can truly move and touch us all. Don't waste an evening on this.
