I was lucky enough to catch a free preview screening of this masterpiece of slap stick kung fu genius, and i feel that i should now pay the theater anyways. Let me explain:<br /><br />Suppose God had a bad day and decided to cheer himself up by creating a new man. This man was one part Charlie Chaplin, one part Bruce Lee, a half a teaspoon Jackie Chan, and an injection of every Looney Toon ever created.<br /><br />This is quite likely how Stephen Chow came into existence.<br /><br />Now imagine that after creating this man, God bestow on him an army of stunt-men, a type writer, a movie camera, a hefty special effects budget, and a eighty wardrobes worth of axes, black suits and top hats.<br /><br />This is quite likely how Kung Fu Hustle came into existence.<br /><br />Ebert has already said that this a movie where Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Bugs Bunny and Quentin Tarantino, but i think that needs to be amended : Imagine a movie where Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Bugs Bunny and Quentin Tarantino, and then the whole crew go to a opium bar for 36 hours. This movie was great, at least as good if not a little better than Shaolin Soccer, the smash hit Chow made back into two thousand. You never doubt the abilities of any random person to be a master of kungfu or, completely not a master of kung fu.<br /><br />Also, the cartoonish beating and contortions that every character seem to be able to endure are so brilliantly installed in the film that despite their utter impossibility, no one ever questions their validity. Characters and fly through the atmosphere, surrounded in an aura of flame and not even have a scratch when they reach the ground.<br /><br />Where Sin City was a living comic book Kung Fu Huslte a living cartoon, and no one stops laughing for the entire time.
