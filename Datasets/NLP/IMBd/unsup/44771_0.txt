I have no clue as to what the people are thinking that call this the best Alien rip off. First off, it is similar to Alien in atmosphere but it is really closer to Forbidden Planet in plot although nowhere near as good.<br /><br />I remember seeing in the theater as a 13 old around 1981-82 whenever it came out. The only memory I had of the movie was the poster for it in a the theater and the fact is had Jonie (Erin Moran) from Happy Days in it.<br /><br />I saw the movie last week for the first time in theaters and I see why I have no memory of it. There is nothing worth remembering. I expect a Roger Corman movie to be cheesy and suspension of disbelief is a requirement. However this movies sets where so cheap and the plot line was so bad that you honestly will have trouble remembering what happened in the movie the next day after seeing it.<br /><br />I have seen many comments about the rape scene and I personally don't find maggot rape to be a form on entertainment but that scene that was shown in the R-rated cut was cheesy and not going to disturb anyone.<br /><br />The movie had more violence than I remembered and tried to be mean spirited but really amounted to not much of anything. The movie just ends in a hurry with not much of an explanation.<br /><br />I would suggest searching for another creature feature if you are in the mood for B-Movie entertainment. The cast for this B flick looks pretty good on paper but it is executed horribly. This movie was obviously made in a hurry with no money for reshooting scenes.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.
