An erotic love story.<br /><br />Big Joe used his usual plot devices here.<br /><br />Prostitution ring disguised as a modeling agency services wealthy clients of all types. I couldn't tell if this was filmed in the U.S. or Europe. But wherever it was filmed, it looked great.<br /><br />Seeing Mark Shannon play a cowboy was actually funny. But do cowboys really call every woman they meet 'filly?' <br /><br />Laura (Goddess Supreme) Gemser matures in her roles and actually plays the boss of women instead of just a rebel. I hated the fact that she cut her hair. She looked better with it loooooooong. She's still a Goddess however.<br /><br />The sub-plot about the young lad dealing with potential homosexuality was a tad weird.<br /><br />But the lass in the lead looked GREAT. Her massage scene with the Turk left me gasping.
