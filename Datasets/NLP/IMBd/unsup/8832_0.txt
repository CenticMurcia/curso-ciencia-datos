I started to watch it just because of the spoiler, when one of girls writes something bad on a coat and the woman leaves and everyone see's it. I loved that, so I had to watch. I gave it a chance and I was sucked in immediately. I absolutely loved it right away. The characters are wonderful and the actress' play them beautifully. But I do have to say, what did keep me watching was Kirby.Lord help me. I fell deeper in love and began to watch it just to see him. Its great, its hot, steamy and intriguing.The womens stories are great, and how they handle it all is interesting as well. I am keeping my fingers crossed for a great second season.
