It was a good movie, with a great comedic story, and I can't see any flaws in it whatsoever. I've watched it a couple times through. There's no bad acting in it and it includes two of the best actors of that era--Rick Moranis and Joan Cusack. While I like Steve Martin and have seen many of his films, I can't say he's all that great of an actor, just kind of funny. In this one, however, he had a hard role to play, and he played it well, doing great voice-acting too. I can recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's very enjoyable and funny. I like it.
