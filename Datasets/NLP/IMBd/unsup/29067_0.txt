Cowboy Bebop is bloody fantastic anime. I could watch it over and over, not get bored with it.<br /><br />Admitidly, not everyone can understand a certain anime, which means then you'd have to see it right from the start, or you'll be bored to death. A lot of anime's do have concepts that are sort of hard to understand the first time around, but Bebop is pretty simplistic and to be fair I first viewed it at, I think, the middle of the whole series, I got it no sweat.<br /><br />Despite being simplistic, it does not disappoint. It carries it's humor, action, drama, and style around without a slight flaw. The voice acting in both versions is great as well, including the marvelous musical score by Yoko Kanno.<br /><br />In short terms, Bebop is flawless. No debate whatsoever if you ask me.<br /><br />In a lot of cases it appears that the sub version triumphs over the dub version easily. With Beobp, though I'm in the middle of which is better here. I love both with a passion. Who am I kidding? There both great.<br /><br />Bebop is a solid watch indeed.<br /><br />A perfect 10 out of 10.
