When we rented this movie, my girlfriend and I expected a basic feel-good comedy, nothing great, just easy.<br /><br />We lived in India for a while, doing research on IT outsourcing. So we decided to rent outsourced. It actually turned out to be a good movie! It managed to capture a lot of things which were so familiar to us, a trip down memory lane, the amazement we felt at being there.<br /><br />Although the plot is quite predictable, this did not matter much as the beauty is in the details. It has a lot of India, portrays traveling Americans (and we all love those) and even manages to make the entire outsourcing debate insightful without being condescending.<br /><br />The film left us both with a real smile on our face, something only very few comedies manage to do.
