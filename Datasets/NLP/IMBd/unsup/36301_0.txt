Proceeding his debut, no-budget hit "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", Tobe Hooper moved onto more secluded inbreeder carnage with "Eaten Alive" - the touching story of a lonely hotel proprietor and his man-eating crocodile. None of the guests last through the night, yet a surprising abundance of folks happen to be cruising through the backwoods bayou late at night. We see an assortment of colorful characters wanting a room such as: a weary hooker, a masquerading wife with her severely disturbed husband and frantic child, a father and daughter looking for a missing person, and a young Robert Englund who happens to be an arrogant patron of the local whorehouse... "Eaten Alive" is basically Hooper working off the success of "TCM" to a visually lesser extent... Every interior and exterior is obviously a set and, as I mentioned, the characters seem to role in, one after another, just to be killed off by the croc. Not that our one-legged maniac isn't a delightfully zany guy, but the movie just FEELS very low-budget and effortless...
