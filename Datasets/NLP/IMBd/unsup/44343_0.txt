I can't believe anyone thought this movie was any good. It follows 2 women, only one of whom generated any empathy with the audience, and even that was a stretch and only temporary as the movie unfolds. Life's hard - we knew that, but that's no excuse for what happens.<br /><br />The whole thing was senseless, completely lacking in any material that was thought-provoking and a total waste of time.<br /><br />There was an attempt at character development, but it was very shallow, especially considering events which occur later on which are not in keeping with what little character development did occur.<br /><br />The ending, in contrast to what some other reviewers claimed, was not a shock other than that it was put together so poorly.<br /><br />I suppose if you generally like movies aired on Lifetime, this one might be for you, but as for me it only reinforces the reasons why I generally don't bother with them.
