I consider myself to be more cynical, jaded, and negative than most people, but this movie will not allow it! This is an honest, feel-good movie with likeable characters and a story anyone can relate to. It is very well-written and well-acted as well. It also has a really good ending, which is very important. This is one of those movies I took a chance on in the rental store, and boy am I glad that I did! Enjoy!
