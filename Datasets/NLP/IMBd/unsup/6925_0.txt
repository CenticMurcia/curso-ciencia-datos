I find this one of the most moving stories because it is not a frolic through the daisies, walking along the beach and live happily ever after stories. The leading man is not the "prince charming" that it is rumored most women seek. The heroine is not the perfect girl-next-door sweetheart that has men lining up for a dance. Their lives are not enviable. Their relationship is not coveted. I can't even say that the characters are admirable or likable. In fact some might find them contemptuous. However, it is a story about love that doesn't shy away from a reality of true love that few dare to portray - pain, sacrifice and possibly doing the wrong thing.
