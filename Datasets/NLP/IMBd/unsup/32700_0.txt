This film started out with a humorous, well-written screenplay that had potential, but this was wasted by the incompetent direction of its writer, Jordan Hawley. This film is Hawley's directorial debut and it couldn't be a better illustration of his complete lack of directorial confidence, creativity, or thoughtfulness. The dialogue is delivered in a forced, emotionally false way. There are many comedic cheap shots and the humor has a needlessly mean spirit. On a technical note, the cinematography is pretty good with some vibrant colors and a few of the supporting performances, notably Fred Willard's, are funny. However, the film panders to the lowest common denominator and follows a predictable formula. Despite its low- budget, this film has none of the wit and edge you would expect of an indie. It is "mainstream comedy" in the worst sense of the term.
