This was the worst movie I have ever seen based on a book. Everything was messed up. There were ten survivors in the end not six. So much was left out of it. Mr.Tolken would probably not like this at all. I was so angry when I watched this movie that I threw it in the trash after I broke it in a million pieces and cut the tape to shreds.
