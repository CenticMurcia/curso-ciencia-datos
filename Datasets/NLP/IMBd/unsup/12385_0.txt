This movie was the best movie i ever seen. All the action and fighting that was going on made it to be a movie thats in real life and its not like there is magic making it a fake movie. I hated it at first and then until i really watched it i fell in love with it. I even went out to get the second movie. You cant watch one without the other. Ving Rhames really played the part and played the part well. I cant wait to see of there is going to be a part 3. Anyone that has not seen the movie i would suggest that they do. What Ving Rhames did in prison to defend himself was amazing. The wise man that he met that changed his life really added to the movie well.
