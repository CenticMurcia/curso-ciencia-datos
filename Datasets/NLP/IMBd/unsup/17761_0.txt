Great acting, great cast, great effects, great plot. This movie has it all...suspense, twists, and a little action. Even a small bit of romance. I've watched the movie a zillion times, every time picking something new out of it. Lately I've found a few mistakes in it, the latest being a scene where a headlight burns out in one camera angle scene and not in another... but that's another story. If you like adventure movies, this one's for you!
