Contrary to the other comments by macjoubert, Keith is NOT pro-democrat as stated there. He is however anti republican, but if you pay attention to his show you see he is just as hard on the democrats as the republicans. He goes after all the idiots running our country and points them out for what they really are.<br /><br />Yes he is biased, he has his opinion and speaks it loud and clear, but perhaps that's what makes him so good. Unlike a lot of other news groups which just spout off the latest talking points from Karl Rove, or what the Neo Cons would have them say, unlike the lame, democrat biased reporters who are too weak to stand up to our failed government policies and speak the truth. Keith is NOT afraid to tell it like it is. He and unlike those who try to defend the republicans, Keith actually shows proof and makes sense with what he says. Go to Rush, or Bill O'Reilly's show and you will find nothing but baseless claims, aimed at destroying freedom of speech, freedom of though and the American Way. This is Free America, NOT Natzi America! It's time we had more reporters like Keith Olbermann
