Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello co-produced this nostalgic romp about two swingin' teen lovers from the 1960's now married and middle-aged, coping with the passing of time (not good material for a comedy) and the problems of their own punk kids. It has guest spots and musical numbers galore, but unlike the themes in "Grease", for instance, this doesn't have the impact or widespread appeal to be wildly successful; it just doesn't work. The film has a very weak script, which certainly was no help to the director. The scenes don't build any momentum, and the nostalgia in seeing Avalon and Funicello together again is a little bit painful (where's all the chemistry? All they do here is bicker). A lot of people put their time and talent into this picture, but it doesn't soar, doesn't spark fond memories. It's a wash-out. *1/2 from ****
