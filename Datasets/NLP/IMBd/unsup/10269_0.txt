Wonderful story line, great actors, priceless characters. It clearly shows to all the similarities between Greeks and Turks who'd mostly like to think they are different. The ugly side of prejudice, family love, day to day lives of a couple of families with socially different backgrounds that were forced to be joined by marriage and a common grandson are all shown on this sitcom beautifully. The acting is superb, there is not a person that appears on this show that I could claim does not belong. My husband and I anxiously await Friday nights each week to watch it. My husband's father was among the Turks sent out of the Island of Crete many years ago, so he can identify with the Greek family that were forced to leave Istanbu. He enjoys the show from 2 different angles. It is nice to see a situation of this sort under a funnier light as opposed to heavy dramatic flavouring!
