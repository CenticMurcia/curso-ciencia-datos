After nearly two decades of avoiding kung fu movies, a copy of this one was pressed into my hands by a very dear friend... who then extracted a promise from me that I'd take the time that night to sit and watch it. I was less than enthusiastic when I tossed it into the drive of my Athlon, but a promise is a promise, after all. Five minutes later, a nuclear strike warning in my town couldn't have torn me away from the screen, and it's been watched a dozen times since.<br /><br />There's always been a certain cheesiness to Hong Kong cinema, but on rare occasions a writer or director will directly tap a nerve and somehow weave that directly into the story: 'Kung Fu Hustle' is one of those films. This piece isn't simply a 'standard' kung fu movie; it's a romance, a sweeping portrait of good-versus-evil, and a moral lesson on the use of power. The comedic bits are so well integrated into the story that it flows smoothly from one tone to another. The fight choreography is stellar, and special care was taken to make sure that every character in the piece is human. There're no 'perfect' people or places, and it somehow makes the wire fighting that appears in parts seem believable. The acting is excellent and the camera work is all rock steady.<br /><br />Feeling jaded? Burdened? Wonder if it's possible for one person to make a difference? Settle in with a copy of this film, and believe...
