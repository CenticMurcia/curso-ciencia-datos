Opinions and taste is up to an individual: logic is not.<br /><br />Having worked in five countries and been around the block...a few times,I know the value of being able to chill out in order to get positive goals done! Dynomutt allows people to relax and it is a no brainer. Good nostalgia cartoons? You bet we need'em in this,sometimes,too serious world being materialistic (and look where that did go since last year). A good laugh is priceless and well needed nowadays. <br /><br />Anyway,isn't it amazing that this DVD has been redone in 2006 shows,somehow,its popularity: trust me,in business they do not do it because they feel like it. They did it because there is a demand...<br /><br />Even me,being French dig the coolness of this cartoon.
