Right from the first frame, Mr. Drach displays his vivid imagination, sparkling style and a splendid sense of irony, together with a socially aware attitude that transcends the usual clich√©s about age. His film is fun, rousing and a startlingly humanistic look at what might be, if we all shared a generous, more enlightened view of the generations that came before our own.<br /><br />The look of the film belies its modest cost which testifies to a close collaboration between the director and his cinematographer for intention and effect are wedded seamlessly, a gift to both the film and its audience. Not many short films are able to so quickly make their point and arrive at that point in so entertaining, lively and surprising a fashion. <br /><br />One wishes for more from such a fresh viewpoint, so we can only hope that this brilliant filmmaker can find the means to continue on his chosen path and that we can join him as he constructs each film signpost along the way.<br /><br />Have a look and then a second; it's well worth the time. Just be careful with the bubbles.
