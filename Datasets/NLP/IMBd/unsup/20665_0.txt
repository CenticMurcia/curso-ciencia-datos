If you are a film buff and the type that likes serious action and great fight scenes, then this is a movie well worth renting! This is the second indie film that I have seen starring Bas Rutten and this guy has a great screen presence. I would compare him to being a cross between Arnold Schwartzeneger and Vin Diesel. I heard this movie was low budget (less than a million $), but it did not look low budget at all. They must have put every penny up on the screen. I would give it 4 out of 5 stars. It is available at just about any video store. I can not wait to see their next film... hopefully they will have another movie out within the next year!
