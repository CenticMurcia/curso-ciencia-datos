Six friends plan to fix up an old house that one of them bought. But after one moron breaks the husband murdering previous owner's tombstone in half, she comes back to life and starts killing them. They in turn become zombies themselves. But they don't act like typical zombies in the least. Just the opposite some of them are positively chatty. Woulds like "low-budget" or "indy" or "can do spirit" does not translate into a good film. I don't care if someone spent all his money, or shed all his blood to make a film. If said film is a turd. I'll call it a turd. This isn't a total awful film, but it's damn near close to it.<br /><br />My Grade: D-
