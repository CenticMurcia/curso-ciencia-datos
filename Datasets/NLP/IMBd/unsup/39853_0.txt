Ricky(Eric Freeman), the brother of Billy(the killer from the first film)is the psycho donning the Santa outfit..well, for a moment or two..this time, explaining to a psychiatrist what occurred to his brother years back. This screen time is merely a shameless excuse to save money while taking cash from paying customers who ventured in to see it. They practically show most of the first film and then we get thirty or so minutes of Ricky killing people. The most inventive kill comes when he attacks bookie with an umbrella that opens after being thrusted through the stomach. He provides us with little snippets of his past while chatting with the psychiatrist(..who stupidly insisted that a security guard wait outside the room..this understanding that he's in the room with a man who shot numerous people for no reason whatsoever). We get a little understanding of a possible love-life with Elizabeth Kaitan's Jennifer. There's a confrontation with Jennifer's former boyfriend who has a smart-Aleck mouth and says the wrong thing which sets off Ricky's trigger leading to the use of jumper cables as a weapon! The film has a truly sickening scene where Ricky goes on a shooting rampage down a suburban street killing as many innocent people as his gun allows him. Even more despicable than that is when Ricky attacks a wheel-chair bound, facially scarred nun with an ax.<br /><br />Eric Freeman is truly awful as the killer of the film. Even worse is how the film tries to turn this putrid slasher into a comedy. Dreadful trash.
