Having been to Bahrain, I enjoyed picking apart all the inaccuracies in the film. Like: The Manai plaza is in the middle of a sand lot and is much more militarized. The rooms in the movie were your standard sized Hollywood "barracks room" set. The rooms at the Manai are huge, and by hotel standards, rather top notch. The mall is in the middle of the city, not the suburbs. A house like the one the princess lived in wouldn't be on a tree lined boulevard, open to the common folk. Most nice homes over there are behind walls. The "Tree of Life", being the only thing worth seeing over there, would not be so isolated as to allow the princess to talk to, much less make out with, an unclean infidel. Tourists go there all the time. Whoever suggested shooting in suburban southern California should have been fired. They were in Vegas anyway,why not shoot there?
