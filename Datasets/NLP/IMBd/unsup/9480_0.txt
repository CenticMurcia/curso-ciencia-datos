I loved this movie. We were lucky enough to find it years ago as a rental. This is a wonderful story about a little boy who is bullied by his peers and hated by his aunt. He is magically transported by a large head emanating from a bottle, no less, to a "land of faraway" where he discovers that he is a prince. He gets hold of a magic cape that makes him invisible along with other magical items like magical bread. He, and another child fight the dreaded evil lord who is turning the children into birds that must forever circle the castle. This is a wonderful movie that is completely overlooked. My kids loved it and so did I. (We couldn't stop laughing during the giant head part!) There are so many magical moments in this story. Don't miss it!
