According to TV host John Burke, what happened in this movie almost never happens... The main actors in the film were unknowns, who remained unknowns, while those behind the scenes became household names. This movie is directed by Barry Levenson, written by screenwriter Chris Columbus, and executive produced by Henry Winkler (remember the Fonz?). Now, here are the actors: Nicolas Rowe, Alan Cox and Sophie Ward? Ever heard of them? (Each of their careers flourished in the UK, but not in the states). This film, while it does take great liberties with Doyle's writings, is highly entertaining. For the ladies, there's a touching love story set in the Victorian Era, for the guys, there's sword fighting and awesome special affects. For the kids, there's a mystery figure cloaked in black, as well as the screens' first completely computer generated character (If they tell you he looks fake, just say it was only 1985). Recently, near a London school for boys, several men have experienced violent, and unexplained deaths. Ther appears to be no connection between them, but a teen aged Sherlock Homes thinks differently. (Parents, don't worry, there's no "gore" in this one). This is an imaginative tale depicting how the infamous pair (Homes and Watson) might've met. Have fun pretending as you watch; if you're looking for accuracy and detail relating to Doyle's writings, you won't find it here. This movie follows the phrase "Lets just suppose"... A terrific family film, though specific scenes could be frightening for very young children. There is no sex (literal, or implied), and very little language (I think I counted 2 words). Have fun!
