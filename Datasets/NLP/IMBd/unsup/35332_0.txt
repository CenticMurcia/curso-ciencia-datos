Normally I'm one to enjoy a mindless action movie regardless of writing, acting or directorial style. These are generally good movies to watch as entertainment in the background. Last night I queued up "Fugitive Hunter." I was disappointed. This movie didn't succeed at anything. It was too flat to have any sort of compelling drama, the action was too badly-choreographed to get any adrenalin flowing, and the movie too itself too seriously to gain any significant "camp" value. The writing and directing were not only sub-par, they were almost laughably bad. Unfortunately they weren't so bad as to inspire actual laughter, but rather only a disbelieving sidelong stare. <br /><br />Maybe if it's 3AM and you can't sleep and this movie is on cable it might be worth tuning in for a few minutes, but I just can't recommend spending any money on this flick.
