I'm not sure where to begin. The cinematography/editing of this movie was terrible. Colors were frequently washed out, the 360-degree shot in the briefing room was out of focus, on and on...Continuity/fact checking left much to be desired, too, like the cash register at the diner that clearly shows "4d" on it's "display" (4 pence? in an American diner?) All of the actors were just abysmal. The dialog was laughably bad. And the story: It made no sense, bouncing like a pinball from here to there and then wrapping everything up in a nice, tidy package in the last 5 minutes as if DePalma said "Uhoh, running out of film, let's wrap this up!" There are great movies, good movies, mediocre movies, bad movies, and then there's the Black Dahlia.
