This is a great movie. I am amazed that some folks rated it "5" or less. Perhaps the horribly miscast Shelley Long gave these folks indigestion. Maybe there was a negative reaction to seeing "The Fonz" in a completely different light. Oh well, their loss. This movie has many great moments ("This is Chuck reminding Bill to shut up!" . . . "Call Starkist!" . . . "LOVE BROKERS!!!!" . . . etc.) and is well worth seeing. Now available on DVD!!
