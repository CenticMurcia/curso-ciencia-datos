For a low budget movie I guess you can say that it...no, can't even say anything good about this film. Sorry, I tried. From the start to the finish this film had no signs of a script, direction, talent,...the works. If you like cheesy horror films that follow the same mass produced guideline over and over again, then this is your flick. But if you're looking for some entertainment value...something that will peak your interest for at least 2 minutes, then you definitely need to stay away from this one.<br /><br />Not only are the dialogue and direction horrible, but the actors...if they possess any talent...aren't allowed to show it due to a lack of any kind of organization. The story seems to go everywhere, but take us nowhere. Certain scenes drag on for what seems like hours at a time. And the movie finale leaves you with more of sense of "Thank God it's over", then "Wow, I can't believe she made it." For the most part, the producers should have reinvested their money into another project in stead of giving us this one. It's 76 minutes that you'll never get back. (30 if you fast forward like I did).
