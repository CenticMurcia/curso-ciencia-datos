I thought this was so bad I had to watch it in pieces because it was so cringeworthy. I taped it and had high hopes because I very much like Marsters' work on Buffy. But in this movie he was wooden and seemed uncharacteristically and woefully unprepared. The plot could have been a slick little heist movie but the scriptwriters managed to take something intrinsically exciting and make it yawnable. The pacing was terrible and that may be the worst flaw-farce has to stay on its toes to stay alive. However, it took Margot Kidder to supply the cringe. Not the very talented Margot of old. Marsters needed a job and a success but he only got one of those with this drek.
