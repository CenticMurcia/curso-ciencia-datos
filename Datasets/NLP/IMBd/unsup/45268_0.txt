From director John Irvin (Hamburger Hill), I didn't pay the fullest attention to this film when it was on, but I guess it doesn't matter. Basically Mark Kaminsky (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is kicked out the FBI for rough treatment of a suspect, he winds up as sheriff of a small town in North Carolina. FBI Chief Harry Shannon (Darren McGavin) enlists Kaminsky to get the man who killed his son, mobster Luigi Patrovita (Sam Wanamaker). Shannon promises to get him back in the FBI if Patrovita is taken down, to do this Kaminsky goes undercover as Joseph P. Brenner to join his gang. That's the basic story that I got. Also starring Paul Shenar as Paulo Rocca, Licence to Kill's Robert Davi as Max Keller, Ed Lauter as Baker, Joe Regalbuto as Marvin Baxter, Mordecai Lawner as Marcellino, Steven Hill as Martin Lamanski, Blanche Baker as Amy Kaminsky and Louise Robey as Lamanski's Girl. I think the only reasons I stayed with this film was because of Schwarzenegger and some eye-catching explosions and action sequences, but I just couldn't get into the story. Okay!
