this movie is just plain not funny. I know I am in the minority on this one, but Al didn't think it was funny either. I'm pretty sure the Manwhich, (Foley), would hate it too. I couldn't relate to the humor, if indeed humor was the aim, and when Chris Tuker speaks I get angry. I always hear people quoting lines from this movie, it's not Office Space people, don't quote lines rom bad movies. You don't see me walking around quoting Robocop 3. In conclusion, this movie sucks, people say wow I can't beleive you didn't like Friday, you should see it again. My response, no the movie sucks why watch a movie that I already know sucks when I can watch one that doesn't suck like Varsity Blues.
