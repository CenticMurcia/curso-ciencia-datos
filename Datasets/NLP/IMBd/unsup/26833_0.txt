Peter Jackson is amazing. I know mockumetaries have been done before but never has one fooled so many so easily. I swear 80% of NZ fell for it, and I admit it, I fell for this one hard and fast too. It really makes you take a look at this country . This was such a clever way to laugh the ways of New Zealander's and the blind belief in documentary: <br /><br />Kiwi's are obsessed at being best and first at as many things as possible. This may be due to the fact we have less worldwide status and we desire to be recognised for something.<br /><br />Documentary is a strange genre because we are told to believe something, often without real evidence (or with altered and misconstrued evidence). Jackson captures this unfounded faith in the documentary by making you believe something completely false. It teaches you to take everything in film and television that is supposedly 'real', with a big grain of salt.<br /><br />Overall, very provocative<br /><br />
