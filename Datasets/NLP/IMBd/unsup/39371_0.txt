This show made me feel as though I wanted to vomit. Brian is one of the most dysfunctional, manipulative, abusive egomaniacs I have ever seen (even on t.v.) - and he stated that he is a psychologist??!!?? These women are nothing short of victims. Pam - the subservient, non-confrontational pleaser, Kathy - the insecure other woman, and Denise - clearly abused in previous relationships and feels she doesn't deserve a decent man. As other commenters have remarked, the children have lost the most and will carry the dysfunction consciously brought on by their ignorant parents for the remainder of their lives. I can almost understand polygamy for religious reasons (while recognizing the welfare fraud, statutory rape, and other associated criminal acts that commonly accompany this lifestyle), but this pig of a human openly states that his polygamy has nothing to do with religion - just his inability to keep his organ in his pants. The only redeeming moment was when Denise finally left (even if it was not of her own doing). At least she stands a chance at getting some counseling for her self-esteem issues. It is disappointing that TLC would air such a low class show. To give them the benefit of the doubt, though, perhaps they were hoping to shed some light on abusive relationships. They could have done a better job of it, though. Would I ever watch this again? No way. It was a complete waste of one hour of my life. I write my first ever post to save someone else an hour of their time and a bottle of pepto to quiet an upset stomach.
