This is the BEST version of this story, by far. Others have tried but failed. In my opinion, Colin Firth is the ONLY and BEST Mr. Darcy to have ever played the role. The rest of the supporting cast are fantastic and amazingly realistic. The pace of the story is brilliant without cutting out too much of the detail to the plot. (I think this might be a reason why this mini-series blows away all of the other tries at doing this story in movie format).<br /><br />A true classic! Grab some wine and cheese and spend a night or two watching this wonderful mini-series. You will want to own it in order to have more Pride and Prejudice evenings with the girls (or guys) in the future.<br /><br />A MUST have for anyone's DVD collection!
