MGM used to be known as "retake valley" between the 20s' and the 30s' because the studio used to res-hot and/or reedit their films until they were good enough in order to turn out a profit.<br /><br />"Exit Smiling" is a rare case. The film probably flopped in 1926 simply because they probably did not change it at all. The major flaw of this production is its finale which is quite frustrating and out of tone, especially after Beatrice Lillie probed to be a delightful personality and you cared about her.<br /><br />Its impressive that Irving Thalberg did not perceive what was wrong with this picture and was unable to made the necessary corrections to make it a success.<br /><br />As it is, the film is quite a charming despite its ending. Linda Mart√≠nez score, for its TCM presentation, is very good.
