This is not a film with an amazing script, nor has it special effects that will blow you away. Still, there is something about it that makes it distinguish itself from others.<br /><br />The plot is quite standard for this kind of psychological thriller, but it has its moments, and you can expect some surprises. But it is the solid acting combined with great illumination- and sound techniques that really makes this film worthwhile. Andy Garcia truly shows that he is a great actor, and the supporting actors seem more than believable to me.<br /><br />All these factors combined results in a solid movie which I highly recommend to anyone.
