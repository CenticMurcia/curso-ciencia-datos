Do not read these comments past the 2nd paragraph if you haven't seen the movie!<br /><br />So we're walking through Blockbuster right? Through the sea of assembly line movies we come across a Vince Vaughn movie we hadn't seen yet. Amazing. It's like finding the pot of gold. Further examination of the case reveals that it also has Ed Harris & Julia Ormond. Wow! We need to look no further. The cover boasts an unpredictable ending. Sweet! (I never learn)<br /><br />The movie begins and the first few minutes are full of Vince goodness. It was fun seeing George Wendt too! Norm! Ok, I hate telemarketers that call people. It's one thing if you call them but when they call me I long for lightning to hit their phone system and electrocute every last one of them. Vince plays one of these types of bastards and is good at getting people to give up the green.<br /><br />Ok, enough. This is to comment not give a synopsis so let me get to the point. I love a good set up in a movie but 30 minutes is a bit extreme. This movie leaves no surprises. You know every step of the way how it will end and it just doesn't try to make it interesting. The best scene is when Vince is trying to sell the old lady on the investment. The ending left you with the empty feeling that "Penny" was feeling. Wonderful. Still, 2 good things do not make a great movie or even a good movie. They wasted everyone's talent and our time.<br /><br />
