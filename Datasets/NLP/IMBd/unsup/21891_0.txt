David Lynch over all is not a bad director, this movie proves it. I just wish he would make more movies like this than movies like Mulholland Dr. If you wish to see a David Lynch movie that is going to make you feel bad, angry, and all sorts of emotions then watch this one. If you wish to waste your time watch his other movies....<br /><br /> **** out of *****
