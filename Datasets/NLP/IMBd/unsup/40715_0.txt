I don't usually write comments because most movies have at least one point, or moral, or meaning of something of common interest! So did the actors not show up for production and they had the cast wing it? because if that's the case then I retract my statement. Otherwise for all who rated this with anything above 3 stars (I'm being generous)should be banned from misleading future viewers. Unless of course you enjoyed the acting in the educational films they showed throughout years of school. Thank god I didn't buy it, although when i'm on my death bed and cannot stay awake long enough to say my farewells to my grandchildren, and children so forth I will remember that this was the 87 min of my life i'm never getting back ! ! !
