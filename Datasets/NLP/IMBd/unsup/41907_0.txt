This film is a classic? What you been smokin' girl?! I decided to give this movie a 2 star rating out of 10 because at least it is very funny. This is probably the funniest movie ever without trying. The cheesy eighties clothing that is trying to pass for street clothing of the period was great! If you like to watch movies strictly for the cheese factor and horrible acting, then this is the movie for you. Break it down Bobby Brown!
