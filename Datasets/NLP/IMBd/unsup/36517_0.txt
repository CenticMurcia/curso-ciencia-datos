(Someone needs to say it)<br /><br />Possibly the worst, most depressingly dreary and poorly lit movie ever made, I find it unbelievable that anyone could find any merit in this turd. Bad, bad, bad... even the gore is bad. I usually am a big fan of the red stuff, but here is was just cheesy and nasty. They didn't even try. Far too long and boring to be funny either. Barely 6 people die in the course of the movie, the zombies look terrible (Gino De Rossi went overboard on the maggots), the kid was an obnoxious freak, and the music caused my ears to bleed! Only see this if you are on the brink of suicide and need just a little push to go all the way through with it. It'll make you feel ashamed of being a fan of Italian movies or Horror flicks. Burn this movie.
