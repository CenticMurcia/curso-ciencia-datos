The film begins as a documentary, explaining how a triple-homicide plays out in the Pine Barrens, located in Southern New Jersey. Although the film captured my attention quickly, it stalled out into early points and didn't seem to connect later in the film. For example, they employ an ex soaps director to direct the live broadcast, yet he not only does not accompany them to their live broadcast, he is basically left out of the film entirely. The shaky camera work, I think, worked well in some cases, but was overdone. Some camera shots just don't make sense (the camera angles from outside the camp, looking in, for example).<br /><br />The 'documentary' also doesn't play out like a normal documentary. It was close, but maybe thirty minutes or so in, I could tell something was a little off, and didn't make sense.<br /><br />The movie had a ton of potential. Done a little different, and with a different 'twist' ending, it could have easily been a great movie. As it stands now, the 'twist' at the end barely made sense, and although I understood what they were trying to portray, it came across as a cheap ending, a 'it was all a dream' sort of conclusion.<br /><br />To be honest, I'd skip this one if I had the choice.
