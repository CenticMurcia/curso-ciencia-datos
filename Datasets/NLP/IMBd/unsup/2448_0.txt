This movie is pitched so low it insults the intelligence of all mankind. How stupid do the makers of this movie think we are. I get pitching a movie like a graphic novel, but why would you pitch a movie like a cartoon unless your audience was kids, and lets face it this movie series is about machines that kill humans, its given away in the title. Why would you do this to such an important and well represented franchise. once again there is a clue in the director. He made some adverts and charlies angels. The people who put their money behind this piece of very expensive garbage deserve to lose it. the dialogue is something else though. 3 people in a speeding truck being chase, The driver shouts "hang on", not once but 3 times over the course of the chase. Gee, that's a good idea i wouldn't have thought of if it was me clutching to the vehicle. I would have been scratching my nose or something. insulting wasteful and shameful.<br /><br />Skynet is computers and robots yet they have a sophisticated laboratory with tables? Skynet develop sophisticated flying machines yet they also build motorbikes utilising the combustion engine?<br /><br />A guy who has been a sleeper for 20 years who was a simple murderer before comes back to life and is a skilled fighter, who proceeds to treat a seasoned female rebel like she is some sissy amateur (are you OK,get down, do as I say etc)<br /><br />The resistance made up of survivors all talk in American military speak in one scene and in the next are huddled round a fire being unskilled.<br /><br />The resistance seems to have limitless access to ammunition, fuel, arms etc, yet they have no factories to produce them?
