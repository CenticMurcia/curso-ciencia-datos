As I was thinking about what to rate this movie, I tried to come up with flaws. I couldn't. This movie is a loving look at the golden age of television comedy. It shows the process of building a television show. But it is so much more than that. It is also a comedy that doesn't miss a beat. And it is a story of redemption. My advice is to see this film and when you do, just sit back and have some fun.
