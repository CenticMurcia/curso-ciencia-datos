I'm the other bad-movie-loving friend EBA mentioned in his review of this natural disaster of a movie.<br /><br />He didn't do it justice. Not for lack of trying; it's easily at least as horrid as he makes it out to be, but there's just no way to make it sound as horrible as it really is. He's right when he says that there's no good way to convey through language how abominably bad the movie is. It's the rental video equivalent of the "Ancient Evils" Lovecraft wrote about: it's horrible beyond your imagination, and thus beyond your ability to conceptualize.<br /><br />I think the portions of my memory pertaining to this film have erased themselves, in a subconscious effort by my mind to stay sane.
