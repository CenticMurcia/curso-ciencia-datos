i don't know whos idea this was, but they should just hang it up and work somewhere else. this was by far the worst pile of crap i have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. in fact, i want that hour and a half of my life back. the thing that got me was the fact that the packaging was 100% misleading. it shows a huge mansion at night and this jacked, menacing killer with a devastating looking crossbow. the movie takes place in the middle of the day in a ranch house in the middle of suburbia, and the crossbow killer is a scrawny dude wielding a dart gun you would find in the children's section of Wal-mart. it was i believe 79 minutes or so long, and roughly 77 minutes were devoid of anything except terrible acting. NOTHING HAPPENED! there were some footsteps, a girl and a delivery boy were "attacked", if you could even call it that, but otherwise nothing happened. when their friend was attacked, they did NOTHING but let her sit in another room. finally when one girl miraculously escapes the Wal-mart killer, she doesn't run to a neighbors house to tell them that this crossbow killer is on her roof, no she runs down the street past dozens of houses and stumbles across a guy and says "um, there's um, been an um, accident". do not waste your time on this worthless pile of garbage. i feel legitimately cheated.
