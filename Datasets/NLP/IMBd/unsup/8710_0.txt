This movie is absolutely tremendous. I found the story mesmerizing with it's unique structure of story telling. The opening was nice and slow, leading the audience in, and following with good pacing. Of course, the plot was helped by spectacular cinematography and music. Even if you don't love the violin, you must watch this movie! Far better than any summer blockbuster you'll watch.
