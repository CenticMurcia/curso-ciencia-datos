For those interested in martial arts -skip it. You will hate this.For the rest of us this is a hilarious bad film that everyone should have a good laugh at.This film has so little to offer in terms of film but it could show a lot of bad expensive films how to reach a level of drivel that you just have to watch it.This film could never be accused of being an average film because it stands out so much.Exceptionally Bad is all I can say.<br /><br />
