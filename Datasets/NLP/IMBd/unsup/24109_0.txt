I was more than willing to accept a new actor to take over the Pink Panther franchise as Clouseau's inept son, and I feel that he would have made a decent enough Clouseau. The problem lies with the script of this movie. Many of the gags are simply re-hashed from previous Panther movies, and not very effectively at that.
