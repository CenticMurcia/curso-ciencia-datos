spoofing horror films is something people think is easy. in truth, it isn't. just being stupid doesn't make something funny. it just makes it stupid. throwing a bunch of naked chicks in the flick only makes me think of some porn i'd rather be watching.<br /><br />this is a bad movie that isn't scary. it isn't funny. heck, it isn't even gory. it is boring. i guess that's something.
