OK. So you've seen a lot of movies. If that's true you know most of the genres just keep imitating each other and there is a serious lack of originality. However, when watching Kung Fu Hussle, the only thing I can use to describe it is "original." It takes from a lot of different ideas but the overall feel of the movie is non-stop fun to the end. It's more like a Warner Bros. classic cartoon in live-action than anything... complete with Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote style chases with the feet blurred into a swirl as the chase heads down highways. The actual look of this in the film is Hilarious. There's all kinds of cartoon like violence and such, but in the end it just gives the film more heart.<br /><br />The film is a lot like watching a Japanese anime (animated) more than watching an old martial arts film. It has a surreal feel to it.<br /><br />But it really doesn't matter what I think of it. I just say go see it. It does have subtitles, but the audience I was with did not care (and I never do anyway). There was laughter abound. It is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The acting is SUPERB. If they dubbed it, it would have only taken away from it.<br /><br />Kung Fu Hussle is worth every penny. Go see it with some friends together for maximum enjoyment.
