Eunice cannot read anything so she goes to the United States of America to become a maid. In the meantime she is completely psycho but it's sad because she cannot read. It was funny when she wet her pants but I think that everyone was too hard on her. Who cares if she couldn't read? She was a maid and they could have helped her read or sent her somewhere to learn how to read. I didn't think that it was that big of a deal and she seemed like a good maid except when she went completely nuts. It wasn't that great of a movie and they could have given her a better weakness than she couldn't read. She could have just been completely psycho. Anyway, I did like her crazy religious friend but the movie is something to clean out of a box of bad movies.
