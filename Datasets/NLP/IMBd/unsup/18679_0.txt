I was at the gala screening of "Stage Beauty" last night at the Toronto International Film Festival, and I am still in awe of what a brilliant movie this is. "Shakespeare in Love" has been one of my favourites since its release, but I have to say that "Stage Beauty" totally takes the subject matter up one level, and blows it out of the water! The story had me captivated from beginning to end, with stellar performances by all cast members, particularly Claire Danes and Billy Crudup (who I truly believe is Oscar worthy for his portrayal of Edward Kynaston). Cast members Tom Wilkinson, Claire Danes and Billy Crudup were at the screening, which made it even more exciting. Although it takes place in Restoration England, the themes throughout are universal, particularly male/female roles and gender identity. Melodic, edgy, witty, and visually stunning, "Stage Beauty" is a must see for all film and theatre lovers, and I highly recommend it as a "must see" for any students studying Shakespeare, his contemporaries, or any Renaissance/Restoration/Elizabethan drama.
