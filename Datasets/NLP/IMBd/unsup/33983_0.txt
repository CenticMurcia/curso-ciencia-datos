Look; I don't understand how any one could have thought this was worth the time to produce or direct, and the money that goes along with that. It's unbelievable that a film made in the 21st century could be this elementary visually. I cannot find one good thing about this movie, and I did try. The acting is terrible (like a group of college students were pulled out of class, handed the script, and told to do their best), the script is very weak, and the characters do not relate to one another at all. To be honest; I think you could give a group of high school students (each in the bottom 5% of their class) $200, a camera, two gallons of red corn syrup, and a three days to work, and they would put together a better horror flick that this.
