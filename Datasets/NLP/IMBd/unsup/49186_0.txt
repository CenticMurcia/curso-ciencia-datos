After returning from a tour in Iraq, two soldiers attempt to track down their squad leader who has gone AWOL before something terrible happens. Based on some killings in Fort Bragg this is a a good but not great little film thats hurt by a directorial style that makes the film seem like any number of recent independent films. Some people have called it the Sundance look, which is a style of film making that some people adopt to get noticed at a film festival. I'm sure it helps to assure that their film gets seen because its the look that film festival organizers seem to like, but for me a member of the paying audience I find it more on the order of lacking in creativity. I would think it has less to do with Sundance and more to the fact that film schools are turning out filmmakers who are all clones cut with the same cookie cutter. Watch any number of independent films and you see that Garrison blends in with them seamlessly. Its a shame because the story is a good one, even if the pay off is announced at the opening. Recommended only for those who don't watch a large number of independent films.
