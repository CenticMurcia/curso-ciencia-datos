This a well made movie with a fresh, young cast. Corrigan shows great enthusiasm for dialogue, especially one liners and double entendre. The plot twists are fun and totally unexpected. I also thought that the technical aspects of the movie were great-- especially the sound and music. My only criticism would be that the flashbacks at the end became a little repetitive. Otherwise an excellent first movie.
