A sad and pathetic overture in the life and times of Oliver Stone. Sadly, after making so many great films to this point, Stone was forced to rebuild his career after creating this crummy film. Having enjoyed Sean Penn's movies in the past, this seemed a real departure for him. There is very little to say about this film, except it help Stone wise up and create Any Given Sunday.
