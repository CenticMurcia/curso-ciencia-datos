I first saw this movie on Sky Digital here in the UK.. I am aware of it being a fake but I still liked it.. I liked the way it's made to look like a home movie.. This makes it seem more realistic and I like the way it's made to seem unscripted.. This gives it a raw genuine look and feel.. I also liked the way they had segments which cut away from the movie with people commenting on the footage.. I take this movie for what it is. A fake made to look real.. I like it none the less.. Also I have to keep commenting for up to 10 lines due to the 10 lines minimum law.. So Er yeah like I was saying I like this movie because it's a movie I enjoy and movies that I like to watch I enjoy watching...........
