I misjudged the movie from the hype created with the blasts in India... This movie was the 'Da BomB'..... a bigger bomb than the one that was dropped in Hiroshima...Worst movie ever watched ....will think ten times before watching any Sunny Deol Movie... Please dude ask him to talk on a cellphone and not an IPAQ. The chicks were cute ...which was the only decent aspect of the movie. No need for a screenplay for the movie.. the songs can start whenever needed, based on the level of boredom of the movie.<br /><br />The music was bad too...This is what SantaBanta.com had to say ... "Sukhvinder Singh -"Rab jaane" (along with singer Kamaal Khan who plays a villain in the film) and Sunidhi Chauhan (trying to infuse life into a very mediocre 'Raat kuch aur tthi') to Jaspinder Nirula and Kamaal leave you thirsting for something beyond the immediate sensation. But alas, no salvation."<br /><br />Overall..."FBE: a Fully Bewakoof Endeavour"---IndiaTimes
