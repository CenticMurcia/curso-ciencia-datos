What the ...? That's all I can really say as an introduction. I have little to no idea why this film was made and if the director honestly thought men would find Chesty Morgan an erotic performer. Maybe this was all one big prank, ala Andy Kaufman. Who knows. All I can say is that this is one of the most bizarre, inane, and insane sexploitation films ever made. I haven't seen "Deadly Weapons" but apparently its even worse (if thats possible). This is something akin to watching a freak show.<br /><br />I should mention Chesty Morgan around now. This is a woman with a bust that made Anita Ekberg look like Winona Ryder. Chesty was a stripper with an all natural 73 inch bust. I'm a fan of well endowed women, but that is just a bit too much for the average man's liking I would suspect. Seeing her naked is an absolutely disgusting experience. Thats why the film is appealing however. Its so gross and so stupid it becomes a painfully funny viewing experience, a real cinematic train wreck in which nothing seems to be competently done. Attempting to explain the plot would be in vain, because this film was made solely to concentrate on Chesty's breasts.<br /><br />As fascinating as Chesty is, a good deal of what makes this film so bizarre is Doris Wishman, the director. Allegedly the most prolific female filmmaker of all time, she was certainly an unique auteur. The low budget is more painfully obvious in this than most pornography. Because of issues with post-dubbing, Wishman had a tendency to concentrate on random objects (animals and furniture being a particular favorite) whenever a character is talking. Also, she would use the same room for multiple sets. That's why the spy headquarters in the film look like a used car salesman's office. If you want to see an almost competently made film of her's (meaning its a good film with bad production values), check out "Bad Girls Go to Hell". "Double Agent 73" is of interest to any vintage exploitation fan. (2/10)
