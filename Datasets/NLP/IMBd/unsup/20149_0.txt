Okay, my title sounds a little extravagant. Even though this film doesn't sparkle with a huge budget and sexy highly paid stars, it is a story that hits home. A storyline that Hollywood seems to skip in favor of big budget action or graphic horror films. I felt inspired and moved by the story... AND I am a guy! So many are quick to judge films if they are not up to a certain level. I honestly did not expect much from this film but walked away impressed; continually thinking of the events and the character revelations throughout the film. I have even encouraged friends to see it. I am disappointed it did not receive a better advertising/marketing campaign. When I urge those to seek it out, they have never heard of the film. It also was released on a limited number of screens. My advice to Fox Faith is to get the word out. Start a grassroots campaign and let people know that these films exist. There is an audience out there! Many avoid cinema because they have been disappointed so many times. This is a film that actually moves the heart with a positive life changing message, instead of big-budgeted shallow films that are filled with CGI but devoid of hope... I challenge anyone to remember such films.
