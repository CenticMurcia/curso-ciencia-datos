The only portion of the previous comment I agree with is that the movie is good. The statements of "the guy hardly ever did anything" is entirely wrong. All throughout this film there are scenes of rape, beatings,coercion and forced medication on the part of the prison guards onto the general population. There is only one female guard in the entire prison so men are allowed to do as they wish to women who have been cast out of society for acting "unwomanly". It is a wonderful film and a true account of the horrors of the modern day prison system. We seem to hold the belief that when someone is incarcerated, guilty or not, whatever treatment they receive on "the inside" is something they deserve. What about respect for autonomy and human dignity? what about the concept of rehabilitation? We lock human beings up in cages like animals and subject them to constant inhuman treatment and wonder why upon release they wind up more violent and committed to a life of crime than they were upon entry. I wish more could see this film, perhaps it would give needed attention to a large problem hidden in plain sight.
