I love the film Xtro, because it's weird and imaginative, and just overall a strange little film. Jump 8 years into the future when this "sequel" was made and we have nothing more than "Alien" in an underground research facility. And the critter looks like Alien, it doesn't look like the critter in the original at all. The storyline is promising as this lab is set up to send people to a parallel universe (and then of course bring them back...right?) but of course this is a horror movie and they're not coming back, or at least the one that did wasn't alone. And it's a woman, and guess what is inside her? Of course it gets birthed in glorious splatter and once loose, goes into the ventilation system at which point this becomes a movie you've seen many times before and probably much much better. Not worth your time, 2 out of 10.
