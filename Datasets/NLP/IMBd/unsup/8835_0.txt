I watched the first episode out of curiosity, but I really did not expect to like it. Even with such great actresses, I thought it would probably be stupid. But once the first episode was over I couldn't wait to watch the next one, and it's continued to be that way! These women lead such exciting lives, and their love for each other is so refreshing to watch. This show is about what friendship is suppose to be, and rich people with seemingly great lives have problems too. I'm also really enjoying Andrew McCarthy's character, Joe! He's a billionaire that can be very romantic, but he also has issues. This is a very enjoyable show!!!
