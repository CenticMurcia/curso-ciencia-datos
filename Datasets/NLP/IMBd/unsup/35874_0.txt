I have been a big fan of MK since the beginning, although I must admit I lost interest in the game series after part III.<br /><br />Buying MK Deception this past Christmas renewed my interest in the series.<br /><br />This movie was crap and I can't believe I bought this mess.<br /><br />Good thing I found it for 9.99 at the used bin, so I wasn't out of much.<br /><br />I was expecting to see a REAL sequel to the first movie, which I found fairly entertaining.<br /><br />I thought the first film was very good and does the game upon which it is based some justice.<br /><br />Not the case with MKA.<br /><br />The first problem is that they tried to fuse too much of MK2 with MK3.<br /><br />Then, if you're going to replace a character with another actor (Christopher Lambert), then at least make sure the new actor does a batter job than the first. The first Raiden was a hard-ass, and you knew not to mess with him. The second Raiden was a wuss and every time we saw him he was going through a wall.<br /><br />Weak portrayals of major MK characters was another flaw.<br /><br />The actress who portrayed Sonya Blade was nowhere near as good as Bridgette Wilson (the first Sonya).<br /><br />Same could be said with Cage (Linden Ashby).<br /><br />What was the point of even having Ermac and Rain in the movie if they weren't going to be referred to? A very weak portrayal of Sindel, Kitana's mother and the actress who played her isn't fit to act in soap operas.<br /><br />Line example: Kitana: "My mother is dead." Sindel: "As will be her daughter!" Gimmie a break! Stick with the first.
