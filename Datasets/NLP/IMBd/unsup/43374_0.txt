If you thought "Trail of the Pink Panther" was a poor excuse for a movie, you haven't seen anything yet.<br /><br />With Ted Wass standing in as US detective Clifton Sleigh (as in "one-horse open"), he goes through all the pratfalls in the book as the only other detective clumsy enough find where the missing Jacques Clouseau is. If you can figure the logic to this choice of detectives other than pratfalls, you're smarter than anyone else in this film.<br /><br />And Wass takes a lot of pratfalls. A lot of them. I hope he got combat pay.<br /><br />He even gets to interplay with Herbert Lom and Burt Kwouk, veterans of the series. Not to mention Robert Wagner, Capucine and David Niven. Not that this matters much. It's simply a chance for everyone to waste time while Blake Edwards continues to beat this dead horse for all it's worth.<br /><br />Poor horse.<br /><br />Two stars. If you like pratfalls, you may want to catch "Curse". Otherwise, stick with the original.
