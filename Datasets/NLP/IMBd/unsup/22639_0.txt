This might be the worst movie I've ever watched. Complete crap from front to end... I doubt the blind mice that produced this vomit fest are still allowed to even go see a movie let alone produce one. Very offensive, dumbing down of American cinema, sloppy editing, terrible lighting, did I mention terrible lighting? I would rather watch paint dry than sit through disgusting thing. Who funded this is one question? How in the hell did anyone not think it was going to be a complete joke... maybe I am being a bit harsh... but this thing was a complete abortion of movie making. I bet the actors in this movie really wish they didn't agree to this one... it was worse than a grade school recital.
