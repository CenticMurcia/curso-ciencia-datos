I just got a copy of this one and popped it int the DVD player. I right away got the definite impression that I might very well be watching a deliberate comedy, a definite send-up of scifi from the fifties. (But then it couldn't be, since it was made in 1953 and precedes most of the films I would think it satirizes by several years.) The movie is relentless in the number of stereotypical, one dimensional characters it introduces (and usually disposes of just as quickly), as well as the amount of pseudo-scientific technobabble its chief characters spout at every turn. The scientific howlers come fast and furious - example; radioactivity and magnetism have virtually nothing to do with each other but this movie insists on linking them in a very ham-fisted and unsophisticated way. Then there's the matter of the radiation measuring devices they wave around reading the rather trivial level of only about 2 mr/hr or less (it plainly says so in the on-screen close up) while the scientists act as if this were a deadly amount. I admit initially I thought the movie bore a distinct resemblance to an episode of the original "Outer Limits" (where a high energy physics experiment goes awry and spews out living radioactive material) and might have been inspiration for the later TV show. Especially since that OL episode also has the same level of scientific misinformation and technobabble. But that impression wore off quickly and I was left just wondering why I was yet again subjecting myself to a flat, breathless Richard Carlson performance. In the end, my problem is not so much this unremarkable movie (it varies little from several other movies of the 40s and 50s about the dangers of radioactivity) but about where the people who reviewed this movie as "scientifically accurate" are getting their information. Granted, scifi usually has to take some liberties with known scientific fact but there is a difference between dramatic license and just talking sheer rubbish.
