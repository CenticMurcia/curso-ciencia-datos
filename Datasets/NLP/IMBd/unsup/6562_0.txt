In Alfred Hitchock's The Trouble With Harry, the old geezer pulls our leg a bit, offering a sweet but rather cynical black comedy about how best to dispose of a dead body found by an old sea captain. Actually, none of the characters in the film give a hoot about the dead man but are only seeking to protect themselves from scandal.<br /><br />The film, however, is a delightful entertainment, beautifully photographed amidst the Vermont fall foliage, and filled with indelible performances by Shirley MacLaine in her first screen role and veterans Mildred Natwick, Edmund Gwenn, Mildred Dunnock, and John Forsyth. Even though Hitch portrays people at their most loathsome, there is still something so charming about them that you can't help but smile and forgive their all too human foibles.
