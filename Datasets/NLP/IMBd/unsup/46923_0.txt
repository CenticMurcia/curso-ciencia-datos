Hated it for all the reasons mentioned in the other posts. The acting was bad, the plot badly tied together. How am I to believe the FBI would mount such an operation on one highly dubious telephone call. I assume they would first try to investigate quietly. And again. This had nothing to do with x-files in the first place. One thing in particular annoyed me: Cancer man in the "past-life". If he was a gestapo member during world war II, wouldn't he be much younger? He was at least 20 in the fifties, wasn't he? If the writers were so desperate to pack all of Mulders's loved ones in his past life, where were his parents? Where was Skinner for that matter? And if this Melissa was so important to Mulder in a past life, how come she appears so briefly in this one? The whole thing was just plain ridiculous.
