The daredevils in Daredevils Of The Red Circle consist of three circus stuntman who when the little brother of one of them is killed in an arson fire on that circus. The circus is one of many things owned by millionaire Miles Mander and his old partner who Mander had sent to jail, Charles Middleton, is busy plotting to wreck and dismantle his fortune.<br /><br />The three heroes are Charles Quigley, David Sharpe, and Bruce Bennett under his real name of Herman Brix. Because they managed to save Mander's granddaughter Carole Landis, Landis gets the three of them hired by the millionaire to find out who's causing all the problems and to apprehend same.<br /><br />But this is a really deep conspiracy because Grandpa isn't who he seems. It turns out that Mander was kidnapped and Middleton is in the house impersonating him with the use of a lifelike mask and a good imitation of his voice. They've given out the cover story of a stroke and they have him behind this glass panel, rigged something Howard Hughes would later do for real.<br /><br />Our intrepid heroes get inside information about various plans of wrecking that Middleton has going and spend most of the 12 chapters foiling same. Why they didn't get a message out about Mander's situation is beyond me.<br /><br />Still it's the ultimate of inside conspiracies. The kids loved it back in the day, I'm sure its chapters played with whatever Gene Autry or Roy Rogers or whatever Republic cowboy feature film was coming out.<br /><br />It all looks so silly now though.
