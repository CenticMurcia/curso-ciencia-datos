The point was made 1 minute into the movie, and then repeated in different words from other people and shows, movies, etc. for the remaining 1 hour and 32 minutes.<br /><br />There was no other side to this, and it is sad to see people making these kinds of documentaries that are so one sided that they should be considered as complaints, or even brain washing material as to how many times they have made one sided points. Like every other documentary about something that is "bad" as we are told growing up, this was made to be funny and fun to watch.<br /><br />Complete waste of 1 and a half hours.
