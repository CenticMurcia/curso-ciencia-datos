I had the honor of viewing Head Case at the Newark Film Festival this past summer and it scared the hell out of me. The film is not your conventional horror movie, but that is what makes it so scary. The film details the seemingly mundane suburban existence of Wayne and Andrea Montgomery and their two children. The appear to be the typical middle class family, but what lurks beneath the surface is a barely masked evil. Wayne and Andrea kill for fun.<br /><br />They are serial killers who target transients and hitch hikers. They film their daily lives and the killings the way that other families would a graduation or holiday. The most disturbing thing about Wayne and Andrea is that no one knows about their secret life. They go to church, work and raise their children for years without being detected.<br /><br />I found that to be the scariest thing about the film, that these depraved people could indeed live next door to me or share a cube at work. They could be part of the PTA or serve on the church board.<br /><br />As far as the production goes, I think that Anthony Spadaccini has grown leaps and bounds from his other films. The lighting, camera work and acting all support the home movie style that is the centerpiece of the movie. Think Blair Witch, without the witch.<br /><br />The standout feature in my opinion is the gore effects. Head Case has a particular special effect that seemed to be very realistic and unsettling. The use of gory is minimal, but it is effective. It is what you don't see that will make you cringe.<br /><br />The dialog in the film is very realistic and shows that people's lives are not always exciting. There are parts in this film that some would consider boring, but I find that it adds to the realism of the piece and really provides the home movie feel that I think the director was trying to convey.<br /><br />As far as standout characters go, I was supremely annoyed and amused by Andrea Montgomery. Her nagging and the tone of her voice reminded me of the typical over the top mom and added an eeriness to each death that she was a part of. Each time she called out "Waaayyynnne", it made me want to duck and run.<br /><br />Overall, I think that Head Case is another solid effort from the Fleet Street Films team and I hope to see these characters again.
