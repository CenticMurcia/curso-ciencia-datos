<br /><br />Being a Brit living in Canada it was nice to see a glimpse of Blighty. I liked the way this film used the documentary style of filming. The grainyness gave it a even more realistic touch. Gina Mckee was outstanding as usual. It reminded me a little of some mike leigh filcks. Best of all i liked the way it didn't try to preach as so many films about working class Brits(like myself) do, they showed the characters as flawed indivduals but there was a undercurrent of love flowing in the film( Gina mckee's scenes with her dad always outside as to avoid her mother.) Sheer class the best English film i have scene for along time.
