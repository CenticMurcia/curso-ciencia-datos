SPOILER!!! I completely loved Dead Poets Society. It's definitely my favorite movie of all time. all of the actors are amazing, and i follow some of the actors work now... namely Robert Sean Leonard, Neil Perry, and Ethan Hawke, Todd Anderson. Great film, would recommend it to anyone, any time!! When Neil kills himself at the end of the film, I cried, cause i loved him. He was such a good guy, including Todd at the beginning when he had no friends. What i liked the most about Robert's character is how he was friends with everyone. Everyone was sad when he died, and though the other boys had their 'Tiffs' he wanted everyone to be friends. On a whole, great script, great cast, great sets and great MOVIE!!
