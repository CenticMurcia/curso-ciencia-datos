Not many documentaries make it into the movie theaters, but this one did and for good reason. Wordplay is a great documentary that delivers lots of big laughs. At the same time that the movie is entertaining, it is educational -- in particular, the interviews of Clinton and Dole. For that reason, it can draw a diverse audience (families, professionals, college students, etc). It is also a great date movie because it is not long and gives you plenty to talk about after.<br /><br />You don't have to be a crossword player to enjoy the movie, though it helps. The documentary really is about how people can so enjoy their passions, whether it be crossword puzzles, baseball, work or companionship. Overall, great movie because it has a great message.
