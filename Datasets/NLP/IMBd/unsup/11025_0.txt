This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It is incredibly stupid, incredibly bad acted, and includes incredibly bad special effects. So, what's not to like? I mean, this movie also includes an award winning number of melon heavy breasts...although many of these chicks are bald...but hey, they got large knockers! Yes, this is Class of Nuke Em High 2: Subhumanoid Meltdown. It has near no relation to the original Class of Nuke Em High, but that is okay. This film is about the T.I.T: Tromaville Institute of Technology and all the wacky things that happen on campus including a giant mutated squirrel who likes large nuts, peeing on nuclear power plants, and sneezing on innocent civilians. At the same time, subhumanoids have lived on campus, they are like humans only they have a mouth instead of a belly button, so they are better at making love. Sound simple enough because we also got a dolphin-sophomore who is belemic and a professor with a 9 foot hairdo. Dear, I have said too much. Just make sure to hear the rocking theme song, which is one of the film's best qualities. Just check this movie out nuff said. It is dumb, tasteless, and incredibly bad, but also it is hilarious! Check it out!
