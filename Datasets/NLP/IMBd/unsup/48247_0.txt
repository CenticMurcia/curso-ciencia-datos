This one kind of clops along like an average B movie is expected to. This may be a cult classic in Australia, but I just don't dig it. Exploitation of Mick Jagger? Your guess is good as mine. Jagger plays Ned Kelley Australia's most notorious outlaw. Director Tony Richardson dramatizes the life of this bad man and his family of horse thieves. The meat of the movie is the big man hunt that results in a lot of gun fire and death and the eventual capture and execution of the legendary 19th-century outlaw. Jagger is as sluggish as the movie itself and his attempt to sound Australian comes out sounding more Irish. Good to watch if you are a follower of the Rock 'n' Roll bad boy. Also in the cast are Geoff Gilmour, Allen Bickford and Clarissa Kaye-Mason.
