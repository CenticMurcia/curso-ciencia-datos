Candyman 2 is a very unworthy sequel to Candyman 1.The beginning scene where the fat guy gets slaughtered in the bathroom is basically the only good part of the movie because the way to destroy Candyman was very cheesy and stupid,and the end was crap.SPOILERS,they killed Candyman by breaking a mirror,that was bad.Most of the movie wasnt interesting like it can be lead to believe,and the whole thing where Candyman can only be destroyed by breaking a glass was very half assed.Seriously,the only thing that this movie can deliver is mediocre acting,and a straight gore fest from beginning to end.I tried to like this movie,I tried,but it just want good enough to surpass the first one.Its not scary or anything.A very bad,and very cheesy movie.4 out of 10.
