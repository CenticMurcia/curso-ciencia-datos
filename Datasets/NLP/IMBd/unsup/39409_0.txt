I'm a big Oprah fan and I wanted so much for this movie to be a success. I feel that it was doomed from the start with the casting. Hallie is a beautiful person, but I don't care for her acting. Her persona is weak and frilly--far too much for her to play the role of Janie. I wish there had been more of a focus on Nannie and the early life of Janie--even spending more time talking about Logan Killicks. Other than the few statements that Nannie made about Janie's mother, we really don't get a since of what Janie's childhood like and what Nannie really taught her about life--black women are the mules. I was also disappointed with the portrayal of Janie and Tea Cake working in the "muck." I have been to Belle Glade, Florida and know how the muck looks and have heard the description of the field workers about how it gets on the body and is nearly impossible to wash off. So when Janie shows up in a sleeveless shirt to work in the muck. Trust me--that just ain't happening. Way to much of the story is missing. It might be an okay movie, if you never read the book.
