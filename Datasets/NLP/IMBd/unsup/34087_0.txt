Caught this at Cinequest. It was well attended, but the crowd seemed disappointed. In my humble opinion, "Charlie the Ox" was very amateurish and overrated (it pales in comparison with other cinequest pics I saw). Acting (with the exception of Polito) seemed self-conscious and "stagey." Photography, despite originating on high-end HD, looked like home video... very stiff and undramatic. Score was repetitive. There were basic sound editing errors, such as background noise that changed noticeably with each edit. Most importantly the script was unfocused, repetitive, and limp.... I hate to ask the tired old question, but "why should we care?" I applaud the effort involved in any project like this, but it played much more like a community project put together by hobbyists, than a legit movie.
