in my opinion of the show's fate, i think that warner brothers officials were wrong to cancel this show... although it lasted 4 seasons it could've been at least 3 more seasons until the did what they did... as for this whole comic book movie battle between DC and MARVEL, i think that DC/WARNER BROS. should make a live action version of static shock and bring it to the big screen. nobody knew who blade was until marvel came out with that movie and it spawned into 3 movies because of it's success. so in the end, if DC wants to redeem themselves for this HUGE mistake they need to bring static to the big screen
