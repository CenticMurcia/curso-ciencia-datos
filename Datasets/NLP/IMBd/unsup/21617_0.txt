This was no unlucky 13. It was just as good as the previous 12. Although the comedy wasn't as intense as in previous years, people have been going to not only see George the comedian, but also George the storyteller. Carlin has been around for a long time and has seen a lot of things. He likes to express his feelings and bring up things that most people take for granted. Essentially people listen to Carlin to laugh and also to learn something. So if you feel that this wasn't good because it wasn't as comedic, then i think you completely missed the purpose. George may not have been as quick as he used to be because his age and drug use has taken its toll. Overall I rate this a 7.
