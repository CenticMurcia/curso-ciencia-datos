In what may be one of the truly bad films of all time, the lead actress<br /><br />cries out "Oh My God," whenever anything unexpected happens. I counted<br /><br />six such outbursts and stopped, but it occurred to me that her words sum<br /><br />up this witless, pretentious,badly acted, badly directed, badly written,<br /><br />badly photographed mess. OH MY GOD, indeed honey, OH MY GOD indeed!
