Dr Dollitle 2 was a fairly good movie with a strong cast but it just didn't do it for me. I found it pretty boring because what to like about. Not much because it's been done before. It was very distasteful but the voice actors were alright. I guess i expected too much from this movie as i do for a few movies. I bought this movie for Australian $15 a few years ago, most like it's $10 now because it wasn't that good or popular. I Just wish this movie could have a better storyline because "saving the forest" has been done before and it's common to viewers. They need to have a great idea that's never been done before and really wild.
