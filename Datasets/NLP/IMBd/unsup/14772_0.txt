I have seen the movie for the first time back in 1995. I found it delightfully funny, great entertainment. Yes, the plot is a bit on the complex side, over-elaborated and somewhat predictable and yes, the content might be questionable, but the movie combined some characters into a pretty entertaining entity. Not Oscar material, but definitely enjoyable.
