Daniel Haller directs this adaption of a H.P. Lovecraft story. A young warlock(Dean Stockwell)steals a one-of-a-kind book of spells and is determined to conjure up a way to bring back a society of witches and warlocks to earth. A strange and sometimes boring story to follow. The background score by Les Baxter is haunting and keeps the movie drudging along. Also in the cast are Sandra Dee, Sam Jaffe and Ed Begley. I expected more.
