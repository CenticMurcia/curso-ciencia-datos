Kim Ki Duk is the infant terrible of the South Korean cinema. The best thing about his films is that there is no repetition in them. All of his films have had different story lines, plot constructions and even his choice of actors is different. This makes fastidious viewers appreciate his films. Not only people appreciate his films but are also able to associate themselves with them. As far as "Bad Guy" is concerned, it is largely autobiographical in nature. It might be said that it is quite possible that the characters portrayed in this film must have been a part of Kim's life at some point of his life. "Bad Guy" has made some interesting observations about Korean society too. However some viewers might find it hard to accept that the depiction of women characters is a little bit weak. Whatever one feels this film is rather oddball given its subject matter and content. Watch out for its musical score which is simply stunning. The end of the film is really a class affair.
