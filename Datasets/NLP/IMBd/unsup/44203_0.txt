Hotel for Dogs is the story of two foster children who adopt stray dogs and find a place for them, as well as filling their need for family, in an abandoned hotel.<br /><br />This is not a terrible movie, but the viewer has seen it all before. There's not much originality here in its typical underdog makes good, love conquers all kind of story.<br /><br />It has some amusing parts, the acting is reasonable, the dogs are cute and the pacing is decent, but there's really nothing exceptional in it.<br /><br />It's worth a watch if you like this kind of sappy family comedy, but there's not a lot of substance and nothing that you'll remember in five years.
