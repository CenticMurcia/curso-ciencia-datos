This dull and utterly unscary horror film is cruddy in every department and I simply can't believe that some genre fans actually liked it. The fact that it was followed by a sequel (!) also seems inexplicable to me. There are absolutely no scares here - and no gore, either; our views of the "monsters" are always too brief - but not brief enough to hide how cheap the effects are. "C.H.U.D" is rock-bottom stuff, and no fun at all.
