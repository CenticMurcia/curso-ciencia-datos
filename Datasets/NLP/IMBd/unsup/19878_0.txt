I rented this on the strength of the crew's previous works: this by far is the weakest. A character uncomfortable in his/her own skin is only funny if the lines are funny. They aren't. I was severely disappointed. I understand Guest's formula: get talented actors together with a concept and minimally scripted lines, put them together and roll the film. It has worked before (Waiting For Guffman, Best In Show) but not here. What the viewer gets is talented actors begging for material. They don't get it and neither does the audience. Other reviewers have loved this film and I think I know why. They remember the actors' brilliance in other films and are trying to re-live that experience. They have loved the film before they saw it. For me; this is a very boring film made by people who should and do know better.
