These guys really were on fire.<br /><br />What a truly great DVD this is. Truth be said, Queen weren't popular after their 'disasterous' "Hot Space" album.<br /><br />But this is the tour, and they done the disco songs like "Staying Power", "Back Chat" and "Action This Day" and transformed them into traditional Queen stage classics. But this album apparently killed their success in America. But there are still loads of devoted American Queen fans as much as there are British. They are a great band with an awesome universal appeal.<br /><br />This is a different sounding concert if compared to "Live at Wembley '86". Queen were going through a transitional stage.<br /><br />But they still showed cynics that they still knew how to rock.
