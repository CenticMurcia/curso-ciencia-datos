My response to this movie was it was great. The reason why I say this is because I can relate to these things that happened in the movie from my own experience growing up in a troubled neighborhood. I myself grew up in TCHC neighborhood so I see these things taking place on a regular basis, people getting shot, drugs being sold, police come in and harassing innocent people and friends getting killed over nonsense. <br /><br />Therefore we need more community support and more community organizations to help out in these troubled neighborhoods, so that our young men and women can have a future and move forward in life to accomplish their goals and dreams.<br /><br />The reason why I thought the movie was great was because it showed the struggle that we face on a daily basis, growing up and living in a troubled neighborhood. It also had a community leader that was trying to make a difference by having community group meetings once or twice a week, having people come out and participate in making a change in the community.
