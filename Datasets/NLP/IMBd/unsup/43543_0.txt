I think that our subtitles weren't right, which is odd, since we rent it from a normal video shop. The conversations weren't going anywhere. Anyone knows what was wrong with the womens eye(?)<br /><br />I survived 102 minutes of film, glad to never see it again.<br /><br />What i really thought was annoying, was the lack of ending, it suddenly stops when the 2 girls are swimming...uh.<br /><br />Let this be a warning for you people. Don't go see this movie, when you don't speak Spanish.<br /><br />The movie has more than one story lines. None are worked out well as far as I'm concerned.
