I looked forward to this film in advance of its presentation, and suspected Lucie Arnaz's negative comments were un-founded. Ms Arnaz, I do apologize.<br /><br />The story line made for a "C" average Television movie at best. Unfortunately, the subject matter was one the most viewed and known in the 20th century. When the presentation of re-created scenes and actors from "I LOVE LUCY", the grade fell to a D-. The portrayals of "Lucy", "Ricky", "Fred" and "Ethel" were an insult to "Ball", "Arnaz", "Frawley", and "Vance". Fisher's attempt to re-create the "Lucy Ricardo" bits were sloppy. Immediately after its initial TV Presentation, the local TV station did a news segment on it. They cut back and forth between Fisher's Lucy and Ball's Lucy.... it was night and day.<br /><br />Let me close by saying that the performers in this piece are "quality" professionals, and should be commended for many of their past performances....just not this one.
