Being tired of watching U.S. detective and spy movies, with all their over used cliches (the spy who falls in love and must not, as in "The Saint", the nice looking hero who saves the free world, the Russians as being always the evil guys and sort of) all I can say about this one is that it recaptures the original meaning of detective movies, and shows us at the same time a new perspective (the troubles by keeping the detective job secret from the family, the unusual emotional ties between the assassin and a journalist, the passive role of the government in the crime, etc).<br /><br />A very well time-paced movie with a intelligent and mature plot rarely seen in detective and action movies this days. I strongly recommend it.
