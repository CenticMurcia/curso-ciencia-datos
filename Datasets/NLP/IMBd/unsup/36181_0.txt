Sigh, OK let me be blunt...this is a movie that only a strict horror movie fan would watch and a movie that only a drunk horror movie fan could enjoy.<br /><br />The concept and idea is decent but the film's overall plot is so absurd that by the end of the film, if you are still awake, you are squirming in your seat hoping none of your friends find out you watched it.<br /><br />The movie starts with a good setup and heads in the right direction. But it doesn't take long until it finds itself so over-the-top that it is insulting. The audience is left shaking their heads at some of the poor acting and silly dialog. While gore fans will be pleased by some of the effects, that isn't enough to make it a decent horror film. The ending is so absurd that it takes a real trooper to keep from turning it off.<br /><br />There is nothing scary, nothing interesting, nothing entertaining about the film. It to poorly written, toooo silly (unintentionaly), and toooo much of a waste of time to recommend.
