This is a complete rehash of the first film. I enjoyed the first film, but the second one was kinda sad. It uses almost the same script from the first film, and not really any points for originality. You almost feel bad for the cast and crew in this film. Home Alone II is one of the few films to use shameless plugs. The Plaza Hotel is the backdrop for this film and it almost felt like Donald Trump was bankrolling the whole production. Watching Home Alone 2 is like seeing The Harlem Globetrotters more than once: there is always the same gags, but as least the Globetrotters keep there shows fresh. As I said earlier this film has no life and no originality. Still, it didn't matter because the film made mega-bucks and Fox laughed all the way to the bank.
