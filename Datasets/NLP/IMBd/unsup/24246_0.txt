Harold loses the love of his life and wants to end it all.His all suicide attempts are failures.But he ends up marrying a pretty girl and ends up with her in a mansion that is spooked by a wicked uncle who wants to scare the young people away so he can have the place for himself.Alfred J. Goulding and Hal Roach are the directors of Haunted Spooks (1920).It's great to watch Harold Lloyd do his comedy.Mildred Davis is beautiful and brilliant as the girl.She would become Harold's real-life wife three years later.The film has lots of fun during its 25 minutes.It's awfully funny to watch Harold and Mildred in a car while those chicken and ducks peck him in the head.And comedy meets tragedy in all those suicide attempts.Lloyd sacrificed two of his fingers when a prop bomb exploded in his hand.What wouldn't Harold have done for comedy?
