... Yeah! But this one's a sure success! Treating a subject like this ain't no easy feat IMHO.<br /><br />A little bit of mistake and the whole thing could be turned into one of those spoiled movies that don't even sound funny.<br /><br />Good one here indeed hence the 10 stars I'd give it even though it ain't win no Oscars or nothing of 'em nice awards.<br /><br />(Hey, I sure am sounding a l'le ethnic in here ain't I?) :)<br /><br />This movie is a fine example of those getting into a 'mixed up' society. A place where people of various ethnicities and racial or social groups do live together and mingle too but they never add up or properly get together. Mixed identities, alienated souls, badly mistaken (if not dirty) politics, and so forth ...
