I was very excited when I saw Loving Evangeline was going to air on WE. It's one of my favorite Linda Howard books and I couldn't wait to see it 'live and in color'.<br /><br />I only wish I would have come here first and found out how horrible this movie really was.<br /><br />After watching this farce I couldn't help but feel disappointed. I realize that sometimes the movies have to take liberties with the books; but the writer, director and producers completely ruined a wonderful story.<br /><br />In fact the movie is NOTHING like the book aside from the title and the lead characters' names. The acting was sub par, the storyline was ridiculous and the characters were NOWHERE near as great as their book counterparts.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't rent this flick. Don't buy it. And if you see it on TV change the channel. Don't bother to waste your time.<br /><br />Instead, get the book and see how the story's really supposed to go. You won't be disappointed.
