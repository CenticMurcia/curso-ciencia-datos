For a comedy, this movie sure doesn't have a lot of jokes. I think I laughed once during this movie, when someone made a remark about the "Lambada", and even then, I was only laughing because I kind of knew what the lambada was. The joke wasn't funny on its own. There are a few lines in the movie that could have been very funny, but suffered poor delivery by the actors.<br /><br />Plot? There is none. Most of the movie is an excuse to show gratuitous nudity. In between the nudity, there is some sort of story about a ski competition, but it doesn't make sense at all. I think the ski competitions are supposed to be funny or something, but mostly, it's just a bunch of people falling over.<br /><br />The soundtrack is atrocious. I've never heard so many bad 80's dance songs in my life. The characters look like such idiots dancing to the songs (and not in a funny way either - in a pathetic way). I think I heard two good songs during the whole movie, but they didn't feel like they went with the movie.<br /><br />Oh yeah - and the acting sucks. For a stupid comedy like this, I don't the acting to be that important, but the actors were so bad in this movie, it's hard to concentrate on anything else. Their bad acting is a distraction, and by the end of the movie, you'll feel like strangling the actors.<br /><br />If I were to classify this film, it would fall somewhere between "Animal House Ripoff" and "Cheap Softcore Porn".
