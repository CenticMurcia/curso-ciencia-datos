That's for you decide! I'm going to list a few things and you can make up your own mind, which will decide if you wanna watch this movie or not. Let's start with the actors, because they really give their best. They are great and the chemistry between Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams is really good. Even if it's almost unbelievable, that they would love each other that much, they sell it.<br /><br />But that's also one of the downfalls. There is not that much drama, there is not that much friction. While that might be nice for the characters, you wonder how smoothly things go! Then at other times you get problems, that shouldn't be there. In other words, the movie is inconsistent! Plot holes and a very crazy story detail (the first time Eric Banas character and Rachel McAdams character meet is .. well wrong! Just wrong! I can't say more, without revealing anything, but in normal terms it's a "no no"!) add up to an overall weird experience.<br /><br />Add to that the occasional and normal time traveling paradoxes and some major plot holes and you have a movie that got you through it's romantic magic or a movie that will leave completely cold ...
