I upgraded my PC to Vista because Halo 2 would not run on XP and to become up to date. Halo 2 is graphically the same as 1 IMO. Same characters same feel nothing new, in fact I swear they used the same maps but I could be wrong. The flood are back, the bubble headed boobies are back (ohh the pain the pain). The annoying screens just to get to play single player, I mean who cares if I cant upload my progress, I just want to play!!! I play about half an hour a night before I get bored. It seems that they have ported to PC just to rake in the profits, no thought to current day graphics,Try it out first before you spend your money. This may be the first FPS I have started that I may not finish. Sorry to all Halo fans but...this one is garbage!!
