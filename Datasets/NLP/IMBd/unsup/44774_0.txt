Galaxy of Terrors is basically now known as the "Girl gets Raped by a Worm" movie. And that certainly fits the bill. Because this movie is entirely forgettable. Well, the scene where a guy karate chops off his own arm is pretty cool, but besides that, get ready for a completely average scifi/horror flick.<br /><br />Story revolves around a rescue mission going terribly wrong when people mysteriously start dying off. That's it.<br /><br />The story or idea behind the flick ain't bad. But with such crap writing and such carefree characters, it's just a lot of waiting around for the next death scene to occur. Thankfully the death scenes are kinda cool. But death scenes can't carry a movie. Just ask the Final Destination series.<br /><br />For myself, this was a huge disappointment. I was expecting some great 80s crap. But it turned out just to be kinda crappy. No laughs, the rape scene wasn't very rapish (truthfully I don't even know how she died), not enough use of Haig, awful characters, and it took itself too serious. Which you would think would deliver a couple cheese chuckles. Nope, the flick was just a mediocre flick that didn't do anything particularly right. Well, I don't wanna be too mean. The atmosphere was thick and effective, and the make-up effects were alright. There, that's it.<br /><br />Check it out if you enjoy bad SciFi/Horror, cause there is a following for this flick. But damn, those people must be easily entertained cause this flick was a stinkin bore.
