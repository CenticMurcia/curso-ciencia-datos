Futurama is one of my all time favorite cartoon series. Never gets old. This show is so smart and funny. Why FOX ever canceled this show is beyond me.<br /><br />Instead they have crappy programs like that lie detector game show and other lame junk.<br /><br />Adult Swim was dumb for no longer having Futurama in its nightly line up. It is the only reason I watched it. As far as it being on Comedy Central, at least it is still on the air. As much as I love The Simpsons I can actually say I like Futurama more. Looking at all the nominations and wins the series received while on the air with FOX just proves how dumb FOX was to cancel the show.<br /><br />WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?<br /><br />They brought back Family Guy. Why doesn't FOX and Matt Groening bring back Futurama?
