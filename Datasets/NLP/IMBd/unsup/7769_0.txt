Dead Life is without a doubt the saddest attempt at film-making I have ever witnessed.<br /><br />From a technical viewpoint, this film is a mess. The image quality varies greatly throughout the entire movie, sometimes switching to black and white for no apparent reason. The computer graphic scene is reminiscent of an early Atari game.<br /><br />The soundtrack is out of sync during much of the film, and it's quality fluctuates.<br /><br />The plot is thin and hard to follow. It is often impossible to understand the motivation for the actors actions.<br /><br />The skill of the actors makes it painfully clear that they were chosen for their ability to arrive on the set, rather than talent.<br /><br />This film is full of inconsistencies, hair length and clothing change inexplicably, the same extras appear in two consecutive scenes, supposedly miles away... <br /><br />The list could go on, but I'm getting bored with this review, just as I was when watching this poor excuse for entertainment.<br /><br />After watching Dead Life, I was surprised to find that it wasn't made as a middle school drama class project.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of B movies, but Dead Life is an F at best.
