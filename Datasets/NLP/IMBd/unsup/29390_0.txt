I don't care if people say it's a chick flick. I don't see it that way. I think this movie was a great start for Houston's acting career. The character of Rachel Marron was complex, and her personality clashing with Fram Farmer's set the tone for this movie.<br /><br />I quite enjoyed the soundtrack as well. The music as well as Rachel's performances at various stages of the plot fit perfectly with the mood. The "Queen of the Night" performance was out of control, as was the situation at that point in the movie.<br /><br />What can I say about the end? A perfect ending for a chick like me, I suppose. On a more serious note, I liked how the movie wasn't perfectly happy and warm at the end. It was obvious that these two could not be together at this point in their lives, because they got in each other's way. But, that does not rule out the possibility of them finding one another again later on down the line.
