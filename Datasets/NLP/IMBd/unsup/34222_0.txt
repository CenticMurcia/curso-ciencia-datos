This movie is garbage. It looked interesting and scary so I rented it from Rogers. What also drew me to see it was the comment that it is the scariest movie since The Shining. Yeah right. This movie is TERRIBLE. I am not even exaggerating. It is the worst film I have ever seen, and I really question why ANYBODY would give this movie anything higher than a 2/10 rating. First off, the plot is pathetic and it is extremely boring. There were rarely any moments that the movie was scary at all. The editing was horrible as well. Something would happen in the movie, then all of a sudden it will cut to another scene and never carry on what happened. It's like they just stuck it in there for no apparent reason. The story is very hard to follow in the sense that it makes NO SENSE AT ALL. Don't waste your money or time with this film. Not even halfway through the movie, my mom and I started laughing because it was just so pathetic to the point that it turned into a comedy. Whoever said it was the scariest movie since The Shining should be ashamed. It is an utter disgrace to compare such garbage with The Shining! I actually got scared watching the Shining and had nightmares! I was a little young when I watched it, but still, it was entertaining.
