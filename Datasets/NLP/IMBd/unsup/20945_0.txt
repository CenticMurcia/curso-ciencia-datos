I've always enjoyed Jim Carrey's films. But, somehow, I missed seeing "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". Director Tom Shadyac does a wonderful job, and would go on to even greater success with Carrey in "Liar Liar" and "Bruce Almighty". Jack Bernstein's script (co-written with the star and the director) has some really brilliant gags, and is very bizarre.<br /><br />If the film has one flaw, it is the low energy level of the supporting cast compared to Carrey. While he bounces of the walls, the rest hardly have his level of talent. That's not too big of a complaint, however, in a classic comedy such as this one.<br /><br />7.2 out of 10
