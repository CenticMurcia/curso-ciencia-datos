If you like the Comic, you will like the film. Javier Fesser and Comapny have made the perfect film of Mortadelo and Filemon (Clever and Smart, etc). Benito Pocino is the perfect actor for Mortadelo because he is Mortadelo, and we can't forget Filemon, a great Pepe Viyuela who makes a great performance too. But even the Super and the Profesor Bacterio are as I have imagined them. They have done a great job recreating the inventations and all the items that are in the comics. You can see the Eskimo, and a lot of nonsense in the set, like signs, draws, etc...<br /><br />The Plot is very funny, the seed of the film is the comic El Sulfato Atomico, one of the masterpieces of Iba√±ez, in where you can see the Tirania Dictator, and a lot of inventions.<br /><br />A Must see for all the Real Fans.
