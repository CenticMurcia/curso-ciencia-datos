This film was terrible. Not only did it not stick to historical facts (which would be understandable since Gregory didn't either), but it also completely changed the plot of the novel. First off, the first twenty minutes or so of Mary getting married, etc were never even in the novel, and basically wasted space in the movie. There was just so much wrong with this movie, I cannot even go into it all. I even like all three of the main leads. What annoyed me the most though, was the choppiness of the film. It never took the time to properly explain anything so that if someone who nothing of the Tudor Era walked in to see it, they'd be left dumbfounded the entire 115 minutes. Ex: If you hadn't read the book, you think "what the heck happened to Mary's first husband?" Also, they never shell out the characters properly. Mary, the MAIN CHARACTER, is barely in the movie at all! And you never really understand the relationship with Stafford or any of it! Hm, the one thing that irritated me the most: Henry raping Anne? WHAT?!
