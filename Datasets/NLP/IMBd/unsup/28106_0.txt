Modern film with good use of digital camera. The feel of the movie is really that of the 21th century, pushing the envelope with a vivid, in-your-face, yet artsy imagery. The hand-held video-camera goes way beyond "The Blairwitch Project" with a twisted and most effective use of colors to give a surreal atmosphere to the creepy tale. Poignant futuristic images you'll never forget. I was especially impressed by the bathroom floor-height angles that are so well orchestrated that they would give Hitchcook and Zemeckis a good run for their money in terms of suspense. Yes, there is still something new to do in this over-used "water running" room, where you are literally naked with nothing but skin and your fears. But that is exactly what this film is: NEW. From the use of computers to the rewinding of a scene just played, this movie screams Hi-Tech.<br /><br />So besides the lavish package, the next question is: what's up with the content? Well, it is still a horror movie. So don't expect the plot to be overly thought out or imaginative (like Scream), but it is neither a seen-it-before boring-and-all story full of holes. Actually, I was quite pleased with the screenplay in general. The characters are engaging and the story holds up to mild scrutiny. It has enough twists to keep you wondering and interested.<br /><br />Bottom line is excellent cinematography and better than average story8/10
