Let's put it this way:<br /><br />Variety writes: "Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds" -- and the film-making continues to be just as sloppy.<br /><br />You can't argue with Variety, the showbiz bible. This film probably has two more laughs than the first film, Eating Out, which means it has exactly TWO laughs. Trouble is I can't remember what they are now. What I remember is some really bad acting -- just like in the first film. I remember a stupid script that could have been written by a horny gay high school student. I can't comment on the direction since there isn't evidence of any. My problem with films like this is that they create such a negative image of gays and lesbians for the straight community. The characters are stereotypes. I don't know people like the characters in this film and I don't want to. Why can't the producers of this movie use their financing powers for good?
