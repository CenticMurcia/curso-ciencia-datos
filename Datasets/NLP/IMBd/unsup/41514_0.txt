This is the first time I've ever turned of the movie before the ending. I already started getting worried when I saw the first images.. the movie was recorder with a simple dvcam (or even worse).. The acting is real bad, the camera-work is also very boring and the 'action' is mostly plain stupid... <br /><br />It's OK for an amateur-movie for the friends of the actors/crew, but it's an awful production for someone who has to pay for it. I expected at least a C-movie.<br /><br />I'm sorry but I can't be positive about it, and I can't forgive the dutch publisher who put this trash on DVD (I'm glad it was part of a 4-movie DVD which only cost 3 euro's)..
