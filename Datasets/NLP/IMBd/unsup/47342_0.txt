Come on now. You cant expect someone to watch a movie just cuz it is said to be banned in 43 countries can you?? Well I was victim to that. Thats the only reason why I rented. Stuck it in my DVD player hoping for a half descent movie. The nudity... ahhh its OK.. not great, but its alright. The acting????? There's no need to comment on that. The freaks?? Yeah OK they were real sideshow performers, but I thought that for example the wolf man, or wolf boy played by veekay, was really a wolf boy/man... but apparently he just had a bunch of hair stuck to his face.. So it didn't lie when it said using sideshow performers, but it wasn't what you would have expected. Like the elephant man, if there is one out there why not use him.. but it was a mask.. The make up was excellent I will give it that, but these days, its easy to make things look real. The only good part of the movie, was just gross. Im not a squeamish person, but I had to say.. wow.. looked real. And to someones comment who said "Im wondering if they used a real person or not"... what the hell are you talking about? Do you really think someone is going to get killed that way on camera for the sakes of a shitty movie?? Some people are soooooo stupid.. just for that person.. its called PROSTHETICS....<br /><br />Anyways, movie was bad, acting was bad, banned in 43 countries.. more like..rejected from 43 countries cuz it was soooo FREAKing boring (haha) only good part is the 10 minute torture scene but don't rent it for that, rent something you might enjoy, like The hills have eyes.
