Cloying whimsy with Sandy Dennis as Sarah an incurably ill woman who runs some unspecified "legitimate repair service" that apparently includes the men she takes in to her life and bed each month;she's lover, muse and mother. Sarah makes odd sounds when she sleeps, takes lots of medication, feels tired and cold on occasion, but spends most of her considerable energy, and apparently limited lifetime, prattling. That the men in the film or anyone would tolerate her or find her appealing is beyond me. 2 minutes with Sarah and you'll want to bolt. The script resembles a sitcom without laughs, and the NYC background locations are the only interesting thing in the film. If you are a fan of painful 60's comedy with New York backgrounds like A Thousand Clowns, A Fine Madness, Luv, Any Wednesday, Promise Her Anything...you might want to feast on this turkey. Sweet November is a dud, the title song is awful and the remake is a terrible reworking of a bad idea. Dennis played an even drearier kook in Robert Altman's That Cold Day in the Park(69)in which she holds a young man against his will. Sweet November opened at Radio City Music Hall and pretty much disappeared. Watch it and you'll know why.
