I liked the fact Damodar, the only good thing from the first abysmal movie, was the main villain in this one. Someone mentioned that he seemed to be a spellcaster now, but I disagree. I think he was still a Fighter, but he had an artifact that did all sorts of things for him. Also, why did Damodar run from Berek (the Fighter) at the end? My guess is that Berek is a higher level fighter than Damodar (who was put at 7th level in the first movie in Jeff Grubb's adventure adaptation of the movie), and he knew it. I'd run from a higher level fighter too.<br /><br />Things I liked from the movie in no particular oder: we were told about arcane and divine magic, a passing reference to the Barrier Peaks, the god invoked to save the day was Obad-Hai, the Rogue checked for and disarmed traps and picked a lock or two (and used and ancient secret of the Rogues guild at one point...watch carefully for it!), the Rogue palmed a Gem of True Seeing (which saw some good use), LOTS of lightning bolts, a white dragon with the proper breath weapon, the great wyrm black dracolich (The dragon god, but just woke up so he wasn't up to full god power. Shame he breathed fireballs instead of acid streams, but chalk that up to SFX difficulties.), the Rogue burned through a lock with purple worm stomach acid, we had a lich (who was great near the end), wraiths, cloakers, cool traps, a cameo by a pair of dead drow, and Damodar's half-orc toadie.<br /><br />Someone said the cleric pulled a novice move by jumping out and trying to take down the white dragon, but if he hadn't done so, the rest of the party would have been wyrm food too.<br /><br />All in all, it was an entertaining movie and easily the best movie Sci-Fi Productions has ever done.
