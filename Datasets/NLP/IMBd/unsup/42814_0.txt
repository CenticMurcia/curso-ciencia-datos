$$$$$$<br /><br />People tend to hate this film for its premise rather than it's film-making qualities. If it was called something else however, it would not have made half as much money. The film itself is poor, a definite thumbs down. No drama, no suspense, no thrills. For a monster film it kind of falls flat on it's face.<br /><br />It's real crime is that it's called Godzilla. The creature itself has so many differences to the original that it's not right to call it that (Gojira was over 400 feet tall and would tower over the world trade centre). So it's not the actual creature, let alone a remake (it has nothing to do with the plot of the original film either). Just plain fail from Emmerich and co. So the only possible reason for calling it Godzilla must have been to cash in on the name. Thanks but no thanks.
