Kara Unger co-stars, and that's always good. But this film basically throws away everything it works so hard to achieve. The first 30 minutes or so are fairly engrossing (in a "Dark City", "Matrix", "Strange Days" sort of way) and the settings and characters are intriguing. Then things start to go down the tubes.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT <br /><br />If you are watching the action fairly closely, you will see the entire plot of the movie foreshadowed at least three times in the first ten minutes. I kept expecting that the movie would end with some sort of surprise, but it didn't. This complete lack of suspense contributed significantly to my lack of enjoyment.<br /><br />*****END SPOILER <br /><br />Eventually, the art-house pretentiousness just wears you down. The plot has a few high points and there's a little bit of titillation, but not much else to keep your interest past the halfway point. By the one-hour mark, I just didn't care about any of the characters and (since I knew what the underlying plot point was) I just sort of gave up.<br /><br />To give the director and crew some due, the film definitely has a "look" that belies the small budget. The apartment house is suitably odd, as are all the tenants. Sisto does a good job with what he's given.<br /><br />Still, I thought this would be more worthwhile than it was.
