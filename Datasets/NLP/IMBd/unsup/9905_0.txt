Very disappointing foray into slasher movie territory which misses one central pre-requisite for the genre, towit, if you're going to abandon your plot and characters you have to have blood and ingenious visceral carnage by the bucket-load. Which this film clearly does not. Bar one Argento-esque scene in which the ships Captain is stalked by the sloth-like killer in a toilet, the rest of the set-pieces are poorly constructed, badly lit and downright tedious. I hate to admit I actually fell asleep during this one (I can't imagine that happening during the best horror exploitation pics of Fulci, Deodata and the like.) The crashing soundtrack doesn't help our comprehension of the lame brain plot either. And is it just me who found the killer thoroughly unthreatening to look at? (maybe he should have worn a hockey mask or something....) Has all the directorial style of an end of term film project on a limited Arts Council grant, to which I have but one closing comment: must try harder in the future!
