In 1976, while in a drama academy in Los Angeles, I had the misfortune to be chosen by Mr. Zarindast to act in the film (and I use the term loosely) Kill Alex, Kill. Mr. Zarindast is not one to be stopped by minor details, such as substituting me with someone who had no resemblance whatsoever with me or my character(?). I was never given a script o read, not even the page with the scene in which I was about to appear. My character kills "Alex" in the end of the story an drives away. All this substitution took place while I was in South America and was recalled to film additional scenes, after shooting had ended. I could not help Mr. Zarindast finance his own movie when I was never paid one dime, so I declined to come. I had never seen the film until, in 2003, browsing the internet I found a copy of it in a movie warehouse in Conroe, Texas. I am sure that I purchased the only copy of this disaster ever sold. While filming I thought that my acting was terrible ad unworthy of participating in any home production, let alone a real one. After seeing the tape in 2003, I realized that I was not the worst actor... Mr. Zarindast was. That being said, why would I be surprised at any negative comment towards any of his productions/directions/acting/screen-writings/etc.
