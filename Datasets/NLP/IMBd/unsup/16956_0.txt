This movie is one of the overlooked war movies. It tells a powerful story about how history repeats itself. The Americans find themselves falling into the same trap that the French fell into just a few years earlier. Their fears would be well founded in just a few brief years. <br /><br />Burt Lancaster was great as the beleagured American Major. His fate at the end of the movie is one that every combat soldier must surely dread.<br /><br />Taut direction, combined with a strong supporting cast and a literate plot makes this a must see for fans of the war movie genre. I would put it right up there with Platoon and Saving Private Ryan. A strong 3 1\2 stars.
