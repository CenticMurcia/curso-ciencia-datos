This is the worst movie I've ever seen. My friends and I actually paid money to see it in a theater back in 1985, and were laughing about how bad it was for hours afterwards. On the up side, we did have a good time making fun of it. It's worth seeing as a goof. The idea of people running around with water pistols to kill the neon maniacs was just too ridiculous. And then the movie's abrupt ending in the rain with the comment "This rain can't last forever". People in the theater were booing and moaning.
