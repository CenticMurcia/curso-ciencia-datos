I wondered why I haven't seen that movie before... Because we are very familiar with movies with leading actors... Prestige or illusionist... Except those are much better and exciting as it is difficult to predict anything in the movie... That's why I think they are one of it's kind somewhat unique movies...<br /><br />This movie is about 100 minutes long but I felt like 2 hours or more... Because there is story going on but it's not very successful in catching the audience... <br /><br />The character of Rachel Weisz (Penelope) was the most interesting one... I wish there was more about her skills in the movie because her abilities and specificities as a character were the most exceptional and unique parts of the movie...<br /><br />We see the big brother in the beginning as a cool and promising image, the brain of their smuggler team... But during the movie and especially at the end of the first con on Penelope he was very passive and he lost lots of credits as he is just about to fail during the play of the con and actually fails in the end... That made the character and the movie look very soft... disappointing for me... After all I thought that the character is not cool at all... Thus less excitement...<br /><br />Oh and there was that Diamond Dog, appearing for 1-2 minutes during the movie but the end of movie was based mainly on him... where I was expecting some scenes that involves him too as a leading bad character but we can't see even his face in the end... Not even sure that the actor was the same one...<br /><br />this movie could be one of the best in right hands... Not very satisfactory but not that bad... Despite all the shortcomings you can watch this movie on DVD and spend nice evening time with your family...<br /><br />7 from 6.5... :)
