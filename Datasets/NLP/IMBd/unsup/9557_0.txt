I learned about this series of Vitaphone shorts while channel surfing... I tuned into the Golf channel and was wondering why they were showing an old B&W film. <br /><br />I continued watching until I slowly came to realize who I was watching... the great Bobby Jones.<br /><br />I had seen the film biography of Jones... and have visited a lot of the Jones memorials in Augusta GA. But this was the first time I saw and heard the great man.<br /><br />Cool!<br /><br />I plan on getting the DVD version of this series, given the practical instruction (despite the use of archaic terms like "Mashie Niblick" and "Spoon." <br /><br />This film... and the others in the series, are very highly recommended for all golfers!
