I will just make a few comments about this film.<br /><br />This is a highly irrational and illogical film noir. It's something quite rare I must say that, but in a good way? The answer to that is more or less yes. A lot of it was genius but some of it was quite poor. <br /><br />It was also way too sarcastic. Felt like they tried to make a joke about, well just about everything. I did laugh a few times though, but it didn't fit! This wasn't a black comedy though it could have been one hell of a genius black comedy if they changed a few things.<br /><br />It's both unexpected in some parts yet quite predictable in others.<br /><br />I love Mankiewicz and his direction was fabulous, that must be said! But I'm not so sure about the story.<br /><br />I will say this though. It is good! See it if you have a chance! I won't directly recommend it since I only like to recommend films I love but yeah it is a nice little film!
