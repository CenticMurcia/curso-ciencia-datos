Morbid, cynical, depressing script. Overstaged, empty direction. Actors who can't act, let alone dance or sing. Apparently no one noticed that, in the classic '30s musicals, there's no more than one or two tap-dance numbers per show--more than that irritates, and almost all the numbers in "Pennies" are tap dances. All the gimmicks like lip syncing wear out their welcome after two or three repetitions. A truly worthless venture.
