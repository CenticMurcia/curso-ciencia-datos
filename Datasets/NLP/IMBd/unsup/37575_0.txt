I see many being enthusiastic about the series..<br /><br />Unfortunately I have another opinion..<br /><br />The idea is good and I have nice memories from the 80s when I saw some parts of it. Now when watching it with the kids I feel cheated by my own memories..<br /><br />The very first part is promising. There is a sense of getting the big picture in an entertaining way. Blend of details and jokes and overview is quite balanced.<br /><br />But the further one goes the stack of DVDs and episodes the more frustrated one starts to feel.<br /><br />The history part gets often obscured by Tom & Jerry (or perhaps Asterix) like fast action fights & jokes. Sometimes linked to the time and events described. But often not. This perhaps is the most frustrating aspect as quite often one is left with an uncertain feeling... Was there something to be learned - ow was that a simple joke.. Then when the story goes to describing real historic facts these are often fast paced listings of years, names of important people/fights, etc.. Perhaps that is the part for adults as the kids have no chance of learning from that level of details coming at that pace..<br /><br />Transitions from the life of individuals to the world events is often surprising and would benefit from better justification / preparation. Further confused by reusing the same characters in different roles in different episodes.. It is like one should have read the history books in advance to really understand what the events described are connected to.<br /><br />There are good points in the series, there is high level of ambition, but somehow one feels that the mix of plain cartoon amusement and real history teaching is not really working. Perhaps it is the 30 years that have passed from the production of the series.. But the end result is a bit questionable in teaching history to kids as it makes the boundary between real facts and plain fiction quite hard to see
