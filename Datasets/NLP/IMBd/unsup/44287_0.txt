FF7 was less then average at best. The problem with it is that it had to compete and overdo it's ancestor, FF6, the best video game ever made. FF7's storyline even resembles that of FF6's, including an evil corporation that is trying to take over he world. In FF6, it's "the Empire" and in FF7 it's a corporation. Way more characters are met and played in FF6; 15 beings are acquired, compared to FF7's 7 or 8. The most annoying thing about FF7 is Cait Sith, a poor excuse to include humor in an otherwise failing game. Cait Sith is to FF what Jar Jar Binks is to Star Wars. Don't waste your time.
