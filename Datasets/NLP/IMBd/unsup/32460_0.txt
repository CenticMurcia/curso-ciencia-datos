Spoilers ahead (if you can call them that). There is no reason to watch this worthless slasher. A killer with a twitchy eye awakes. Mario Lopez from "Saved by the Bell" leads a bunch of nobodies into the forest-they all die (EVERYBODY!) and rather bloodlessly at that!!!!!! The twitchy eyed killer goes back to sleep.....THE END.....So many unintentionally laughable moments....No fun whatsoever.....Gary Busey's roll is stupid and about 1 minute long. Should be called "A Cr.p in the Floor".
