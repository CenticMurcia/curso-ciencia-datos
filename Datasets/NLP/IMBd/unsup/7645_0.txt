This movie lasted 109 min. and already around 5 min. into it I was bored!! I really sat through 109 min. of just wanting something to happen, but nothing did. Maybe this movie is good for people interested in the event that took place in 1970, but as I knew nothing about it, it didn't appeal to me. I had hoped that a good ending would come in and save the movie, but I was let down there as well! I have seen loads of movies and have voted for over 370 movies here at IMDb, some of my favorites being "Schindler's list", "Limelight", "Breaking the waves", "Awakenings", "Fried green tomatoes", "The green mile", "Legends of the fall", "Saving private Ryan", etc., so it's not that I don't like this type of film (drama), on the contrary. I've started viewing more and more drama instead of just lame Hollywood blockbuster action flicks, but this movie was extremely boring and slow. It wasn't terrible, but REALLY bad! No more than 2 out of 10 from me!
