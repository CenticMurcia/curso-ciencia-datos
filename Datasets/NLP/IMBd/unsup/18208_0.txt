The non-Hollywood fuzzy camera first put me off, but the initial action fight-chase scene had me wondering what was happening and why.<br /><br />Then you go to the daylight scene with the Archaeologist, which seems totally unconnected to the opening scene and as you watch Dr Page go hot and indignant against the Developer, you wonder how in Hell are the two connected. Plus, despite the low-budget indie effort-- the actors are all putting serious feeling into their roles.<br /><br />Last-- you come to the Police teams and the unexplained problem of dead homeless people-- and now you have a Mystery. And you will want to see how everything ties together. Then comes the Alien Voss, who is searching for something and he's a nasty piece of action.<br /><br />Just as the Opening scene showed, this flick will jump into action, shootouts, car chases and confrontations and a lot of Fatalities. There is some ick-horror embedded here also-- and a little humor, but never overdone.<br /><br />The ending will not exactly follow your expectation. Nor will everything be neatly explained-- but the flick will leave you with gaps that a Sci-Fi fan can fill in the blanks with his or her own theories.<br /><br />In short-- I don't necessarily call the LACK of a coherent explanation a Negative: It's a Mystery because you will never really know what you were involved with, especially if you're only concerned with getting out Alive.<br /><br />I was genuinely Surprised and intrigued. And at the end-- Not Disappointed.<br /><br />Give this one a shot on a Friday Night. I wouldn't call this a Main event movie, but a thought-provoking Indie dish when you want to try something different from the normal polished Hollywood script.<br /><br />If this is a First Effort, the creators of this movie will definitely be coming round again for more.
