I saw a screening of this at the Bend film festival. It seemed to have been well received by those that stayed until the end. The acting starts off great but soon fades to mundane texts. The movie makes many twists and turns and effectively creates a solid storyline BUT it's main effect of the hand-held camera destroys the depth of the story. When a movie, or any story, puts everything from a "character's" point of view that character must have some effect on the audience. It turned out to be a cheap trick that in the end made the movie a cheap exploitation rather than the gruesome thriller it could have been. This was my first experience with a film festival, particularly with a world premiere. I'm not sure how much to forgive to those that are working with a minimum budget. This team may have better luck in the future with some more money to not have to worry about shoddy camera tricks and focus on the story.
