Albert Ter Heert does a marvelous job in showing the viewers the inside of a sensitive issue in the Netherlands - integration. A heart warming and funny, bitter-sweet story with high-octane entertainment; Shouf Shouf Habibi enriches the viewer with insight into the struggle of a traditional Moroccan family trying to integrate into Dutch society, while maintaining their "identity" as well. An all-too-familiar scenario that occurs in every nation on earth; integrating into a society that neither understands nor fully accepts you is a challenge that every immigrant must face. The Dutch and Moroccan actors in this movie were most genuine in their presentation of the topic. It's an eye-opener to the ubiquitous intolerance of the unfamiliar in every society, but is presented in a light-hearted, enjoyable way that both educates and entertains. A delight to the senses.
