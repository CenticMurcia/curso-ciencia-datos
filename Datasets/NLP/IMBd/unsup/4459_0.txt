Not the worst film I have ever seen ("The Fourth Kind" is the current champion in that particular category), but considering the charm of the series I must ask "what in Sodor were these film makers thinking?" The idea of a human being able to interact with the trains and people of Sodor has some appeal; sadly that - and watching Alec Baldwin having a ball and Peter Fonda attempting to "keep it real, man" - is the only high point in this film. I had to wonder what sort of medications were being abused by the scriptwriters, or perhaps they never mentally left the psychedelic sixties. Fans of the Thomas series will want to fast-forward through the live action sequences (which truly never match the Sodor world) to get to the train sequences. It is almost like watching two different movies at the same time, but spliced onto one reel. Seriously, the only real way to enjoy this film fully is to turn the sound off and make up your own dialogue as you go along. Better yet, forget this film and just go with the other Thomas offerings.
