What do you get when you put the 2 greatest actresses alive today (Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn) together with the incomparable Bruce Willis and thrown in a little Isabella Roselini for good measure...you get a hilariously funny comedy that had to have been just as much fun to make as it was to watch! The effects in this film were uproariously funny and definitely Oscar worthy! The acting is unsurpassed and it is filled with comic scenes such as the one where they make Hellen Sharp (Goldie's character) look a hundred pounds heavier and place her in an apartment cluttered with trash, cats, and frosting containers! How about the funny lines such as "You paint my ass, I'll paint yours!" and the 'death' scenes. How do you kill something that won't die? You don't but you have lots of fun mutilating her! The fight sequence where Hellen and Madeline Ashton (Meryl's character) beat each other senseless without killing each other or even inflicting pain is uproariously funny! Hellen winds up with a huge hole in her stomach and Madeline winds up with a broken neck that won't repair itself. Only Earnest Menville (Bruce Willis' character and the man these 2 women fight over throughout the film) can piece them together again! Not since Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" have 2 such brilliant and gifted actresses been on the same screen and worked so well together to make such a colorful and masterful film...see it today, if you haven't already and if you have...see it again!
