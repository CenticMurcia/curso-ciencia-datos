I am not a fan of Master P's music or movies, but I would rather sit through one of his CD's for an hour than be forced to watch his cinematic exploits. When I think of his movies, one of the titles sticks out, Foolish. This sums up what all of his movies are. The acting is terrible, the scripts are lame, confusing, non existent, or a combination of all three. He just cranked out junk to add money to his growing empire. When a producer casts his family, friends, and label mates in all his films, this should be a clue it definitely won't be nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br />Granted, AJ Johnson is funny in most of his roles, but when given nothing to work with, what can you do? Master P thinks he is the next Ice Cube. Wake up call, Ice Cube has talent, something Master P seriously lacks. I think the movie viewing public will be safe for a while from being tortured by another No Limit movie production considering almost everyone on the label is either facing some type of criminal charge or serving time for being found guilty on charges brought against them. As long as video cameras and crew are not allowed inside prisons, we should be OK for at least 5-7 years.
