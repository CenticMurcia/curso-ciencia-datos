Connie Selleca, whose acting rivals that of Ali McGraw as the worst actress ever to hit Hollywood or Made-for TV-Movies, has little redeeming value in this film. So much so that Kevin Dobson's infidelity is totally understandable. If Buck Rogers divorced her in real life, that should tell you something. As much as Kate Hepburn's quivering chin and teary eyes are an annoyance to devotees of serious acting in film, Connie Selleca's wooden gestures and her inability to deliver a line with any meaningful emotion are enough to invoke the "throw-up" doctrine for evaluating films: If an actor's inability to act creates such nausea that vomiting in unavoidable, then the film itself should be consigned to the nearest trash-bin. Ms. Selleca should do us all a favor and retire at once from the film biz.
