This movie was awful. I have to agree with the person who said most of these reviews were written by people connected with the movie. My friends and I decided to watch this movie today because,like an idiot, I fell for the glorious comments about this movie being great and different. The only dream Brian has is of himself not Drew. She's just a vehicle for him to yap about himself on the big screen. It's not funny, it's not sweet, it's not witty, it's not inspirational. But it is really boring. I just registered for IMDb today right after I saw this nonsense so others won't be led astray like me. This site, I always felt, was for "real people" who ARE NOT connected with the movie in ANY way. This whole things smells like when Sony created the fake critic David Manning to promote their movies. But unlike that case, I won't get a $5 refund. And if this movie won any awards as one reviewer states, then I have a "documentary" of me sleeping I'd like to submit to the judges. You'll laugh, you'll cry, it's magic. Interestingly, it too is about dreams.<br /><br />And if these reviews are truly sincere, well, then I will politely disagree with them. But honestly (hmmm...honesty, there's a loose concept),I think I'm one of the few people on this site that's actually seen the movie. It REEKS.
