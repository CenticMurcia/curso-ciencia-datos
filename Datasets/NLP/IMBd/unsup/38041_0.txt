As someone that was born and raised in New Jersey, a huge Howard Stern fan (back when it was free, that is), and a fan of both baseball movies and R-rated comedies, I had high hopes for this movie. Boy, was I off when I finally got to see this thing! The movie wasn't funny at all except for a few scenes here and there. The screenplay was more sitcom material than movie material where the comedic lines just don't sound natural at all. After one character says a "funny" line, it's followed by a silent beat as if it's allowing time for the audience to laugh before the story continues. What's that about??! Artie Lange's acting is horrible. He's no leading man and should just stick to supporting roles instead. It's a shame because some of biggest laughs I ever had in my life came from listening to the Howard Stern radio show which Artie helped tremendously when he was added to the show, but the comedy involved in Howard's show wasn't stale one-liners that fell flat. Instead, it was the realistic banter between everyone in the gang about their lives, arguing or busting each other's balls. You'd think Artie Lange would learn from his own radio show what would make a great comedy, but, no!, he chooses to make an 86-min. episode of The Artie Show instead.
