Even allowing for it's age, this film is basically a clunker.<br /><br />The plot is ridiculous, the script is dreadful, the acting dire and the special effects are laughable.<br /><br />Anyone who knows anything about computers will cringe at lines like "the new RISC architecture will change everything." "yeah, RISC is cool." or "it has a 28 point 8 bps modem" (even when 28.8 modems were state of the art, who called them 28 point 8 BPS modems?)<br /><br />If you are teenage boy and a fleeting glimpse of Angelina Jolie's nipples is the most exciting thing you can think of, watch this movie. Otherwise look elsewhere for your evening's entertainment.
