I had no intention of seeing this piece of schlock, but finally caved into temptation. I had to see why anyone would bother to make a sequel to a film that obviously did not need one (much like Jaws), well I did not expect much and got even less. This film is a gratuitous waste of time that has nothing like the intensity of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Henry was not a slasher film, it is human portrait, better yet a sort of cynical comment on films about real people. Henry Lee Lucas was a real person, but certainly not the type of person that has any right being venerated in film. Even if he did not kill all of the people that he claimed to, he is still a degenerate who has still killed.<br /><br />This film was a meditation on the type of mind that can do these horrible things, it is a commentary on the evil in man's heart. Henry was not exploitive in any way (which is why I object to it being placed in the Horror section at video stores and its being referred to as a Slasher film), it was grim and unpleasantly realistic. It did not attempt to be entertaining, whereas this pathetic sequel does, it tries to portray Henry as a slasher or a character rather than the simple, banal evil of the original film. I am completely baffled by the fact that this film was ever made and what possibly could have motivated it (well, money of course, but thats not an excuse).
