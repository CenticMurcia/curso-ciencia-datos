Coming from the same people who gave us the bloody awful Octopus movies, I fully expected Spiders to be a complete stinker; I'm glad to report, however, that this cheapo big-bug movie is a lot more fun than I thought it would be (hey, I might even go so far as to say that it was actually rather good!).<br /><br />The film stars Lana Parrilla as spunky college reporter Marci who, along with a couple of pals, infiltrates a top-secret government base where the sole survivor of a space-shuttle disaster has been taken for observation. Unfortunately for Marci and her fellow 'snoopers', the unlucky astronaut has been impregnated by a genetically mutated spider, and it's not long before a huge, ravenous arachnid emerges from his body to feed...<br /><br />The story, by prolific writer Boaz Davidson, is completely predictable B-movie hokum, and the visual effects vary from the reasonably impressive to the completely naff, but with decent pacing from director Gary Jones, some nice gore make-up and creature effects from KNB, and a cast who look like they're having loads of fun with the clich√©d schlock-horror material, Spiders passes the time very nicely.<br /><br />If you love cheesy sci-fi featuring over-sized monsters on the rampage, then you should have a great time with this one.
