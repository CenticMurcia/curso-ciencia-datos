I think this has got to be one of the funniest British films ever made. The sheer silliness of the plot and the completely mismatched trio of friends make this a film to sit back with a beverage of your choice and laugh at.<br /><br />In my opinion, all the cast play their parts well, with an outstanding performance from the veteran Leslie Phillips as an piano teacher who likes a "small" sherry. The sequence involving a pre-war socket and a modern tape recorder has me in fits of laughter.<br /><br />The finale, involving the three main characters singing in a talent show [ dressed as pig-tailed schoolgirls ] has tears rolling down my face and my face aching from laughter. Again, the farcical nature of the lyrics about how each of them " lost IT " in various locations around the school and "IT" turning out to be not what you were expecting, just gives the whole film an appeal to all ages from the older kids up to grandparents.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, give it a go - you'll be surprised.
