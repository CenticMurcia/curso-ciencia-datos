No, there are no zombies having sex in this film, the zombies just do what zombies normally do...wander slowly and aimlessly and munch on human flesh. It's the living that have all the sex in this movie & boy is there lots....way too much for my taste & all pretty graphic, nothing left to the imagination. Hardly what I'd call erotic. Seems that there's a rich American developer that wants to build a hotel on a remote island, and he hires a guy with a boat to take him and his recent acquisition (Laura Gemser) to this place. The island is supposedly deserted but it seems that an old man lives there with his granddaughter, who may or may not be among the living herself. Of course the zombies get riled and walk, and munch. The best parts of this are filmed on the island, before that it's almost all extremely long sex scenes which get rather boring. There is a bright spot though in what appears to be a young Filipino woman who performs a strip-tease in an empty nightclub for our ship's captain, and she opens a bottle of champagne using her enormous...uh...talent. A very sleazy movie & of perhaps minor interest to horror fans. 4 out of 10.
