One of the worst movies I have seen this year and I have seen many. Riddled with technical errors, a space shuttle ditches beneath the surface of the ocean and the crew must somehow survive and get out.<br /><br />Shuttle has a submarine depth gage! Do submarines have airplane altimeters? Interior doors all lock one way only. I guess the shuttles are designed this way so crew can lock themselves in for some "private time" from sexual encounters like hiding the salami to just a good old session of pouting and crying.<br /><br />Love triangle ensues aboard the shuttle. God help us. Too much time spent on social relations in the abyss instead of survival. Can't they find enough astronauts on the program that just wanna fly the mission and leave their love interests on earth? Heroin goes up with long bangs dangling by face, probably got caught in the shuttle's transmission. No wonder they ditch.<br /><br />This movie was so bad I had to watch the whole thing to see how retarded it could get with this cast of basic nobodies. Take a peek but remember you'll never get that time back in your life. Time not well wasted.
