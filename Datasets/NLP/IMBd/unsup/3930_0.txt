'Nowhere' is definitely among my favorite movies of all time with the likes of '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Eraserhead', Pierrot le Fou' and others. It's sad to see that many people have misunderstood it, but then again, it's certainly not meant for everyone. People think it's thrash, just a fun flick like 'The Evil Dead' or the Troma movies. This is actually ART made to look like thrash, because it brings the audience closer to the characters. In my opinion the movie is totally impressive, both both visually and thematically. I love the dark and apocalyptic feel to it, this definitely looks like the generation that's gonna witness the end of everything. Araki is a MASTER and 'Nowhere' is his MASTERPIECE.
