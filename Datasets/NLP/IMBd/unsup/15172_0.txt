I saw this film at the Miami Gay and Lesbian Film Festival this week and I totally loved it!!!!! Even more than the first. <br /><br />If you are ready for a Cliché, stereotypical, and yet totally hot and fun gay comedy then sign yourself up for Sloppy seconds. This sequel is very much that, all the while pushing the envelope so much further than the first chapter, Eating Out . Be warned this time its full of much more shocking and crazy situations, yet guaranteed more laughs than the first, so in fewer words if you liked the first you will love this one even more. On an exciting note this is the first ever American gay movie sequel. If you remember in part one Kyle convinces his straight roommate to pretend to be gay to get the girl he was attracted to. Well in this journey Kyle is the one who is pretending, in order to get the surprisingly hot, model Troy. Kyle fell in love or should I say lust with Troy when he modeled nude for Kyle's art class. The funny thing is Kyle pretends to be an Ex Gay to get to spend time with Troy. While doing so he gains self confidence and esteem. To be honest the acting in this movie is clearly not the best, but you soon forget about the over acting once the movie gets started. Even right from the opening scene which basically sets the mood with a homo erotic scenario where two guys were getting ready to go at it, of course with a gay guy seducing a straight guy. <br /><br />This movie is full of hilarious one liners like when Tiffani says that she wishes a guy would say "I love you" instead of "Take it you tight little ..", that and many more.<br /><br />I will however say that the most interesting twist is the whole ex gay ministry segment with their homo no more movement lead by Allen who obviously gets off on the other ex gays telling of their sexual slip ups with men. <br /><br />This movie was Brilliant and funny, yes cliché as in it portrayed the stereotypical gay characters that we usually think of for gay drama. However I honestly know many people like this. They are often shallow and manipulative on their journey to get sex, sex and more sex. So to be honest this movie was not only full of super hot, some of which get fully naked (yes inclusive with cock shots), but it was also believable, enjoyable and ridiculously funny to the point that I was screaming. <br /><br />PS. Some may say that this movie gives gays a bad name. Well if the shoe fits wear it, why do you think bath houses, and the adult book stores with glory holes are so popular? Most men have a one track mind and its sad but true, but it doesn't mean its not funny to watch
