After 1981 the knock off's of the Road Warrior -- Mad Max 2 kept a cumin'. This one is set in New Zealand! It has a cameo from everyones fav mail man from Cheers Cliff Clavin. A little post nuke grubby of course. I remember Cliff builds some sort of road warrrior like dune buggy for the hero that goes up against a fortified 18-wheeler truck. I think 98% of the budget went to that truck. Give or take a dollar. Worth my time? Not really. Yeah, this one sucks. What did you expect? I like the start thou, it has this burning tire smoky start that is so a direct rip off of Ole' Max which is hard not to laugh. I've seen worse. Very small cast, in fact I think it re-uses actors if you watch carefully. I forgot about this one but who can you blame there? Not sure if this is even on DVD but not worth the effort unless it has director commentary offering explanations and apologies!
