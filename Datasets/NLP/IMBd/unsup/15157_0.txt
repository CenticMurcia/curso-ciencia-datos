This is a great example of Australian humor which is prevalent throughout the movie. <br /><br />With less known names such as Jamie Croft ("The Real Macaw") and Richard Moir ("Round the Twist"), this movie is bound to be enjoyed by those who appreciate and understand the Australian culture, and more importantly, the humor. <br /><br />Although a couple of Americans appear in this film, they fit in well with the storyline, which is presented as them being introduced to the Australian way of life, which makes a nice change from the usual attempts which American film makers make to put an Australian spin on what is essentially an American film, mostly unsuccessfully. Being made by an Australian film company and including Americans, this movie simply works.<br /><br />The storyline is consistent and demonstrates perfectly a true Steve Irwin style approach to animal activism and conservation, in this case, the protection of Australia's most well known animal icon: the kangaroo. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in Australian movies, movies about animals and movies about conservation. But most of all, those who enjoy a good laugh and appreciate the uniqueness of Australian humor.
