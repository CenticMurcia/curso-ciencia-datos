This is one of the most boring, dull, and worthless movies I've ever seen. 96 minutes felt like 96 hours. I have never been so annoyed with characters of a film, nor have I ever prayed for a character to be killed off before I saw this movie. It is a poor attempt at trying to be obscure, and it fails. It is a waste of time and money.
