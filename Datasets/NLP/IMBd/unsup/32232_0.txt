This is the sort of film that only Woody Allen (in the 70's) could do. It is all surprisingly classy for a sex comedy, and has many brilliant sketches. There is one part of the film where Gene Wilder plays a doctor who falls in love with a sheep that has to be seen to believed.<br /><br />Certain parts of the film might be considered to be in extremely bad taste. Case in point is the TV show, "What's Your Perversion?", where a Rabbi has a fantasy to be tied up in silk, get whipped, and have his wife kneel at his feet eating pork. All at the same time! Not to say the film isn't funny. In fact, it's one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. Of course, the best part of the film is the well-known "What Happens During Ejaculation?" sketch, where we get to see the inner workings of a man's body during intercourse.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the film there are many great supporting roles, such as John Carradine as a Frankenstein-esquire doctor, Tony Randall as the "Operator", and the aforementioned Gene Wilder.<br /><br />Recommended (But not for your parents).<br /><br />7.6 out of 10
