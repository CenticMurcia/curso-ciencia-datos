I'm only commenting due to the lack of information about this movie available--I'd like to keep anyone interested from making my same mistake.<br /><br />"Uniform" was a largely cliche-ridden, uninspired movie which contained sequences both unappealing to the eye and intellect ("simple" as the reviews called it). Essentially fruitless, "Uniform" is simply unbearable to sit through-I painstakingly made my way through half. I found it amazing this movie was given any credibility (however underground it may be), as every aspect was entirely banal and seemingly ignored during production (note when a passing SUV passenger sticks his head out the window to look at the camera crew). An obnoxiously linear story teamed with horrible, horrible acting is what should be expected.<br /><br />In summation...<br /><br />"Zhifu" is reminiscent of a student film--a student sadly disgracing cinema who has no right to be using the medium until he shows a little more respect for it's intrinsic artistic value.
