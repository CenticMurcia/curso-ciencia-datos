Scott Wiper is one of the most talented film makers of my (30 something) generation! And Larry Sher is a cinematographic genius! (Way to go there Kyle and Ephram!)I know this to be true because I have had the great experience of working with both of them.<br /><br />I loved the film guys! Let's hope you partner up for another one soon.<br /><br />For all of you action/suspense film lovers - this film is for you! Move over Bruce, Arnie, and Sly - here comes Scotty Wiper!<br /><br />
