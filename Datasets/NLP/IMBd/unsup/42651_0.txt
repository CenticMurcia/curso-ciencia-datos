Gabrielle said a comment that made me very disappointed in her. I have watched Desperate Housewives and sometimes they have shows that have a good moral to it and sometimes are funny. It is, I think, very well written. But over the past couple of episodes, I have been disappointed. When Gabrielle said that virginity went out of style in the 1950's, I wanted to tell her that I hope she knows she just convinced a lot of teenagers to go and commit adultery. Living in this world is already hard enough with all of the pornography and drugs out there, we do not need someone encouraging people that they would be cool if they were not a virgin. I am only 15 and I wanted to tell you that I will always be a virgin until I am married. That comment that she made has a huge impact on this world, and it is not a good one. I know it will cause a lot of sorrow in this world with the people because they will find out it will not bring happiness. I will never watch Desperate Housewives again unless you take that comment back!
