Obviously, EVERYTHING should be taken loosely, especially when it comes to events as sensitive as 9/11 -- but I am shocked at how many people are choosing to not even question one ounce of what happened that particular day. It's exactly why America is in the state it's in -- no one wants to "rock the boat" or see another point of view, even if it means effecting an event that forever rocked our security as a nation.<br /><br />I am further shocked that the people who are so quick to disregard even an ounce of this information haven't even bothered to research "the lies" even a little. If even 1/3 of what is said in the movie is true, isn't that enough to further investigate?
