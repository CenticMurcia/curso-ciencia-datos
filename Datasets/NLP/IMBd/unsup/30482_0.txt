The movie is supposed to be a comedy, and does somewhat average.<br /><br />Don't expect this to be a great movie or take things seriously then u'll be thoroughly disappointed.<br /><br />The movie starts well. Nihal Singh a policeman of Punjab gets the chance to grab international terrorist "Romeo". But he is so innocent he believes in Romeo's story and romeo escapes. nihal singh has to catch romeo for this is the only way he can recover his and family's prestige.<br /><br />so he comes to newyork to catch "romeo".<br /><br />the comedy was good at the start but it dragged after that. The heroine and the vamp are dump and show a lot, as it is supposed to be.<br /><br />See the movie with full timepass mode.
