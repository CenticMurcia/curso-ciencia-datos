I oh so wanted to see this film desperately after seeing the awesome trailer for it. I mean, a two color musical, the first ever made for Warner Brothers! The King Of Jazz has no plot. Nada. Nil. Instead it's a whole pile of musical numbers and comedic skits. The whole thing is centered around a guy who was popular at the time, Paul Whiteman, and his orchestra. The one thing I really liked about this movie is the set design. THAT was truly gaga, but soon lame musical number after lame musical number envelops what good that does and makes this an AWFULLY uncomfortable sit through. Well, at least we got to see a very very young Bing Crosby. That's about all that makes this watchable.
