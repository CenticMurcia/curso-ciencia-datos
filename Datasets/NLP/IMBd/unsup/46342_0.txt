Having just killed two men, and tortured a convenience store assistant, three thugs (two thoroughly sadistic bastards and one 'nice' guy) decide to lie low, taking refuge at a deserted farmhouse, home to pretty young teenager Lisa and her paralysed war veteran grandfather. Naturally, it's not long before the more morally bankrupt members of the murderous trio decide that they wanna piece o' Lisa; to their horror, however, the girl proves to be not quite as defenceless as she at first appears...<br /><br />Axe is one of many low-budget pieces of trash that gained notoriety thanks to its inclusion on the Video Nasty list during the 1980s, and, as such, will forever be of interest to those who are compelled to check out the 'forbidden'. The irony is, of course, that if it hadn't been for the futile efforts of a handful of politicians, Britain's right-wing newspapers and certain clueless activists, the film would have been long forgotten by now (along with many other titles on the list).<br /><br />Although just over an hour long, this amateurish home-invasion exploitationer is still rather tedious stuff, being extremely slow and very predictable. It also features a poorly developed plot and characters (apparently due to a rather rushed production in order to meet distributors demands), several totally unbelievable moments (Lisa being able to dismember one attacker in the bath unseen, and then even convince the gullible 'nice guy' that his partner in crime did it!) and a dreadful score consisting of an abysmal aural assault by stylophone, bongos, piano and tambourine!.<br /><br />Also, whilst this is admittedly fairly grim stuff thematically, with endless scenes of humiliation, rape, murder, and the suggestion of cannibalism in the film's final moments (or so I understoodÂ—the whole soup thing was fairly confusing), there is nothing particularly shocking to see: a very weak neck slicing, a couple of off-screen axe attacks, and a headless chicken. Nasty, but all things unlikely to cause a problem for today's jaded horror audiences.
