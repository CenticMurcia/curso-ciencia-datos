This film was made way back in the Cold War days. We knew who the enemy was, and how to do combat with them. They were Russians and Communist Chinese, who flew MIG aircraft with which we could do aerobatic battle. The Soviet Union had not collapsed and we weren't buying more from China than they were buying from us.<br /><br />That was then, this is now. The "enemy" has used our own passenger aircraft as suicidal missiles to crash into the World Trade Center. We are in 2 wars for oil where the weapons of choice are Improvised Explosive Devices (IED's) and 4000 Americans have died to protect oil company holdings. <br /><br />Top Gun is a quaint nostalgic look in history, the way we were, then.
