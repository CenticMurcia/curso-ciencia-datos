When I first saw My Cousin Vinny, I then realized the difference in those movies that were done pre-2000, and those done today is like comparing a juicy orange to a glass of rancid milk. My Cousin Vinny was from start to finish outstanding in story line and acting. One cannot find one actor in the movie that failed in any way in his or her part. Of course Pesci was great - the woman in it, Marissa Tomei not only was quick, witty, gorgeous, but acted the part easily - and I think was the #1 actor in the movie. There's no doubt that My Cousin Vinny will be my favorite repeat picture in my library. The social conduct of Northerner or Southerner left you with a love for both (allowing that some have leanings either way). It definitely is a must see for anyone, and definitely keeps your interest from start to finish.
