I had previously seen Tom Waits version of Woyzeck in the theater which I love, read the novel, which is equally good. Watching this 'classic' was a disgrace to movie lovers across the globe. I found the film cheap and mainly bought it because of Kinski I must admit. He does a good job in this movie, which just ends out being dull and long (though it isn't that long!). The scenes are built up as if you sat in the theater - long shots from one side, only with few closeups now and then. It felt to me as a waste of time, as I had hoped to watch Woyzeck THE MOVIE, not another run of a theater play. If you like Kinski, watch the movie to see his grotesque faces, if not - leave it alone.
