Little Carlitos has a problem. He has been left home with his grandma because his mother, Rosario, has gone to Los Angeles to work. One thing though, Rosario never lets a Sunday go by without calling her son in Mexico at 10am. She also sends presents that make her son the envy of the town where he lives. Carlitos is much more mature than his nine years. He is savvy of how things work.<br /><br />Carlitos has made friends with Dona Carmen, a lady that is in charge of the 'coyotes' that bring illegal Mexicans across the border, for a price. She is reluctant to let the little boy try to go North because of the dangers ahead. Carlitos grandma's sudden death gives him the opportunity to try his luck. Help comes in the shape of a Chicano couple that volunteer to take the boy through the border at El Paso. Unfortunately, they are detained because they show as being delinquent in the payment of traffic fines. Carlitos decides he must go on his own.<br /><br />At this point, the film turns into a 'road picture' because along the way, Carlitos will encounter all kinds of people. In general, the Americans he meets are bad. He clings to another Mexican that started being unfriendly, but in the end he offers a sacrifice to the boy that was completely unexpected because of he sees in the boy the person he would like to be. A happy ending is in store for the boy and his mother.<br /><br />"La misma luna" is a well intentioned film that proved to be a crowd pleaser at Sundance, the year it was presented there. Directed by Patricia Riggen, and written by Ligiah Villalobos, the film aims to please the audiences which have been targeted to reach. America Ferrera, who appears in a small role, better known for her role in "Ugly Betty", is credited as one of the producers.<br /><br />The best thing in the film are Adrian Alonso and Eugenio Derbez. As Enrique, talented Mexican actor Mr. Derbez, gives one of his excellent performances. Adrian Alonso, who is older than the boy in the picture wins the audience's heart because of his precociousness and determination to find his mother in a strange land. Wonderful Kate Del Castillo plays Rosario, the Mexican immigrant working as a domestic and being taken advantage by wealthy employers that only want to exploit her and pay nothing in return. Carmen Salinas, a good Mexican character actress is seen as Dona Carmen, the 'coyote' coordinating lady.<br /><br />The cinematography by Checco Varese takes us from Mexico into the United States along the routes traveled by Carlitos and Enrique before landing in Los Angeles. The musical score is by Carlo Siliotto. The film will please the viewer because in spite of its implausible plot, it has its heart in the right place and sends a positive message about the bond between a boy and his mother.
