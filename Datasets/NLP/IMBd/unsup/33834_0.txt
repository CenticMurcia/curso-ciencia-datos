OMG were do I begin this movie was so stupid. First of all Bollywood cant make movies anymore they just copy western books and movies. I don't want to spoil a lot of it for you people who think its good but they just copied it read the book "The Letter A" same story only the letter A was true and it took place on a farm jeez bollywood get some creativity.<br /><br />The casting was alright but that girl when she was young lol now that was funny. She looked like she was possessed or something. Jezz what are they trying to make a movie or a bad version of the Excorsit<br /><br />Well thats all I have to say if you still want to watch it be my guest but bollywood needs creativity. A begger in India can become a movie writer at this rate. They just need to get some western book and there u go one stupid movie.
