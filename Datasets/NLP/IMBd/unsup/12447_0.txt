I saw Martin Murphy's film "lost thing's" last night because I love thriller's and horror and have been wanting to see some from other countries.I was impressed and watched it twice to understand it better.The beach was beautiful and the soundtrack eerie with the background sounds.The fact that the beach was empty with no other people except an older guy who was preaching doom, and only had snakes and sinister looking birds on it was unsettling. Some people wrote that the 2 leading young men looked too much alike,well I disagree! They played cousins who were like brothers so I liked it that they resembled each other.Brad's mom near the beginning of the movie made a reference to this and I thought it was a nice change having 2 of them being related other then having your typical 4 friends. I thought all the actors were believable and the movie was very well acted.It was such a nice change to see an Australian film.It was a disturbing film but in a different way then wolf creek was.It really got me thinking a lot.It makes you wonder if this scenario does or could happen if you are in limbo.Their souls all ended up back at the creepy beach and only Emily seemed to have figured out what had happened.It was tense watching her convince the other's what had happened to them. I am not fully clear about what the scenes of each of them standing on the beach alone was all about.The beginning was a bit rushed and the scenes with Emily and Zippo were not very clear.Otherwise I loved it and give this movie an 8 out of 10.
