You would think with Lisa Kudrow, John Travolta, Ed O'Neill, and Bill Pullman in the cast you could expect a fun, clever movie. Travolta and Kudrow try very hard, but the story was tired and boring. Lisa looks great and the dancers are decorative, but even skin couldn't save this film. This is just a hideous waste of time.
