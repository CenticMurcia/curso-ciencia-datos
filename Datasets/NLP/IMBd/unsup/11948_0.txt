This was one of the first ever Karate films ive seen and i got it from a video shop about 8 years ago. The film is dubded like most karate films of that time. The plot is good and has a man avenging the death of his family and the other is the son of a genaral and they are both after the same man the notorious "SILVER FOX" hes one of the best fighters around. Both the men have to enter a fighting tournement to get near him and the fights are brilliantly staged plus the two men have to fight the emperors guards who get in the way through the film. At times there are funny parts to the film. In the end the two main leads both like the same girl but she only likes one of them they try to fight each other twice in the film to see which one of them is best but both times they get interupted and then they team up together to take on the mighty "SILVER FOX". This is a good film for karate fans but its a fairly rare film and it would be very hard to get your hands on it.
