CONTAIN SPOILERS<br /><br />"Lord of the Piercing"is so bad,but so bad that I need to write this comment!<br /><br />I was watching the 2002 MTV Movie Awards and this spoof appeared.I've read about it,so I thought it would be funny.But in no way it's funny!<br /><br />The Spider-Man version also featured in MMA was cruel,but you could laugh.This one is 3 times more cruel,and completely unfunny.The writers should be thinking:"Oh,let's parody Lord of the Rings,with the worst kind of comedy and make people laugh".It didn't work with me.<br /><br />I can't believe that some people(including Peter Jackson and Elijah Wood)actually liked it!<br /><br />LOTR:The Fellowship of the Ring didn't deserve this,and Tolkien must be shaking at his tomb.<br /><br />Grade:-1/10
