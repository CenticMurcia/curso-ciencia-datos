Who would guess that a SILENT-era version of a Sigmund Romberg musical chestnut like 'The Student Prince' could be so wonderful? The acting -- especially by the stunningly handsome Ramon Novarro in the title role and the glowing Norma Shearer as his love interest, a humble beer-hall girl -- is uniformly excellent. The settings and costumes are exceptional as well. The overall sepia glow that this film has adds to the sense that the viewer really IS seeing and experiencing "Old Heidelberg". The movie has it all : a little drama, a little humor, a little romance -- it is a confection that anyone who is willing to explore silent films is bound to find enjoyably sweet and memorable. HIGHLY recommended! (The version I saw also had a fantastic 'new' score by Carl Davis that added considerably to the atmosphere while supporting the action.)
