I just was channel surfing and ran across "Daugher of the Mind", which have not seen since I was a young child (I am now almost the big 50), however, much to my dismay the movie was 3/4 over and I only got to see the last 1/2 hour. But this was enough to bring back memories of seeing it as a young girl and how haunting the movie was to me.<br /><br />In now seeing the credits and getting the name of Pamelyn Ferdin I was able to go online (something I was not able to do 36 years ago) and find her web-site with all of this wonderful biography information.<br /><br />I had no idea how many movies and TV shows she had done and I am sure that I must have seen many of them in order to have such fond and vivid memories of her.<br /><br />To Pamelyn, "thanks for the memories" and hopefully this movie will be on again so I can see it from the beginning or better yet, obtain a copy for my collection. Also, I am glad to see that you are not a "casualty of child stars" and that you proved you can be a child star and a successful adult person.<br /><br />Maybe "TVLand" can do a "Where are they now" special on Pamelyn.
