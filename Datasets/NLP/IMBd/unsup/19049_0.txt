Serial Mom is another mainstream film in a way like Polyester (Considering both take place in suburban homes). Unlike the mom in Polyester who becomes an alcoholic, the mom in this film becomes a psychopath. Beverly Sutphin at first seems like the perfect mom. She has a great husband, Eugene, who's an orthodontist. Her son, Chip, is a horror fanatic. Her daughter, Misty, loves boy. Despite her perfect motherly image, Beverly has a dark side. Beverly secretly starts a series on phone harassments and vulgar letter to fellow neighbor Dottie just because she stole her parking space. She soon becomes a murderer after Chip's teacher criticizes about the way she raises Chip. They she does it is by running him over with her car. Soon, 2 nosy detectives try to find evidence that Beverly murderer Chip's teacher. Eventually, Beverly continues murdering people who get on her nerves. She uses fire pokers, scissors, air conditioners, and so on and so forth. Now the cops are prepared to arrest her and after that happens, she will appear in court and manipulate people into declaring her innocent. Despite being a mainstream film by John, Serial Mom shares a lot in common with Female Trouble. Both films have the leading lady committing crimes (Mostly murder), getting famous for it, and a classic courtroom. Another 10 out of 10!
