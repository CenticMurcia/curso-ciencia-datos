"Quiet! I'll have no laughter in the courtroom," says the deadpan judge, but in fact the scenes in the courtroom deliver the only laughs in this movie, because they deliver the only breaths of fresh, honest air in the script.<br /><br />Cary Grant's comedic flair shines as always, even when he's mugging for Garson Kanin (a director who should have stuck to writing). Too bad his character, the only remotely attractive one, is stuck with a lousy screenplay and two loser wives.<br /><br />Nothing against Gail Patrick, who exudes cool intelligence and can deliver a cynical remark like a brunette Eve Arden. Unfortunately, most of her roles are thankless, and none more so than this one. As Wife No. 2, she's pure plot device, manipulated to the needs of the story.<br /><br />But, as usual with her movies, it is Irene Dunne who makes this almost unwatchable, particularly in close-ups, when her ever-visible tongue threatens to flop out of her usually open mouth.<br /><br />If you get stuck watching this, check out the score and the sound editing. Both are aggressively silly, in an attempt to make up for the lack of comedy throughout the film. A futile attempt.
