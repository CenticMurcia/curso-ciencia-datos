This movie is an incredibly hilarious movie, no matter how many times you watch it. It's true that it's profane, violent, and stupid, but in this film, that's what makes it so funny! The timing is just perfect. It's a great movie to watch with friends for the first time, especially for the fact that you will be quoting lines with them randomly for quite a while. I have seen it over 30 times, and I still laugh. This is Adam Sandler at his very best. Great random characters, such as the "Jackass" man, the homeless guy, and very best, Bob Barker! To tell you the truth,"It'll make you laugh until you hyperventilate". There's not only great vocal humor, but the visuals and especially the body language coming from the actors is classic. To me, there is not a better comedy.
