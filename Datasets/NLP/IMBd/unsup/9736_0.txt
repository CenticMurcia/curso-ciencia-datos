A CLIMAX OF BLUE POWER is a strong piece of 70s sleaze that is equal parts crime/drama and trashy porno. A solid entry in the lacking genre of story-driven grindhouse cinema - CLIMAX is one of the several drama/porn films that actually work on more than just an "arousal" level.<br /><br />A disgruntled and scummy security guard illegally moonlights as a real police officer in order to fulfill his sexual desires with random hookers. When our "hero" accidentally witnesses a murder take place and begins fantasizing about the crime-scene, he decides to play private-dick (literally)... <br /><br />A CLIMAX OF BLUE POWER is one of those rare 70s era porn films that actually relies on storyline and a bit of decent acting to carry the film, while still maintaing it's grimy porno atmosphere. A notable piece of drama/porn - CLIMAX works better than most similar genre entries. The porn scenes are pretty hot, while not really focusing on them as a way to validate the film. The bizarro ending is also worth noting in a weird and pretty much unexplained PSYCHO-ish turn of events (but with hardcore sex added in...). A gritty and rough piece of 70s exploit cinema - this one will be of interest to "classic" porn fans, and those that dig a whole lotta sleaze mixed in with their drama films...8.5/10
