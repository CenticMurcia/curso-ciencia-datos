This is a very funny series but please don't confuse it with a history of WWI. David Lloyd George (The British Prime Minister) and Douglas Haig (The General commanding the British Army) hated each other and after the war DLG got his memoirs into print very quickly - this led to the myth that the British Army was led by bungling officers and sacrificed for nothing.<br /><br />This show plays on that myth - In an extremely funny way. Alas - it also helps rob the British Army of its finest victory. <br /><br />Despite that I love this show - they visit so many of the controversial sides of this conflict in what is at times a side achingly funny way. The end is especially poignant.
