Some sisters I couldn't care less about are told about the death of a grandpa they never knew about and are subsequently left a hotel nobody seems to stay at where they get up to shenanigans that are hard to be entertained by before being picked off and murder death killed in fairly unimaginative ways by baddies we neither know nor are too scared by. If that sounds quite bad to you . . . . then it is.<br /><br />This is one of those movies I really despise thanks to it being so shockingly mediocre. Films that are staggeringly inept are at least laughable whereas films that are good enough to entertain, obviously, do just that. This film falls between the two and is just a pretty dull way to spend 90 minutes.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly bad although not even terrible enough to provoke laughter, the "plot twists" are uninteresting and predictable and all of the characters are unlikeable and paper-thin. The only thing lifting this above total non-entity is a bit of decent gore for fans of the red stuff and even that is all over during the first half of the film (the first couple of kills are the best and then it's down hill all the way).<br /><br />Don't bother with this one unless you have absolutely nothing else in your "to watch" pile. You could throw a stone in the middle of your nearest movie store and randomly hit a dozen better, low-budget slasher flicks.<br /><br />See this if you like: Zombie Lake, Lake Of The Dead, Madman.
