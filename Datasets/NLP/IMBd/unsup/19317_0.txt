King of the Lost World starts as a plane crashes in a mysterious jungle, of those aboard Ed Malone (Jeff Denton) & John Roxton (Rhett Giles) take charge. The plane has been broken in half while crash landing & the end with the radio & black box in is somewhere deep in the jungle, a group decide to go look for it & try to radio for help. However they soon discover a jungle full of horrors including giant spiders, giant scorpions, flying dragons, a giant ape & a tribe of primitives...<br /><br />Co-written & directed by Leigh Scott who also plays Dr. Armstrong in the it this is another terrible zero budget Asylum produced sci-fi flick that in this case is a complete rip-off of King Kong. The script by Scott, Carlos De Los Rios & David Michael Latt takes itself very seriously & moves along at a reasonable pace but the character's, dialogue & situations are terrible. This is a poorly thought out mess designed to cost as little as possible & to cash-in on the recent (at the time) King Kong remake. I don't know why what else to say about this, it's just both conceptually & technically awful. If a passenger plane crashes there would rescue planes & search parties there within hours, we do have things such as radars & tracking devices you know. What happens to the other plane crash survivors who stay behind on the beach & are then taken away by the tribe? Do yourself a favour & give this one a miss.<br /><br />Director Scott turns in an average looking film that isn't much fun to watch. Then, of course, there are the special effects which are simply terrible. The big ape at the end looks awful & all the horrible CGI seems really blurred which makes it look worse, the special effects on the original 1933 version of King Kong are better & more convincing than this. There's nothing quite like bad CGI effects to take you out of a film & make it look cheap & nasty. We get some killer vines, a giant spider, several giant scorpions, a huge ape & some flying dragons all of which look pretty childish & unconvincing. There's no gore or violence in it worth mentioning.<br /><br />With a budget less than $1,000,000 this has terrible special effects that are simply embarrassing to watch at times, the live action stuff is competent but forgettable & unimaginative. The acting sucks too, the always watchable Steve Railsback makes a small cameo appearance.<br /><br />King of the Lost Island is a pretty terrible film as is the general opinion for which once I am in full agreement, definitely one to avoid.
