It seems that a lot of classics fans come to this movie as fans of James Cagney. A lot of the more negative comments on IMDb are from those people, as Cagney has a very small role in this film. Of course, director Wellman would make him a star later in 1931 with Public Enemy. The stars of Other Men's Women are Grant Withers and Regis Toomey. They star as two railroad men and best friends. Unfortunately, Withers and Toomey's wife, played by Mary Astor, fall in love when Withers stays with the couple for a while. This film is highly flawed. The two leads are rather bland, and maybe it is just because he would be such a huge star, but Cagney definitely draws your eye whenever he's on screen. Ditto Mary Astor and Joan Blondell. All three of those actors you already know are very strong, while Withers and Toomey are just decent (it doesn't help that the two resemble each other, so it can be easy to mix them up). The story is also kind of weird, and, like a lot of these very short dramas of the 1930s, there are logical jumps and loose threads. However, I would say that Other Men's Women is quite a strong film cinematically. It's exciting, and beautifully shot. There is also an extremely impressive special effects-driven climax which uses models completely seamlessly. It may be a flawed film, but it's an excellent one anyway.
