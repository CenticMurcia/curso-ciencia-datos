I used to subscribe to Toyfare magazine and one of my favorite sections of ANY magazine was "Twisted Toyfare Theatre". I always wished they would do an animated show...Then recently a friend asked if I had seen "Robot Chicken" because it was "right up my ally". What a great surprise!!! Seth Green too!!! Each episode is packed with little skits that is set up like watching T.V. with someone else flipping endlessly through the channels, sometimes sticking to one channel long enough to "get involved", and flipping again. Brilliant! Even the split second skits are hilarious. Definitely designed for adults. I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of The Simpson's, Futurerama, Ren & Stimpy, Southpark, Star Wars, The Smurfs, and SO MANY other shows that Robot Chicken spoofs - It's animated action figures & toys!!! Picture Knight Rider, Dukes of Hazzard, Mario & Wario, Speed Racer & more all racing in The Cannonball Run!!! With Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise doing voice-overs!!! Mario Brothers stumble into Vice City (from Grand Theft Auto) and trade the go-cart for a "Pimped ride"!! By far the best is when Darth Vader calls the Emperor after the Death Star has just been destroyed - "what's an aluminum falcon?!" & "oh! just build another one - who's gonna finance that-You?!!" Words are not enough - you just have to see it!!!
