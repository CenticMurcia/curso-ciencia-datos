After surfing through this site, I came across the reviews for this movie and I just had to see it for myself. It happened to be on this afternoon. And let me tell you...<br /><br />The other folks who have written comments were not joking. This movie is so incredibly bad that words will be hard to find that can describe it. Wish me luck. Here goes!<br /><br />From the very instant the opening credits finish up, you can tell this film had a budget of a few thousand dollars or more. Everything looks cheap and hokey. <br /><br />The next thing we notice is that nearly all of the actors' voices seem dubbed. Why in the heck was this done? Were they all a bunch of foreigners who couldn't speak English that well? Makes you wonder. Anyway, the dialogue you can actually decipher is so bad that it sounds like drunken ad-libbing. I'm sure nobody actually sat down and wrote this entire script. If so, it gives hacks like myself hope that we can actually land work in the movie business.<br /><br />As far as the technical aspects of this film are concerned, let's just say that ANYONE with their own camera could have filmed this. So many mistakes! Night turns to day instantly. We get LONG shots of people doing simple things like walking across a lawn to their horse and giving him a drink of coffee (!). We see people riding up and down escalators and driving down the highway for much longer than we need to see them. All this tells me that they had a weak story that could barely be stretched out for the standard 90 min that films usually last. <br /><br />The plot? Forget it! It is nothing more than a rip-off of Robocop. The film still wants to try and be some kind of a western at the same time!<br /><br />The music? Absolutely putrid! Any ten year old with a little Casio keyboard could have made it. <br /><br />I guess what I'm trying to say is that I should have heeded the warnings of the other IMDB contributors. Still, I had to see if this film was truly as bad as everyone said. After viewing it, I have no choice but to agree.<br /><br />THIS FILM ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!!!!!<br /><br />0 of 10 stars<br /><br />So sayeth the Hound.
