This series was one of the BEST of its time. I was SHOCKED when it did not continue to run in 1981. It was witty. Jeff Goldblum was the 'perfect' actor for the character of a nerdy stock-broker-turned-Mickey-Spillane-wannabe detective, paired up with Ben Vereen who portrayed the role of con-man-extraordinaire that mimicked the roles of a vast array of characters... in order to close their cases. I especially enjoyed listening to Jeff Goldblum's voice (In the background) as he would sit and read the Mickey Spillane book as he sat at his desk. It was 'pure genius' for the producers to include the book-reading episodes into the script. The plots and 'action' were believable and fun-oriented. In other words, it was a CRIME for this series to end so quickly. Now that DVD's of old movies and TV series are available, I have waited... and waited... and WAITED for Ten Speed and Brown Shoe to be released on DVD. I'M STILL WAITING!<br /><br />John Mangum JuSen4Me@EC.RR.Com
