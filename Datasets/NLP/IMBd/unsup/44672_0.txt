I expected this movie to be kind of hackneyed to begin with, but the overall package of "Down to You" was beyond my worst expectations. Budding young starts are thrown in haphazardly as sex, drugs, and alcohol take center stage. The whole film is an insult to my age bracket -- save your money on this one.
