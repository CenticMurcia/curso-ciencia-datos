Saw this one last week. Damn what a disturbing bad movie. Read a couple of comments (i suppose it was here). Shouldn't have done that "better than Shark attack 3, special effects are OK" and more thing like that. Well, let me tell you one thing. The special effects suck big time. Check that half ass piece of shark at the end when it exploded and sank to the bottom.<br /><br />The girl in the mini sub marine is told to wait under water for some serious looking bearded dude to get her because "they can help each other to the surface". Yeah do that! The whole reason she had to wait was because of the fact she was with another mini sub which was attacked by the shark.<br /><br />At one point in the movie one guy is going down with the elevator to get another guy who is in the mini sub, Yeah sure, better not use radio contact because you can better tap on a window (don't know what he was planning to do down there.) I'm really curious whether we will ever see a great shark movie that will come close to Jaws, or number 2 "deep blue sea". Suppose not while sharks are more and more like teddybears when you watch discovery channel.
