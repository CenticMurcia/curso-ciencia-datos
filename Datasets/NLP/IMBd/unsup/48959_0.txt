There probably aren't a lot of people out in imbd land that are bigger Zappa fans than I am (I have ALL of his records for starters), but even so this film just doesn't do it for me. Others who are big fans of this late genius may want to give this one a look for curiosity or nostalgic purposes, but as a cohesive films it leaves a lot to be desired. It'd probably be great to have on if one were to be, say, experimenting with hallucinogenic mind altering substances, but other than that it leaves a lot to be desired. I recall about 10 minutes of entertaining segments in this long production and again, I'm a HUGE Frank Zappa fan. Thankfully there's more suitable footage available for those who want to see what this often underrated musician was really like. Then again, I've always thought Zappa was ahead of his time musically and philosophically, so perhaps this somewhat dated production will be more appreciated in years to come. Like his music, though, there's certainly not many other things out there like this. Sorry, Frank, but I still have to give this one a 2 out of 10. Long live Zappa!
