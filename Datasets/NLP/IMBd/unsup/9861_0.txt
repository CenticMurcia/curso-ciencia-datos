This movie was without a doubt, very predictable. There have been a hundred other movies made with basically a similar plotline. But I still enjoyed it, simply because I enjoy this type of movie. Jessica Lange gave a great performance as the deranged mother in law. It's fun to watch, even though you know how it's probably going to turn out in the end. I think everyone should at least give this movie a chance. It's worth watching.
