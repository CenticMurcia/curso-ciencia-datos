Even the least interesting Disney animated flicks are light years ahead of "Rock-A-Doodle". I cringed in terror during each and every single second of this crapola film.<br /><br />Just when you think the movie couldn't get any worse, there's that atrocious song and dance number at the end. Why did Don Bluth insist on combining live action with animation (the only time it truly worked was in the excellent "Who Framed Roger Rabbit")? And what was the point of involving that little kid in the story to begin with?<br /><br />"Rock-A-Doodle" is probably one of the worst movies in general I've ever had the misfortune of seeing. I'm sure the money wasted on this steaming pile of excrement could have better used to feed several Third World countries.
