This is a beautiful life and love story of a single mother in her 30's, played by Nancy Travis (Three Men And A Baby, Vanishing), who is diagnosed with cancer. When Doctors tell her of her fate, she is faced with making a lifetime worth of memories with her only child, in just a few short months. She takes her daughter to live in a small town so she can spend time bonding with and loving her. When a free spirited, handsome, younger man, beautifully played by Scott Bairstow (Lonesome Dove, Party Of Five), comes into her life, she gets more than she bargained for. Falling in love is not in the rules... fortunately, sometimes rules are meant to be broken.<br /><br />"My Last Love" is a life story about true love and a love story about true life. This movie, to me, showed that if you truly love someone nothing can take it from you. You can find your best friend and soulmate in anyone. Love knows no age. Love knows no illness. If you are fortunate enough to find it, grab onto it and hang on with everything you've got. Don't give it up for anyone. Five minutes of being really loved is worth whatever risks you have to take. True love lasts beyond a lifetime.<br /><br />Superbly written, directed and acted, this tender story is a must-see for anyone who believes in love.<br /><br />
