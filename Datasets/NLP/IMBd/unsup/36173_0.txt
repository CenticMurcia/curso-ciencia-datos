Excuse my English, I'm speak Spanish, but i do my best. I had a big expectation about this film, i spend a lot of time seeking this one, and finally i See, and i have to say ¡¡ this sucks!!... The acting was poor poor, the direction poor too, and the sound awful... literally hear the wind blows again the mics... and the story was stupid, even if was a true story, the gore and violent is very bad, the movie has no strong scenes like the title says... i expected intense violence and stuffs like that, but noooooooo..... Really, if you want to see a bad movie, see this one. Low budget is not equal a low quality, but the director of The great... think different.
