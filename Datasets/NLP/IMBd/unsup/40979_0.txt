This pretty bad slasher film would be completely forgotten today, if it did not feature an early appearance by future super-star Brad Pitt. Now it's merely ALMOST completely forgotten. It actually tries to set itself up as a murder mystery, of sorts, but the script and direction are both too often incompetent. Examples? A math problem that would be fairly easy for a 12-year-old kid is presented by the teacher in the senior class. Later on, that same teacher is trying to solve another math problem, posed to him by the killer, and is apparently too puzzled to notice that the problem has no givens! By the way, the killer must have had a really big death wish to do something so utterly stupid in his final scene. The film also has a slightly fuzzy look that makes it seem older than it is. Jill Schoelen is a likable and agreeable actress, but with films like this it's no wonder her career stalled. (*1/2)
