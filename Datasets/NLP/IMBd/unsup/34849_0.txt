Meet the Stricklands, hard-working proprietors of the world's most labor intensive walnut ranch. There's sweaty Luther who in his spare time cooks up hard cider and sticks coffee cups to his upper lip. There's his wife, Molly, who collects pot holders and can boil a mean pot of water. Next is Melissa, who likes shopping for Carnation ice cream and spooking the town folk with her witchy ways and large forehead. Oh, and then there's lovable Lucinda, who's into doll collecting and dispatching farmers and police officers with pitch forks and meat hooks. One day, while tooling around in his pristine Maverick, rich boy Jody decides to take the road less traveled and ends up with these loons. What's worse, he falls in love with one of them. Luckily, it's not Luther. This is a B movie that gives B movies a bad name. The dialogue is nearly as unspeakable as the horrors offered up in hell, the lighting goes from too bright to pitch and there's absolutely no one to cheer for. It's easy to see why this "film" was such easy fodder for Mike and the 'bots on the Satellite of Love. It lends itself to such biting commentary.
