I thought Ten Inch Hero was a wonderful film! I really enjoyed it! I wasn't sure what to expect because I had never seen an independent film before. It ended up being much better than I thought it was going to be. Even though I am a Jensen Ackles fan, that wasn't the only reason I loved Ten Inch Hero. The plot and storyline were well written and the characters were very interesting. All of the actors did a fantastic job in their roles! The film also had a great message attached to it that anyone can relate to. It wasn't just some superficial movie about a group of friends. I would love to see it come out in the mainstream theaters, I wish it already was so that I could see it again. I am definitely buying this one when it's released on DVD.
