When i saw the cover of this movie i thought it was going to be fun.. Ashton Kutcher,Nicole Sullivan and Bernie Mac..great actors! but my hopes were not met.. Guess who had lots of unoriginal scenes and bad humor.. It was Ashton Kutcher on the worst! it was like he didn't take the comedy job seriously, he was just silly (not in a good way). <br /><br />the movie puts sometimes a smile in your face,but you will never laugh..NEVER! Me and my friends were more interested by a fly,flying in front of the computer. This is a kind of movie you shouldn't buy or rent!<br /><br />i hope that i could help you choose..
