This movie is definitely not for the girls. <br /><br />No hot guys, while there are plenty good looking girls, most of all are the "slutty" type, and there a few scenes in a strip club, so there's lots of female nudity and stripping, which they also added in unappropriate parts of the movie. Not good. <br /><br />And unlike the first movie, this one has no feelings. <br /><br />I didn't find the acting very good, I feel Kirsten Dunst doesn't belong in a film like this, she was whiney and annoying most of the time. The character Alex wasn't a very good actor either, he had nothing that appealed to me. <br /><br />It was hard to understand this film because of so many characters, I had to rewind in a few parts to understand.<br /><br />Overall: 3 out of 10 I didn't enjoy it at all, but maybe you would.
