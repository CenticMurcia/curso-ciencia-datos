Hi! First of all I have to say that I really enjoyed 'Agents secrets'. I wasn't disappointed as many seems to be because I knew what kind of film I was going to see... By this, I would mean that it is a 'Schoendoerffer movie' i.e. a movie that is not focusing on a special mission or on action but rather on people, what implies their job, on their daily life...even if they are spies. It was the same in one of his prior movies 'scenes de crimes'. So, don't expect to be staggered by special effects or by an unexpected end. You're not in 'M.I.1' or in 'The Usual suspects' - even if I also appreciated these movies- , what matters is people, their relations, their perception of their job... It was really a good moment and it does not really matter if at the end everything is not fully explained. It's not the the director's main purpose at all...
