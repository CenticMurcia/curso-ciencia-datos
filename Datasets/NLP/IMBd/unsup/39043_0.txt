I generally think that all films have some merit. A couple of cool scenes, some enjoyable action, no brainer comedy or just a really interesting camera angle. I really did fail to find anything I liked in this film.<br /><br />I found the acting very unbelievable. Lines were spoken without feeling and realism. The story line was basic, and nothing left to the imagination.<br /><br />From the sporting side it looked quite poor too. I hate it in Football (soccer to the statesiders) films/programmes when one player gets the ball and runs past everyone to score... all the time. So I am sure it does not happen in Lacrosse.<br /><br />I guess there is the mildest interest in what happens at the end of the film, though your expecting everything to work out alright. Apart from this I found nothing particularly good in this film. I was cringing all the way through. That was actually quite hard to say as people must have put some hard work into the film.
