Dennis Hopper, who I think is great, should stick to acting, and as for Linda Manz, justifiably forgotten, could they not find anyone who could act? The dialog is excruciating, and the bleakness of their lives is not original enough to get past it. Typical white trash lives, not compellingly told. Really long, horrible songs by Neil Young accompany equally long, boring scenes. The junkie mom angle could have been played up, as it was it was gratuitous to make her a junkie slut, a slut would have been enough. The dynamite should have been used a hour earlier.
