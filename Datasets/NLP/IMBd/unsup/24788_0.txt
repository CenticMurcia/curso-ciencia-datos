Julie Delpy makes an impressive first work as a director in 2 Days in Paris,a great movie.The best thing about this movie is,no doubt,the screenplay because it makes very intelligent commentaries about the modern relationships and it also has brilliant dialogs.I would say this movie is a twist between Annie Hall and Before Sunset,because it has the intelligent humor of the first one and the brilliant dialogs from the second one.Delpy makes a pretty good performance but Adam Goldberg really surprised me.This actor made a perfect performance and he does not seem to be acting at all and I think that's the greatest achievement of any actor.The only fail I found on this movie is that some scenes are a little bit pretentious.2 Days in Paris is a brilliant movie I truly enjoyed.I totally recommend it.
