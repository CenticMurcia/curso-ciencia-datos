Starring Ginger Rogers. - "It Had to be You" opens with Victoria Stafford (Rogers) ditching numerous grooms at the altar. (and don't you just LOVE that veil and halo getup when she ALMOST marries Atherton Huntley??) Mom is played by silly but knowledgeable Spring Buyington. (It HAD to be either her or Billie Burke.) The groom's dad suggests that Victoria go off and decide whether she is really ready to be married to his son. Of course, there is a dream sequence which starts to get downright silly, and that takes the film in a weird direction, involving psychological issues. Then more dreams, involving long hallways, a Native American, (the dashing Cornel Wilde) swimming. Misunderstandings. Got a little weird for me, but I guess if you don't look too closely, you can just go along for the ride. This was one of Ginger's comedies, like Stage Door, Monkey Business. The 2000 film version seems to be kind of a remake of this film, but has a different plot direction.
