This is one of the most underrated, brilliant films of all time. If you've never seen it, do: but see it at a cinema if you can or on a good home theatre system, with a big screen and great sound. Shut down the lights, take the phone off the hook, give it the respect it deserves... and go on a journey.<br /><br />I first saw it in 70mm in a cinema re-release in 1995, and still remember that night as one of the most transcendental cinema experiences of my life. I hadn't even wanted to see it - my boyfriend dragged me along. I thought it was a boys + their toys movie, the subject matter didn't interest me at all. Yet I came out of the cinema speechless, barely able to walk. <br /><br />I felt like I'd just orbited the earth too, so closely did I identify with what was happening on screen. Wolfe's book, Kaufman's screenplay and direction, Caleb's cinematography, Bill Conti's music, the sfx, the design... all are at the top level of their craft. And every one of the actors... from Sam Shepherd through to the nurse... is beyond superb. If anyone who worked on this film is reading this, even if you made the tea, know that you helped create something incredible.<br /><br />The movie beautifully portrays and celebrates dual themes: technical endeavour vs the mystery of the natural universe, external recognition vs inner 'right stuff'. <br /><br />Like Chuck Yaeger, this film never achieved due recognition in its day, but will continue to inspire through time.
