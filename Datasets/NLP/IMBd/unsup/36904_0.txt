I watched through 8 of the 10 episodes and couldn't handle anymore. All of the episodes were boring, and I think even if I appreciate The Ten Commandments, I'd still hate The Decalogue.<br /><br />Each episode pertains to one of the ten commandments. Well, that's nice and all except that the editing and direction of each episode was slow and boring. I wasn't sentimental to any of the characters, and the guy who keeps appearing in every episode was utterly pointless. I'm pretty sure he is supposed to represent something, but I don't even care at this point.<br /><br />It'd be great if there was some sort of depth in the script, but there weren't any. Overall, a major disappointment. Don't bother watching this unless you want to be bored out of your mind.
