This television movie about an underground Princeton porn club had potential. It was better than I thought it would be. Yes, it didn't go beyond the Animal House level of complexity, but it actually tried to deal with the material using a small measure of intelligence.<br /><br />Not enough though. I was disappointed that every time the movie introduced an interesting plot thread which would have made the movie about more than just "liberated students vs. stifling university dean" it was dropped by the next commercial because serious thought would have interfered with the party atmosphere the movie tried to foster.
