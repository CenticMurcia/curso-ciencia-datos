Once again, no listing of the music. Does anyone know what was the opening music, in the first minute or so? I'm sure I have heard it in another movie.<br /><br />As for the film itself, the general script/storyline is so well known, certainly to anyone living in the UK, that the interest could only be sustained in obscure details -eg what do the royal apartments look like; and does HRH always wear a tie at home. The only snippets that I found of interest concerned details of princess Anne's personal life. Her character, as depicted, did not correspond to the popular image of her. I wonder, was is fact or fiction?.<br /><br />As for the family, we saw something of Anne, of Uncle Dickie and a brother or two -and that was about it (oh, and a note delivered from Papa).<br /><br />I am thinking of instituting communications by notes in our household, with my sons. But i would have to rely on the cat to deliver them.<br /><br />And the music---if anyone knows, please help....
