This game is both a treat for fans of ICO and those who are new to these kinds of games. Don't expect to fight armies, or to even have to defeat a legion of regular enemies (if you've played ICO, you might be expecting to fight off the shadows), but rather a series of Colossi; a being of great power that takes tact to destroy, not random hacking and slashing.<br /><br />At the beginning of the game, Wander brings a dead girl to a vast, but very much deserted, land and lays her body on an altar. A being named Dormin tells Wander that with the sword he carries, if he can defeat the sixteen Colossi that roam the land, he will be able to bring Mono back to life. He does, though, warn you that the price you pay will be very high, and I will tell you that it is high. However, Wander says that he doesn't care, thus begins your journey to do nothing other than seek out and destroy the Colossi. It sounds simple, but it really isn't. This game will tug at your heartstrings, and the vast, lonely, but beautiful land will leave you awestruck.<br /><br />The graphics for this game are stunning. In all honesty, I don't think even the PS3 could do much to better this game in terms of graphics! I highly recommend this game. It's simply a masterpiece, and anyone who plays it will feel the same.
