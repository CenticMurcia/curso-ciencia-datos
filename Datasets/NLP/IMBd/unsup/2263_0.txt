My friends and I were debating about what movie to go see the other night. I suggested a foreign art film because I was getting sick of all the Hollywood story lines that were starting to look alike. Anyway, we saw a film that was moving, wild, unpredictable, emotional, seductive, and dramatic. I fell in love with the characters so much I didn't know what to do. You are definitely moved and excited. Yes, you get excited...admit it. I have never seen such an explicit film that was so raw, yet romantic and pure. It was so forbidden but adventurous. I have seen a lot of foreign film that have raw sex, but this one...took the show. The colors in the film are also unique in that I'm sure they were chosen so that your eyes would not wear out because of so much life you see.<br /><br />Incredible film from Spain. I'm going to marry my next woman from that beautiful country.
