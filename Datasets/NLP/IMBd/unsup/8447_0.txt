This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. The story line is great for any audience: kids just learning the story or adults who never wanted to grow up. Spielberg's imagination and his way of sticking close by the original story makes this film a delight to see if you ever wanted to be a lost boy in never land. Every time I watch this film I notice another superb detail and use of irony. The story ties together beautifully and is easily one of my very favorites. It makes you want a never never land of your own.
