A wonderful tale of an obsessive, compulsive writer, who's life is forever changed by three things, a waitress, a gay artist, and a little dog.<br /><br />Absolutely fantastic! "As Good As It Gets" is one of the finest films I've ever seen. From the excellent acting, to the superb directing, "AGAIG" is a truly unforgettable film. One of those rare films that only come out once in a blue moon. <br /><br />The acting is nothing short of amazing! Jack Nicholson who plays Melvin, deserved the Oscar for his role. As did Helen Hunt as Carol the Waitress. And the directing is wonderfully done by James L. Brooks, (Fans of The Simpsons, may recognize that name, as he's the Executive Producer.) Not to mention the fabulous writing also done by Brooks!<br /><br />"As Good As It Gets" is a must see! It's a shame that it was only nominated for Best Picture in 1997, it lost out to some movie about a sinking ship, directed by the guy who made "Terminator 2".<br /><br />The title says it all in this rare and wonderful film; As Good As It Gets!<br /><br />***** Out of Five Stars (Outstanding!)
