Bollywood sucks the big one. It's like a malfunctioning machine that keeps spitting out these ridiculous musical romantic comedies, that always end the same way, have generally the same plot, same characters, and same music. They're not original, or brilliant in anyway whatsoever. It's like they don't realize it's bad and they keep wasting money on the same crap. Of course it does appeal to Indians, because these are their films, but I mean can't you at least come up with something better. I mean Bollywood comes out with more movies than Hollywood every year, and they seem to only generally get attention in India, and even in India, International films seem to be more popular than their own (judging by their box office results)I am not a racist in any way whatsoever, in fact I have at least 7 friends who were born in India and came to America during their childhood. I am just a harsh critic, and I certainly hope some writer, or producer finds this and realizes that a change is in need, and not all films have to be musical comedies where a girl and guy serenade each other throughout the film. THERE IS OTHER MATERIAL OUT THERE AND India IS A VERY INSPIRATIONAL COUNTRY!
