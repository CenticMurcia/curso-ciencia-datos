First, a word of caution. As an American, I am not familiar with Norman Wisdom. I know that he's a bit of a British institution and he was beloved behind the old Iron Curtain, but his movies and television programs were not popular here in the States--in fact, he's almost completely unknown. Because of this, I don't have the sentimental attachment to him or his work. What went over well years ago does not necessarily translate well to today--at least if you aren't already a fan. I just saw TROUBLE IN STORE and didn't particularly like it. However, I am a glutton for punishment so I decided to try his films one more time.<br /><br />However, before the film began, I read through the reviews on IMDb. Unlike the universally positive ones for TROUBLE IN STORE, the reviews for JUST MY LUCK seemed strangely divergent. Either they loved the film or they disliked it strongly--with not much opinion in between. That's pretty interesting but also didn't help me decide whether or not to watch the film.<br /><br />Well, my initial instincts were unfortunately correct. I didn't particularly like the film, as JUST MY LUCK seemed an awful lot like a Jerry Lewis film--with broad humor and comic bits that were overdone--with every last bit of comedy squeezed dry from the skits. For example, the movie theater scene is just dreadful--going so far overboard with its timing and pace.<br /><br />My advice is that if you are British or Albanian or Russian, by all means see and enjoy this film. Otherwise, it might just be tough to take for more than about 30 minutes. And, no, this is NOT like Mr. Bean in any way, despite another review to the contrary. Mr. Bean is funny (especially the original TV show).
