This film is about same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, but it's really about everyone's rights and how government is supposed to protect, not deny, citizens' rights. Most people outside of Massachusetts (and probably a good number inside as well) don't have any idea how this whole issue of same-sex marriage came about in the first place, so this film does a great job of showing the time-line of events, and how the courts play a role, and the legislatures play a role. It was really interesting to watch the legislators explain why they were voting either "for" or "against", but even more interesting to see the whole process of how ordinary people can make a difference, working with the legislators, or opposing them. I learned a great deal from the film and I hope to see the day when the other 49 states will stop denying gay people the right to marry. "Civil union" instead of marriage is like the old segregationist policy "Separate but equal", which the late Thurgood Marshall argued, if it's separate, it's not equal. Likewise, if it's called "civil union", it's not "marriage". And that's wrong.
