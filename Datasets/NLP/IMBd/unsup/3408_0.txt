While not exactly a brilliant masterpiece, this movie is solid, steady entertainment. The basic elements of a Robin Hood setting are there, but with a "daughter of Robin Hood" -approach to give a little variation to the theme. <br /><br />Even though it's a "new" plot, they've kept a lot of familiar Robin Hood -themes in the film, including an archery contest and the same old villains - what would a Robin Hood -story be without Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham, after all? And just like her father, Gwyn steals from the rich and gives to the poor, and desires justice and fairness to the people. All the classical elements are there, but with a little "girl power" in the mix. <br /><br />There's also a rather nice father-daughter dynamic going on, with Robin trying to shelter his daughter from the dangerous life he lives. Gwyn, on the other hand, won't have any of that nonsense, and is more than willing to prove that she's "just as good as a son". The movie doesn't really explore medieval gender roles all that deeply, though - Gwyn dressing as a man is made slightly fun of, but there's no shock nor any disapproval of what might have even be considered sinful back then. The clothes may be medieval, but the attitudes are rather modern, and in that sense this is a rather typical adventure film, that doesn't let historical accuracy get in the way of a good story. <br /><br />Keira Knightley does a delightfully energetic performance as the tomboyish and almost recklessly fearless Gwyn, and adds a lot to the freshness of the film. If you intend to watch this film because you're a fan of Keira Knightley, I doubt you'll be disappointed. The actors in general are giving solid, although maybe not the most memorable performances. <br /><br />If you're looking for an entertaining, sort of harmless "feelgood" adventure movie, and are a fan of medieval type of settings, this is the movie for you.
