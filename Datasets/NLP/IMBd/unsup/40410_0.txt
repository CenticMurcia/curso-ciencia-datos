I was really looking forward to seeing this when I 1st heard it was on TV. I've become quite a fan of Rachel McAdams recently, and I quite like Anna Faris's films also.<br /><br />The film is about a high school girl who has it all, and a down and out criminal in his mid 30s. Somehow they switch bodies and we see the consequences unfold.<br /><br />The film itself was pretty awful. The script wasn't funny and neither were the actors. There were major points glossed over and the characters actions were completely unrealistic, even for a comedy of this type. It was bizarre how they almost completely ignored one of the two affected characters for much of the film, such a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />The dilemma I have is I am unable to give it less than 4/10. Despite how bad it was, at no point did I want to switch off or even get bored with the film.
