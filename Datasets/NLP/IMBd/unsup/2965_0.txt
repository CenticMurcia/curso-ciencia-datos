The reviewer who labeled this "The WORST movie of all time" must not have seen many movies. Far worse films top the box office on an average weekend. Some people just can't handle low budget movies. Some can't handle Horror Comedies. So if you're a stickler for a multi-million dollar budget and a film that takes itself too seriously, you may well want to avoid Hide and Creep. On the other hand, if you're like most genre fans and enjoy the occasional humor with your Horror, you should get a kick out of this film. If you like films along the lines of Bad Taste, Evil Dead 2, Evil Aliens and Slither then you'll probably understand this movie.<br /><br />Hide and Creep is both a parody and an homage to Romero and Raimi and Jackson. It's chock full of in jokes and not so subtle references that only a true movie geek can fully appreciate. Lots of bad makeup and iffy effects that some movies would expect the audience to believe as genuine. That's part of the gag. The zombies aren't meant to look 'real'. The gore is meant to induce more laughs than scares. Again, don't take the film too seriously. It's not a serious film. It's a comedy. Not a broad, slapstick parody in the Scary Movie vein but a parody just the same. Better than Shaun of the Dead? No but I laughed more at Hide and Creep than I did Shaun or even Slither for that matter.<br /><br />While small on budget, Hide and Creep is huge on heart. Real Horror fans should appreciate such love for the genre and the effort put forth by young filmmakers with no studio backing.
