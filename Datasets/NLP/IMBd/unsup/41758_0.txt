Adding more Leonard Maltin movie grading: It has already been done before! As close by as in 1986 to be exact  and then much better due to those who remember. <br /><br />It should of course be a legal non-profit entity protecting these classics from overexploitation  as the one representing Swedish now diseased Astrid Lindgren (of Pippi Longstocking fame) rejecting all adaptations she wouldn't have liked. Else I can only agree with earlier downbeats by adding a few of my own. Except the MGM musical-style village in full summer bloom (Christie's novel was set in dark winter and in 1930 rather than 1950) not only is the sugar-coated McEwan a miss Marple miscast (and why is everyone treating this snooping old hag as a royalty?), but even worse is the misuse of the stately Janet McTeer as the sinister murderess. It must be people who simply hate tall blonds (she is 6"1') that got her into this! (At least she would sue someone for the terrible lipstick makeup smeared in her face.) And why is her lover-accomplish, "artist painter" Flemyng, sporting a Hollywood nineteen-century van Gogh-look?
