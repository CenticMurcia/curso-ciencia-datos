This movie is such a deception. I've been watching some random Manuelde Oliveira movies to understand how he got so renown. Maybe I should go check just the ones that got the best awards. This is the worst I've seen from him. What a waste of time. He could well have condensed all the story into less than an hour and spare us our time. I don't like fast action movies. A movie can be slow and have much more intensity and thoughtfulness. This one however is just boring ideas from boring people. And Pedro Abrunhosa, who happens to be a famous singer from my city should stick to his music career so we don't have to put up with such bad acting and can choose not to listen to his songs.
