It is clear that most viewers will be extremely disturbed by the pace of the film... <br /><br />Describing two plots (one in antiquity, one now) and using the same actors, and a series of flashbacks to get his point across, Claude Lelouch uses his traditional style in a confusing manner which will make the film beyond the understanding of many.<br /><br />3h20 minutes later, the mystery is solved, fully, and it is plain that he was in control all the time... not like other directors who can't make a clean film with a linear time line.<br /><br />From the gorgeous Marie-Sophie L., Beatrice Dalle, Vincent Lindon, the cast, although familiar faces in Lelouch's films, all show their talent. Even late Paul Preboist, usually too strong in his approach, delivers a beautiful performance.<br /><br />Music is in perfect harmony with the images, inclusing Brel, gypsy music, bullfight themes perfectly and flawlessly.<br /><br />If you only heard about Lelouch but never saw any of his films, "Ladies and Gentlemen" would be a better first film than this one as this one is possibly very confusing... but a masterpiece nonetheless.
