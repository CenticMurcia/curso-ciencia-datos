This move is quite fun. No award winner but really enjoyable. Kids will love this film but I think most adults will too. Sean Hayes as the evil cat was excellent and quite funny. Yes it was a little hokey but hey, I wasn't expecting anything different. Jeffrey Goldblum's performance left a little to be desired but considering the role, it was allright.<br /><br />Overall I was quite pleased with all the animal characters and laughed quite a bit throughout the film. I definitely recommend this film but try to see it on a matinee.
