Life is short. You only have so much time on this earth. So don't waste 90 minutes of your precious life, watching this HORRIBLE film.<br /><br />I don't know where to start. The non-stop screaming and ranting. The fact that every character is supposed to be different, yet they're all screaming the same S*** "I hate my parents! I hate you!"<br /><br />What is this film trying to say?<br /><br />I wanted to see this for one reason. Charlie Talbert from the movie Angus. I think he's a great actor, and he gives a decent performance, given what he's got to work with. Still not even close to his performance in Angus, still it's interesting to see him older.<br /><br />Elizabeth Huett, the little girl who believe she can fly, was good as well. She stood out among the surrounding S***. But then you have to ask "What is a 9 year old girl doing locked in a cell with a bunch of 18 year old crackheads?"<br /><br />I bought this for 1.99 at Hollywood Video. Needless to say, it will never enter my VCR again.
