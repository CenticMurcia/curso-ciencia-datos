Omg! I love the show Popular!! I've probably watched the whole series over 10 times and I still watch t every night! I think I missed a few episodes though, like the 2nd last one. I'm so mad that it ended. I have so many questions. I've read the "3rd season outline" but t doesn't answer anything. I wish they would bring t back! The story was awesome and so were the characters! Even if they started the whole thing over with a bit of the same story and different actors (same characters) I wouldn't really mind, as long as their good! I wish we could make a petition to bring it back 'cause it was the best teen show I've ever seen!
