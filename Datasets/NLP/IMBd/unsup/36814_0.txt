What will Hollywood scenario writers think up next? As an historian I am appalled about this story. What will they put foreward as actual fact. Now you could argue, they never said... but anyhow they used the victim's names and murder locations. This can't be serious. What a missed chance. The actual Ripper story drips with drama, mystery, enigma, colourful individuals, should I go on? No, but some third rate, coca-cola drinking scenario writer thought the American public would be better off with some fifteenth rate love story soap. It could even be oscar material. Let me tell him or they, thanks to this 'penny-novel' approach, every well made, well acted and sometimes brilliant visual approach was destroyed thoroughly for me. Victorian England was something else. One piece of advice: check your sources well, if you used sources other than your bank account. A good advice: don't be confronted with European historians or you will end up like... To conclude: Jack the Ripper doesn't translate to Disneyworld. Real people died in 1888 and the British Royal family had nothing to do with it.
