"Easy" is totally one of the best movies of 2003, if I am not mistaken, was the release date. The depiction of relationships, friendships, and actions of the human heart and condition are realistic, unflinching and uncompromising. Each scene that involves the "Jerk Magnet" Jamie, (Marguerite Moreau) and her two men, (Naveen Andrews, the hot Persian from "Lost" on ABC, and aka "Kip" in "The English Patient", Juliette Binoche's hot Indian stud); and Bryan F.O'Bryne as the lovable talk show host are all equally heartbreaking, warm, and humorous, ultimately human. The love scenes are very realistic, and uncomfortable to watch, truly making the viewer forced into seeing that sex and intimate acts in the bedroom are truly personal and uncompromising, unlike the mundane and choreographed love scenes we see in films like "Basic Instinct", "Color of Night" or "Body Heat". We see sex as it truly is, imperfect, but at the same time an emotional and physical need that everyone craves. Don't miss seeing a comedy-drama that is truly realistic.
