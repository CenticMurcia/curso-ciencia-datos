I was looking forward to this, being a big fan of stop motion animation. Man, what were they thinking? Wasting all that gorgeous animation on such awful writing?! That was the lamest attempt at comedy I've seen in a long time. The character with the most lines had the most irritating voice imaginable, and blathered on in a near scream throughout the entire episode. It was like fingernails across a blackboard, it was so difficult not to get up and change the channel (okay I admit, I didn't make it through the whole episode. After 20 minutes I just couldn't take it any longer!) And the gay character, who is constantly on fire (get it? 'flaming'? get it? don't feel bad, i didn't laugh either.) is such a homophobic stereotype, I'm surprised the CBC let it slide. It feels like they just thought, 'hey let's throw some kooky characters together and that will be enough: this one will be the smart one, this one will be the nihilist, this one's gay, etc.....' The end effect was soulless and irritating.<br /><br />The show looks gorgeous, the animators are talented and must have worked their butts off, so I hope they get some better scripts. They deserve it.
