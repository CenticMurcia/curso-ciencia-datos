It is arguably the most boring film I've ever seen in my life. Boring and pretentious. European cinema at its worst: no plot, no nothing. I wonder how the director started filming having such an empty script. The stilted monologue of the Portuguese woman who explains things to her daughter makes you feel uncomfortable, simply because you know most of the things, and don't really want to know the rest. The whole first part of the film sounds like a bad documentary from an educational channel: we could have read a guide-book, instead. If you want to watch a good film with an educational background, find a copy of Sophie's World: this is a great film. In the second half, Catherine Deneuve, Irene Papas and Stefania Sandrelly excel in a small talk, and so does John Malkovitch; they wouldn't stop for ages. You begin to anticipate some kind of deus ex machina, and here it duly comes in the form of a bomb. The Talking Picture isn't even bad, it is awful. Avoid!
