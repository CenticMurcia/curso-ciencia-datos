this movie is terrible. i loved the first 2 urban legends, i don't even understand how this movie got added to the urban legend series. the killings in this one are supernatural, and only loosely follow real urban legends.<br /><br />The acting is awful. the script makes no sense. Gaping plot holes glare at you everywhere. the make up and special effects are terrible (i laughed at every dead body out loud). The pace of the film and the camera angles make no sense. The only slightly decent part of this film is the makeup done on Mary Banner herself when she's attacking people.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor, NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER rent this movie. i don't care for what reason, even if you are bored stuck at home for 8 hours alone and this is the only movie you have, DO NOT WATCH IT. i feel like i got used by watching this. i want 2 hours back.
