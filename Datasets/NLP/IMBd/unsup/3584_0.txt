Narrated by 'Oggi' (a boy who does not exist and may or may not ever come into existence) this sad, philosophical, hilarious film recounts, disjointedly, the almost random conjunction of events that lead (or don't lead) to Oggi's coming into the world. Lightning strikes multiple times; people keep bragging about the quality of their mobile phones; a farmer and his wife aboard a tractor burst into a lively lip-sync of 'I Will Survive'; good Samaritans keep stealing things; a doctor tries to end his life; cops simply can't get a break...this movie is full of seemingly random events that somehow crazily knit together to bring us to the end that is the beginning (possibly).<br /><br />This movie is suffused with the particular brand of bitter humor that seems to abound in Eastern Europe. It is not for all tastes, certainly. If you are looking for something different, something that will make you think while you laugh and think about why you are laughing, this movie is worth taking a look at.
