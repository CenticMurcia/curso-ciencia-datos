"Time Walker" starts out iffy, gets worse, then when it just starts to get interesting...IT'S OVER!<br /><br />Sorry if I sound a little hard on this one, but have you seen this movie? You can probably figure out what's going on in this one LOOOOONNNG before any of the characters do, but once they catch up, there's nothing left to do. Just watch in desperation as the words "To Be Continued..." come up and the end credits begin.<br /><br />This is bad beyond belief, even Ben Murphy can't save it (and he's usually pretty reliable, or at least WAS). And with window dressing like Shari Belafonte and Greta Blackburn along for the ride, the drool factor is there guys, but to what end?<br /><br />It all makes you wish you had a screenplay-writing program on your computer so you could just write a sequel, get a couple of dollars and make the sequel yourself! How long has it been since the original? And how much longer will it be before the sequel?<br /><br />Look at me, I'm begging for a sequel. I'm broken.<br /><br />Thanks a lot, "Time Walker".<br /><br />No stars. Don't watch it, keep your self-respect.
