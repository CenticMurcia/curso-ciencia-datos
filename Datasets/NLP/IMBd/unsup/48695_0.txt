I've seen a lot of bad animation and this is the worst theatrically released animation I've ever seen.<br /><br />It's just hitting the pay-per-view scene in Canada and I beg you, don't rent this one. Obviously I fell prey to its "something to rent for the kids on a snowy night" marketing strategy.<br /><br />Animation: zero Sound quality all over the map: zero Dialogue (are you kidding me): zero Poster (a well done rip-off of the Finding Nemo design): 1 out of 10<br /><br />I only log into IMDb to comment maybe three times a year and this is my first of 2008. It's that important that this film dies a quick death.
