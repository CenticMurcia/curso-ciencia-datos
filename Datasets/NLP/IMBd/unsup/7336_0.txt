"Orient Express" is a very good Romanian version of the classic movie "Il Gattorpardo" ("The Leopard" - en.). Unfortunately, like other Romanian movies, it's not a universal movie, it's a Romanian movie - difficult to understand for other culture. Of course, there is a difference between Nicolaescu and Burt Lancaster, but as director Sergiu Nicolaescu did a great movie. A bad element is that some romantic moments can be remarked as a little bit artificial, but we must not forget the environment, the circumstances of those years (between first and second word war)with a snobbery society. I also appreciated very much the music.<br /><br />For me it's a "must see movie".
