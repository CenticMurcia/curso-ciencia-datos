Wow - I really hope they publish all the seasons of Comedy Inc on DVD sometime in the future because I would really like to collect this classic comedy series.<br /><br />To all those that reported negative comments about this series - either most of the humour was over their head, or perhaps they are President Bush supporters because I really don't see how you cannot find this series extremely funny unless you do NOT have a sense of humour (quite possible with Bush supporters!) Anyway check it out and make up your own mind... great comedy in the tradition of Kids in the Hall and other great Canadian ensemble comedy series...
