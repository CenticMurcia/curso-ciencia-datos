I know what people are thinking, another documentary based on conspiracy theories, but just for one minute ask yourselves, why are there so many of these films (documentaries) barking up the same tree?, maybe, just maybe there's some fact in what is being told. Also remember most if not all of these films are made by Americans not by outsiders and as a result of the attacks on the Twin Towers 100,000 Iraqis' have perished, and now in Britain the US and majority of the world the war is being called illegal but we cry for the 179 soldiers (UK) that have died out there fighting for their country but not for one minute do we realise the chaos and death we have caused. <br /><br />Watch it with an open mind and question it but if you have already come to a conclusion that this film is a farce then avoid it and God help you.
