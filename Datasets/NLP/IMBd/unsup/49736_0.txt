"Whisper" began on an interesting note, but began to lose it's "spark" about halfway through when it hit me like a ton of bricks that it was simply a compilation of purloined concepts from numerous other horror films - namely "The Omen". An ex-con and his girlfriend join up with a pair of criminals to kidnap a lawyer's 8 year-old son and hold him for ransom. They take the kid to some empty campgrounds where they plan to wait out their crime. The kid, however, unleashes some kind of telepathic power on them, playing mind-games and causing "accidents". Soon, his captors become the captive since his evil and limitless abilities hold no bounds... This movie contains a familiar and tediously subdued plot with the overly sensitive bad guys, the articulate kid with mind-powers, and a completely predictable "twist" ending. There's more plot holes than there are fish in the sea, the characters are all irritating, especially the kid, and there is not an original FRAME in the entire film. I detected hints of "The Shining" (snowy area and even a man-chases-boy-with-axe scenario) and, as mentioned, "The Omen" - with a scene even stolen straight from "The Omen 2" involving a frozen lake. Avoid "Whisper" at all costs...
