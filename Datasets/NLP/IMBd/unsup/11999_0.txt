As somebody else stated so well, this is a complete waste of time and money. B-movies can be very entertaining indeed but there is nothing here that appeals to me. Over-exposure of breasts, depicting drug use in a way that is far from reality and poor acting - none of those mentioned appeals to me, sorry. If it appeals to you perhaps this flick is for you. Was there even a plot? I cannot remember myself noticing it if there ever was one. I consider this one to be a complete failure as regards making a college flick with goals set on appealing to young people.<br /><br />2/10 - my advice is stay away from this one!
