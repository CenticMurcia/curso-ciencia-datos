I could not wait for this film to be over. The film did not give you a reason to want to keep watching it. I don't understand what the director was trying to accomplish with this movie. What a waste of money. The movie was really predictable. The acting was not bad. The objective is clear, but the director failed at making the journey interesting and there was not enough rooting interest where you were eager to keep watching. It is a shame that African American actors have to be reduced to having to make such poor quality films. It is better to pass on these types of films, and wait or develop projects that are entertaining and meaningful.
