Even if it is the last movie in the video store and the vendor offers it to you free, do not waste your time. Between catching up on my sleep and counting 'z's, I painfully watched 4 self loathing women in an office space taking full advantage of whatever thinking that it will improve sometime, even if all we do is watch the clock. Terrible waste of time. You could strap me to a chair, perform a root canal without freezing and blast Kenny G... instead of torturing me to watch this awful movie again. Videostore owners... do not put a satisfaction guarantee on it, my wife took the film back to Blockbuster and demanded a credit!
