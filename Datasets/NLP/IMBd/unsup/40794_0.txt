As everyone here has already said, the casting was quite terrible and Holmes and Watson's symbolic friendship was condemned to hell in this 'adaptation', but it had some interesting elements. <br /><br />This may be a bit of a SPOILER!!!!! but I liked the confrontation at the end where Watson went on somewhat of a rampage. I also like that he got shot, which did add a bit of... something-- some kind of emotional tension between the two supposed friends. Speaking of, it did introduce the interesting idea of 'what if Watson did hate Holmes?' but if that's the case, then why are we here?<br /><br />Anyway, the movie seemed to try patch things up between the two in the final scene where Holmes offers a nice evening to Watson, in which I forgot the response, but it's there. (Shows how impressive it was, huh?)<br /><br />Point is, if you wanna see a good adaptation of the Baskerville story, along with proper casts, watch the Russian one with Livanov and Solomin. Best, most accurate, in my honest opinion.
