!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!<br /><br />A man shoots the US president with a dart containing an infectious agent . What a stupid premise for a film . If someone wanted the president dead why didn`t they shoot him with one of those old fashioned bullets made out of lead ? And just how easy would it be to shoot the president ? I know it`s been done in real life but you`d think the security people would have noticed the muzzle of a gun poking out of a window 30 yards away . In fact wouldn`t they have checked the buildings for snipers beforehand ?<br /><br />From the start I was convinced the bad guys were going to be right wing militia types but in a shock twist it turns out the villains are an IRA man and an American woman and for once it`s not the Irishman who`s the dumb one. Boy is this woman stupid , if she was good looking she`d be a bimbo . In fact it`s impossible to take seriously the whole idea that an idiot like this would be able to engineer such a virus , especially when the script points out that not even the defence department has the resources to create such a virus .<br /><br />But it gets worse ( No small feat ) when it`s revealed that ugly American woman has got an antidote to the virus ( Like I said it`s no small feat the way this film degenerates ) so Irishman phones the president to tell him if he gets $100 million the president gets the antidote . But the president turns down the offer because " The United States doesn`t negoiate with terrorists " Now let`s think about this , the president has been told his organs will slowly dissolve due to the virus and when offered something to stop this happening he turns it down on principle ! You do get the feeling this American president isn`t based on Dubya , or Clinton , or any American president , or any politician ever . It`s also difficult not to notice that in real life leaders and former leaders of the IRA , Irgun , Stern gang , EOKA , PLO , UVF and ANC have all shaken hands with the American president . Oh and don`t think that because the Irishman and Ms ugly bimbo want one hundred million big ones the president will suddenly decide they`re blackmailers and not terrorists and give them what they thereby saving his principals . No sir this is the president of the United States after all , he`d rather dissolve than give in . Luckily the villains die and the president is saved . <br /><br />Sure you still want to see it ?
