This is a bad film on almost all counts. First, the theatrical trappings are obvious, with long, tedious, dialog scenes of little import, and even less wit or charm. The acting is also unforgivably poor, given the talent involved. Ginger Rogers is totally out of place and completely unconvincing. Never a great actress, she doesn't even try here. The usually reliable Van Heflin is equally unconvincing, though certainly better than Rogers. Raft is also totally unbelievable and totally out of place. The supporting cast are a thorough disappointment. Nunally Johnson wrote some excellent scripts in his day, but this is not one of them. And he should never have been allowed to direct his own scripts. The worst aspect of this so-called 'mystery' is that the conclusion is obvious from the beginning, so there are no surprises here.
