With out ruining all the films twists and turns (I recommend reading as few reviews as possible before seeing the film), this is a great little thriller. Very stylish cinematography and good characters. The twists (there are only a few, so don't let them be ruined by careless reviewers!) were unpredictable, mostly.<br /><br />Great film, only complaint would be the very horror-slasher ending which left me a little disappointed given such an intelligent premise. And no I don't think that will ruin anything for the first time viewer...
