When you see a woman buried to her neck and children about to stone her, the brutality of mankind is shown in full view. Regardless of how one feels about the Afghan war in Canada, the overthrow of a regime dedicated to treating women worse then dogs was justified. It is hard to believe that in the modern Muslim world there are still people willing to humiliate and torture women. If this is how the majority of men still want to indoctrinate their boys in school to behave, then the world will remain a cruel place for woman from Morocco to Indonesia. I find it hard to believe that any Muslim living in Canada would oppose the United Nations intervening in a society were music at a wedding is a crime. To lock up young women and force them to marry against their will was a problem in many countries till recently. Few women in the west would tolerate such control over their bodies by men. I am ashamed that some generally good religious Muslim men in our community still refuse to condemn such outrageous behavior.
