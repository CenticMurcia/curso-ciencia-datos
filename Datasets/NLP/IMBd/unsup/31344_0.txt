Okay I'm really starting to get sick of these people who say that this show is a CSI spin off CSI is a bad unbelievable show that is totally fiction they can do forensics in 10 seconds when it takes more then 10 hours, its pure Science fiction CSI is but NCIS is closer to reality its always enjoyable, funny and I'm sure more people would watch it if they could not view it as CSI spin off/Rip off because its not watch one episode and you will see its more about the Federal Agents. the Forensics are only used to identify chemicals and finger prints CSI is not the only place to use CSI and if they didn't have the Foresics in the show it would be fake, and we should just let out all the criminals as we cant convict them because CSI is the only place to use forensics. CSI doesn't mean NCIS unless you are Dyslectic, then maybe it does to you.
