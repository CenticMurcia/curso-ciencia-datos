No, it's not a shocking expose on the deviancy of the "Growing Pains" star, that might have been watchable. No this movie is just a sorry excuse for a 80's horror film. Camoron Lansing is a introverted little tyke who has telekinetic powers. People always seem to die around him. Can the dashing police detective save the day? Will Dr. Nora Haley (Mel Harris of "K-9" 'fame') admit his secret desires? and most importantly, with all the atrocious acting, crap special effects, and groan inducing plot, will anyone give a damn?? I'll give you a hint the answer to one of those questions is a resoundingly overwhelming NO. Directed by Armand Mastroianni, who after "The Supernaturals" and "He knows you're alone" obviously just doesn't know any better.<br /><br />My Grade: D-
