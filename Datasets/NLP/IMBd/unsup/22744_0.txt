I wonder what has gone into those peoples heads who think that this movie is bad.It was such a beautiful film.This film had everything what a good movie should have strong performances,beautiful sets,soothing music,excellent direction. Ranbir Kapoor does a commendable job as Raj,a kind hearted charming boy,who comes in a town for work.Love strikes him when he sees Sakina(Sonam Kapoor),a beautiful young lady.Sakina has her own past.she had been waiting for her love.Raj is heartbroken on knowing her story but he continues to be her friend. Rani Mukherji is the one whom i admired the most in the movie.She plays a kind hearted prostitute.Her appearance really rocked the scene.i have started liking her more after this film.Salman khan had a small role but he portrayed his character well. The person who made these two and half hours of sheer magic is Mr.Sanjay Leela Bhansali.Hats off to you sir!
