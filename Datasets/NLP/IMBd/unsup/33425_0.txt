During a sorority initiation ceremony a girl is accidentally killed. Seven years later, the girls who took part in this event are individually invited to attend a gathering at a remote mansion. It subsequently transpires that they have been brought together by the father of the dead girl, who is seeking retribution. Then a series of murders begin to be carried out by an unknown assassin.<br /><br />Sisters of Death is a pretty unsuccessful thriller. While the premise is reasonable enough, there simply is nowhere near enough effort put into generating suspense. All of the characters act in too much of an ambivalent way, they just don't seem to be concerned that a maniac is picking them off one by one; so it's hard for the audience to exactly care too much either. The movie could also have benefited from the injection of a little more grindhouse content to liven things up. Despite the presence of the five Sisters, there aren't any erotic moments. It's all strictly PG, sadly. This extends to any violent content. Until the final showdown, all of the murders are committed off-screen. Surely it's not too much to ask for a 70's film called Sisters of Death to have at least some salacious content?<br /><br />The best thing about this was the ending. And I do not mean this as a cheap gag. No, the ending was at least a little bit surprising. Although if you think too much about it, I'm not sure if it really entirely makes sense judging by what's gone before. But I'll leave you to be the judge of that for yourself. But other than this, unfortunately, Sisters of Death proves to be a pretty boring movie.
