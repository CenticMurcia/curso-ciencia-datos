I missed this tour in 1991. Two years later I saw Paul in St. Louis and the show was fantastic. Several of my friends that saw the first tour said it was good, but when they saw the next tour they felt that the Get Back Tour was just a rehearsal for the one in 1993.<br /><br />Paul hadn't toured in thirteen years and when you watch the DVD it really shows. I'm really glad that I own this DVD because it feels like a bootleg of a practice gig. There are great moments, but it feels like McCarney is trying too hard to compete with Duran Duran. It must have been a little embarrassing to have 40,000 people show up every night for a practice gig.<br /><br />As for Richard Lester's directing; shame! It is awful. Remember those terrible 80's videos where they just edited in stock footage of silly things that didn't really go with the music? This is a concert video with that awful gimmick. They even use footage of the Beatles. This video goes on my shelf next to "Give my Regards to Broadstreet". It is a nice reminder that Paul is greatÂ… but not perfect.
