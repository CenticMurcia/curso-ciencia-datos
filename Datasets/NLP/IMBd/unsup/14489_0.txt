Patrick, Lisa, and George are simply amazing. If you love anything to do with dancing, you MUST see this movie. The cast is brilliant, the dancing is magical. Words cannot express the beauty, chemistry of this movie. There are movies and then there are brilliant movies and to me in my opinion, this is a brilliant movie. It captivated my attention, I felt emotion through the dancing and acting. Wonderful. The storyline is well put together and the actors have such wonderful chemistry together. This is not a movie where people just dance, it is what they love. You can feel and see the passion in what they are doing. Its one thing to act but its another to have passion in your acting and dancing. I highly recommend this movie.
