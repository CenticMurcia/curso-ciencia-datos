This is called EXTREME MOVIE, just that fact should be enough to make you stay away.<br /><br />They probably didn't know what to call it so they decided to go with the company names latest edition EXTREME, as in DIMENSION EXTREME, mostly used to distribute horror-movies but this is a "comedy-movie".<br /><br />First of all THIS IS NOT A MOVIE, it's about 15-20 short sketches which mostly focuses on teenage-sex-life.<br /><br />There is one story that comes back from time to time between the sketches about a "geek" (played by Ryan Pinkston) in love with the prettiest girl in class (wow, we never heard that before).<br /><br />I wanted to see it because Michael Cera is really funny in SUPERBAD and he is funny in this "movie" as well, BUT his role although being on the cover of the DVD is limited to one sketch that runs for about 3-4 minutes.<br /><br />I also noticed that Frankie Muniz and Jamie Kennedy had their names on the cover but they also only appear in one sketch only, and Jamie Kennedy whom I normally find funny is just disgusting in this one.<br /><br />These types of sketch are better off on YOU TUBE, and there are plenty of YOU TUBE-comedians that are way funnier then a lot of these sketches.<br /><br />Sure there are a couple of funny sketches like the sick and twisted one about a teen boy in love with a sex-toy, at first I was like "yuck" but I couldn't help but to laugh.<br /><br />But for the most parts it's not that fun, and it's definitely not worthy spending money on.<br /><br />I recommend checking out a couple of YOU TUBE-comedians instead because that's all this movie is really, a bunch of YOU TUBISH clips wrapped around a not interesting love-story.<br /><br />The running-time is just around 70 minutes but a lot of times it feels a lot longer.<br /><br />This so called "movie" get's 3/10
