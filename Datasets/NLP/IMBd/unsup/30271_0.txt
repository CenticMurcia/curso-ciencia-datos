This movie was amazing! I have never known much of the Women's Suffrage, other than there was some protesting and women finally got to vote sometime early 1900s. This movie changed all that...<br /><br />The first time I saw it, I only saw the last 30 minutes and was completely engaged. Hilary Swank and Frances O'Connor were fabulous portraying Alice Paul and Lucy Burns. They portrayed so much passion and determination. I immediately checked out when the next showing was so I could see the whole thing.<br /><br />The first while was a little slow, but sets the stage for the climax. The use of new age music with 1910s fashions were a nice contrast, bringing the attitudes and mood of that time into a present day reality.<br /><br />The script was so well written. Not only was it easy to follow, but very accurate as much as I can determine. After viewing the movie, I rushed out to my public library and checked out several books on the suffrage. So far what I've read is congruent with the movie.<br /><br />It's so awe-inspiring to think what these brave women went through to give us a vote. I can't wait until this becomes available on DVD-I will definitely be buying it as soon as that happens.
