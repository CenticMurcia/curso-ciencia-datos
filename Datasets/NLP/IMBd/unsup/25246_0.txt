this film has been made by joe d'amato aka Aristide Massaccesi with kind of european sense of social life and interpreted by my favour actress Luciana Ottaviani aka Jessica Moore that she plays a role as top model and in reality she is a writer with the role of Sarah Asproon that Aristide Massaccesi ( Joe d'Amato) wrote in the different names one of is Sarah Asproon it is a very nice film and deserves an excellent as reward. unfortunately it is very sad that Aristide Massaccesi is dead otherwise he would direct other film to let the people to applause his talented trick of magic
