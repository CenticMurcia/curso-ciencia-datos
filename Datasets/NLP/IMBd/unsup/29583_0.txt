Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega is a nice film. Salman Khan always an excuse to take off his shirt. He was okay but in some scenes he was being silly. Other than that he was fine. Preity Zinta was very good. Rani Mukherjee was good aswell.<br /><br />It starts off with Raj (Salman Khan) coming from Goa to Mumbai in search of a singing career. He stays with his friend Abba (Neeraj Vohra).
