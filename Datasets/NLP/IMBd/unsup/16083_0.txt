this is a fun movie. it's got some corny lines, and a few weird bits, but hey, the fx are good, the monsters are funky, and the human drama is entertaining. so shut off your brain and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />also, though the middle 40 minutes has no godzilla, what many people fail to mention is that it has a big ol' UFO that flies around and blows things up, plus a pretty good bunch of plot advancements. And it's all worth it to see the final battle, which quite frankly is one of the best ever.<br /><br />go see it now!
