Jack Klugman did a brilliant job as a Los Angeles County Coroner on the show. "Quincy, M.E." dealt with the most specific issues of its time during the seven years on NBC Television. It was not an ordinary show as most people would realize in the entertainment world. The show dealt with serious issues like rape, corruption, driving under the influence, mental illness, wife beatings, gun violence, child pornography, indifference, coercion, drug usage, governmental bureaucracy, and child exploitation. Garry Walberg's role as Lieutenant Monahan -- to say the least -- was just as credible in dealing with suspicious deaths to some degree. A show like this was heavily underrated during the 1970's and 1980's. The only problem: not many shows could match the intelligence of "Quincy, M.E." ... let alone its credibility. Need I Say More!!
