Director Shinya Tsukamoto of Tetsuo fame returns with something very different than his hyperkinetic cyborg technophilia mindtrip: an almost sober costume drama cum doppelganger thriller. This man has versatility, I must say.<br /><br />Now the story is decent, though not as great as it could have been. As strange occurrences and the feeling of an alien presence start plaguing a successful doctor's life, he suddenly gets trapped at the bottom of a well while a mysterious person who looks just like him takes over his life, including his house and his wife. Through dialog and flashbacks we learn that the mystery man is his long-lost brother, abandoned by his family because of a snake-shaped deformity on his leg. After he got separated with his wife Rin, he searched for her to find that Rin had married the successful doctor twin. Wanting revenge for his rejection from society, plus to get back at and back together with his old wife, the stranger decides to taunt his doctor brother by forcing him into the most abject of conditions.<br /><br />It's not particularly effective for horror or thriller approach, but it is a good movie in the way the one actor plays the double roles and the color and movement Tsukamoto captures. Apparently he hired actors from a certain local theatre to play the roles, and the approach they have to their characters is certainly very physical: the doppelganger and Rin snake around each other while making love, the way he cartwheels around to scare the brothers' mother, the level of distortion each character puts on their face in order to project their emotion. Add an extremely acute focus on costuming and you get something almost out of Noh theatre: demonic expressiveness, bright colorful motifs, paced and structured movements.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
