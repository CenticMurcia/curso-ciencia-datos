This is by far, the worst piece of poop I have ever seen in my entire life. None of the people who ever produced,acted or directed this movie will ever hold a meaningful position in anything ever produced ever. Not once did I laugh, at anything in this movie (except obnoxiously to annoy people). Don't watch this movie, Ever. Please, I am saying this as a concerned human being. Oh yeah, and this is whats wrong with American film. At least it had something redeemable, like the fact that all the Asian's were masters of the martial arts, or all the great well written "hit in ball jokes", or even the special effects (see explosion at end of movie). Save yourself 10 brain cells and $10, don't see this.
