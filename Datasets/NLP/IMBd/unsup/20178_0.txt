After the shocking revelation at the end of Walkabout, White Rabbit exposes another side of the supernatural aspect of Lost, this time focusing on the show's "hero": Jack Shepard.<br /><br />The story kicks off with Jack having visions of his dead father, Christian (John Terry), and following the seemingly otherworldly figure into the jungle. Flashbacks explain how father and son had a fragile relationship, also revealing that Jack went to Australia to patch things up, only to have to deal with Christian's death and getting the body back to the States. Another plot point concerns the sudden disappearance of the survivors' water supply, which causes heavily pregnant Claire to have some health issues and everyone else to automatically suspect Sawyer.<br /><br />While not as emotionally relevant as the previous episode, this still qualifies as great Lost, presenting two intriguing mysteries - what's the deal with the visions, and who stole the water? - and digging further into Jack's past in order to establish his motives and make him a sympathetic leader figure, as opposed to the scheming Sawyer or the spooky Locke. Matthew Fox, having carried much of the dramatic weight in the two-part pilot, really comes into his own in White Rabbit, turning in a charismatic, affecting performance.<br /><br />In short, Lost keeps going in the right direction. Besides, it's always a good thing when genre shows have titles that reference classic literature: could the island be a much scarier, more realistic version of Wonderland?
