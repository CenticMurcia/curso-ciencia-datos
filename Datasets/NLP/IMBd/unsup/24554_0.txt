I have seen a lot of TV in my time, both good and bad, and I cannot agree with the comment that this show is hideous. My only problem is that I was too young to appreciate both AbFab and High Society when they first started airing. I have seen on this site where people scoff at the use of Valium as a way to get a laugh because the drug is too weak. Let's face it. None of the Americanized versions of British comedies were allowed to be as free with their material as their counterparts in the 1990's. American television was more restricted than other nations, especially on regular networks. People immediately labeled Jean Smart as "family TV" because of one role, so they failed to accept her as Ellie Walker. Mary McDonnell is a two-time Oscar nominee with amazing talent, so how could she possibly be funny? That's what people thought, and they were wrong. What's sad is that some of the people who put this show down are probably tremendous fans of the American adaptation of The Office. Funny how it's acceptable today to rip off a show, but ten years ago, it was a deadly sin.
