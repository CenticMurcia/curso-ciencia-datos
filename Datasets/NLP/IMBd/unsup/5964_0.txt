Breath in.....breath out....breath in. Hi everyone, I am here to talk about the best zombie movie ever: Resident Evil. I first viewed the film when I was six and then I didn't understand English good. When I was about nine or ten, I viewed it again and it was then that I realized that Resident Evil is a masterpiece. It has guns and blood and horror all the way through and, boy, is it one heck of a awesome ride. The lady in red, Alice(Milla Jovovich), has to be one of the most important characters of all time. I mean without her the movie would seem crap and boring but she made it look good. The story is nothing short of brilliant because it will have you captivated and immersed into a world of zombies that like to bite! When 28 days later came out along with its favorable reviews, I though that it was going to be better than Resident Evil but after watching it, 28 days later came out to be nowhere near as good as Resident evil. I love this movie and all the sequels and I can't wait for the new one called RE: Afterlife.<br /><br />After waking up, Alice, has no memory of her object due to the exposure of nerve gas. Along the way she joins a squad whose mission is to contain a virus released by the Red Queen, a supercomputer in charge of the release of the T-Virus. They have to fight through zombies and the Red Queens fatal traps in order to complete their mission.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful from Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and many more. They know how to use their expressions and body language in the movie. The gore and horror is so stupendous it was one of the reasons this became one of my favorites. From biting people on the body to deadly traps, this movie has it all. The sequels were impressive but could not match the power of RE1. All the horror and zombie fans will have a good time enjoying a zombie movie that comes out every four or three years. Ciao, ladies and gentlemen! ****/****
