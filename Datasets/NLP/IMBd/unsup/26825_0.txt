It took me the first 10-15 minutes before I realised that this wasn't a documentary, but was in fact a mockumentary. In other words it's all fiction. I loved that fact that the comments by Sam Neill, Leonard Maltin etc made it all seem so real. What a hoot. Well thought out, and well acted. Just love it.
