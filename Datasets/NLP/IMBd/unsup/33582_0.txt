Zombie, tied, raped, fast forward, every character behaves precisely in the most improbable way. I mean, you have MACHETE in hand and there's a woman TIED to ceiling by a foot long ROPE and you start to UNTANGLE her ? Come on ! Its all like this the whole movie time. This movie was the first zombie movie which i stopped watching because i was bored and resumed later on, just to see that the end sucks too. If the makers of this movie wanted to express some dark side of men, or moral aspects, they failed, and remaining time was wasted on long camera pans and emo music. It could have been better movie, if they at least washed her from time to time.
