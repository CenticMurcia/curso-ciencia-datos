I honestly liked Nightmare On Elm Street 2, i think it was the appropriate sequel to the first one.It had that 80's aspect that for me somehow made it more enjoyable.It was so simple in a way because they were not trying to yet make Freddy Krueger a Dream Master, or a Psycho Dream dude who was psychologically ill and all this is just making the series into a confusing wreck.Here we have a simple plot that tries to explain some stuff, but not to much.I like all the references to the first one, i basically look for that in all sequels, i guess it makes me feel cool to say,"Oh i saw that happen, i actually saw what happened".Ill admit at times it was cheesy, and there were some really unnecessary parts to it, but i liked the film.Overall you might be one of many who hates this movie, but give it a chance if your a fan of the first one or a Freddy fan than you will give this film its props for that. 7.9 out of 10 stars
