I went to see this film with a fairly international group of film goers. . . and we all hated it. Apart from some interesting cinematography (eg. the tandem swim at sunset) this film is absolutely empty. I can't remember a film where I felt so cheated out of my money and my time.<br /><br />On the yahoo cinema site for the film it said that the director did an enormous amount of research:<br /><br />"Frédéric Schoendoerffer s'est énormément documenté sur le métier d'agent secret en procédant à un tri méthodique des informations recueillies à ce sujet".<br /><br />If this is true then the spy business has to be the most boring profession on earth. Granted I realize it isn't all James Bond in real life, but it has to be a thousand times more interesting than the film, because someone could pay me to be a spy, but they could never pay me enough to have to watch this film again.<br /><br />It should be pointed out, I think, that the director didn't do an enormous amount of research into car accidents. The main character suffers severe injury to his head and hand from a relative fender bender, while walking away from a car accident in which the car he is in, going at full tilt down an expressway, flips over a median and land upside down hitting another car, which then causes them both to blow up within a matter of seconds...<br /><br />yet he escapes unscathed...<br /><br />Please, don't waste your money on this film . . . go watch classic Hitchcock. . . he also did an enormous amount of research on the subject but he also knew how to tell a good story.<br /><br />Watch the zoom-in shot at the beginning from outer space to the Meditteranean, it is alright, though a bit cliché these days, then go demand your money back for those of you who have accidentally bought your tickets in advance.
