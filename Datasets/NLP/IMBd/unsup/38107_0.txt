This movie made me angry not because it was really bad, almost all zombie movies are bad, but because it just ripped and ripped and ripped off Romero's movies without as much as a wink. It's not new to borrow from Romero but this is as unoriginal, boring and poorly executed as it gets.<br /><br />I normally wouldn't slash another artist's work this way but looking at the IMDb comments here there are clearly planted 10 star reviews from interested parties and that's kind of lame.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is two of the women who take off their tops have really great breasts. I can imagine the crew of this film hanging out and slapping themselves on the back for getting us to rent this but please stop making movies. It costs too much to go to Blockbuster and pick up two or three of these awful movies that no one seemed to put enough time or effort into making.
