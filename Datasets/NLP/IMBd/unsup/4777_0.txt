I loved this movie from the beginning to the climactic ending. It was suspenseful and I always had the feeling of trying to see around corners to find out what was to happen next. I won't give a synopsis of the movie as others have always done it adequately. I won't liken it to other movies as it stands quite clearly on its own. Transgressing shock horror and mutilations for the fear of what cant be seen, and that resides not only in the woods alone. I love the way the woods intruded on the school with vines and leaves on the walls and the floor. And the leaves always present on the teachers hair. Patricia Clarkson does a beautifully understated job as the headmistress, and her quiet voice doing a lot more to scare me than a lot of yelling and overbearing attitudes of other films. Agnes is great as the Heroine Heather, and I found myself totally captivated by her style. Her friend Marcy was a lovely touch and the vocals for the part (whether her or not) were stunning. The stillness was also an attraction, never hurrying, like trees, still and composed. I am enamored by the atmosphere, the cinematography, and the set design and I don't know if the director can better this but I do hope he gives it a try.
