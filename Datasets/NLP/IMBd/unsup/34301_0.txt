1 for Tobin Bell whom I thought had a good character (And the only reason I watched it in the first place).<br /><br />2 for some of the death scenes which were quite grisly.<br /><br />Other than that...this movie appears to have stolen ideas from other movies such as Nightmare on Elmstreet, scream (or any other slasher picture), and lastly jeepers creepers.<br /><br />I say Jeepers Creepers because the "Boogyman" looked a lot like he could have been the Creepers' brother in this movie. Even on top of that the "Boogyman" looked like he stole his costume from slipknot.<br /><br />It started off with potential...but seemed to just go down hill extremely fast. It snowballed and the movie ended leaving me more disappointed than the first one.<br /><br />I was gonna give this a 3 out of 10...but I couldn't think of anything else good about this movie in which I enjoyed.
