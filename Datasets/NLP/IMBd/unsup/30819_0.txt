Star Wars Episode 1 and 2 are quite controversial films that true Star Wars fans think stink like garbage, but Star Wars: Clone Wars doesn't let down. It's got great action, great stories, and expands the Star Wars saga further. And it's a darn cartoon! Can you believe that a great action show is a 2-D cartoon? All our favorites from the prequels are in this show. Anakin, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Mace Windu and many more. What makes this show so remarkable is the way the series leads up to Revenge of the Sith, as a matter of fact, the very last scene is a shot of the Battle of Coruscant. I also enjoyed the lightsaber duels in this series, particularly the one between Anakin and Asajj Ventress.<br /><br />In the end, this is an incredible mini-series, and fills in the gap between Episode 2 and 3. It's too bad every episode was too god darn short!
