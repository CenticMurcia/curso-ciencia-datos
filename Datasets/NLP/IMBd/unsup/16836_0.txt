This is truly a great classic film starring Charles Laughton,( Sir Humphrey Pengallan) who is a ruthless ruler who heads a gang of thieves who look for shipwrecks along their coastline with many huge rocks and boulders. These crooks live in the Jamaica Inn and deliberately turn out the lamp that would guide the ships away from their rocky coast. Maureen O'Hara, (Mary) is traveling from Ireland as she lost her mom and seeks to find her aunt who lives at the Jamaica Inn. However, Mary does not have any idea what she is getting herself into until she realizes that the local town people do not want anything to do with the Jamaica Inn and her coachman leaves her a mile or two away from the inn along with her luggage. Maureen O'Hara was just starting her career and was very pretty and thin and you just knew she was going to become a great star. Charles Laughton gave one of his best performances in this great 1939 Masterpiece of great acting.
