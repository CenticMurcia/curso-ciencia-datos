The Conrad Boys can be either a small or a big disappointment. It simply depends on whether the previous film of that kind that one has watched was just as cliché or perhaps (probably) better.<br /><br />There are two main areas making the film weak. The first would be the fact that there is already a much better movie with a similar plot, namely 'Shelter'. What might stand for a defending factor for 'The Conrad Boys' is the fact that it was released in one year earlier which might have helped the makers of 'Shelter'. However, Justin Lo could do much better, at least making the film more believable for the audience to attach with. The other major problem of the movie is its cliché aspect, which unfortunately touches a number of the film's areas. The first would be the dialogues, which might sound original only for people who begin their adventure with cinema. What makes the dialogues even worse are the cliché characters played by second-class actors, with little BooBoo Stewart (playing the protagonist's little brother) at the top of the list. One cannot stop wondering whether he got the part only due to some family relations with the person responsible for the movie casting.<br /><br />Summing up, but for the very nice face of Nick Bartzen (playing the protagonist's 'boyfriend') and his acting, 'The Conrad Boys' is an evening waste of time and it can hardly remain in the viewers' warm memories or heart.
