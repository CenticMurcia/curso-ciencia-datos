I feel sorry for Anna Friel, first the show that she is absolutely adorable in gets cancelled, then the final episode is almost as bad as the final episode of Seinfeld, then what could have been a great movie for her career - the only other real character in a major Will Ferrell comedy - turns out to be a terrible, stinking turd of a flick.<br /><br />The jokes were not funny, i don't remember laughing. They were terrible, obvious and loooooooong. The Ferrell character was completely unlikable from start to finish. There is a Neanderthal as one of the major characters and at one point the question is asked "why don't we let the monkey lead?" a question the many writers, producers ad director of this stink-fest may have asked themselves repeatedly as the Neanderthal was more often than not the source of what passes for 'humor' and not Will Ferrell's overacting. The last point is a source of some concern to this moviegoer, WF can be funny, and he can be very funny and as seen in Stranger Than Fiction this pony has more than one trick but what I have been seeing more recently is a series of choices that leave me questioning how long until people stop paying him to be in their 'comedies.' I don't know if anyone ever bothered to watch the deleted scenes of Bruce Almighty but there are a few scenes in which Jim Carrey was given some props and told to do Jim Carrey-like things, shameless and uninspired directing which thankfully didn't make it in to what was an averagely fun movie, however Brad Silberling must've, as this film was one long series of bad set pieces designed to make Will Ferrell do Will Ferrell-like things and the terrible bits made the finished film rather than the extra features of the DVD.<br /><br />Zero stars. MUST DO BETTER. PLEASE Hollywood, PLEASE!
