I rented this flick after viewing part of a cut version on the Sci-Fi Channel. I thought it would be so cheesy it would be funny. It has TONS of cheese but the acting's so awful, it begins to wear thin on the viewer. Amanda Donohoe looks pretty hot but the armpit hair could go. Hugh Grant phones in his performance and looks stunned that he had to do this flick. The other women look decent but are somewhat forgotten while they attempt to tell some very dull story. In a word, this movie is "pathetic." It might be "the best Irish/Celtic horror film" because it might be the only "Irish/Celtic horror film." If this film had any competition in the category, I can guarantee my vote would be for the competition. They could have just filmed the three women running around semi-nude and that would have more of a plot than this piece of trash. The "monster" looks like a paper mache worm. The VERY end is cute but the nearly 1 hour and a half of slow torture it took to get there isn't worth it. Don't waste your time!!!!!!!
