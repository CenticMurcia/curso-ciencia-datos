This is truly one of the most intriguingly rich documentaries I have ever seen illuminated on the screen. I was fortunate enough to catch it at The Seattle Film festival a couple of years ago and have been looking for the DVD ever since. Where might this be? I know it received several awards and can't imagine why it has not been released yet._THIS IS A GEM NOT TO BE LOST!!! "Strange Fruit" very masterfully combines History, Biography, and Jazz Music. It starts with the simple premise of a song, "Strange Fruit", which Bronx-born school teacher-Abel Merepol wrote the lyrics for and jazz diva Billie Holliday later made famous. Although there was some conflict about whom should have rightfully received credit for this song "back in the day" (I will not reveal too much),-the fact that the writer was Jewish and the singer African American helps us to understand the sensitivity of the lyrics themselves as the story unfolds a rich -if previously unspoken-tapestry of the American Soul- revealed to us via one of the greatest of all American contributions-jazz music!!! This documentary is a powerful acknowledgment of the people and history that gave us this legacy and to whom we owe much recognition. I think the viewer will find themselves glued to their seat as the behind-the-scenes story of the 30's and 40's New York Jazz scene/its venues unfolds with the music. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS ON DVD!!! Any info out there on a planned DVD release?
