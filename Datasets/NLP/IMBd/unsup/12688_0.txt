The lines of time are very blurry. Past, present and the future are merged into one another in a very fascinating manner. So are the lines of conventional philosophies. What is life? What is death? Where does one end and the other begin? What is in between? According to Gulzar's Lekin, in between is this eternal search for moksha, in between is this struggle against the ghosts of life, where time stands still, till the spirit is free.
