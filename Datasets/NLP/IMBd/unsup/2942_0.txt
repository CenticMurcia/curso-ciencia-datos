Although at first glance this film appears to have been done as a final project for a film school freshman, the film has many great and classic qualities. Released in 2004 the grainy film quality gives it an older look adding to some of the great films of the 80's. The humor adds an element that isn't all too characteristic of these kinds of films but nevertheless is a welcome relief. The low budget is obvious but the filmmakers do a great job of stretching that budget and the final result is not a bad piece of work.<br /><br />The characters are surprisingly deep and the actors portraying them give them a realness and are believable.<br /><br />This type of film may not appeal to everyone but I suppose the only ones renting it will be the type who will enjoy it.
