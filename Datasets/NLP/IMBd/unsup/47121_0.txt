Affleck's portrayal of Jack Ryan can only be described as one of the biggest casting mistakes in all of Hollywood history. Does he really think he can fill in for Harrison Ford or even Alec Baldwin? YIKES. As long as the American public will shell out their hard-earned dollars to see Affleck, Hollywood will continue to produce this kind of tripe. Don't people know good acting from really bad? I guess it is just as well that Affleck is associated with this clunker; better actors probably knew to turn the role down.<br /><br />After Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games, this was a miserable followup to what I understand is a great Tom Clancy novel. It was tedious, boring and, amazingly, full of bad language, unlike its predecessor movies. In short, it stank. The script was terrible and the plot so unbelievably stupid that it was painful to watch. The special effects were laughable CGIs. I have not read the novel, but I doubt very seriously it was as asinine as this screenplay was. Skip this one!
