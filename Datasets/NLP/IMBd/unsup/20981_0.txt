This isn't a war film, it features in a time of was with POW's and their jailers, but it is at its heart about the magnificence of the human spirit. A marvellous example of hope. The worst and the best of the human condition is on display, it doesn't succumb to tricks or props, it doesn't need to, because what it has is emotion. Get out your hankies. Be prepared for marvellous performances by all of the cast, nobody stands out because that was the way it needed to be played.<br /><br />This film is one of those you must see. I bought it for under Â£5.00 at my Choices video store, and what a bargain that was. Go out and buy this film now and add it to your collection.
