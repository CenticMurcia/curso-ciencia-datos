This movie showed some potential with time travel and mysterious memory loss, however the plot never really unfolds and the hospital suspense scenes feel totally forced and bland.<br /><br />None of the characters really develop past the basic storyline which is poor at best, although the acting is OK. Visual effects and the strange time traveling are all it has to offer.. <br /><br />"the I inside" tries hard to be intelligent and mysterious but is ultimately uninteresting but of course you don't find that out until the end of the movie...where you are left scratching your head and disappointed.<br /><br />AVOID!!!
