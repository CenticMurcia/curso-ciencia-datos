With a plot more resembling a Japanese production than your usual kung fu film and excellent cinematography, Avenging Eagle is a very good lesser-known martial art movie. The main actors do their usual good job and the fight scenes are very well done. The whole film has the feel of a good B grade western.<br /><br />The director, Sun Cheung, has a style apart from the other more well known Shaw directors and he handles the fight scenes with finesse as well as the rest of the movie. HIs movie output is hard to find and guessing from the lack of reviews on IMDb many of his films never made it into the U.S..<br /><br />I recommend this film for anyone familiar with Liu Chia Liang or Chen Cheh's work. The movie is a change of pace from the baroque and brutal plot lines of Chen Cheh and the elaborate hi-jinx of Liu Chia Liang.
