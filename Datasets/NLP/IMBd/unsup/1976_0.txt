(Spoiler alert!)<br /><br />I was not excited when I learned of the show coming to television, but after they closed off the initial story arc and continued with new material, it took off and had the potential to be a great series. Separating The Crow as an alternate entity was brilliant and having Shelly remaining on the bridge to the afterworld held the original premise of the show.<br /><br />Also, Demascos was terrific as Eric. He maintained the look Branden Lee originated, and also made the martial arts natural and well-integrated into the action sequences.<br /><br />I only wish the series would get released in DVD so I could see the episodes again.
