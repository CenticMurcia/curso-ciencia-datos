This movie depicts human relations.It shows the inevitable gaps between people and like the movie "Babel" it also shows how important communication is; because most of the things throughout the movie happen because of lack of communication. It also questions the judicial system in Turkey. People don't understand each other and in fact sometimes they don't want to. Most of the people evaluate others with the things they own, they wear or with their occupations. As if the Social status of a person has become the criterion of being a human. I mean if your social status is low, you are not respected, you are accepted as a "non-human" You see what one can do when he has nothing to lose. "It's only after you lose everything that you are free to do anything" (quote from fight club) Selim and his gang have nothing to lose, so they are free -actually they think they are free to do anything; because what else they can lose? People's non-existing respect? Money? What? The answer is nothing. You can't lose what you don't have. Torturing is their self-masturbation, destruction is their revenge. Yet this is questionable: "Do we have the right to take justice into our hands." Nothing is unreal in the movie. Loved it
