The movie was very sweet, I was happy I rented it. Although I wish someone would explain the R rating. I thought the guy playing the redneck was very funny. And he's either a very good actor, or a real weird person. I don't want to spoil the movie but glad the two boys find happiness. In fact I found myself thinking about the coffee scene and thinking of my boss. Over all a fun movie a lot different than I generally would rent but very glad I did. Has the redneck done any more movies, and what was his name. If anyone from the film reads this tell him he has a fan.
