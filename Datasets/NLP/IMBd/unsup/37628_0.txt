I would love to see a "G" rated version of this movie.<br /><br />It never let's up in its use of the "F" word. In fact in the opening words of the movie, it used the "F" word.<br /><br />I think if they made a "G" version of this movie - there would be NO dialogue -- the movie would be one long "MF" BLEEP!<br /><br />This isn't even a good "bro" movie. Bad acting, bad dialouge. It did have a semblance of a plot though.<br /><br />Let me put it this way - if I had to choose between this movie and "Pippi Longstocking" -- it would be a toss up...<br /><br />Wayno<br /><br />
