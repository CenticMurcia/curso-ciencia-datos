Im sorry to those who loved this film. But i thought it was sick. The scene at the end was hideous, with the way matthew lillard shot cher was horrible and very unpleasant to watch. yes it's educational at how christians react to abortion, but surely this is extremism that isn't even enjoyable. However I did think it was well acted by the leads, but I cannot get over why on earth the shooting scene was in here. It was horrific, and as a secondary school religious studies student, i found it rather distracting and haunting and something i will always think of whenever learning about abortion. truly horrible. cher has certainly dropped her standards, why on earth would she make this hammy, horrid rubbish?
