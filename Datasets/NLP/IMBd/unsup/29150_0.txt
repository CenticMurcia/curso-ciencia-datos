This is a classic 1950s Sci/Fi film.<br /><br />I originally saw it when I was nine, and had nightmares for six weeks, thereafter.<br /><br />My rating for this film is 8 out of 10, primarily because of the impact it had on me as a child. I can now look at it and smile, but also recall those dreams which invaded my sleep.<br /><br />Enjoy; It is worth a viewing.
