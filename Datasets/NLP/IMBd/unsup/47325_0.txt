I enjoyed the first "Pet Sematary" and rented this because I wanted some cheesy entertainment. It won't disappoint if one is looking for cheese, but on most every other front it will. The main problem is that Edward Furlong, our protagonist, has virtually nothing to do. Clearly he was cast because of his participation in "Terminator 2." While I find Furlong to be somewhat grating (the pubescent cracking of the voice and the eyes glowering under too-long bangs), he did create a coherent character in "T2." Yet here he is given very little dialogue and exists to merely sleepwalk through scenes. I kept waiting for him to respond to his tormentors with some biting comment, or have some insight into death, but he is a cipher. If he had been a proactive character--at least as interesting as the bully and the abusive sheriff--this movie would have been an above average horror.
