This is not just any King Kong rip-off... this is a King Kong rip-off from the legendary Shaw Bros! Filmed in Shaw Scope! Shady Chinese guys try to find a giant ape in India. The "exploration" is wonderfully ridiculous. Then, just when you and your friends think you can't possibly laugh any more, amidst all the Chinese actors appears a beautiful blonde westerner! Raised in the jungle, she swings through the trees like Tarzan with a crazy scream. Her top is glued on... barely.<br /><br />Lots of bad, generic 70's music accompany all of this.<br /><br />When she shimmies up a tree, legs akimbo, the hapless Chinese explorer guy gets quite an eyeful.<br /><br />She can control all the jungle animals. The tigers, cheetahs and elephants all love to frolic with her. Except the snakes. One nasty snake bites her high on the inner thigh. Pretty close to the danger zone. What's the hapless Chinese explorer to do while she writhes in pain? Why stick his face down between her legs and suck the poison out, of course! The miniature sets are fantastically cheap. Not one of them would have qualified for a Godzilla movie. They don't help matters by offering lots of close-ups of the miniature trees and fake streams. You keep expecting a Lionel train to whistle by.<br /><br />Samantha (the girl) doesn't command much of any language, preferring grunts. She is so grateful to the hapless Chinese explorer that they make love in her cave. Cue more 70's music.<br /><br />Oh, and Samantha, raised in this harsh jungle since a child, wears a lot of make-up.<br /><br />The Peking Man changes size a bit, depending on the sets. He seems to range from 20 to 100 feet tall.<br /><br />If you enjoy campy trash, this is a must see! Our group has watched a lot of bad movies together but very few have given us as much joy as Mighty Peking Man.
