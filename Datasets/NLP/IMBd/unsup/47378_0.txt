From Ellyn Bache's novel about the feisty mother of seven boys, most of whom are now grown and out of the house, still worrying after them, concerned over their health and safety, which eventually puts a strain on her sanity. Extremely odd piece is not an attractive vehicle for Susan Sarandon, although she's as interesting as ever. Film takes place over a couple days' time, while Sarandon and her eccentric brood await the news of her soldier-son, but the picture has no particular viewpoint, it's just a melodramatic passel of scenes. Susan is its one distinguishing factor: giving another in her repertoire of aggressive-yet-vulnerable characters, she's reason enough to take a look but you probably won't remember the flick a day or so later. *1/2 from ****
