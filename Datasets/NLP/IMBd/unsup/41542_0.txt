I am a big Jodie Foster fan and went to see Stealing Home mainly because she was in it. I thought Jodie Foster was great actually,but the movie itself didn't do it for me. <br /><br />I found it very different then the previews made it out to be and at times it was plodding, as well as being very confusing as well at certain points.(I Really didn't like the flashback theme, that works in certain movies but I didn't think it worked here.) It was also rather dull, at times though, maybe it's because I'm not a major baseball fan either so I wasn't that into that part of it.<br /><br />I can appreciate the premise of the movie, however, and this is one I know some disagree with me on. The best thing about the movie was Foster. As usual she gives us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable role. I might watch it again if it was on, just for her performance. Her character was fresh and fiercely wonderful- I wish she'd been in every scene, maybe I would have stayed focused on the movie more if she had been. In fact all the performers were great and I think this movie really did have a certain sweetness to it but I just wish certain things had been done differently and maybe a bit less on the flashback sequences. The previews were also very misleading making it look different then what it actually was. Even though, I can appreciate it's appeal, I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped.
