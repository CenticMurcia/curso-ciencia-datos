Definitely the highlight for the few people that actually watch this film will be Leelee Zobiewsky prancing around in her underwear. She's not a bad looking woman and certainly many male viewers will regard this as the highlight of the film. That's not to say that this is the only thing men respond to, it's just that there's precious little else to entertain or occupy you during these long hours of this film. This film is tedious and it justifiably bombed at the box office, even in France, where they tend to be more sympathetic of a low=action film Many of the key people in this film aren't actually French, which is no bad thing in itself, but there is the feeling that the French setting is used to justify the worst excesses of this film; low plot, pretentious and clich√©d. Not even LeeLee's knickers and bra could salvage any decent viewing figures.<br /><br />If you have sympathy for young petulant pretty girls that invent crises of their own because their life is too uneventful, then you may sympathise with young Leelee, but the fact that she decides life is worth living because her Chinese neighbour cooked her some spring rolls with chop suey and then washed and ironed her dress properly pretty much sums up the vacuous nature of this character and also of this turgid film. There's no doubting that his cooking and laundry abilities look impressive, but given the fact that they extended the life of this fluffy irrelevant girl, and hence of this awful film, he has a lot to ask for.<br /><br />I was never in favour of voluntary assisted euthanasia before this film, but I now believe that there can be a case made for it, at least in the context of this dreary and highly pretentious film.
