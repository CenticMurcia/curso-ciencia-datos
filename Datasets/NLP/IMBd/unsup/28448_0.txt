This movie may have a lot of zombies running around (yes, running... like they are getting ready for a marathon), but it doesn't matter anyway. They could have put in 100 more zombies, and this movie would still suck. The acting is awful, the zombies are terrible and the story is just lame. I can only assume that the director was waisted when trying to edit this movie, because there are so many scnenes, that has plot holes and errors in them, that you just want to turn of the movie and lie down meditating over your whole existence, and why you ever wanted to waist 70 minutes of your time on this crap. I had to check twice to be sure this was not an Ittenbach movie, because it easily could have been one.<br /><br />I'll give it 2 stars for Bloody Bill only, because he was OK... at least he was the best actor in this movie, and thats saying a lot.
