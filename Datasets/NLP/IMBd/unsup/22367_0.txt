I caught this movie on Lifetime Movie Network. I really only watched it because it's opening screen was the Bakersfield street sign. As a new Bakersfield resident, I was fascinated to find out how many places I could recognize in this movie. Not much. But I do believe it captured some of the "Nashville West" culture, with the cowboys, the country-western bar, Tony Llama sign. It also shows that the typical "armpit of America" slam I sometimes hear about Bakersfield does not take into account the many affluent citizens who own high-dollar extravagant homes. As for the movie, it kept my attention until the end, which is rare in my case for TV. I enjoyed the ending, where the ditsy blond turned out to be cold as ice. And the kinky twist, how she was in love with her female friend was revealed as she shot her to death. Oh, and of course, you had to love the gory handcuff scene in the end! This must have been along the road somewhere heading to Kernville, along the Kern River. That's it, pretty good movie, a cold-blooded Thelma and Louise.
