Bad, bad, bad. I don't know what these film-makers were thinking! Bringing back Linda Blair to reprise her role as Regan couldn't save this. Bringing back Kitty Winn as a tougher Sharon couldn't save this. The Georgetown house and infamous staircase couldn't save this. So, let's bring in Richard Burton and Louise Fletcher. We'll make Burton a priest and Fletcher's character a mother figure for Regan. Why not? She's the closest resemblance to Ellen Burstyn we're going to get. I am not even going to go into the whole locust idiocy. Let's just say that the producers must have used every locust in the free world to film this movie. Bad script, bad acting, cheesy special effects and a horrific (not in the good way) ending make this one of the worst films ever made in the history of Hollywood movies. On the plus side, Max von Sydow is the only watchable player in the film. My rating: 2 out of 10
