As a standalone movie "Highlander II - The Quickening" is definitely a bad one, with uninspired plot, ludicrous scenes such as the one with the accelerating metro train, and pretty bad acting performances. Maybe not bad enough to become an unforgettable classic of bad film making, but certainly awful and ridiculous all the way. However, this movie deserves a special place in the realm of modern disasters in the film industry, because as a sequel it is absolutely abysmal, out of place, and an utter disgrace to the first one (and to the whole series, which never recovered after the atom-bomb that this movie dropped on the plot).<br /><br />This flick could well be a warning for any director who wants to direct a sequel to any movie: if you're not absolutely sure about what you are doing, think again. This movie was so incoherent and inducted so many plot inconsistencies in the whole series that even the credibility of the first one came out irreparably damaged. It put a truckload of trite sci-fi elements in what was just a fantasy story, it denied everything that happened before... literally. The first time I saw this I was totally puzzled, I almost couldn't believe it.<br /><br />As a standalone movie (and if I felt like being generous), I would rate this a 2 out of 10. But as a sequel, this gets...<br /><br />1/10
