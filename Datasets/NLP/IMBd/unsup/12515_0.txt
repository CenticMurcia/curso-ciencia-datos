The brilliance of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore as a double act has never fully been apreciated. Most of the famous sketches are from Not only But Also, but the funniest ones come from the Derek and Clive tapes. Derek and Clive Get the Horn is the Jewel in the comical crown for both Cook and Moore as comedians. It is also something of a last hurrah. Although both men would appear together again over the years, this was the last original performance they gave together, and it rarely came, excuse the pun, funnier than this. Dud is at his giggling funniest best and Pete cracks Dud up with his waspish dry wit throughout. Overall not a movie to show grandma on Boxing day, or any other day come to that. Come to think of it its best you watch it on your own. With the curtains drawn, at Two 0 clock in the morning. And it was directed by Russel Mulcahey! Good GOD<br /><br />Favourite sketches : Mother, Horse Racing, Songs and Schoolboy. Just so you know i have seen it and iam not making it up!<br /><br />A classic
