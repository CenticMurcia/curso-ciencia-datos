Terrible, Terrible Movie!!! This pathetic attempt at a storyline, ruins the fledgling reputations of Sachin Bhowmick & Farrukh Dhondy, and causes further damage to Ghai's already in tatters reputation as one of Bollywood's erstwhile Moguls! Elements of Titanic and Lagaan were blended together in the hope of finding favour with the audience, but the story bored the hell out of viewers who went in expecting a different storyline! The ills of Kisna don't stop at unimaginative screenplay, but extend to direction as well. The movie drags adding to the viewers frustration. I've never been one of those who walk out from a movie halfway, but in this one I barely held on. I walked out cursing before the credits started to roll, something I make a point to see in other movies. Others didn't wait. They had long gone...<br /><br />Even the acting was below par. Vivek Oberoi disappoints, but I guess even he saw no point in the movie & just went along with the director. The two lead actresses weren't much either. Isha & Antonia each bare half a breast in the movie, but even that will not salvage this movie. One can only pity Subhash Ghai...<br /><br />This was my last Subhash Ghai movie. In spite of Trimurti & Yaaden, I had thought a filmmaker of his ability would come up with something interesting, but that was not to be. Once again, we had to be reminded that all filmmakers one day lose their touch. It's happened to greats like Hrishikesh Mukherji & Mahesh Bhatt. To lesser ones like Prakash Mehra & Indra Kumar. For it to happen to Subhash Ghai should come as no surprise. The signs have been there for some time.<br /><br />What irks me most about the state of Indian Cinema are people like Ghai who make movies for commercial success. They are scared of taking a risk. As a result we have a slew of mediocre films. This mindset also prompts new entrants to the industry to ape former greats by playing safe, resulting in more bad films. There are actors in this category too who prefer playing safe, rather than acting... Actors like Shahrukh Khan.<br /><br />And there are the gutsy filmmakers and actors. Govind Nihalani, John Matthew Mathan, Aamir Khan. Their movies are the ones that one should look out for. At least they're worth the wait. And your money. Because for now, I very strongly feel that Subhash Ghai owes me Rs. 160!
