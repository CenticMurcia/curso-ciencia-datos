Kevin Smith's "Clerks" is probably one of the last true independent films we will ever see. A joe-schmo convenience store clerk from New Jersey pulls together about $30,000 and films a movie with the limited resources he can acquire. "Clerks" is one of the funniest movies I have seen. I think I like it so much because it isn't just slapstick, but a mix of intelligence with d*ck-n-fart jokes. It'll have you laughing at some things that you never would have expected. The hilarious performances in this movie aren't even from real actors of the time, but friends and family of Smith. Assuming you aren't easily offended (and even if you are), I highly recommend checking out this movie if you haven't already. Even if you aren't a fan of the film, you still have to respect the achievements he has made, going from store clerk to successful filmmaker with this one little black and white gem.
