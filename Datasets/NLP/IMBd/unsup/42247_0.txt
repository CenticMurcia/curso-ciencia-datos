"Jade" hasn't got enough in the way of memorable scenes or entertaining dialogue to be a thriller. My impression is of a "that'll do, let's get it in the can" attitude towards the script, the direction and the lack luster air of some of the cast. The video cassette I have says on the packaging:"An Erotic Thriller". There is quite a lot of what could be called sex in this movie, but the last thing it has is eroticism. I bought my copy from the special offers rack at a local store, reduced 70% from retail. There is a hung jury on whether or not I wasted my money!<br /><br />Two of the leading players, David Caruso "David Corelli" and Linda Fiorentino "Trina Gavin" look uncomfortable in every scene they do. When David Caruso left east coast cop TV to make movies in Hollywood I imagine this by the numbers effort wasn't the sort of thing he had in mind. Linda Fiorentino has made better appearances too. I prefer to remember her in "The Last Seduction" and "Body Count". "Body Count" also provides an opportunity to see David Caruso doing much better work.<br /><br />Perhaps fortunately, Chazz Palminteri and Richard Crenna seem completely at home with their roles of "Matt Gavin" and " Lew Edwards" respectively. The MG characterization is well done. Chazz Palminteri's interpretation, with its calculated cordiality and sinister edge, makes a decent job of unexceptional material. LE is Governor of California. Richard Crenna gives him just the right amount of ruthless deviousness to be entirely believable as a career politician.<br /><br />Other things about "Jade" are worth a mention - at least they interest me, anyway! The set dressing of the rich man's house has been done in impressive style by people who clearly know how to create visual atmosphere. Some of the soundtrack music is also better than routine. The closing credits are accompanied by an excellent, haunting vocal, "The Mystic Dream", performed by Loreena McKennitt. At least I think that's the lady's name, the credit is fuzzy on my tape.<br /><br />Being few and far between, the good bits don't save the movie.<br /><br />
