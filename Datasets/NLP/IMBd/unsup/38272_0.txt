Common teenager horror movie... Teens go to college, first everything seems to be fine, but soon they finds out the dorm they stays in used to be an asylum for mental patients that was tortured by an insane doctor. It also seems that all the new students that lives in the "asylum" has had some issues in their earlier lives, and now the doctor has come back to "cure" them.<br /><br />The plot is very lame, and it is very hard to find anything in this movie interesting. useless effects, bad mood, terrible acting... this movie is not scary, and its not bad in a way that makes it funny, it is bad in a way that makes you wanna cut open your wrists just so you have no possibilities to watch it ever again.<br /><br />See this if you want to be more bored than you were before you did anything, yes, it is actually better to do nothing than watch this piece of crap.
