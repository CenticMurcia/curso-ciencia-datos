Basically it's a series of gags built around April 1st, April Fools day in the office of a newspaper. Office fool Charley at first gets the tricks played on him with mixed humorous results, then he turns the tricks on others only to have them backfire. Our lovable schlemiel (dolt) can always laugh at himself when things go wrong and that is why we love him. The plot is thin but, basically Charley's office nemesis Noah Young and rival plans to embarrass Charley and separate him from his love, the bosses daughter. Of course Charley has to win the girl in the end but his enthusiasm literally gets him in over his head and she finally saves his hide. Charley's 85th film out of 255, another one that needs to be put out on DVD!
