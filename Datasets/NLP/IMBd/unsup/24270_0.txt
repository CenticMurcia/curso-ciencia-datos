For those of us who look back fondly at a decade of dodgy hairstyles, gaudy colours and the reign of Michael Jackson and Madonna, this is the perfect film! It has the capacity to induce laughter, tears, boos and cheers. Adam Sandler (Robbie Hart) takes on the unusual role of a sensitive idealist (as opposed to his usual obnoxious but funny and somehow redeeming characters) and Drew Barrymore plays the delightful Julia with the charm that she never fails to bring to the screen.<br /><br />There are hilarious scenes that echo the usual wedding reception capers, with a fantastic and unforgettable performance of a camp Boy George tribute! Although it is entirely predictable it is nevertheless a heartwarming film that serves to remind us that the enduring love and companionship that a marriage is really about is far more important than a glitzy, elaborate wedding.
