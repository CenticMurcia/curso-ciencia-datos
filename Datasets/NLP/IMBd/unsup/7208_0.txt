Without a doubt, this is the most entertaining and funniest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. The side jokes are hilarious, the main punch lines are even funnier, and last but not least- every word out of Vinny Gambini's (Joe Pesci) mouth is absolutely hilarious. From start to finish, this film will have you cracking up and laughing so hard that you'll rewind a majority of the parts a million times and recite every word in each selection. After that point, you'll have the whole movie memorized in about 2-3 nights. I am in utter disbelief that not everyone has voted this movie a perfect 10. The only thing that I can think of that is a negative point for this movie is that after you watch this, Comedy is RUINED...because NOTHING is funny after you watch this. Nothing even comes close to 1/2 as funny as this masterpiece!
