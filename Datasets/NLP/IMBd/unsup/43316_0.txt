Cute, young Billy Coulton (Derek Rydall--who wears really tight pants all during the picture) sees call girl Lisa Grace (Shannon Tweed) stabbed to death by his high school teacher (Allen Garfield). This all happens within the first 30 minutes. The next tedious hour involves Billy trying to convince the police that his teacher is the murderer while the teacher zeroes in on Billy.<br /><br />Unscary, stupid, dull "horror" movie with gratuitous nudity thrown in (all the victims are hookers). Also Elliott Gould (who doesn't pop up until a hour into the film) is totally wasted. I'm giving this a 2 because Rydall is good (and really handsome) and there are good performances by Tweed and Richard Roundtree (!!) as a detective. Otherwise this is just a hopeless mess. Skip it.
