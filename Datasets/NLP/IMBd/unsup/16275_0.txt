Despite the frivolous title, this was a fun and suspenseful film. Holmes has stumbled across a creepy case, forcing him to delve into the psychology of a twisted killer. Rupert Everett is a younger, more dashing Sherlock than we're used to seeing, but he plays the part well. Ian Hart also makes a different sort of Watson, but there is chemistry (and a bit of underlying tension!) between the detective and the good doctor. I'd like to see the actors take up the roles again.<br /><br />The sets and costumes are wonderful, although many of the scenes are awfully foggy, even for London. Some of the discussions between the characters regarding the murders tend toward being a little graphic, but it is most interesting listening to the rather repressed Holmes discussing the details of sexually motivated crimes! Not an ordinary sort of case. The conclusion is satisfying. Well worth watching.
