I gave this flick a 10, because I'm a big fan of b-movie "train wrecks". Godzilla movies(not the Japanese ones), Ultraman and old kung-fu movies are enjoyable in much the same way as basket case 2: so bad that you sit there laughing hysterically because someone actually took themselves seriously when writing something completely asinine. Good fun if you go into it looking for the accidental humor rather than the intended fright. If your sense of humor is like mine, this is one disaster from which you won't be able to turn away.
