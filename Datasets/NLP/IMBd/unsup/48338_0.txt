If you want my opinion, this show is very negative stereotype of Bostonians especially the blue collar family of the O'Neils as typical Irish Catholic. Harriet Sansom Harris and Lenny Clarke could have a better show without the rest of the cast. They're both really the stars of the show and they are much more interesting together. So their son falls in love with a daughter of two gay men. I don't anything about her mother which makes the impression that she did not have a mother or who is actually her father. I only saw a couple episodes and was not impressed by the writing. The rest of the cast seem easily forgettable in their roles. The gay couple is wealthy, educated, and cultured stereotype of the gay community. One male owns or works in an art gallery. Another male is a teacher in an elementary school. It kind bothers me that the Irish catholic O'Neils owns a bar in Boston. It's just all stereotypes and I'm not crazy about watching stereotypes or being preached too. I think the daughter's mother or actual parentage should be addressed.
