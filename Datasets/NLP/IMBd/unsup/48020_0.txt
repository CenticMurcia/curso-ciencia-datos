Godefroy, a Middle Ages knight, kills the father of his fiancee by mistake. He then is given a magic potion by a sorcerer to return in the past. But the sorcerer didn't mix the potion right and so Godefroy and his servant Jacquouille are being sent in the future. This leads to lots of problems, misunderstandings, some funny scenes and endless dialogues (which are supposed to be funny too).<br /><br />Considering that this is the highest grossing movie ever in France I was quite disappointed. I saw both the French (original language) and the German version of this film and wasn't convinced by either one of them. The film certainly has scenes that are simply hilarious but most of the film is rather lame. At least the music score is very good but the music always ends abruptly because of the editing. There are also a few scenes that are not logical and film also contains a very obvious (and therefore disturbing) continuity error. Jean Reno gives a decent performance and Christian Clavier turned out to be a very talented comedy actor. The film is good for a few laughs but fails to be amusing as a whole.<br /><br />My rating: 4/10
