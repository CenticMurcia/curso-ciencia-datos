Unbelievably silly, cheap, boring softerotic variation of the old INDECENT PROPOSAL-plot with the Robert Redford-character, played by quite attractive, but not really stimulating Tane McClure, offering the Demi-Moore-character, here played by untalented, but happy-to-be-here bloke Tim Abell, money, if she, er, he helps her out in her bed, while his wife Gabriella Hall wanders around in the casino. Hall is stunningly sexy as usual, but her scenes with Abell really belong to her best yet. Still, the rest is pure B-Movie Nonsense. Two points only for Hall.
