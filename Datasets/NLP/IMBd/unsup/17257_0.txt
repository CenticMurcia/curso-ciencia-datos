"Wide Awake" tells the story of young 'My name is Joshua A. Beal. I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I go to Walton Academy, Catholic school for boys ... don't laugh' (played with great feeling and sensitivity by Joseph Kross), and his quest to find meaning after the death of his beloved grandfather. 'Know what? This mission could take days...'<br /><br />Told with warmth and humour -- under the beautiful direction of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan -- this film explores life's universal questions by gently pushing the boundaries while remaining safe at the same time. Issues of pain, heartbreak, and loss are explored with compassion and tenderness. Though it may be too slow or 'good' for some, "Wide Awake" is my style of comedy.<br /><br />However, "Wide Awake" isn't really a comedy in the same sense that Shyamalan's subsequent film "The Sixth Sense", also dealing with matters spiritual, isn't really a horror. They have a deeper, more noble depth to them that can't be expressed with mere labels. They compliment each other nicely.<br /><br />Mr. Shyamalan -- you are indeed 'wide awake'.
