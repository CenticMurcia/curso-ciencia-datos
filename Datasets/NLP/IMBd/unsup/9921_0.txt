i only watched jewel in the palace out of curiosity. it was highly advertised as "phenomenal" and "record breaking" in the Philippines. i watched the first few episodes and got interested enough but a rival show got my attention more.<br /><br />but my mom, dad and brother were hooked! it finally came to a point where my mom borrowed the disk set from a friend so she can catch up on the episodes she missed. well. they were there and i had nothing else to do so i watched it.<br /><br />I'm kinda young so i thought it most probably wouldn't float my boat. but surprisingly, i saw myself waking up day after day watching at least 3 episodes of Jewel in the palace.<br /><br />it was interesting cause no one ever dislikes watching prodigies at work. and that's what janggeum is.. it's just a plus that she's really pretty and has a good heart etc.<br /><br />seriously, if i watched this on TV it would've driven me crazy. good thing for DVDs! :D the universal appeal that it claims to have seems to be in the fact that it is entertaining, educating and practically without sex and violence. a few fist fights here and there and a truckload of back stabbings, schemings and conniving but not very much blood, gore and general things-that-would-make-your-kid-hit-other-kids.<br /><br />i haven't finished the entire series but because the TV show is ending here in the Philippines, i already know what's going to happen.<br /><br />it's a great show to learn from: cooking, medicines, values and standing up for what is right.. all that blah.<br /><br />apparently, it was well researched and is based on true events.. and who doesn't like that? dae jang geum was the first (and possibly only) personal physician to the king. and that was even after a few death threats and several frame ups. mostly, it's an inspirational story about not giving up<br /><br />"She is like wild grass. No matter how you pull it, that plant will return and return." -Geum-young
