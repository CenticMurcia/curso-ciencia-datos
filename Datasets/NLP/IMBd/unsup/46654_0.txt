Well. Where can one begin? This film is not a film in the conventional sense. By estimate anywhere up to 1/3 or a half of this film is made up of stock footage and sequences from other films. Okay so it was a cheap 1980's crappy action flick but even so! Ed Wood may have gotten away with that sort of thing, but I call shenanigans! The result is a "movie" (in as much as, yes, the pictures on the screen move, but you'll wish they wouldn't!) that seems to be the result of the director/editors throwing random sections of fight scene footage at the screen in much the same way a simian slings it's faeces at its cage wall. The good thing is it is just as amusing to watch as that! It is totally devoid of plot, lacks even vestigal artistic merit, and due to the confusing and totally random nature of how it skips from scene to scene I daresay there are some people out there who think it contains some sort of message or is doing something subtle and Lynch-ian. It isn't. It's a garbled, confusing mess that barely qualifies as a film. This doesn't stop it being utterly hilarious and perfect for watching with a few drinks and mates to rip it to pieces.<br /><br />The above score is the rating for it as a film. It gets 2 stars because a) it didn't let me put in half marks and b) Nothing is as bad as "The Killing Edge". If you want a rating based on sheer (if unintentional) hilarity then go and tack another 3 stars on the end!
