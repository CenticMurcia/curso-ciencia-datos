I am an NRI (non-resident Indian) living in the Philippines, and I could completely relate with the titular ABCD in the film. Though this film wasn't great.. (too many stereotypes: the "villain" with his side-kicks, the sometimes cliched love story).. and the scene where Salim was burqa-clad during the visit of Farah's parents seemed ripped off from many other Bollywood flicks. Yet this film is worth a watch, especially by NRI's, who are just as confused as Krishna aka Kris, or know another "American Desi" like him.
