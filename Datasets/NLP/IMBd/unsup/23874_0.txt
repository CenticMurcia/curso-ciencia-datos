The story line would have been good if the actors especially the lead, Emily Shaw, didn't over act so much! What happened to her anyway?? I don't know what happened to the former baywatch girl but she looks terrible in this movie, that unibrow really needs to go!<br /><br />In this movie the main characters totally overacted making it difficult to watch! Don't waste your time with this one! It isn't worth a full "one" vote! Late night cable for a reason, no one wants to see this!<br /><br />This was one of the worst movies I have ever wasted my time watching! What teenager acts this way? Totally unbelievable! But what can you expect for low budget!
