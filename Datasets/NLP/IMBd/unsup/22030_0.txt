This one reeks of IMDb rigging. All those glowing reviews and high marks and then you actually watch this turd and it's nothing like what the cast and crew reviews say it is. Many of the 10/10 reviewers admit to being prompted by someone who worked on the movie to write a glowing review, like we couldn't tell. Embarrassingly predictable, (they've sifted through every trite clich√© they could find and distilled them all into this). Shot like a TV rom com, acted like it was shot before a live audience by inexperienced actors (ie they stick with entirely average performances rather than work them into something decent), lit for TV, scripted with a "try to please everyone" dumbed-down - syrup coated - hollow - interconnection of not really connected stories. I've seen many of these actors do much better, so it must have been bad direction that made them turn in these performances. Every smile delivered like an empty grin; every 'heartfelt' moment delivered like a it was read by a middle school drama class. For a movie who's tenuous message seemed to be "looks don't matter" (yet everyone is plastic-ally pretty) The only interesting character was forced to conform to the shallow beauty ethic by removing his individuality in order to get the loose girl. What a charming message that is, and for a movie that likes to think its so indie how incredibly mainstream of it.<br /><br />Being mediocre isn't a crime but rigging reviews in order to trick people into seeing your movie is. I would have switched this movie off after 10 mins and clocked it up to mass market rubbish, but I persisted with this one in an effort to see what all the hype was about. What it turned out to be about is a manipulative attempt to push a worse than average movie that "should have been a TV show that got canceled" past viewers who under better informed circumstances wouldn't go near this. This is not a cool indie movie, no matter how many times the bought and paid for hype team say it is.<br /><br />Maybe these people believe their own hype. maybe they think they're quirky indie cinema, maybe they think they're punk when they're really just jocks,<br /><br />Did I mention the direction was really really bad. Each scene ploddingly laid out, each emotional response labored and hollow, no interesting camera work to add any amount of impact, edited in a workman like fashion, nothing has any chance of lifting this movie apart from the slogans on Priestly t-shirts, and only then they provide a passing amusement. <br /><br />DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE PUFF PIECE REVIEWS. It's biggest crime is not that it was below average. It is that they've purposefully tried to mislead people on here into believing it is something it isn't.<br /><br />one last note, For a movie that seems to strive to be watered down Hollywood and not offend they slip in a full body nude scene out of nowhere, for no particular reason. Not that I'm offended but where did that come from and why? After watching the whole thing should I really be surprised?
