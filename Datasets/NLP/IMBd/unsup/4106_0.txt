While taking a working vacation in Miami Beach, a heartless employer (Joseph Cotten) fires a long-time associate over the phone and berates the poor fellow for displaying too much emotion and shedding tears. After justifying his decision to all within earshot, he further admonishes the fired employee with this contemptible statement: "He should have learned to control his emotions."<br /><br />Driving back to New York City, Cotten is involved in a freak accident while passing by a Georgia Chain Gang. Smashing into the prison guards and their vehicle, he is paralyzed and pinned to his own steering wheel. He is literally left for dead as the convicts scramble to make their escape. For the rest of the episode, Cotten's conscious mind and thoughts are relayed to the viewers as his horrific experiences continue. Even when the authorities and emergency workers arrive at the scene, he is still mistaken for a dead man. Finally, after spending a terrifying night alone in the morgue covered over with a white sheet, the coroner notices something that immediately tells him Cotten is very much alive. He sees TEARS running from the former heartless employer's eyes. At the conclusion, host Hitchcock (with tongue firmly planted in cheek) wryly informs the audience of the the distinct possibility that Cotten will fully recover from his injuries and most likely reinstate the fired employee. You could say he's had a life-changing experience. Of special note to viewers is a quick glimpse of a very young Aaron Spelling as an escaping convict from the chain gang.
