1. There is no way the nurse would ever go into the dark basement by herself to look and see if the problem with the phones "might" be there.<br /><br />2. Only three people left, an obvious problem going on, and they all split up.<br /><br />3. NO WAY would there EVER be that large of a facility and such a small amount of staff and residents. If funding was short, the state wouldn't bother with the operating expense.<br /><br />4. No maintenance personnel whatsoever.....<br /><br />5. No one ever hears anyone else scream...<br /><br />6. The doors would not automatically "lock down" with no alternate means of escape. That would be a total violation of fire and safety codes. Not too mention the total lack of communication with the outside. I don't care how secluded the place was, or how crappy the funding, there WOULD be other alternatives for contacting outside agencies.<br /><br />7. If the stoner was that afraid of the dark, I don't care how good the pot was, he wouldn't go down to the basement alone to smoke it.<br /><br />8. After the stoner died, everything was business as usual, no investigations by police, no safety code people, no state investigators..<br /><br />When I watch a horror movie, I want to at least have some intelligence involved.
