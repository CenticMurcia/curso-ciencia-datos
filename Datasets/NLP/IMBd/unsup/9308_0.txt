hmmm,what to say about this movie.very,very low budget.CGI that looks very shiny and nice,but completely fake.for most of the movie,nothing happens,except a lot of talking.when the shark finally makes an appearance,it is underwhelming.it does not look that menacing.there is zero tension in the movie.there are only 2 good things in this movie.one is that the acting,surprisingly,is not that bad.and 2,there are some deep underwater scenes showing some very unique and beautiful creatures.they are very obviously CGI,but they look very pretty,nonetheless.i sat trough the whole movie to see the shark.i wish i hadn't.60 minutes of boredom for a few minutes of shark footage is not worth it.it's obvious they had zero budget,so they shouldn't have attempted this type of movie.i'll give it 3/10
