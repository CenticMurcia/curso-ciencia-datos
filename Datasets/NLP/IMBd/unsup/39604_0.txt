To simply tag "Ganja & Hess" with a label of blaxploitation would be a serious understatement, as this is probably THE most ambitious 'black' film of entire 70's decade. The substance of the film covers horror, but you really wouldn't say so, as there's no explicit violence or bloodshed on screen, and the whole production relies on its dark and moody atmosphere. It's a really weird and ultra-slow film, definitely not suitable viewing in case you are looking for barbaric 70's horror. I can't say I liked it very much because, honestly, it's a super-pretentious film that goes on for far too long without actually handling about anything. I appreciate smart dialogs and subtle atmosphere as much as the next guy, but a synopsis claiming to revolve on blood addiction and passionate murder eventually must show something, right? Duane Jones ("Night of the Living Dead") gives a marvelously languid performance as a doctor who suffers from an insatiable desire for human blood, brought onto him after being stabbed with an ancient cursed dagger. Shortly after, when his assistant (played by Bill Gunn, the director) commits suicide, Dr. Hess comes into contact with his widow Ganja and sweeps her along in his strange and depressing 'vampire' universe. The acting performances and filming locations form a potent mix, but the pace of the film is truly soporific. Bill Gunn artsy attempts to disguise the lack of budget with various ingenious camera angles and sound effects, but he still can't hide the fact there's no suspense or involvement in the screenplay. Perhaps the heavily cut version "Blood Couple" is more endurable. I can only imagine some of the dialog is cut in that version, as there's no gore or sleaze to censor. It's an interesting film considering its historical background, but it doesn't hold any entertainment value.
