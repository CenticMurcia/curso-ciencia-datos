Max tries to do something to get himself out of this mess.<br /><br />Directed by Brett Ratner (Rush Hour Trilogy, X-Men:The Last Stand, Red Dragon) made an entertaining crime comedy with full of laughs and some moments of suspense. The cast seems to be having an great time, including:Noamie Harris in a nice supporting role as the local detective. Only the disappointing performance is Cheadle, which his supporting role is very thin for this talented actor. This lively movie turned out to be an box office disappointment, probably due of marketing or simply an bad release date. Because "After the Sunset" is more of an Summer Movie. This film was released in the fall instead in November 12, 2004.<br /><br />DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good:Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an interesting often funny commentary track by the filmmakers, deleted scenes with optional commentary by the filmmakers, outtakes and more. This entertaining caper will certainly plays better on DVD. It's an forgettable but extremely pleasant film from Ratner. Watch for The late Chris Penn, Jeff Garlin, Dyan Cannon, John Michael Higgins, Shaquille O'Neal and Edward Norton appears in cameos. Super 35. (****/*****).
