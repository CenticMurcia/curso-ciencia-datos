I was initially attracted to "Reflex Action" for two reasons. The intriguing plot of an under the border Mexican tunnel being connected to an Arizoina gold mine, and the presence of veteran character actor Richard Lynch. The movie has a nice grabber of an opening beneath an Iraq munitions building, and the overall photography is quite stunning. Character development of the four main characters is acceptable, and the actual mine locations look great. The film disappoints because there is really no development of the drug dealers characters, and Richard Lynch has only a very minor part. The cartoon like violence is another negative, with villains firing automatic weapons that consistently miss our heroes at close range, while our heroes guns seem to have an endless supply of bullets. - MERK
