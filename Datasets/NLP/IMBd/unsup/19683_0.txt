Grace Metalious' mega-selling "Peyton Place" (1956) made it to the big screen the following year, and came to represent small-town sexual repressions; moreover, it set a standard for a new kind of soap opera, with its characters' sexual practices pushed up a notch. Certainly, this was not the first movie to present the risqu√© themes herein; but, due to interesting characters and memorable performances, in a top-notch production, it deserves credit. The soap opera genre was greatly influenced by this film, its sequel, and the ground-breaking 1960s television series.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film whitewashes Ms. Metalious' original stories (for example, the abortion becomes a miscarriage), which sometimes leaves the characters too sketchy. Yet, the alterations are neatly accomplished, by director Mark Robson, writer John Michael Hayes, and a terrific cast. The cinematography of the Camden, Maine location, by William C. Mellor, is also outstanding. With producer Jerry Wald leading the group, they all earned "Academy Award" nominations. It is interesting that the original "Peyton Place" takes place during the 1940s - it sometimes seems set in the 1950s.<br /><br />The film successfully shows young adults' limitations relating to sexual activity, higher education, and moral attitudes.<br /><br />The impressive cast received an impressive amount of honors. There were "Oscar" nominations for protagonist writer Diane Varsi (as Allison MacKenzie), tightly-wound mother Lana Turner (as Constance MacKenzie), shack-dwelling friend Hope Lange (as Selena Cross), sensitive boyfriend Russ Tamblyn (as Norman Page), and alcoholic janitor Arthur Kennedy (as Lucas Cross). Undoubtedly, the numerous noms had some level of canceling out; and, adding to the confusion, Ms. Turner's was the lone "Best Actress" citation, though she was secondary to Ms. Varsi, and equal to Ms. Lange.<br /><br />The "Golden Globes" nominated Lang and schoolteacher Mildred Dunnock (as Elsie Thornton) in the "Supporting Actress" category; probably, they considered Turner and Varsi dramatic leads. "The Film Daily" had Lang, Varsi, and Mr. Tamblyn making "Famous Fives" lists in the "Newcomer" and "Juvenile" categories, with Lang winning in the "Supporting Actress" category. "Photoplay" had David Nelson (as Ted Carter) winning their "Best Newcomer" award for his impressive debut in a young adult role. If they had been given, "Peyton Place" might have won some casting and acting ensemble awards.<br /><br />********* Peyton Place (12/11/57) Mark Robson ~ Diane Varsi, Lana Turner, Hope Lange, Russ Tamblyn
