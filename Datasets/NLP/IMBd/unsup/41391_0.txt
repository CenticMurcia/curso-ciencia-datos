I had the horrible misfortune of changing the channel to one that was showing this "thing that should not have been made." The plot was corny, tired and absolutely unbelievable. Furthermore, Laura Preppon as anybody but Donna just doesn't work. I kept waiting for the rest of the cast of characters from that 70's Show to appear at any moment as I watched the approximately five minutes of this movie that I could stomach. She has definitely typecast herself as Donna. The male lead, Mr. El Pollo Loco, was laughable in his role as well. What were the casting directors thinking when they cast these two in the leads? Princess Leah as a blimp did not help things either.
