Emmanuelle was the first adult film I ever viewed and it delighted me. It was erotic, but it had the added element of sensuality. I believe the element of sensuality is what made it so good.... For a woman, sensuality is an important factor. The fact that Emmanuelle wasn't hardcore, nor was it nasty made for better viewing. Nor was it harsh or ugly as many porn films tend to be. Too many of the films made today lack sensuality, they are cold and obviously put on. Although,I found the story was a bit odd, it was exotic. Exotic in the setting, exotic with it's use of dim lighting. Sylvia Kristel was beautiful and natural in this film. In the world of erotica, it's definitely a classic and worth seeing.
