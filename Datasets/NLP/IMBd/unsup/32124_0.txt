This film is really not for most movie goers. The pacing is extremely slow and the acting is robotic and two dimensional. It is the kind of film that you would expect to see playing in an art gallery where it would be appropriate to only watch ten minutes, and where you wouldn't have to sit for two hours waiting for a gripping storyline that's not going to materialize. <br /><br />Fans of the genre can probably appreciate it as a parody (or may appreciate it for more complicated reasons) but it's unlikely to be worth your time if you're coming at it without the right background. Which would be most of us.<br /><br />What I did appreciate about the film was the scene and decor, the primary colours, the furniture. It's perfectly staged to mimic some aspect of the 1970s, or 60s, although which aspect I'm not exactly sure, I'm tripping out of my area of knowledge here. But it's beautifully staged and it works as a series of individual scenes just as a full length film it is much too long.
