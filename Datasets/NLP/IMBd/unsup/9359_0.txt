Practically the best remake of all time. Vincent Price's movie was good but this one adds another level to it. Jeff Goldblum is wonderful as Seth Brundle/ Brundlefly he really shows the true madness of the character while allowing the emotional content to shine through the gaps.<br /><br />This film is beautiful and even though the basic genre is horror this film plays out one of the greatest love stories played out in film history.<br /><br />In short 'The Fly' is well worth taking the time to sit down and watch be it now or in ten years this film will always be a classic.
