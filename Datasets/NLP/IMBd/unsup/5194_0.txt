Only caught a few episodes before it suddenly ended... what I did see I found intriguing and very moving at times.<br /><br />The sort of show that inspires good deeds, don't you think?<br /><br />"Heroes" does that a little bit as well - despite the frequent gore ;) Let's hope it {Miracles} reincarnates itself one day soon.<br /><br />I'm not one to watch much TV, but when I catch one or two episodes of a show worthy of my time - I'll wait for it to come out on DVD so I can catch the entire series without interruption and in proper sequence.<br /><br />Purchased entire season of Miracles on DVD for just $10 on ebay - can't wait to be inspired!
