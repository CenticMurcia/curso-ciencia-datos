This movie is yet another that has been poorly made by a fan of films, who cannot execute one properly. A film student maybe? OK, the camera work is good and the overall quality of the picture is good, but this film has no real point. The acting is terrible and this film is full of moments that will have you shouting at the screen in annoyance. Moments where the actress has ample opportunity to escape her captor but just cries and wails constantly. The worst unrealistic part of the film is where the girl gets her tongue cut out. She covers her mouth and collapses, only to be fine and eating food the next day! Surely someone with their tongue cut out in some woods and chained to a tree, would bleed to death rapidly? The movie is full of these inconsistencies and is very unrealistic and pretty pointless, solely relying on lots of fake blood and a few gory bits to carry it. I got the feeling that maybe the director has tried to make this film very arty, with funny camera angles and out of focus parts. It doesn't work. I wouldn't recommend this film unless you enjoy watching pointless unrealistic gore. Surely in 2006 we are past the need to be entertained by lots of fake blood and people having their legs broken etc? It takes more to make a great movie than cheap gore. A coherent storyline and an overall ending point perhaps?
