This movie presents the details of the Incident at Roswell very accurately in accordance with the books published on the event. Whilst the movie obviously portrays the incident to be the crash of an alien craft in New Mexico in 1947, the scene in which Martin Sheen and Kyle MacLachlan meet in the hangar I believe gives the viewer the opportunity to make up their own mind about that incident and other U.F.O. sightings in general.<br /><br />Whilst much of the movie revolves around Jesse Marcel,the government's efforts to make him look like a fool, and the subsequent cover ups, I felt the viewer was given the chance to understand why such an issue would have to be hidden from the general public. I believe the producers and director were smart to avoid the over the top, clich√©, tacky Hollywood conspiracy theory theme.<br /><br />Whilst the movie is based on the events at Roswell in 1947 some scenes that have been dramatised for the purposes of the movie are wonderfully incorporated to allow the viewer the opportunity to understand why the government would hide such an event. In particular, the scene in which a secret government committee has been set up to investigate the incident and the round table discussion that takes place. The dialogue such as, "We're here to ensure domestic tranquility, not eliminate it", "what of our religious institutions", and "what if this was to all come out, what are people going to believe" gives the viewer an understanding for why the government would shield us from such information.<br /><br />The War of the Worlds radio broadcast in 1939 demonstrates how feeble minded the human race is to the possibility that we are not alone. If suddenly we were told that yes there was a crash of an alien spacecraft in New Mexico in 1947 then the world would go into a frenzy. The beliefs of an overwhelming percentage of the world's population, in particular religious institutions who are of the view we are the sole occupants of this enormous universe, would be instantly proved wrong. To tell such a large number of people that what they have believed their whole life is completely inaccurate would have devastating consequences. The government has to protect the majority of its people from themselves.<br /><br />Therefore the information needs to be leaked slowly to allow people the chance to make up their own mind over a long period of time. That, in my view, is what is happening.<br /><br />A wonderful movie perfectly produced that has not been given the full credit it deserves. The movie is not for those with a simple, uncomplicated mind however. You need to be able to think in a complex manner. Try watching it with an unbiased view on the event and see what you believe afterwards.<br /><br />Some who have criticised the movie, in particular students from Melbourne, might be better advised to ask their teachers to try movies such as High School High, Down Periscope or Date Movie to better evaluate how a movie should not be made. Every movie made can have the s#*t picked out of it if you are watching it to do such.<br /><br />Roswell is essential viewing on more than one occasion.
