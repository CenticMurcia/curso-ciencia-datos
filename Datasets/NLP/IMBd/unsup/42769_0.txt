want to get ill on apple cider. The movie itself is pleasantly entertaining, but the ending! Gak! Bette Davis gives it all up for Bob Montgomery! Why? He's sexy, yes, but where's he been for three years and what is he offering her? It was depressing to see her standing there nodding while holding the suitcases. It's the chauvinistic Production Code in full force. I think Mick LaSalle in Complicated Women described actress Kay Francis playing a scene that called for giving up one's career for a man as a "soul death." How right! In a pre-Code, Davis would have simply said, "Well, look me up when you're next in town and we'll hit the hay. Meanwhile, I have a magazine to edit!" (By the way, was anyone else as horrified as me to see Norma Shearer throw over suave Montgomery for dorkus supreme Neil Hamilton (the Comissioner from TV's Batman series, for cripes sake) in "Strangers May Kiss"? That aside though, a cute little film with lots of comedy with Davis and Montgomery interacting with the small-town Indiana family whose wedding they have come to cover for a women's magazine. The old man and his outdoor cider jug and Mary Wickes are among the highlights. Watch if you can ignore the silly ending.
