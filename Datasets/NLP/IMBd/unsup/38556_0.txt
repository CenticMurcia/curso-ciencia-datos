This wartime drama falls a little flat in spite of a very talented cast. The rugged Robert Mitchum is in charge of evacuating American civilians in Korea, but ends up bombing refugees. War action is paced with heavy romance between Mitchum and Ann Blyth. This couple all but ignites the screen. Pretty hot for the early 50s. Also in the cast are Richard Egan, William Talman, Eduard Franz and Margaret Sheridan.<br /><br />Note:This movie is directed by Tay Garnett, whose work is better shown in THE CROSS OF LORRAINE(1943).
