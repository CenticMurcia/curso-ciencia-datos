Throughout this movie, I kept thinking that TEENAGE ZOMBIES deserved a score of 2. Then, as the film neared the end, it crossed over the border to the land of truly dreadful films--making it to the hallowed pantheon of truly horrible films, such as PLAN 9 or THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN. Yes, folks...it's THAT bad! <br /><br />The film begins with four teenagers going to an island that they just noticed was off the coast. Yes, apparently although they lived there in town their whole lives, they never knew that it was right off the coast. Well, when they arrive, they find the place is infested with zombies (though because the budget was so low, you only see one--late in the film they inform you that the place is infested with them). In addition, there's an evil scientist who is apparently responsible for turning people into zombies as some sort of Commie plot. This portion, by the way, is the BEST part of the film! When the four don't return, their two friends who didn't come along go to the police for help. However, the sheriff who is assisting the two is actually one of the mob and brings the two irksome teens to the hideout. There the six teens are about to become zombies until they have the world's lamest fight scenes in history. They grapple on the floor with the baddies like a group of toddlers fighting over a toy--it's that bad. And, when the teens actually take away the baddies' guns, they DON'T shoot them--even when the crooks once again attack them. At this point, despite having guns, the teens roll around on the floor again with the crooks for a while. Perhaps the boys just liked the "funny feeling" they felt when they wrestled with men....who knows.<br /><br />By the end, the evil sheriff and one of the baddies is dead AND a guy in a gorilla suit runs amok on the island as the teens take the two remaining baddies back to the cops. The film ends with the kids all having a good wholesome American laugh.<br /><br />Overall, the acting is as bad as it gets, the nighttime scenes were shot in broad daylight, the fight scenes were just dreadful and, incidentally, there really were no teenage zombies. Well, to be precise, they did turn two teen girls into zombies and turned them back to normal about 30 seconds later. And, as I said above, they could only spring for one zombie and guy in a $9 gorilla suit. It's sad,...very, very sad.<br /><br />If you are a fan of bad films, then it's well worth seeing. Otherwise, it's all very painful and dreary.
