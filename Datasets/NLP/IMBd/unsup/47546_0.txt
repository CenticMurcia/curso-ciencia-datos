A group of teens have the misfortune of falling prey to hoodoo worshiping occult masquerading as a Catholic school for troubled girls. The town doesn't discuss the place and we see what one villain, underneath a hood and robe, does to Trina, a member of the school trying to get away from her pursuers. Trina's uncle is out to find the real truth of what happened to her and will uncover some grisly truths he might've never expected. Anyone with information regarding the cult often wind up dead. A young male and female are actually the leaders of the cult and commit the violence towards those they want as ghostly minions to serve them. Only brother and sister, Liz & Jeremy might stand a chance against this cult, but leaving appears to be a problem as escape does seem unlikely.<br /><br />Corny, micro-budget occult thriller with the typical terrible acting and silly supernatural goings-on. The gore effects range from decent to awful according to method of death. The wood chipper death is a howler(it actually looks like the victim throws himself in!)and the hoodoo elements are really cheesy. There's even a voodoo witch and ghostly apparitions throw in the bungled mix for good measure.
