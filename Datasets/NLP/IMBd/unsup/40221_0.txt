After the brilliant First Contact adventure we shared with the crew, we get this lame story involving the Enterprise. This seems like a bad episode that was stretched into full-length time. There are no surprises here, nothing worth noting. It lacked adventure and there was nothing to care about in the plot. What a disappointment! It makes you wonder how such brilliant writing can happen within the star trek series and movies like this fall short of one hour stories shown on the small screen. I saw this in the theatre only to find that I should have stayed home! It was a video release. I wish the executives would take chances with the plot lines, not be afraid to focus on action and drama. Have an all-out battle, have some detailed fight scenes or give us a look at the things that were only mentioned in the series. If you want box office like Alien, then act like it!
