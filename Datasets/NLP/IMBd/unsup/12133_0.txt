This incredibly original film by Louis Malle has the ability to challenge the viewer into contemplation of the way they go about living their lives. Virtually the entire film consists of a seemingly recreated real life dinner conversation between two friends, and yet somehow there's not moment that fails to keep the interest of the viewer. The film deals with questions of the nature of life and the nature of the world we live in, but beyond that it captures a moment of true intimacy between the two friends in a world where people rarely really talk to each other. <br /><br />Some dismiss 'Dinner' as heady and intellectual, clearly its not a film everyone would enjoy. Still for those who realize what they're getting into (yes the whole film really is two people talking over dinner) the conversation can be truly absorbing. 'My dinner with Andre' is one of those rare films that really can impact the way a person thinks about their life.
