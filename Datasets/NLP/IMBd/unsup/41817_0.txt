This sorry excuse to waste 90 minutes of everybody's life is really a mess, made by a director infamous for other such bad efforts in the horror range. Yes, even Witchboard wasn't that good and this one is definetely worse. You have a bunch of psychics going hunting for the ghost of a vicious and very powerful warlock who has to reincarnate for getting his revenge. Among the psychics there is also Linnea Quigley (who has the usual shower scene) and she is in the finest scene of all the movie, that is overacted by most of the cast (that is not very good at it). If you mix it with one of the worst script ever to reach the screen, you have a nightmarish experience. A waste of time (and money)<br /><br />
