American Psycho 2 is a disgrace to the movie American Psycho. This seems more like a girl power movie with over acting characters then a horror thriller. Every thing about this movie sucks. It is a waste of money to rent this movie, it would also be a waste of time to download and watch it. The movies plot was written by morons. The starting of the movie shows the main character as a girl watching her baby sitter about to get killed by Patrick Bateman. Later on the movie you find out her baby sitter knew Patrick Bateman was a serial killer. Why would see be their? This does not make any sense. You will also see the main character killed one of her friends and left her in a closet in a dorm room. You can smell a dead dog from a mile away but a dead human in a dorm room right by the entrance. Hmmm. That must be a dormitory for people who can't taste or smell. Not only that, I highly doubt a scrawny girl could move bodies across campuses in a smart amount of time without any one what so ever noticing. Who ever wrote this movie should get slapped in the face. American Psycho 2 should have involved Patrick Bateman again not some girl obsessed with joining the FBI. The movie did not have any funny parts at all. It was not scary or funny, it was boring.
