I was really looking forward to this film and huddled up on the sofa with a glass of wine last night to watch it. As a horror movie fan, I was expecting something different from a British film and I certainly got my wish. While watching this steaming pile of horsesh*it, my mind wandered off to the point that I actually thought I'd fallen asleep. Suffice to say that I hadn't dropped off but suffered some temporary memory loss induced by this celluloid form of sedative. I couldn't care less who'd been killed, who was going to be killed or who the damn Djinn was. There was no continuity, the acting was truly abysmal and the plot had more holes than a slice of emmental cheese. If you're suffering from insomnia try this movie.
