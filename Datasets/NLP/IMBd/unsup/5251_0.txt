** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /><br />Blair (Prinze Jr) and Marshall (Lillard) are fighter pilots transferred to the Tiger Claw aboard the freighter Diligent, captained by Taggart (Karyo). They are given crucial information and orders that must reach the Tiger Claw quickly. The Kilrathi has captured a Navcom AI, and can now "jump" to the Sol-system and threaten Earth itself. And the human fleet is not in position to defend it. The Tiger Claw must find out what the Kilrathi plans are and delay them before they can jump into the Sol-system. Marshall and Blair, and their squadron of fighters led by Devereaux (Burrows), are central in the Tiger Claw's operations, but they are out-gunned and outnumbered by Kilrathi forces. Some non-conventional methods and tactics must be used and Blairs heritage may be a crucial part of them.<br /><br />A good sci-fi action with a nice sense in their battles. The myth of the story is nicely involved in the plot and the special effects are mostly good. However, there are a lot of plot holes and/or goofs (many concerning gravity or what should be the absence of gravity). The actors and actresses are good but not stellar, but Karyo however is very good as Taggart. Unfortunately, one must try to ignore all the goofs to enjoy this movie, and it is not all that easy, because there are so many of them. But in my opinion, it was very enjoyable.<br /><br />7/10
