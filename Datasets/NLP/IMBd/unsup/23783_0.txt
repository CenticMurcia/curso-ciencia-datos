Well, FOR A START, i have to say I've seen quite many horror films so far. and u know, i can tell it by first 30 minutes. when u cant see any dead bodies at the first 30 minutes in the movie, then, its a non-watchable film, dare! i say.<br /><br />this movie, lake dead, well, it should have been much more entertaining and gory. but it took a chance to be just normal as its title implies. JUST DEAD. the movie contains nudity and some gruesome scenes. but thats not all. I'm telling the method of death and the chase of the victim. also some thrilling moments that u can expect from horror movies. <br /><br />5 girls. yeah...not that small number, but they are too plain. not likable...just i didn't like them. and the secret, huh...its worse than the girls. i cant get it...just a family tradition? gosh, its so typical and not believable. how many times i have to be astonished by that? once at wrong turn, twice at kindred!! if u just want some plain typical horror movies, whereupon its the gem that you've been searching for.<br /><br />my overall : 3/10
