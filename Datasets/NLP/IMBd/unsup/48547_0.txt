As I was watching the show I started thinking:" What is the target audience?" It was just so stupid that even kids wouldn't get anything from it. Bananaman is made extremely cheap, it's boring as hell, and full of stupid jokes that are just so stupid that I can't even describe it. And on top of that, almost all of the "funny" elements are ripped straight off old Disney cartoons. 3 points come from the fact that usually when something is really bad, it makes it just a little funny as it is. Well, bananaman is almost below that, and it deserves credit for it.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the people who are behind this disaster, it must have been a career killer.
