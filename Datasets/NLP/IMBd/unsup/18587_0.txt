Ok, let me just warn you that this is the worst movie ever made with no doubt about it. The film itself must've been shot on a budget of about a hundred bucks and featuring nothing but locals who have acted in their whole life. The plot is about two hunters who go in the woods, dig up a grave, find an animal skull, and run out of the woods when a loud noise scares them. Afterwards, one of the hunters finds body parts showing up at his house and gets blamed for some recent murders. Now onto the films many failures. First off, it's not scary in the least bit. The overall look of the film resembles a soap opera, resulting in a very dreary boring film. Eventully, we get this wonderful devil-dog-pig-monster-thing chasing him around. Numerous plot holes ensue and we get a doctor who's voice is unexplainably odd. Some weird medievil plot twists appear late in the film throwing ya off as well. One of the lowest points of the film comes from the girlfriend's role in the film. Her constant yelling at her boyfriend for not staying home all day makes ya wait for her death. Yes, seriously she scolds him for leaving the house, and how he shouldn't work. When the time comes, the dog pig pushes her down (while she's smiling), and then rips an arm off of her. May I point out this arm is about as skinny as two fingers next to each other, and only about a foot and a half long. To end this, the film is extremly worthless. It can not be found in many video stores, so one's chance in seeing it would be from buying it. The box may say it's good, but read reviews like this one to know how bad this movie is. But then again, if your willing to pay $35 on Amazon.com for this DVD, then something's wrong with you (I bought it for $9 used and regretted it). And if the horror of this movie existing wasn't bad enough...they're making "In the Woods 2".
