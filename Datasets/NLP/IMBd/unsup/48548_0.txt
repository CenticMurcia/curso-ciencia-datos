One huge discovery every week, one week the wheel of something, the other the Holy Grail, a couples weeks some ancient lost civilization artifact in Antarctica all that combined with heavily action scenes that seemed to have been taken from Power Rangers plus bad acting, this show sucked a lot.<br /><br />I use all my strengh to see 7 episode, only because I downloaded all 13 episodes at once, but it was so bad that I couldn't see the rest, this show tried to be a lot of things, science, fantasy, sci-fi, history, action, comedy and drama, unfortunately, it was mediocre in all, the only thing this show manages to be is a waste of time.<br /><br />PS: It was pathetically funny to see the characters make some position before and after all the roundhouse kicks they made many times against their 'oh-so-powerful enemies', that bothered them everywhere, except in their 'base', funny to see how their enemies knew even their thoughts but not the location of Zond's batcave.
