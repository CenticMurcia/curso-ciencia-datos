A superficial description of the movie would be something like this: A group of very close friends, profiled as of middle-class many of whom are university students, go to a bar and get wound up being tortured in many ways by some psychopathic lowbrow blue collar backstreet mob-so how dangerous it is to spend the night outside, or what has become of Istanbul or the world, the world's gone crazy and watch your backs,and so on and so forth...<br /><br />But getting tangled up in the simple and psychologically very effective narration of the movie and downplaying what it has to say would be not reading between the lines.<br /><br />This movie is a very realistic expression of the outcomes of social stratification, poverty, and inequality on different parts of the society. In this movie, you are let into the minds of whom many like to refer to as psychopaths and see the world from their eyes. You understand their reasoning, loss of aim and the slow transformation from troubled people to those -after having been made to accept being outsiders- who have lost everything they have and thereof can do anything, regardless of any value and concept associated with humanity such as love, affection, empathy,honor,self-respect. The psychos in the movie hadn't committed any crime till the story, none was recorded a least. And the crime committed the night of the story was not planned. This alone explains the threshold concept.<br /><br />You see that they do not come out of the blue, instead they are created by the system and after having been victimized to the point of losing their humanity , they turn up in the scene to respond to all this, and their response does not have a particular aim, it is nothing but the fight for existence, the timing of the response completely depends on the threshold of the ability to stand more of it/or not. When this threshold limit is exceeded, they respond to whomever they find available. The response has a particular purpose, the declaration of existence of the self, but it does not aim at a particular person. That is why these guys, in the film, choose a group of very innocent young persons as the object of their violence.At that point, it is a matter of life or death, anyway. So they don't care who they victimize, nor where they will wind up in the end.<br /><br />The film is very successful at displaying the contradiction between the judgment of what these psychos do and how they should be regarded within the society and what that observation tells us about them.<br /><br />It is also damn good at explaining the influence of this system on different parts of the society. Without getting didactic, it just tells a non-fiction story that takes place within a relatively short time. And the lines of each character is so realistic and to-the-point that you really get sorry.<br /><br />You get the wider perspective, the individual perspective and see how they interact.This is what makes the movie exceptional. You see both sides of the story and then the whole story. And even if you knew it all from the beginning, you feel like you were reminded of something long forgotten.<br /><br />I got very sorry but I can say that this movie was one of the best I have seen in the world. there aren't any pleasant scenes, there are no adventurous elements, no effects other than blood and gore. but in terms of story and its artful cinematic adaptation, the movie is one of the richest in terms of characters, points of view, narration, expression, and most of all, meaning.
