Sad to say, the film's prediction that "they will continue to hate homosexuals" is coming true. I have just come from seeing this film at the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. Religious leaders in the former Yugoslavia have been condemning this film, because of the same-sex love story. It's hard for me to square some of the comments of critics with the film I just saw. This film speaks to the future of humanity itself. It is not just the love story between the two men in this film that matters--and it does matter, mightily--it is also the conflict between savagery and mercy in the Serbian townspeople and the Muslim protagonist. In the midst of horrific brutality, we are reminded of the immense power of compassion, love, and even sometimes, humor. This film isn't just about war, it's also about peace. It needs to be seen around the world. I hope it will be.
