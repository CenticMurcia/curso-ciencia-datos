I first saw the trailer for THE BOOK OF CALEB on the Cinemassacre.com website. The trailer had me sold from the first mention of the fabled "upper decker," so I paid for the digital download and checked it out.<br /><br />The movie delivered on the trailer's promise, and shows that this group of creative people is a group to watch. They really have the chops to do something great. This isn't your average oddity that you find on the internet, have a couple seconds of amusement, and then forget about. This is a legit movie from obviously talented filmmakers.<br /><br />If I had to compare the movie to anything else, I'd probably say Wes Anderson's work, specifically BOTTLE ROCKET. This film has a similar quirky sense of humor, a "boys will be boys" attitude, and a way of making the mundane seem epic without getting sidetracked with self-importance -- the movie maintains a great sense of humor and is never pretentious.<br /><br />There is definitely a unique voice here. Most of the performances are solid, especially for such an independent film, and the technical credits are all solidly professional.<br /><br />I'm going to recommend this one to some like-minded friends, and think it could really take off from word of mouth. Definitely worth discovering.
