Lost Things is an interesting movie! It's quite disturbing because it has a strong psychological basis. There are no gore scenes, there's almost no blood, but there's a tense atmosphere since the beginning (and the soundtrack helps it a lot, with some classical and disturbing string sounds!). <br /><br />When the first clues were given I thought: "well, I've seen this before it's another "scary movie" with a predictable end" And in a certain way it is, because the main topic of the plot it's very predictable and the viewer who pays a little attention to some details soon will understand that something strange happened in the past with these guys But when the plot is being reveled, it doesn't give you all the complete answers There are some little details that remain unclear even after the movie ends, and I appreciate this I must say! I like movies which have a complex plot and make me think, and this one did! <br /><br />There are some scenes really amazing because you have a parallel viewing over the story. It's like your screen were divided into two parts and you can see what's happening now and what happened before <br /><br />The scenario of the film is pretty nice too. The beach is beautiful and I think it was a very nice idea (and quite original too!) to transform such amazing beach into a Limbo!
