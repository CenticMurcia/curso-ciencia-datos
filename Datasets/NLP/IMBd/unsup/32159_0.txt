yeah it's horrible but considering who made it and the time it was made, it was the funniest animated film that I ever saw(the frigging orcs singing!!hahahaha!,the dream sequence of the hobbits where the orcs waved at them!hahahaha!) and I don't even think that was it's main purpose. For the story I gave it a zero rating but from a comedic standpoint it gets 10 out of 10!
