Seems the more monsters they feature in a Godzilla movie the less time the monsters are actually on screen. This one once again has aliens trying to take over earth with monsters...a whole lot of monsters. Some we have seen before (Godzilla being one of the main ones) and a few we haven't (some weird snake looking thing). All in all though this movie bogs down more than once as it seems it would rather focus on the people rather than the monsters. In one scene we are treated to these guys using some laser beam to cut something and the scene goes on and on. They show what the laser is cutting, they show the device, then they show the guy cutting and this goes on for a good bit. At the end though there is an all out monster attack as we regain control of the monsters, but it isn't much fun as it has poor King Gidorah squaring off against way to many monsters, they really should have given him an ally to help him...unfortunately, Gigan and MechaGodzilla had not come into being yet.
