Spoilers ahead: Never thought I would say it, but this movie is a failure.<br /><br />Aside from Jared Padalecki and Amanda Righetti's strong performances the rest of the cast was very amateur and clich√©d. The acting was awful and the roles were embarrassing. Danielle Pannabaker tripped through the movie with a slack look on her face the whole time as though she was bored to be there. The rest were so amateur I hardly believed them to have have ever touched marijuana or had sex before in their lives. I understand having a roundabout cast for appeal purposes (or more realistically PC purposes), but when you have the only African American character calling out his very existence in the movie, it is sad. For example: "You are going to have me pump gas because I am the only black guy here!?" A smart audience does not question nor care that there is one black man with a mostly white cast. I feel that the stereotypes in these current movies are too over the top. Cringe worthy.<br /><br />The marijuana subplot was ridiculous. Let's have massive amounts of herb growing around Camp Crystal Lake, because God forbid teenagers might actually want to go plain, old camping and not need a reason like getting high the whole time! Overkill. All the screen time with the bong was lame. The writers really take their audience for a bunch of morons.<br /><br />Considering the atmosphere of Friday the 13th (2009), you could tell we were on a set. Running in and out of the camp, with the sign overhead felt like it was some kind of amusement park! The setting was extremely one dimensional and the props made a mess of scenery. I'm sorry but Jason Voorhees does NOT collect trinkets! And for someone so obsessed with their mother, his shrine to her would have been a little more dramatic and not stuffed in the bathroom wall! This oozed Marcus Nispel's other remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and he should have went with another set designer and filmed somewhere other then Texas.<br /><br />Jason runs (a lot). A lot of people thought this to be odd. Big deal. He went the distance in Part 2. I honestly do not have any complaints about his look or performance. The filmmakers tried to put their stamp his character and have him turn lights on and seem "more human." Why try to fix something that is not broken. The new Jason was brutal, as should be. Even though I thought his kills fell short.<br /><br />Yes the kills were not exciting. I would have rather seen Jason use the same weapon over and over if he did it creatively! Instead he is using bow and arrows, poking people through floorboards! Very disappointing. It should have been more creative, more gory AND more brutal. It's a shame that for the hard R rating, the focus was on breasts and drug usage and not Friday the 13th's signature death sequences.<br /><br />One other thing. How Jason stumbles across a size extra large hockey mask and decides to put it on was laughable out loud!
