This film takes my breath away. This movie is about us ( me M and You Sweety A). I feel it and love it. The way of act of Leonardo Sbaraglia and Eduardo Noriega is so close to life, so close to our way feeling deep inside. Sensitivity, intuity, tendress, great tallent....Come dire...? This is the most beautifull movie I've ever seen. Great work of great trio - Marcello Pineyro, Leonardo Sbaraglia and last but not least ( btw first of mine) Eduardo Noriega, who remembering me in some sensitive and hot acting nature of River Phoenix. Passion. I love it. Chapeaux bas !
