This movie in my opinion was an embarrassment. In every scene there are children playing in their houses and outside even thought school was in session during the time this occurred. Not that I'm siding with the terrorists but the the terrorists in this movie were given no personality or emotion. Every scene was a passenger talking on the phone to a relative and bursting into tears. Whenever they showed the families at their homes on the ground the have a kid in their arm and there would be 20 kids playing basketball and riding bikes outside. When the passengers rise against the terrorists it is very brave but they show the passengers pouring water on the terrorists when the are down. What the heck is water going to do! It was also so stupid that the plane was shown going out of control only a few hundred feet over a farmer and then crashing. After the plane crash the movie keeps going on and on with pointless melodramatic scenes. Just more of Hollywood trying to use way too much melodrama. UNITED 93 WAS SO MUCH BETTER!
