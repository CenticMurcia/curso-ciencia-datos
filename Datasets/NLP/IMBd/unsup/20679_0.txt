A very good movie. Not terribly well-known or important but good nonetheless. It doesn't measure up to "Schindler's List" or "Uprising" but it's still a relatively good piece of work. Julie Delpy is really a very good actress and I have new respect for her after seeing this--I thought she would be forever typecast as the blonde nymphet. If you can manage to get your hands on a copy of "Warszawa", I would recommend watching it.
