Inane "plot" involving the inept duo as mousetrap salesmen in Switzerland; the studio apparently decided the film needed some romantic interest, but if you ignore that (as you should) there is some classic gags. The one with the gorilla and the piano, and Stan and the St Bernard are personal favourites!
