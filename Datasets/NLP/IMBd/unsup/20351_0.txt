This film is the epitome of good anime! It's even clean, so if you wanted to you could show it to your kids (of course they wouldn't get it, but if they like action animation, it's fine!) It carries on the quest for peace and the great battle scenes and even gives us a little of the characters' background! I may have gone a bit overboard, but I gave this film a ten!
