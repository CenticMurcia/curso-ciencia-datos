sorry, haven't seen it but I doubt I will just because of the content and the prior reviews. But just tracking down a comment on youtube ... Caroline Ellis was "Joy" on the Bugaloos kids TV show, very popular in US early morning Saturday shows in the 70's... she was cute then ... guess she was tired of looking like she was only going to act in parts for the kiddie shows ... supposedly she has full nudity in this film, front and back, according to another. Kind of like Jessica Biel when she did that stupid photo shoot to get out of her contract on Seventh Heaven - but she got a good publicist that was able to keep it from ruining her career ... But that is probably STILL not worth a reason to rent this movie. Sorry about that. LOL.
