This movie is severely underrated and was very badly marketed as a family comedy. This is a drama about trying to fit in, discovering reasons for living, true love and the human condition. Sure it has its funny scenes but it's incidental to the rest. The characters, the robot in particular, are profoundly likable (ok, with a few exceptions ;) and I won't mention how or why, but it had truly beautiful moments, both small and big. One of the movies where I identified the most with the hero and shed the most tears throughout and making me cry is very hard to do. I might love this movie for the emotional impact but I was fascinated by several other aspects including the robotics and the passage of time. Robin Williams was great in this role.<br /><br />Rating: 9 out of 10
