well, I'm a PRINCESS HOURS ultimate fan....princess hours fever! hope that there's a volume 2-3...hoping,waiting on it! i hope that the cast of the princess hours can visit Philippines ....hoping!soon! I'm hoping that someday i could see the crown prince in person...of course the princess...this kind of comment! is a big deal for me because i could express how i love PRINCESS HOURS....The cast was doing good in their role....the princess hours writer was very excellent he/she did a very nice/good TV-episode i hope that she will make another or continuation of this TV-episode...and i will wait for it.....but the most is the cast of this princess hours especially the two namely: shin the crown prince,the princess as well...I'm hoping and waiting to see them both in person....thanks
