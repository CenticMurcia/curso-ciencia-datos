The actors in this dull-witted failure of a film seem mismatched. Richard Anderson is not for one minute convincing either as a doctor investigating the strange zombie-like creature, or as a lover to the artist/love interest Elaine Edwards. Ms. Edwards is not especially convincing as an artist either, but together they start as much fire on screen as a CO2 extinguisher. Jerome Bixby's script can't decide whether to make the Faceless Man tragic hero or outright monster, and ends up doing both in fits and starts. Which goes to say that neither is done well at all. And anyone who's watched any Edward L Cahn film knows the meaning of "pedestrian" in spades. The end of the film proves just how little of a threat the Faceless Man really was to anyone, and consequently how stupid all his victims were.
