I had high hopes for this film. Having rented it I watched it this weekend, popcorn at the ready, waiting for a stupidly funny laugh-riot. How wrong was I? Id read on here that many people hadn't found it funny at all - I was actually quite encouraged thinking maybe it was just too silly or in bad taste that they weren't amused. I'm no prude, I don't think that conjoined twins are funny in general, but there certainly was a lot of potential for original jokes, after all its not a situation you come across everyday or in many movies. I can hand on heart honestly say that I didn't laugh once during the entire film, not because I found it in bad taste but because the attempted jokes were just not funny. I'm sure Matt Damon wishes he could sever all ties to this film, certainly a low point for him I believe. After some good performances and some quality films I was surprised to see his name attached to this project.
