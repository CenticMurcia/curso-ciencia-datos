Like so many movies in the great B film noir genre, "Crime Wave" is no exception. It's cut to the bone (no fat usually in the form of "star" turns). The larger A productions often get bogged down in romantic moments. At the time of their release, these films may have starred actors who were very popular and who were given romantic scenes to satisfy the audiences of their day. They are less embraced today so these moments tend to slow up the narrative. The B films just tell an exciting story. Sterling Hayden is made for the genre. One reviewer mentioned Phyllis Kirk's classical beauty. I just shrugged and said "yes, she's cute." Boy was I ever wrong and he right. I fell in love with her. She's a lot of guys' dream of the girl next door....the one you want as a wife. The rest of the cast perfectly executes their roles. This is a terrific film and now available on DVD in a great print.
