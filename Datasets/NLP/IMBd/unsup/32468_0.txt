This one was bad, but I've seen worse pictures.<br /><br />I only bought this one because Gary Busey was listed, and figured...Even if he only has a small part, it might be interesting. But I was wrong..maybe Gary did it for a friend or the paycheck alone...either way..it seems like he doesn't take this role seriously..when this is said I've seen way worse pictures...This one might have been better if they have had a higher budget to work with. Mostly I don't judge movies even if they seem cheaply done, you'd notice that if you saw my collection of DVD's. But in this case..well.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't pay more than 2GBP for this one. I was bored before I began to watch, but my boredom increased me (almost to death;-)during the movie.<br /><br />The only thing/reason why i'm giving this one 3stars is because of the beginning and the end of the movie..it starts okay...and ends in a way that I didn't expect.You do wonder how it's going to end, and look at every angle...but that's it.<br /><br />Don't think it was the actors fault,,they didn't have that much.. at all to work with.
