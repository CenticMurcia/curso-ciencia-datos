One hoped that this was all over: Euro Pudding Films. Taking cash from many countries, and in return each country has to get a reward somehow. Here goes...<br /><br />The story is a "natural" for this, involving three countries clashing. With a director and not an auteur this could have been a very nice basis for a decent movie. But the director simply struggles: Three story lines, one dimensional characters, questionable talent (Kr端ger just can't act, can't even dub her lines properly, F端rmann has been, is and will be a poser, and both of them can't even deliver proper lipsync singing performance. Rest of cast is OK, with Daniel Br端hl again a brilliant stand out; the man's just got it, presence, you now what I mean. Technical credits soso, just OK for these days. In parts very bad editing (eg. going from mid shot to mid shot with different light set up on Kr端ger, awful). BUT the movie is just BORING. I found it difficult to sit through. OK for DVD. Don't spend money on a cinema ticket. It's a bomb in Germany and now I know why!
