Odd that I've been using this "handle" online for years without having ever seen this movie. It is actually a reference to a series, of sorts, of Bob Clampett cartoons. I have actually just seen this movie for the first time this afternoon.<br /><br />So, without slipping too deep "in character", what did I think?<br /><br />Ha ha ha...<br /><br />Ha ha ha ha ha!...<br /><br />(pause)<br /><br />BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!<br /><br />This movie rules.<br /><br />Seriously though, I should be ashamed of myself for not having ever seen this movie for so long. And not just because of my username or whatever; this is one of the Essential Eighties Movies. I've seen, off the top of my head, "E.T." and "the Breakfast Club" and "Risky Business" and "Spinal Tap" and so on and so on, but not "Gremlins"?!? What the heck was wrong with me?<br /><br />But yes, "Gremlins" is good, very funny. Go watch it if you haven't seen it yet. You will apreciate it a lot more if you hate Furbies.<br /><br />Hee hee hee...
