Zenon is back, only this time with a new upcoming star, Alyson Morgan (Dasha). Being an average person that enjoys shows that are made for families, I must say the Zenon movies are very enjoyable to watch. One of the best parts of this movie was the intro to Dasha. Dasha being played as a 10 year old, really should have been closer to 12, played the part excellent. She had the "popping and bounce" as the Zenon in the first movie. So it went hand in hand. The movie as a whole had me dreaming of being young again. While watching the movie, you can tell the actors/actresses really enjoy their acting. This is a non-stop comedy and action packed movie that I highly recommend to any family. Just my 2 cents worth.
