This was by far the WORST movie I have ever seen. EVERYTHING about this movie was horrible. HORRIBLE! Besides the bad acting, the bad sound quality, the terrible directing, and the terrible editing job, what made this movie morbidly horrible was the screenplay. The jokes throughout this movie were excruciatingly painful to listen to. I think I gave a faint smile during one scene in the entire movie. The humor does not work because it simply is NOT funny...it is unoriginal, not very clever, and very elementary. What really ticks me off about this movie is that it has nothing to do with the underground hip-hop movement in Philadelphia. Hell, it had pretty much nothing to do with Philly at all. Whoever wrote this movie obviously does not live in Philly (the suburbs don't count), or has no understanding of hip-hop culture in Philadelphia. My boyfriend and I could not believe how horrible this movie was (and he is a huge film buff). We had trouble falling asleep that night.
