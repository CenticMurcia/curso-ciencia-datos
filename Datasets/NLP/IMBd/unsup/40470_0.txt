Borderline entertaining television, but anyone who doesn't think the union movement in Australia is The Bees Knees is going to be irritated. The Australian waterfront has always been a complete shambles and this series - no real shock that is comes from the ABC - is almost entirely told from the trade union perspective.<br /><br />This would have been far better if we saw a balanced side of this dispute, rather than a rehash which will have all the armchair socialists and unionists nodding sagely from their living room, without ever getting down to the nub of the issue.<br /><br />Poor form by the ABC.
