I watched this movie back to back with "Monster a Go-Go," and haven't been functioning on all brain cylinders since. The plot, or lack there of, was completely incoherent, the camera work was awful, the entire soundtrack was dubbed over after-wards and the acting was down right hideous. Did they think that psychedelic effects, classical music and nudity would be able to get this thing out of the toilet? I guess I know what happened to all of the bad acid in the 60's now, these idiots ate it and decided to make a movie revolving around a witch trying to seduce a young virgin into having fantasy sex adventures. AAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHH.<br /><br />Words fail to describe how horrible this film was. I would rather watch a documentary on the making of "Manos the hands of fate" than watching this again. Someone is definitely going to hell for having released this into the general public. I take that back, it wasn't released it escaped.<br /><br />Please, if you value your sanity, don't watch this.
