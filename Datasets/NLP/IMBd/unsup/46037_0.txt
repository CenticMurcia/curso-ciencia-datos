As a reader of EQ mysteries, and a collector of his films, I have to say that this is the absolute WORST in the entire series!<br /><br />EQ, far from being a "master detective", is portrayed as a bumbling fool who continually gets in his father's way.<br /><br />Not only that, but the background music in this film is totally UNRELATED to the action....it's as if someone off-screen turned on a radio and let it play while the movie was being shot.<br /><br />Pass on this one!
