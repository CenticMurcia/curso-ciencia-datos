Great Great Movie..... If you can stand for a gut wrenching film. It makes you almost sick to watch it. It is THAT GOOD!!! No, i'm not talking blood and guts here. I'm not talking special effects with computers. I'm talking Drama at its BEST. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. You will never want to watch it again, but you just have to. If Hitchcock was alive today and they re-released this to the theaters. It would be a smash box office hit. But ONLY if they used the original, not some remake. I hope NEVER to be put in a position as this film portrays. I hope I haven't overstated this movie. But for me, wow. Life and death at it's worst.
