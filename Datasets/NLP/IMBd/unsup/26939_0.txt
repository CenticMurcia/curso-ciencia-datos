I thought Romeo must die, Li's previous movie, was a poor scripted, poor acted, yet very entertaining movie. This one however, is worse scripted, worse acted and in fact not entertaining at all. We are to believe that in the whole of Paris, there isn't a single good cop to be found, and all go shooting around, killing innocent people and destroying entire hotel buildings along the way. And they can blame it all on Mr Li. Even in France people would not buy this!<br /><br />Add to that that the movie only shows Chinese and French people, and they all insist on talking English with the most preposterous accents heard this side of 'Allo 'allo.<br /><br />Oh, and it may be obvious that the entire FRENCH police corps uses Kung Fu in their crime fighting, of course. But in that, they're not that spectacular really, so the fighting scenes end up being pretty tame too.
