This film, along with a shoe museum and toaster museum, have raised a very interesting question for me: Could my body handle the amount of pot I would have to smoke to go to Canada? The film centers on a Gremlin-faced kid and the Grand Poobah of hockey hair, Zap Rowsdower (ugh!). Poobah Hockey Hair was member of a cult and killed the Gremlin-Faced kids father.<br /><br />SEVEN YEARS LATER...<br /><br />Nobody ages and the film goes on. There are some really cheesy chase scenes, horrible music, nausea-inducing acting, a story that is either too confusing or too boring to follow (I can't remember, I fell asleep!), and so on and so forth. Bad, bad, bad. But, on the brighter side, a very funny MST3K.
