I expected this movie to be a lot worse than it was. But maybe that was because I watched "Ghost Delivery" before it. (Anything is better than that movie.) This movie could have been so much better.I think it is suppose to be a little bit of a comedy, but it falls way short. It starts serious enough and it was going in a good direction, then I don't know what happens. The break dance scene and the fart scene just totally screwed up the whole creepy effect. I do not recommend watching this movie if you are wanting a good scare. It could have been a good scary, creepy film but like I said, I think towards the end the Pang's got tired of their own movie and just released a major brain fart. Would i say the movie is terrible...No. Will I watch it again....Probably Not.I recommend sticking with "Eye" or "The Eye 2"( I liked "The Eye 2" better than 1)If you are a fan of "The Eye" movies this movie will only disappoint you.
