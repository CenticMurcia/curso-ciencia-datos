CRAZED is one obscure movie. <br /><br />It's quite forgettable and boring but not bad. I've seen much worse than this. <br /><br />While watching it, I couldn't figure out when it was made, who was in it or why it was made. I couldn't help but feel that this movie was made in the 1970s, not 80s. The whole cast is unknown to me. And the reason why it was made is even more obscure. It's not horrific enough to be considered an all-out horror film. But it's too gruesome to be considered a standard melodrama. The characters in the movie were all annoying, certainly the woman who's looking for a room. Talk about an unpleasant character. And the killer was such a loser that it's impossible to empathize with him. The filmmaking is neither this nor that. It's very conventional filmmaking with very little personal, artistic touches to it but it's not 100% commercial filmmaking because of its low budget. <br /><br />In the end, it's like watching nothing at all.<br /><br />BTW, this film is also known as BLOOD SHED. I wonder why they called it that because there's no shed to be found anywhere in the entire movie.
