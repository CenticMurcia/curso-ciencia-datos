I was quite disappointed watching this movie because in no way does it live up to the first one. It misses the atmosphere and general feeling of Candyman that made it scary. This is not such a bad movie if you can get over Donna D'Errico's cheap acting and her lopsided nipples as well as the production.<br /><br />There is enough gore for anyone though and I kind of liked the way the director tried to experiment with white lights to create a different atmosphere.<br /><br />So maybe you should see it and judge for yourself because our opinions may be very different.
