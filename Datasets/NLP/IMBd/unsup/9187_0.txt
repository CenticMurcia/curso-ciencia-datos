For what it is, this Doc. is extremely interesting. This is what happens when years of tension finally build up, and it is all caught on film. Let it Be as a movie does little in it's approach to capture the initial idea of the "get back" project. However, in it's hours of random songs and conversations, Lindsey-Hogg, whether knowingly or otherwise, captured a compelling look inside the minds of the four Beatles. I would disagree with the notion that this film is depressing. Sure it is somewhat sad to see one of the most beloved bands of all time crumbling apart, not to mention making all of them look like the egotistical rock stars they all were. But, what happened had been building for years. This film in NOT depressing because it documents the liberation John, Paul, and George from the stiffeling Beatles. And in the end, that is all any of them wanted.
