Yes, there is a secret code in this movie (for what, I forget) but it's "E Pluribus Funk", the title of an LP by Grand Funk Railroad. I think that this speaks volumes about the quality of this film.<br /><br />If you enjoy bad sci-fi films, then look no further. This is about as bad as they come. The crew of a secret space, uh, satellite? Or something...end up being in space while nuclear war happens on earth, only to crash-land on earth sometime later...not MUCH later, but society seems to have changed rather quickly and gotten that dirty Mad Max Punk Rocker type look to it. Plus, cannibalism is in, too.<br /><br />I watched this only about a month ago & really, most of it now escapes me (except for the all-important secret code). It's pretty much ridiculous and can be taken as a comedy, although I'm relatively sure it was never intended as one. 2 out of 10, argh...
