What first hit me was that this is such a brilliant movie. Then I watched the other 60 minutes and it all faded away.<br /><br />The director of this movie has done a lot of TV stuff and will probably have to stay with that. The cast is a laugh because they are mixing good performance with old TV stars that should have retired or just stayed with TV.<br /><br />The plot is excellent, the effects are really scary. But the long drown out discussions should have been cut out to make a better flow to the movie.<br /><br />The biggest mistake they made in this movie is to concentrate on the lead character's drinking problems and if his boss is gonna believe the star characters visions again, and again and again.<br /><br />This is a pretty good movie that is obviously made fore TV and should stay there.<br /><br />But with just a little more effort it could have been a very good movie.<br /><br />It's good, but its just not making it. How ever its not a waste of time.<br /><br />But it could have been so much more !!!!!
