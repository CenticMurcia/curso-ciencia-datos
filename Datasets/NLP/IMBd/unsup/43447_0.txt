Does Hollywood even read screenplays?This is a bad movie, but can be fun if you want to count the plotholes.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT.... The first bad thing is the flashback: how can CGjr know these things? But there are more questions. Why does the writer wanted us to believe that Eric Stolt's Character is behind the trap? Why does the mask in the beginning look like the face of Tom Beringer? Why does CG jr not see that he is be framed? You can see that Marlowe, Goethe and the biker bookfan are not real persons. Why is he as a fugitive so well dressed? Why does he walk around at daylight without shaving his hair and mustache? Why the plottwist, so Eric Stoltz is no longer a suspect? Where did that came from? Why the last 2 minutes. Why is Cg jr not Guilty?<br /><br />Feel free to add a few plotholes more.
