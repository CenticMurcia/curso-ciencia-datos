I rated this show a bit higher because during the first few years it was on, I didn't know anyone who didn't watch it. Granted, most of those people were kids, we still enjoyed the show.<br /><br />The show centered around disco dancing and each episode was a dance contest where about 5 couples would compete for cash and an opportunity to advance to semi-finals and then the Grand Prix competition, where they would actually win a Pontiac Grand Prix. Denny Terrio would hand them the keys.<br /><br />Terrio, a dancer himself, was the original host. He was accompanied by two dancer assistants, collectively known as Motion (Dianne and Toni were the originals), and Freeman King, a DJ who always wore a hat that looked like a record album on his head. I think King was only there for the first 1 or 2 seasons. There would be 3 celebrity guest judges and a singing performance by some of the top musical acts of the time.<br /><br />Although it had a good run, there were a few things that really did the show in. One was the fading popularity of disco. Another was Terrio leaving the show and being replaced by Adrian Zmed in 1985. Also, probably with more focus going on music videos, I don't think they were getting the sponsorship they had in the beginning, so on a tight budget the quality of the judges and music acts began to sink. I remember Zmed himself singing a few times towards the end, for example.<br /><br />But the show was decent and entertaining during the Terrio years.
