As an avid watcher of the Real World... I was totally disappointed in the storyline and well, its characters... it was badly played out and possibly the only good part of the tv-movie... was Adam, the frat boy's face... otherwise the characters were very bland. Roland, what kind of name is that, who planned the Real World 'Challenge' was a terrible character. Bunim and Murray... that was a low blow to your Real World Wonder.
