I saw this movie twice, and both times I just sat there and wondered why they even put this movie in to production. It's totally a brute force type movie with tiny bits of emotion, and Kevin Sorbo is not a great actor, he's just strong and has a good voice. Tia Carrere (who is Miss I-have-no-career-since-I-am-no-longer-in-Wayne's_World) does not give a very good performance either, and is not good for a mean bitchy character. The movie is so typical of most action movies these days, and the only thing that sets it apart from those is that it is set back in time. Kull the Conqueror is a wannabe movie of Hercules. I'm guessing they didn't have the rights to make a Hercules movie, so they took the same premise of sorts (big strong guy kicks the crap outta bad guys in medieval times) and made this awful movie. I just laughed at it's mediocrity. The lines are so typical, and so are the fights. I give this movie a 4, only because the special effects weren't too bad.
