Make that title about ninety percent nude and ten percent Satan. Watching this slice of Eurotrash, it's pretty obvious what market the producers were going for. So, if you come across this title in the horror section and expect an exciting slash and dice chiller, look elsewhere. However, where regular horror fans will be perplexed, fans of stylish but trashy exploitation will fall in love with this offering. After seeing it (and knowing what to expect), I was made an instant fan. The film is (as mentioned earlier) full of nudity from hot Italian babes, stylishly psychedelic touches, Satanic orgies, and an overall lack of any remote coherency.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a man picking up a woman on the side of the road whose car crashed. He takes her to an old deteriorating Gothic castle, inhabited by a man who seems to wield mysterious powers and his servant girl (both of whom resemble the two travelers). There's an opportunity for subtext, but its pushed aside in favor of nonstop sleaze and schlock. As for the horror equation, the film is nicely photographed, lending a dreamlike atmosphere. It also has a spider attack, which has to be the most laughably fake monster I've seen in a film since possibly "Horrors of Spider Island". However, the main reason to watch this is the overabundance of nudity. The gorgeous star Rita Caledroni, is naked for just about the entire duration with little explanation and none really needed. She's one of the most voluptuous women I've seen in a film. For fans of this brand of trash, you really can't miss "Nude For Satan". (8/10)
