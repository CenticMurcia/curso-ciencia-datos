Clerks is a rare thing indeed a low budget (about $25,000) indie comedy that's actually funny, not in an intellectual gentle way i.e. Garden State but in a gut wrenching laugh out loud way. Made with amateur actors in many roles performances are pretty good although the odd line is fluffed this only adds to its charm. The plot is difficult to explain as its just about two guys in a convenience store and one weird day, the script is sharp with plenty of humour but clearly has something to say no matter how muddled. Jay & Silent Bob make their first appearance here but its Randall and supporting characters that have the best lines. The best way to describe this film is a slacker comedy it's perfect to watch with your mates and pizza. The only negatives I can think of are the film is a bit rough but c'mon what do you expect for 25k and anyone adverse to bad language should avoid this!! Rough, rude, ridiculous and seriously funny 8/10
