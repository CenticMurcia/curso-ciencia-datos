Predictable plot, poor direction, poor acting, and a number of logical errors make this film a disappointment. The redeeming quality of this film is in its usefulness as a training aid for dramatic criticism and showing the neophyte film producer how to make mistakes.<br /><br />While the potential of the premise of this film would make any attempt worthwhile (and has done in serials such as Medium or Ghost Whisperer) the film didn't achieve what it might have. This was also a disappointment.<br /><br />If it sounds like we're disappointed, we were. We stuck it out simply to see if it could get worse. In fact the show became a means to "spot the disaster". Not really what we were looking for when we started watching.<br /><br />At least in real life the girl got the guy so, perhaps, not a complete waste of time.
