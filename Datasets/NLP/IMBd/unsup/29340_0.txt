I am not a big fan of vacanta mare's humor. I much rather prefer divertis, but the movie itself is indeed not bad all things considered. It has been far too long since a straight romanian comedy was made. The director is american and this was definitely a plus. The trademark vacanta mare humor is toned down a few notches and the result is a spoof that is funny at times, hilarious at others and flat here and there. All in all it was above may expectations, and certainly better than the last few AMERICAN spoofs I've seen.
