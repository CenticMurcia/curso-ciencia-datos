I am going to be brief about this horrifying series, let me begin by stating I am a Christian, so I hold no kind of vendetta against the morals portrayed.<br /><br />Let me explain my feelings about this show in one sentence: This is an awfully acted, horrifically directed, terribly written, atrociously misinformed, horrendously uninspired "series" that deserves to have a warning on it to keep unsuspecting families from renting it.<br /><br />That is my one sentence review, there you have it.<br /><br />NOTE: This series does not reflect what Christians enjoy to watch, quite the contrary really.
