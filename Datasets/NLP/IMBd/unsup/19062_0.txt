It sounds interesting but don't bother. Jean Reno plays a French investigator of unusual, you can say illegal, methods who teams up with a younger, better looking cop to track down a terrorist gang. The gang is referred to as the "wolves" and they are skilled assassins who seemingly best every opponent they face. Dead bodies are turning up everywhere and the police are stymied. There is a convoluted plot with people being brainwashed and having their identities stolen, all to provide cover for the wolves. The latter are trained, it seems, in the Mideast. Reno, now a baguette-bellied and aging actor, seems unconvincing in this role. He plays a wine swilling, street/terror-wise, hard-nosed crime fighter. But his age and girth don't suggest an agile pugilist...oh well, it's a movie. They spent a little money making this flick, but ultimately it doesn't quite pass the test, even for a standard thriller. I can only recommend to the bored and hard-core Reno fans.
