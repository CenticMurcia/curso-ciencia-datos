When Martin Scorsese deigned to adapt Edith Wharton's novel "The Age of Innocence" for the big screen he obviously saw it as a highly stylized period piece. THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is a meticulous, beautiful film with glowing production values and a pallet of production techniques not seen since CITIZEN KANE. Although a stunningly beautiful film to watch, the story detracts from the Edith Wharton novel. The narration by Joanne Woodward is jarring at first, yet gives the modern viewer an idea of 1870's New York City mores. <br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis plays Newland Archer with strong conviction and virtue. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Countess Olenska seems a bit modern in this otherwise fine period piece. Scorsese's camera deftly flows through ballrooms and mansions effortlessly, giving the film a broader scope visually. <br /><br />I watch this film over and over when I need a break from the mundane films that are pumped out on an assembly line known as Hollywood. <br /><br />Although lacking in story and substance at times, it has some great supporting players, such as Brits Miriam Margolyes, Michael Gough, Jonathan Pryce, Sian Phillips,and of course a wonderful bit by the great Alec McCowen as the snobbish aesthete Sillerton Jackson. <br /><br />I highly recommend this film to the discerning viewer.
