Both "Steamboat Willie" and "Plane Crazy" are timeless classics. Personally, while very entertaining, due to its somewhat minimal story, I didn't find it as much as a classic. Still it has held up well, with some nice black and white animation, plus the music is absolutely wonderful here, particularly in the sword fight between Mickey and Pete. Speaking of Mickey, he is so cool here, he smokes, dances the tango and challenges others to sword fights. Minnie is also quite hot, and Pete is suitably villainous. Walt Disney does a great job with the vocals, making the most of the little amount of dialogue he has, as a vast majority of the cartoon is driven by visuals and music. All in all, entertaining and worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox
