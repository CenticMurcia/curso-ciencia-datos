This is a must see for any Russian film lovers; or rather, anyone who enjoys something with spice. Fast, slick dialogue, w/ sexy characters, it is more than just a one night stand. In fact, it sits on my shelf. Film techniques are interesting too - borrows a little from Russian Arc and also, a little from Stalker (of which I've only seen a little - unfortunately). Perhaps the most amazing part of it, is that it takes place only in one day...? Also, it makes you want to jump onto a plane to Russia. It's not that it shows romantic landscapes or a wholly 'pretty' view of the country; quite the opposite. It shows the dirt alongside the rich. Thieves and students. Everyone. The colours are grand. The rain is even grand.
