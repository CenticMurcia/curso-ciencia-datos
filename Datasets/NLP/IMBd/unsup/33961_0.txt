This is really stupid to make people laugh without respecting other's religion....... This is unrespectable show... Muslims aren't like this They live in SAND houses!!!!!!!!!! how dumb, come on people... i can't see this is a funny show at all, i even watched a million little fibers episode and it was not funny at all... they didn't respect Oprah's character and they made fun of her, i just wonder why we laugh to something while other's cry when they watch it... u know y i cried simply because media shows Americans and the whole world another face of Islam...a face they created especially for them. this in not our religion, our religion is much higher and spiritual that makes your soul to fly into another world... it's a pure religion leads your life to perfection, and if you don't believe me, please just turn the TV off and go on, order books taking about our religion, let yourself judge not others judge for you
