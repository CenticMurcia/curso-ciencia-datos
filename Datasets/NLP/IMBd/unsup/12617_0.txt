The best of the four Matt Helm films featuring the most entertaining plot, and the greatest number of beautiful women.Dean is funny as hell as usual, but it's Sharon's film all the way. Revealing a naturally funny comic ability, Sharon is an adorable doll, clad in unbecoming clothes and non-flattering eye glasses, before revealing the legendary Tate beauty in the memorable final scene. This film, along with Valley of the Dolls, revels the enormous potential of the tragic beauty.All in all, a good show.
