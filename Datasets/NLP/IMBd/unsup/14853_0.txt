I was dismayed and confused by the fact that Fox canceled the series after the 3rd (yes, THIRD) episode.... But, I've told my wife several times that the only show I ever liked that ran more than three seasons was X-files. Unbelievable that people will watch an "Animal Psychic" and keep her on the air for two years (and still counting), but a great show like Harsh Realm dies such a premature death. Even the repeats on FX were in a dead time slot, and the so-called "Series finale" didn't wrap up anything... It just ended. It was pretty obvious to me that Fox pulled the plug VERY rapidly on this show. I'm also surprised that no other network picked it up and continued it...
