Easily one of the most misguided projects in film history by virtue of its dogged determination to site the camera itself as the first person narrator point of view. How could the producers have sat through dailies and not realized the "concept" did not work. In fact, hardly a scene goes by that is not unintentionally funny. Demonstrates conclusively the absurdity of first person p.o.v. in film.
