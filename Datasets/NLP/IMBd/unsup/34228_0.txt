Every so often you get a sequel to a really good movie that is even better than the original; sadly this is not one of them.<br /><br />The gags are more crude than subtle, and stretched till all the stupid people get them, to the point of discomfort, and redoing the VCR gag that was great first time round was a crime against comedy.<br /><br />I loved the first film and after waiting 15 years to catch CS2 I have to say I was disappointed. The start is slow and bogged down by domestic issues that did not contribute to the plot in any meaningful fashion.<br /><br />CS1 was uplifting, CS2 is a predictable repeat and subtracts from your fondness for the characters as they discover greed.<br /><br />Thankfully Jack Palance lived on to make a few more films after this for us to remember him by, may he rest in peace.
