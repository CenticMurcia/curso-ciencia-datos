***Some Spoilers*** Okay, I don't really know what the other reviewer was on about, this is a human story about two lonely guys with issues regarding their self esteem, sexuality and place in society. It is not sensationalist, nor particularly exploitative and it is based on the true events. Wishing to watch, or even make a film about a gruesome murder, does not mean you necessarily have a sick mind.<br /><br />The problem I have with Grimm Love is the pathetic back story of the American student. Why does a very strong and intriguing story about two German men need to be framed by, and told through the eyes of, a fictional, attractive female American? Well, the answer is pretty simple I guess, she'll look good on the poster and in the trailer and give the film some chance of success in the US. However, this is a MAJOR flaw of the film.<br /><br />This character adds absolutely nothing to the story and only serves to waste about 20 minutes of screen time which could have been cut completely from the film or used to go deeper into the actual story of the two men. Not only is this character boring and unnecessary but she acts irrationally throughout the film.<br /><br />For example, she breaks into the house where the crime occurred - this was highly unconvincing and only served as a means to start some flashbacks to the actual events. Secondly, she is able to locate the actual video of the crime, which has never been found, even by the police, by posting a single message on a cannibal website! This was so laughable it was beyond belief. This lost video must represent something of a holy grail to the cannibal community so the idea that an outsider can simply stick a request for it on a forum and be sent a copy free of charge a few days later is ridiculous.<br /><br />It's a real shame about these elements which surely anyone with even a basic understanding of script writing could have pointed out would scupper an otherwise serious attempt at film making.
