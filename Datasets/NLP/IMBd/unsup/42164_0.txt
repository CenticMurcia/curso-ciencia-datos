Should have PG13 rating instead of PG. Was watching with a 11 year old. Did not know of the nude scene. Did not appreciate this. Would be nice if you let us know with the 13 rating. It is very important that as the movie industry your try to help us do the right thing when there are children involved. We are doing our best to raise good kids. Help us by at least using the Pg13 rating correctly. I know you think nudity is cool. I know you think it sells Movies. For some of us we would like to watch<br /><br />a movie with our children and not be embarrassed.<br /><br />Apparently you can't count either. Do you not want to submit this because it is negative.
