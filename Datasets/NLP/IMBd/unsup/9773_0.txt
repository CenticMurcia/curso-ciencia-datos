Is it just me, or is this movie basically "Event Horizon"? It makes me wonder if Paul Anderson saw this movie as a kid and then subconsciously recreated it later. A crew of expendable caricatures head for deep space in a mysterious and uniquely experimental vessel which is secretly both sentient and malicious. The evil spaceship begins to throw spooky vibes and lethal accidents at them in equal measure, and a guy who is very "in tune" with the bodiless lurking evil gradually becomes obsessed and consumed by it, eventually graduating into a full-blown zombie possessee. He is killed in a messy, disfiguring way and yet because he is the ship's puppet/mascot he comes back again and again. Eventually what's left of the hardy crew manages to circumvent the "evil core" of the ship and explosions ensue. Does any of this sound familiar? It makes me wonder if EVERY contemporary genre film has its own obscure eighties counterpart that nobody remembers.<br /><br />-H
