I was excited to they're going to make a movie about heavy metal violence but I did not enjoy this movie at all, while it was slightly a bit enjoyable, overall I was highly dissapointed in it, I wish that they would focus more on the metal bands than the government.<br /><br />1/10, the only reason why I give it a 1 instead of a 0 is cause it had some slightly enjoyable parts.
