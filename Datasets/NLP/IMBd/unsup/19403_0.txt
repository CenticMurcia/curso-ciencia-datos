Mildly entertaining but only for Hopkins on screens. Rest of movie was dreck. Subplot with the corporate law firm was a complete waste of time.<br /><br />I didn't understand why Crawford fired the pistol through the window. What was the purpose of that and didn't this provide ballistic evidence when those bullets were retrieved? Now the big holes...<br /><br />Crawford had to check the make of the Nunally's sidearm well in advance to purchase an identical pistol.<br /><br />Is it possible that Nunally might have noticed a difference between his personal sidearm (nicks, scratches, general feel) and the "identical" replacement weapon? Why didn't Nunally (or anyone else) think it unusual that the murder weapon was the exact same pistol that he himself carried? How did Crawford know that his wife would not have divulged her identity to Nunally at some point in their liaison? Assuming that the only ballistic evidence was in the wife's head, how could Crawford know in advance of the shooting that it would not simply pass thru, at such close range, or that the bullet could not be surgically removed or that his wife would not have died from the shooting? Any would provide ballistic evidence that Nunally's pistol was the murder weapon.<br /><br />The big, big hole. How did Crawford know that Nunally would be the officer arriving on the scene? Is he the only homicide detective in town? It all falls apart if anyone else shows up.<br /><br />Raised by Gosling, but unanswered in the plot, why did Crawford remove his wife from life support when he could have simply left the country for good as a free man.
