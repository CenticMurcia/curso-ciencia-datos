The tenants of a Manhattan apartment complex have many things to worry about. Their apartments are old, falling apart, and now the city has allowed a developer to evict them in order to build a new skyscraper. These are hard working people who have little going for them except for the fact that they have some honor in who they are and how they try to live their lives.<br /><br />Clutch (Nick Damaci) is a former boxer who is the "big brother" of the building in that he tries to look after everyone's needs. Tenants such as Kay (Bo Corre) and her son Otto (Javier Picayo), Peter (Antone Pagan) and Charlie (Larry Fleishchman), in one way or another benefit from having Clutch around. When Clutch learns that his daughter Casey (Kim Blair) is returning home after a tour of duty where she was wounded, there is another dimension added to Clutch's responsibilities. Though we never learn exactly what happened to Casey and how that affected her relationship with her father, it is apparent that the relationship is strained even though there is still love between the two.<br /><br />On the day that Casey returns home a series of news reports are broadcast around the city. Reports of rat attacks where people who are bit develop a strange sickness soon begin to spread along with rumors that the city is finding itself unable to deal with the threat. Clutch, however, is more concerned about trying to create a welcome home party for his daughter while Kay in particular seems more concerned about trying to capture the attention of Clutch himself. Other tenants and those not affected by such reports pay little attention to the growing crisis.<br /><br />When night falls the terror begins. For reasons unknown (and Mulberry St. never attempts to explain), those who were bit begin to turn into carnivorous beasts themselves who resemble rats. The whole city is soon under siege as the infected spread the disease or destroy those who fall into their grasp. Clutch, Kay, and Casey witness the horror that ensues when bodies are ripped apart and fed upon as once normal humans turn into vermin themselves scavenging for scraps of meat. Others such as Charlie experience the nightmare of being trapped in their own home with nowhere to escape.<br /><br />Mulberry St. isn't really a zombie movie so comparing it to Dawn of the Dead or another movie of the same theme wouldn't be fair. However, it does hold its own even if there are some gaps in the plot that could have been filled in. For example, what happened between Clutch and Casey? What happened to Otto once he was captured by soldiers sent to clear the building out? The questions are never answered but in the end they don't affect the outcome of the movie.<br /><br />One of the better "8 Films to Die For", Mulberry St. is an example that low budget horror and suspense can work.
