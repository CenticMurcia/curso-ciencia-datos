When Walter Stevens (Lionel Atwill) receives a threatening letter from a mysterious killer known as The Gorilla, he calls in a team of detectives to help protect him and his family. Unfortunately for Mr. Stevens, he's hired the Ritz Brothers.<br /><br />The Gorilla does have a few things going for it Â– a big, old, dark house; a terrific thunderstorm; and a lunatic killer. The cast features the always entertaining Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi. They're both good, but I can't help feeling sad that by 1939 Lugosi was already reduced to playing butlers and servants in supporting roles. Ah well, he's still enjoyable. And when The Gorilla focuses on the mystery/horror elements of the plot, it's pretty creepy and good. The problem is that there is far too much lame comedy in the mix. First, Patsy Kelly who plays the maid, could make Una O"Connor look quiet and demure in comparison. She's loud and annoying. Second, and more annoying than Kelly ever dreamed of, are the Ritz Brothers. These guys are about as funny as fingernails on a chalkboard. I can't believe anyone ever found them entertaining. They're broad, over-reacting style of comedy plays on my nerves real fast. They completely destroy whatever atmosphere The Gorilla might have had going for it.
