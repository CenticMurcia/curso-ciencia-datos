I'm a zombie fan and this movie was just BAD. I even fast forward some parts when they where running.<br /><br />I didn't look at all the votes only the first ones and those said it was good. I learned a lesson that always look how many voted and also read all votes. There are so man other good Zombie movies out there then this one. <br /><br />They often use effects like 3 small windows instead of a big one some times and that ruined it a lot.<br /><br />Acting bad, story bad. I liked the last scene at the end. That was nice.
