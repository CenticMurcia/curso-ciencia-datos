I generally don't watch movies these days, due to the age (68) and not very good health. But when on very rare occasions, I get a chance to watch a movie and to my luck, it turns out to be a master piece. In this process, first I watched Page 3 (by Madhur Bhandarkar), and then Satta (again by Bhandarkar) and after viewing these movies, I realised that I indeed was missing some thing in life. Last night (8 July), I happened to watch Dev (starring Amitabh Bachchan, Om Puri and Kareena Kapoor) and realised how great director Govind Nihalani was. After watching such great movies, one feels that there is no dearth of good talent in the country. Amitabh Bachchan and Om Puri are great assets to the film industry in India and their work needs no introduction or word of praise. Om Puri is such a versatile actor that to compare him with the acting skills of Amitabh would surely be doing injustice to both of them. After watching the movie, one feels ashamed to be living in India where religion always plays a dirty role. But India is not the only country to suffer from this malice. The late Amrish Puri (as Chief Minister of the state), exhibits his acting skills in great style, though his role is very small. Kareena Kapoor though still very young, plays the role of a matured person and quite admirably. I wish every one who has not watched this movie, to do so at the earliest.
