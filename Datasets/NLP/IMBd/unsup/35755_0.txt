This could very well be the worst movie ever made. It is beyond me why there are so many people that have positive things to say about this truly awful piece of film.<br /><br />Let's get something straight, I don't think it's "awful" because it's violent. I think it's awful because it was made by a bunch of hacks.<br /><br />Just go up to the actors listed in the film to see what they've done after this movie was made in 2006. It looks like only two have gone on to do other things. That's because the acting in this movie was an abomination. You could use this movie in film class to show young directors how to NOT get good performances out of their actors.<br /><br />First of all, the casting was atrocious. They couldn't find a less threatening guy to play the antagonist then they one in the film. He looked like the small doofus that played the little guy on the chain gang in "Oh Brother Where Art Thou." And we're supposed to believe this guy has been living in the woods when he's wearing clothes that looked like they were freshly bought off the rack from some new Western store. The woman, "Hope," looked like an ugly Baby Spice. Why anyone would want to kidnap her is a mystery. Jeffrey Dahmer took better care in picking victims than the evil guy in this movie.<br /><br />Second of all, the character development was none existent. Let's forgo the third-of-all and fourth-of-all and just rattle some more off here.<br /><br />There were scenes where the captive could easily get the chains off by lifting them over her head. The first scene had a woman go through torture to stay alive only to kill herself when she got through the hard part. The movie took place over a month yet they looked just as clean at the end of the movie than they did at the start of the movie. The school girl victim was the most annoying character ever. I was begging for her to die. The ending was retarded.<br /><br />The movie was typical Euro movie making: Don't explain anything, just film a bunch of stuff and play it off as being artsy.<br /><br />It's like these Japanese horror films. They say they don't like American horror films because we have to explain everything and we have to exact revenge on the antagonist. I say, it's lazy screen writing to not provide back-story and a resolution.<br /><br />Avoid this movie at all cost. If you see it in the store do us all a favor and burn it. No eyes should ever witness the abortion that is Broken. I'd like to spit in the directors' faces for being such hacks and somehow getting a bunch of moronic fans to back their lazy garbage. Go screw.
