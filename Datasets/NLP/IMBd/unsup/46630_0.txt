This is extremely aggravating. Michael Pitt is a terrible actor, sorry, but it's true. I didn't even find him in the least bit attractive. He looks like a pathetic, greasy emo kid. He plays a man who travels out to Japan to obtain silk worms, while his beautiful wife is left at home. In the mean time, he somehow manages to fall in lust with a Japanese chick. They never really talk or screw each other, though. Instead, she offers one of her fellow Asian girls for him to sleep with. <br /><br />He doesn't appear to feel guilty over his choice to cheat on his wife. Overall, I'd have to agree with what a lot of others have written. It's terribly boring and mostly about the Asian fetish stereotype that Hollywood loves to put out and impress upon Americans. He has a perfectly beautiful, smart, and loyal wife back at home, but all he wants to do is submerge himself into the sexual lust over the ever-silent, "love me long time" girl. This story has little to do with "love", but mostly just lust and infatuation. It just makes the movie all the more pathetic and uninteresting.<br /><br />This was not worth the money I spent to rent it, even. I'd suggest another movie if you're looking to watch something in-depth and interesting.
