While it is true that Nail Gun Massacre is a true insult to celluloid due to its lack of anything remotely well done, well acted, well framed, well planned, well edited, etc., I've found that if you pretend it is intentionally bad, it starts to have some redeeming qualities. The one-liners are so lame and include horrible puns, and I laugh like a mad man every time I hear them. The killings have absolutely no element of surprise to them; you're given at least 30 seconds of warning before the soon-to-be victims see the nail gun killer, and once they've seen him, he usually interacts with them in a poor, poor manner that would not be intimidating. While most slasher film fans don't really care about getting into characters and just want to see each and every person killed off, I find that I like to select a few characters to root for each time, hoping they make it alive. With the exception of the doctor and the sheriff or whatever they are supposed to be, it seems there are no constant, recurring characters in this film. When you are introduced to a character, that means they are toast. Great way to make you care about the characters and have a reason to care if they are dying, huh? Still, this movie is perfect to sit around with a couple of buddies, play drinking games if you like, and just laugh at all of the bad lines, unnecessary nudity, and hilariously bad special effects. 10/10 just cuz I can't bring myself to not plug this piece of snot.
