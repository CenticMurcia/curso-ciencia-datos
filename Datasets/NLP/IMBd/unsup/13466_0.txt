Who would have thought an 8-minute cartoon could produce such emotions? At first I was sad and really felt the depression when sweet little Porky's heart is broken. Porky takes some drastic measures, and ends up dreaming about his life with the girl he wants to marry, but doesn't want to marry him. It is funny, and then heartbreaking if anyone's life would turn out like his dream. Porky then wakes up to decide whether he still wants his dream girl. I truly felt sad for Porky and understood his decisions. I was angry at the girl, Petunia Pig, for she was only using Porky and breaking his fragile heart. The cartoon, in only 8 minutes, makes the viewer think about his/her own life and suggests that you think about big decisions in your life before making them. Perhaps the sweetest moment in cartoon/film history is when Porky goes to see his dream girl and she laughs at him. He walks off her front porch only to first turn around and kiss a plate with her name written on it that is displayed by her front door. Porky then walks off heartbroken. What a greatly sad moment.
