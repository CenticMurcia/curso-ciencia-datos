The film is not all bad, it has it's charm but the good parts are too few and far between. The acting is generally very unconvincing, still Bai Ling and Alec Newman are more or less OK most of the time. Parry Shen is awful and overacts all the time, a shame since he has a big role in the movie.<br /><br />The story is weak with terrible plot holes. The emotional development is rushed and very hard to relate to. Bai Lings hard core assassin with a yearning for romance feels like two characters pushed into the same person.<br /><br />The CGI is very sub-par for a movie made in 2007, I've seen Xbox 360 games with more realistic graphics.<br /><br />The movie seems to rely entirely on Bai Lings push-up costumes and she is heavily exploited throughout the movie.<br /><br />The worst part, however, is the pretentious artsy cuts and slow scenes that wants to make this movie into a cult classic, all of which feels embarrassing considering the apparent weaknesses of the narration, pacing, acting and CGI.<br /><br />Watch it if you're a sucker for the genre, like I am. But keep your fast forward button handy.
