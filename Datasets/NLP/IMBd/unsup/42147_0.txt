"Brian Herzlinger is an inspiration to anyone who..." wanted desperately to be famous. Seeing this film at HBO Comedy Fest, I did not understand how these guys did not get served with a lawsuit. Probably knowing a thing or two about law, they jumped through as many loopholes as they could to use Drew Barrymore's image. <br /><br />Another issue I had with it was the fact that this film not only uses Barrymore but makes her an object to be desired. Is Barrymore a thing to be coveted? Does it not matter to this schlub that she actually has a boyfriend? <br /><br />If anyone needed a gimmick it was them. And they used it. But judgig that, after the fests, it only lasted a weekend in already limited release, the gimmick does not work on audiences.
