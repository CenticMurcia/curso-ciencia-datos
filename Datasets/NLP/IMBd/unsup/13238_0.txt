"Red Sun" is a very enjoyable film. I can't really think of any other films where a gunslinger and a samurai team up to fight the bad guys. Westerns have often imitated the great samurai films, such as "The Seven Samurai" and "Yojimbo," so it is especially satisfying to see Toshiro Mifune, the greatest of all samurai actors, in a western.<br /><br />The plot concerns the teaming up of Charles Bronson and Mifune in their quest to catch up with the film's slimy villain, Alain Delon. I guess teaming up is the right word even though Mifune has actually sworn to kill Bronson if he doesn't work with him. So most of the movie is Bronson trying to escape Mifune's character. Of course, the 2 men eventually bond, and find out they are much more alike than they initially thought, and end up fighting alongside each other in the film's wonderful climax.<br /><br />Charles Bronson shows a good sense of humor in this film, an element lacking from most of his other films. Toshiro Mifune, who is simply one of the world's greatest actors, is not required to do much, but I enjoyed seeing him teamed up with Bronson. Watching 2 of the world's great superstars in the same film is all the reason anyone should ever need to see this satisfying samurai western.
