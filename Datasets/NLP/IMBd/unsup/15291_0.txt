If not for the special effects and the sets, I would have given this movie not a 3 but a 1. There's hardly any explanation what the story or the plot are about. I have seen the whole movie and I really have no clue why this movie was made. Or what this movie was about.<br /><br />Weird combination of plot less Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Star Wars, Galaxy Quest, Stargate, Starship Orion, Starship Troopers and a whole lot of other space opera with space fights, silly uniforms, actors who have no idea what role they are supposed to be playing or what the texts mean they are saying. Technobabble galore... (even the subsonic).<br /><br />The end was weird, was it an end? What happened there? It was a clueless ending. One thing was clear though: it was supposed to be followed by a TV series. I'm glad it wasn't.<br /><br />I lost 85 minutes of my life. No idea why I did that.
