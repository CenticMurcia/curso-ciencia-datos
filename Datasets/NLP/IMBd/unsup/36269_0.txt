This could have been a good film if it had a good director and someone to edit the script. Writer-director Joe Carnahan is a little too enamored with his Tarantino-like dialogue, a little goes a long way. Some of the acting is good, I like Carnahan and Dan Harlan as Danny Woo, but other times it is painfully low-budget. I give the film-makers credit for coming up with some visually interesting ways of filming the violent shoot-outs. Overall, the good bits are just a little too few and far between to make this really enjoyable.
