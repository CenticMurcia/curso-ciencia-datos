I hadn't seen "The Six Million Dollar Man" for 30 years, and it was fun to watch this episode for awhile, hear the sound effects of Lee Majors doing his bionic stunts, etc., and letting my children have a good laugh at what passed for entertainment in my own teen years.<br /><br />However, this initial fun turned quickly to boredom once the inane plot began to develop about 15-20 minutes into the first hour of this two-parter. We sat through it, hoping it would get better, but nothing doing.<br /><br />How the IMDb fans rated this a 7.0 out of 10 is beyond comprehension to me, but obviously not everyone enjoys the same kinds of entertainment.<br /><br />I was pretty fascinated with the TV series back in the day, but watching this revealed to me just how cheesy it all was -- not just the wooden dialogue and acting, but the sets and script-writing as well.
