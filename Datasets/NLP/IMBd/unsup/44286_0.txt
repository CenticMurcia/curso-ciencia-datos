Final Fantasy VII does not have much going for it. It is exceedingly bad for a Role Playing game. It's even worse when you consider the fact that is part of the Final Fantasy series of RPGs, which are noted for their excellence.<br /><br />First of all, the story, which is the most crucial part of any RPG, is not only stupid and boring, but it has numerous holes and is completely mundane. The plot does not drive the game, it only bogs it down.<br /><br />Secondly, the gameplay ruins any fun you might have with the game. It robs the characters of any individuality they might have, and reduces them to blobs of polygons, only differing in color and shape.<br /><br />Finally, the worst feature of Final Fantasy VII would be the character development. Most characters have very little, if any, substainial development. Others, like the main character, are developed in a fashion that makes you want to hate that character. The impact of the quality of the character development(or lack there of) can truly be seen when compared to the game's predecessor, Final Fantasy VI, which had excellent character development. FF7's character development leaves a void which bother the player throughout the game.<br /><br />Overall, this game is not worth the $20.00 one would spend on it, unless that person is easily pacified by albeit excellent visuals. However, sadly enough, visuals are the last basis of judgment for RPGs, which makes this game a total bust.
