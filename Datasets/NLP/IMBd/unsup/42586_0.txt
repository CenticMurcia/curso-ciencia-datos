As a fan of Lovecraft I thought it was an interesting concept to tie some of the madness from the story of the Shunned House with 2 other stories from Lovecraft & the low budget film setting never bothered me. One of the elements of Lovecraft's stories that work so well is setting up the mood for the story, which gets shot apart in this film. You start getting into the tale of the what's behind the strange music from the violinist (in The Music of Erich Zann) and then a couple minutes later you're in present day, wait a few minutes & then you're off again to the story revolving around the mathematician (in Dreams in the Witch House). I think that the movie might have done better if the present day investigators introduced the Shunned House & then started to tell what happened by showing the complete piece on Erich Zann, a little bit more of the Shunned House, the whole piece on the Dreams of the Witch House & then let the Shunned House story finish off the movie. It's good that someone else is making adaptations of HPL's other stories but filmmakers should look to Re-Animator, Dagon or The Resurrected on how to do a singular film on HPL's stories or do an anthology film.<br /><br />And for anyone who watches this film, the strange singing melody in the film is from Danny Elfman's music in the movie Sleepy Hollow.
