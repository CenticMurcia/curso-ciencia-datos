Indeed this film did have it's entertaining elements, but that's because I'm a football fanatic. Indeed, I've just contradicted myself, but it just patronizes you at every football-based moment. Of course this at the end of the day is merely a sport film, so no plot is expected. The storyline-- well it goes with the clich√© dilemma of whether he should go for love or sex appeal. In addition he randomly finds out about some secret family. Well this lack of originality can only rival Christopher Paolini. And to cap it all, they come back to win the champions league. A tantalizing twist which no-one saw. Period. That was sarcasm.<br /><br />*** Oh, and the fictional player called T.J Harper-- that made me laugh-- not sure it was meant to.
