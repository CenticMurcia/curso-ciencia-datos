This preposterous sci-fi flick deals with the first mission to the moon. While there, the astronauts encounter a subterranean civilization of slinky cat-women dressed in leotards and a giant spider puppet. The men are hypnotized by the cat-women but eventually break free of the spell and triumphantly return to earth.<br /><br />It certainly appears that space travel has vastly improved since 1953, since the spaceship's crew is using office desks and chairs. The space suits are pretty funny, and instead of ray guns the astronauts carry around plain ol' six-shooters.<br /><br />I can see why Sonny Tufts was in this movie, since he appeared in quite a few substandard films in the 40s and 50s. But what on earth are fine actors Victor Jory and Marie Windsor doing here? This film rates as probably the worst ever to be remade (just a few years later, as "Missile to the Moon"). Campy film will certainly provide some chuckles.
