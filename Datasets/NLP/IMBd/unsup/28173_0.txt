A hilarious musical besting Trey's earliest forray into film "Alferd Packer, The Musical" (also in this DB, though that one not R rated) This is NOT..I repeat NOT a movie for the kids. And yes they will take every measure possible to get you to bring them. It is hugely vulgar and uses combinations of profanity I have never heard before. Beware the "Video Sleep Over" parties come September. However, you are not going to be able to keep the tykes away from exposure completely, so best to talk to them aboot the content and language first. Do the job that the story is aboot. Parent your children.<br /><br />That being said, the film is one of the funniest of the season. Funnier, even, than The Spy Who Shagged me...sorry comrade Mike. Myers wouldn't be welcome in the world that develops around South Park Colorado. Nor would I, as we are both Canadians, and Canada is a four letter word in this SP.<br /><br />The songs in the flick are well conceived and executed. Parker is a latent musical director with a great sense of humor. "It's Easy, MMMkay", "Blame Canada", the "Uncle F**ka" song and dance, and "What Would Brian Boitano Do?" are good examples of his prowess. You even detect a hint of "All I Really Want" from Alferd Packer poking into a song. You soon become desensitized to the language (for good or bad) and can appreciate the cleverness of the lyrics and staging.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who has consciously or unconsciously hummed "Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo". But beware where you choose to sing some of these songs.<br /><br />There are some subjects and comments which will make some feel uneasy, like the scenes in Hell but I think they're cleverly designed to bring some of our phobias to bear and beg the question "What do you expect from Hell? What's taboo in Hell anyway?"<br /><br />I'm still alive and kicking so the movie won't kill you.<br /><br />
