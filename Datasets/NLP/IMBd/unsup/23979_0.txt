This unknown movie maybe one of the best action movies I have seen! To my surprise everything works! Mark Dacascos is great! Kadeem Harrison isn't annoying in the supporting role and even Brittany Murphy performs well! The action is top notch! MD delivers on this front like he did in "Crying Freeman"! For a low budget production the movie looks great! The plot is adequate and provides a good background for the main characters. (At least it was in my version: director's cut)! The action is done in Hong Kong style which is always good! The martial arts sometimes is used in combination with wires! But it is not obvious! In this way it intensifies the action scenes! I must admit that the climax: fight between MD and other "super" man could have been much longer but still it is great finale! Once again it is a mystery to me that a gem like this didn't get the publicity it deserves! This B movie is far superior to crap what has been made by Hollywood studios! If you get the chance to rent it or buy it! You won't regret it!
