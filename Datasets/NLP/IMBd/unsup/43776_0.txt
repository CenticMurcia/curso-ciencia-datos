Just when you thought you had seen one of Dennis Hopper's worst movies ever, along comes "The Amarican Way", and a new contender for worst of the worst is born. The script is like a free fall from the heavens, finally crashing to earth in such a predictable manner, there is nothing left. Don't ponder for meaning, because if this is an anti-war movie, it fails to prove any point other than mayhem. More like "The Groove Tube" or "Kentucky Fried Movie" on acid, only the most tolerant viewer will remain through the entire film. In fact, the only relief from the random dialog in the plane is the few welcome moments when the viewer is back on planet earth, a place this entire production has never been. Definitely the cream of the crap, and a must miss, avoid, movie. - MERK
