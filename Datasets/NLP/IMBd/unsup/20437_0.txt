I have to say that, for a long time, I didn't even bother watching any of the two "Goal!" movies because of my bad experiences with a few other soccer movies I've seen in the past. However, last week I happened to stumble upon the first movie while it was shown on TV and I kinda liked it, giving it an IMDb rating of 8 out of 10 stars. Although it was definitely not an excellent movie, having a few plot holes and a quite predictable ending, it was still a surprisingly good soccer movie with an otherwise decent plot. Logically, I wanted to see the sequel and therefore decided to rent it on DVD a few days later.<br /><br />However, the second "Goal!" movie was a huge disappointment. It was nothing but another below-average soccer movie with a boring and predictable plot. While the beginning was more or less promising, the rest of the movie was just a bunch of nonsense. It wasn't even about soccer anymore. Throughout the movie, the scenes of a soccer match would only occasionally appear on screen for a few minutes, while the rest was about disco clubs, parties, expensive cars, love affairs, family problems, paparazzi, filming of TV commercials... All in all, a bunch of more or less uninteresting situations already seen in numerous movies about famous musicians or film stars.<br /><br />The ending was also as predictable as it gets, with the main character's new club, Real Madrid, winning the Champions League in a similar fashion as his previous club, Newcastle United, qualified for the Champions League in the first movie, coming back from 2-0 down to win the game 3-2 in the final few minutes. I rated this movie 3 out of 10 stars, but the rating could have easily been lower. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've seen in the last few months. One more thing, it was quite unusual to see another sequel being announced at the end of such a terrible movie. I'm not sure if I'm going to give it a try, it surely can't be much better than this.
