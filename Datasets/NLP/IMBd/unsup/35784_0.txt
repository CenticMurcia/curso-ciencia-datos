This film was not scary or creepy. It was a pathetic version of "chuckie", yet shorter. If you are looking for a decent horror movie, your not in the right area.It was an alright episode, but not if your looking for scary. It was unrealistic, more supernatural. Also quite bad acting if i must say. I would recommend, 'The haunting in Kenetticut'. Its scary, mind-controlling. It is far more advanced then this excuse of a horror. I watched it with a group of friend, you'll be looking round corners, closing curtains and leaving lights on. I leaves you with nightmares. I really think you should consider this as an alternative.
