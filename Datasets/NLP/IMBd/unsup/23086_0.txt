F*ck. It's one of those "evil" words used every single day by more than just a vast majority of the entire human population. People slip this word in myriad forms and gestures, it's a common practice for so many people. Yet this one word divides society, each side strongly protesting for it's demise or the freedom of expression this single word has. Director Steve Anderson digs into the history of F*ck; it's origins, it's power, meaning(s), place of use, those who hate it and those who love to use it.<br /><br />F*ck is a strange follow up to Anderson's debut feature The Big Empty. Switching from a film with ideas bursting at the seams, of aliens and abductions, cowboys, blue suit cases and internal exploration of ones self, Anderson seals the lid on his obvious creativity for eccentric and esoteric concepts, jumping genres to documentary for a delve into the perversion of language. Language is humanities most powerful tool, Anderson wants to hit our nerves and see us tick and react to this word of curse.<br /><br />For the short space of time F*ck has, this documentary covers a lot of ground. The words origins, which has actually never been pin pointed to a certain time and it's mix up on false facts of it's derivation based on an acronym. F*ck's play over media in televisions, films, radio, music, porn. Politicians and Presidents to religion and even on the Apollo 16 moon landing. The word is just everywhere. Similar to another documentary The Aristocrats, on which reveals the worlds most depraved and sickening hilarious joke only known to comedians, interviewed comedians and their love of this, till now, secret joke. With all the ground covered, F*ck places all views; with comedians, politicians, porn stars, musicians, conservatives, religious figures, and most importantly the public all laying their stand to the issue.<br /><br />The draw back to F*ck is though it covers a lot of ground, it doesn't dig very deep into each sections. This presents more of a skim over, grabbing the most prevalent facts to present. Sections like comedians with Lenny Bruce and George Carlin battles over censorship, Howard Stern censorship battles on radio, the failure of the First Amendment, freedom of speech, censorship in general and the FCC. Youth held as the poster child to fight against profanities; the seven dirty words. The use in sex and porn, it's cathartic properties in just it's release from one's mouth. There is so much rich information to explore to this subject, that a lot of the information is left untapped.<br /><br />Once again Anderson, much to The Big Empty, takes on more than he should. He has to many things to juggle for in depth exploration, but to his credit as a film maker to watch, he manages to hold it all together. F*ck runs with a dark slice of humour, along with some satirical stabs, inserting clips from films and archival footage of news reports, comedians acts, short cartoons and the interviews themselves are executed with precision to emphasis points with poignant resonance. <br /><br />While F*ck may only present a small excerpt from a larger, in-depth conversation, F*ck still offers so much food for thought. A film to wrap your perverse language around.
