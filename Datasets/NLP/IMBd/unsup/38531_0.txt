Oh!...I am in awe of how terrible this movie is. I am a huge horror movie fanatic. And i finally got a chance to see this. It is one of the worst i have ever seen, next to "Troll 2" (that might even be better). I could barely make it through. The directing was awful, the storyline is SO awful, characters are 2d, special effects are worthless. It was so bad, i wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. The story is about a Nerdy boy who lives with his Christian "mommy", who gets picked on at school by bullies in the bathroom. They spend a lot of time in that bathroom it seems. The cousin of this infamous nerd is a bad ass motor cycle riding 80's boy toy who's reckless with the "babes". They all seem to tamper with this phone-line 976-evil, that tempts them into doing naughty things, via "satan". After some time, the main character (nerd), gets obsessed and the evil takes him over. Wow. Then the tension builds!...He goes on a minor rampage taking foes out. I wouldn't want to spoil the terrific ending in case your tempted to see this (note the sarcasm). If i could rate this below a 1, i would.<br /><br />It is a waste of anyone's time. You will actually kill brain cells by watching it.
