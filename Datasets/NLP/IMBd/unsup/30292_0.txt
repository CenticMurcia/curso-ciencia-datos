Everyone seems to LOVE this BOMB movie!I was going to school in NYC when the movie opened. The poster looked cool....then I saw it on HBO in 1983, or thereabouts. It was *NOT* a punk movie at all. Parts made no sense at all. All I remember was Tim Curry telling teenagers (on the air) "They treat you like criminals so wear masks; they treat you like garbage--so wear garbage bags" (or something like that). Then all these teenagers emerge in the "big scene" at the end wearing "bandit" masks and black Hefty bags, and I was like "What the F--k is going on?". A real "wrong time/wrong place" movie, that MAY have been altered a little bit, a few years later, into a Molly Ringwald "Brat Pack" vehicle. Maybe. The double LP soundtrack was a cut-out bin STAPLE till the mid-1980's. Stigwood & co. should have learned their piggish little lesson with the Bee Gees "Sgt. Pepper" movie. There are better "new wave" girly movies than this ("Starstruck" , "Breaking Glass" perhaps?). Overall, this movie was a corporate plan to sanitize punk rock for Mall Girl Consumption by the greedy Grease people! Nothing more. But hey, I'm a 40 year old guy (now), so maybe if I was a 15 year old budding lesbian in 1980, this would have been my "Citizen Kane"?
