For the love of all things sacred how on earth did this movie get 7 stars. More like minus 7 stars!!! If this is one of the pivotal movies in Australian cinema (Along with Somersault and Look Both Ways, which made me want to eat my own legs) then i will cry. Cry a golden tear. Please, Make it stop.<br /><br />Can someone please point out to me where they hid the plot in this hienous film??? I've looked! but i cant seem to find any hint of interesting story.....<br /><br />Aussie girl meets uptight Japanese business man. They don't know what they are saying to each other. They don't know each other. Then they have sex. they are soooooooo obviously in complete love! cant you see that they are soulmates???(no? neither did i) then they are like "we are so happy together.....then he dies, oh no, then she tries to get his slippery and slimy corpse back into the car for like half an hour. then he gets sent home and she looks at the plane for about 5 hours and cries. Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />that should be the blurb on the DVD case. It was not emotionally draining as i was told, it was funny. Me and my cold, black heart laughed because it was so very very excruciatingly stupid. HA HA HA.<br /><br />And excuse me, buti think Toni Collette should quit while shes ahead........please.........quit........toni?
