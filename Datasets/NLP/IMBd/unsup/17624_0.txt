This film gave a detailed view of the history of the gay marriage issue in Massachusetts. It gives the viewer both sides of the story (though in truth the opponents of gay marriage border on self-parody) and allows the viewer to make up their own mind. The film opened my eyes to the difference between "marriage" and "civil unions". As a former supporter of the notion of civil unions I now realize that is simply a term of appeasement, not a term of equality. I emerged from viewing this film a more educated and compassionate person. It would be beneficial for people across the United States to be able to view this film and see the story behind the controversy for themselves. This film will impact anyone who sees it.
