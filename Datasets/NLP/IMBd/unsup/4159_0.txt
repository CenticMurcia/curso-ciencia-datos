"Let My Puppets Come" is one of those curiosity movies due to it being a pornographic puppet flick. The movie concerns a few men (played by puppets) who need to make some quick money to repay what they owe to a mafia man. They decide to make a blue movie as a way to make that fast cash. "Let My Puppets Come" is full of comedy that falls flat. The human nudity is there without being titillating, and the puppet sex scenes are really not that interesting. There is one rather surprising (or maybe shocking) sex scene in which a puppet dog is involved. Luis De Jesus and Lynette Sheldon both appeared in the awful "Blood Sucking Freaks." Adult film director Gerard Damiano ("Deep Throat") directed this movie, and also appears in it. Another porn king, Al Goldstein, also appears in the movie. Adult actress Annie Sprinkle helped out with her production design. To sum it up, "Let My Puppets Come" is a rather bland and boring curiosity movie. "Let My Puppets Come" is a short (about 50 minutes in running time) motion picture for adults only, and is rated X for hardcore puppet action.
