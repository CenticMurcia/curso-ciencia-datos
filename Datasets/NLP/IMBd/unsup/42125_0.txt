This has got to be the worst remake I have yet to see! If A & E was too concerned with being politically correct to do this correctly, they should have left this alone. As it is they produced a senseless watered down version that made no sense because they ignore the fact that it all is a dream world created by George Orr. Where are the aliens, the plague, gray people, etc. While I like both Lisa Bonet & Lukas Haas, neither was suited for this movie. If you want to see this produced correctly rent the original that is finally available after 20 years of petty arguing between the writers and PBS or read the book.<br /><br />
