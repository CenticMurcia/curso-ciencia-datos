This movie is ideal for the task of escapism, immersion, the transformation of one's mood.<br /><br />The film has the perfect combination of giddy happiness and stabs of sadness. It achieves this because it forces the audience to CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. A vital ingredient which film directors neglect all too often. Of course this compelling quality is thanks to the inspired writer Dodie Smith, but it takes a keenly in tuned director to animate a writer's vision on screen.<br /><br />The cast was picked because the actors were SUITED TO THEIR CHARACTERS. Again a vital ingredient neglected all too often. I despise watching an insipid actress who has been chosen because she is pals with the director. Both Romola Garai and Rose Byrne not only suited Cassandra and Rose, but also suited being sisters. The chemistry between all characters in this movie was believable, from Cassy desperately longing for Simon to view her as more than a silly child to her dealing with growing jealousy of her beautiful sister.<br /><br />If one is ever homesick for england as Dodie Smith was when she wrote the novel, this is the movie to turn to for refuge. It transports the viewer to scenes that could only be England. Green meadows, crumbling castles with damp walls, the need to wear wool en socks in bed, the excitement of venturing into London.<br /><br />A fascinating look at the age seventeen where one feels like they are forty, but are treated as if twelve and are being told that the passion they are feeling is mere fantasy.
