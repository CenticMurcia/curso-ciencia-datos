Never have the shades of modern dating, flashing too quickly from delicious to devastating and back again, been captured so well in film. Brava, Ms.<br /><br />Weinstock, bravissima.<br /><br />Marguerite Moreau's Jamie is so distinct, so rich with idiosyncrasies to a degree that would make most filmmakers nervous, worried to alienate the audience.<br /><br />But the character is charming; it is soon clear that her weirdness is merely an accurate sketch of how distinct we all would be, if our most private moments<br /><br />were recorded. So the effect, no matter how original, quite marvellously evokes the real, the normal.<br /><br />While nearly every character boasts this unusual realness (an exception is<br /><br />Jamie's older sister, who is the only major character that may be construed as a generic type), the situations and feelings they evoke are quite intimately familiar. This is not a typical romantic comedy to be accompanied with strawberry wine<br /><br />coolers and dreamily horny sighs. No seduction is without awkwardness, and<br /><br />the whole film might be subtitled "imbroglio." So it describes, as it were, real life.<br /><br />Hope we see it distributed soon.
