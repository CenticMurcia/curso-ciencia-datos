This was simply a sad movie. I sat watching this today on FOX, all along thinking, when is it going to get better? When you consider such classic tales from other programs such as House that dripped blood, or Tales from the Crypt, or even Tales from the dark side, one must come to the conclusion that this series could never reach that level of shock, suspense or fright. While other programs had good writing, this lost me at every turn. I mean, what was the point to the finale ending anyway? How did the teeth manage to kill AGAIN? Who is the Christopher Loyd character supposed to be? This series should die a horrible death by the very teeth it showcased. Sad, it's very sad indeed there is no truly gripping and compelling storytellers anymore. Stay away from this movie or you'll DIE being bored!
