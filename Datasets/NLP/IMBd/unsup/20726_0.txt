I thought this movie was good because it was very real. I could relate to both of the main characters. I thought Bruce Willis did an excellent job. I'm used to him in action roles but he was convincing as a kind, easy-going husband and father. What made the movie not quite as good for me was Michelle Pheiffer. I didn't really care for her. Throughout the movie I found her acting not that convincing. I don't know, just something about her wasn't quite right, not enough feeling or something. And I hate when people in movies are supposed to be crying really hard but no tears come out, she did this in this movie. And there was one scene where she makes this long speech and she's very upset and supposed to be crying but there's no tears and she's wining to the point where it's annoying and again it's not convincing, there doesn't seem to be the right feeling. You could always feel Bruce Willis' sadness or happiness but I didn't get this from Michelle Pheiffer. I liked the movie for it's realistic portrayal of what should be considered a "happy" marriage and it's just a nice story.
