One of Ford's better (and lesser known) films, notable for the restraint exercised towards the characters and story. It is about a ship traveling through dangerous waters to bring war supplies to besieged England, and centers on the conflicts, dreams and sufferings of the sailors who inhabit the ship. Wayne does a good job as the big Swede, mostly by not talking much. Ward Bond does a great job with his death scene. It was cool how Ford allowed the audience to become more and more annoyed and frustrated as the situation at the film's climax reaches its conclusion. <br /><br />Not market with the overbearing sentiment that hobbles so much of Ford's output (IMHO).
