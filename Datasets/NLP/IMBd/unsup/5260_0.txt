I have seen the movie twice and i agree that it's not at great movie with brilliant script or tricks but.....<br /><br />I have played all the WC games and i loved them - and the movie has the same sense of surprise and plot that the games have. An outcast who ends to be the hero and a little crush on the senior in command actually the movie is much more scientific correct than ex. Star Wars. The spaceships are using bullets and there is a little Einstein with time/space theories. The movie is NOT i repeat NOT for anyone else than non space combat sci-fi nerds which means - no girl- or best friends, parents and ....- but my son (11 years) loved it - as i did
