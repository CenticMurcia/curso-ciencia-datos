Cool movie! One of my personal faves! It's the best Crow movie 'til now in my opinion. Eric Mabius looks great as the third Crow and Kirsten Dunst acts brilliantly as Lauren Randall's sister. The first part of the plot is pretty common (a guy being set up for his girlfriend's murder) but the next is typical Crow-Corvis(Mabius) comes back from the dead to revenge both deaths.<br /><br />Though the blood doesn't look real.More ketchup, please! <br /><br />There are lots of great special effects which make it great (the car chase scene where the car and the helicopter blow up).<br /><br />The rest is cool...
