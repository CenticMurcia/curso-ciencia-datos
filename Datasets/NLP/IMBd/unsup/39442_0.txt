SHAREENA. Shahid and Kareena Kapoor that is. This overwrought over-zealous over-polished Faux attempt at the famed British whodunit genre would have swept the house at Hollywood's Razi awards but since it's Bollywood, an industry that does not (well at least at the time of this review) have an award show that gives out accolades for the worst performances like Hollywood does the night before the Oscars.<br /><br />36 Chinatown weaves the tale of a missing child, his murdered mother, two gold digging teenyboppers, a handsome playboy and two other couples in circles around one another as drawn by a police inspector (Akshaye Khanna in one of his most dashing and sinful hot roles yet). Khanna takes the cake, I mean honestly if only they could have edited Shareena out of the picture, the film might have been a masterpiece lead by the very confident and professional Khanna. Not to mention supported by the very hilarious Johnny Lever & Paresh Rawal who turn in decent performances. Oh! and what's up with Piggy Chops? Priyanka Chopra that is? She seems to be doing a lot of cameos lately. Blink and you'll miss her appearance as Khanna's very sexy wife. Upen Patel makes his Bollywood debut as the heart breaker Rocky. Apart from the songs, you might want to skip this Chinatown.
