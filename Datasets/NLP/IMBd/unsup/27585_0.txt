I saw this film today in the Cinema. The film critics gave it the bottom grade. But I didn't listen to them. Do I ever? This third entry is not really as good as the two other films, but well worth seeing. I was really a lot better than I thought. Paul Hogan is as funny and charming as ever. If you're a fan like me. Four words: GO AND SEE IT! For everyone else. I recomend it. I give it 7/10.
