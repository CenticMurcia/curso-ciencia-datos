While it is not a perfect 10 on my scale it is high up on my list. I really like this story and is a good story. I don't know why there are all these bad commands like this movie is Gigi or Camp Fever. Those of some terrible movies, like on a negative side, really really bad. This actually a good movie and here we have people who just hated it. If I hated a movie that much i don't watch more than 20 minutes of the movie. I love that it showed for once that the woman can mess a good thing up and its not always the man. It gets on my nerves that everything are so one sided sometimes. I liked the one year later thing because if they had gotten together at the end of what happen it would have been too cheesy. Chris i loved your movie and much love my brotha.
