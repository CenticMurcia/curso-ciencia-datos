I hope i never see this movie again.<br /><br />Not in a bad way though, it's just the memories of this film give me a warm, fuzzy, nostalgic feeling & i wouldn't want to spoil this by watching as an adult.<br /><br />I've given this movie 10/10 just because of the nostalgia factor, if i watched it again as an adult, i get the feeling it'd struggle to get past 3.<br /><br />I've kinda spoiled some TV memories by re-watching old shows & we all know that however much we want to, we cant feel the same way about the things we loved as kids.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm off to watch reruns of Diff'rent Strokes.<br /><br />:-) <br /><br />XX mojo XX
