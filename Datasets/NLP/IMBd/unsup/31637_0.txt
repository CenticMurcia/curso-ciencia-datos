I saw this on TCM a couple of nights ago, and stayed up late to see it a second time when it was screened again later in the evening. I had never heard of this movie before, and it turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Based on a stage play, it has sophisticated and witty dialog, and is very nicely acted and directed. William Powell is his usual charming self, and Ann Harding is terrific--exuding intelligence, strength, and femininity in a very difficult role. I can remember seeing Ann Harding in only one other film, Peter Ibbetson, and she made an equally strong impression on me in that film as well.<br /><br />Powell and Harding work well together, with a seduction scene creating a great sense of intimacy. He's a playboy, and she lays a trap to snare him, which eventually leads to a lot of emotional pain and heartache. Despite all their troubles, there is a certain civility and grace in the way that they deal with each other--and I think it is this quality, more than any other, that makes the film so appealing.<br /><br />For people who like films of the pre-code era, Double Harness is highly recommended.
