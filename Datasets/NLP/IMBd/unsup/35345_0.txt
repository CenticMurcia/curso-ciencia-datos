Yes abuse is awful, but Donna Yaclich was a scheming, greedy, manipulative woman who had her husband killed for insurance money. To this day she shows no remorse for hiring some guys to kill her husband. Any way you slice it, she is an evil woman and deserved every moment of the forty years that she got in prison for conspiracy to commit murder. Unfortunately, this movie casually ignores the horrible thing she did to her husband and to their children. Let's say she killed him because she could no longer stand the abuse and wanted to protect her children, that might be believable, but no she did it for the money. And because her husband was "killed" in the line of duty, she got double the money. This is no accident, she carefully planned it this way all along, knowing that her husband's life insurance policy would pay double if he were killed on the job. Then after the funeral she partied in Jamaica. No remorse whatsoever, this woman is unbelievably evil. I don't know how anyone can watch this movie and feel sorry for Donna Yaclich, she is a horrible woman. Even today in t.v. interviews, she expresses no remorse for having someone killed.
