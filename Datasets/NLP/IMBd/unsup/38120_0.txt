OK let me start by saying that i APPRECIATE a 'bad' low budget movie, if it has effort. I mean i had a Public Access Show in Atlanta GA in 1999 where people sent me stuff (for you kids, Public Access is how you got stuff played before YouTube), and even though the movies were cheap and low budget and technically 'bad', it was for that type of genre. If they had sent me this movie to play on Public Access, i would've shown it. But Public Access is as far as this should ever get.<br /><br />I can't believe this made it to national distribution. Acting is god-awful. all the way around. Editing and plot are terrible; all of a sudden you might be thrown into a mass zombie attack which lasts 2 seconds, then everyone is safe and sound again talking about how dangerous everything was. The plot is disastrous. the ubiquitous bad guy in the group (and the group keeps growing/shrinking mysteriously with no explanation) murders one of the girls in cold blood, and the good guys, in revenge, rather than killing badguy outright, decide to punish him by sending him to the zombies. of course the dude who sends him to the zombies never returns but butthole badguy survives. Then the movie ends with a lame salute at a 'butch cassidy & the sundance kid' ending. really, really bad movie.
