When I saw this years and years ago....there was a big gimmick.<br /><br />They advertised it in my area as "When the screaming stops" and said it was the most disgusting movie ever. So, everybody that showed up got an airline style barf bag and they ran a big warning at the beginning of the movie telling people the producers were not responsible for whatever happened to those who watched the movie.<br /><br />The movie was heavily hyped with lots and lots of ads on local TV stations telling everyone that this was the grossest movie ever made.<br /><br />So there was a big buzz and the theaters were packed.<br /><br />Then, of course the opening scene was of a tranquil lake outside some castle in Europe and people began making very mocking barf sounds...that was probably the most memorable thing of the whole movie.<br /><br />There were some disgusting parts (including one part where I think the bad guy rips an organ out of a body and if I remember right eats it.<br /><br />Pretty gross stuff. But it was clearly a foreign movie repackaged and expertly hyped here in the US. <br /><br />Probably made some decent money but many felt ripped off.
