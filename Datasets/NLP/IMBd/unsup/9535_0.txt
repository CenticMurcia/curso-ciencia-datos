This is by far the best movie I have ever seen, and I think anyone that has seen it agrees with me. Basically, the movie tells 5 different stories,which interact with each other, but still follow their own story. The movie is about the basic principles you learned in life; people come closer during danger or despair, we should accept people who as they are and learn to live with them etc. I beg of you who has not seen this movie, PLEASE go and buy it from ebay or anywhere else, you wont regret it. This movie is the most vibrant and mindblowing experience you wont find anywhere else, it is simply amazing. There are not anough words to diplay the beauty of this movie.
