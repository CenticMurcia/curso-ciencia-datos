Great to see this kind of film out on general release in British cinemas and now on DVD. It's about time! One thing I would say is that if I were a sixteen year old girl or so, this would be my favourite film for a good while because of the 'girl-on-girl action'. But don't get me wrong this is definitely about women and not girls! <br /><br />Well done Pratibha Parmar for bringing this fun-loving film, full of diversity of many kinds, out for all to see. I look forward to seeing more.<br /><br />This film marks a time where more and more expressions of true love, identity and passion should be allowed onto the big screen for the mainstream to see. There are plenty of interesting works out there, which are simply not being allowed into the cinema for people to see because there is deemed to be 'no audience'. So pay attention to what you chose to see! It's people that determine what's out there and what isn't.
