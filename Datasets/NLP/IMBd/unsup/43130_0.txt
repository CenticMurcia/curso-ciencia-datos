It should be illegal to make a film this bad. Watching it was like having a pencil shoved in my eye and it being swirled around, then having a bunch lit of cigarettes put out all over my body. But other than that it was OK.<br /><br />I feel this way and I was getting paid while I was watching it at work. They say it is like American pie. This, my friend, is nothing like American Pie. American Pie had a plot, this was just a bunch of idiots doing stupid sh#$* on camera with no rhyme or reason at all.<br /><br />Anyone thinking about watching this movie, just know, it is 89 min of your life you will never get back.
