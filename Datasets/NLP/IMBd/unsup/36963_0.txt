Decided to watch AMC and found this film and decided to give it a try and see what I was in for in regards to entertainment. There was a great deal of humor and Steven Baldwin,(Sean Linden),"In My Sleep",'06, made very little effort in his acting to convince me that he even enjoyed making this film. Sean played a has-been hockey player who liked the wild life and decided to get in on a deal offered to him and his team as a comedy hockey team. Added to the action in the film was, Jessica Steen,(Jessie Dage),"Homefront",'91, a gal who was the granddaughter to a very famous hockey player from the past. The film was very boring and never seemed to end and made absolutely no common sense at all.
