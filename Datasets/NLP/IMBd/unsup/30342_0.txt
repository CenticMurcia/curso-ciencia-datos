A movie with serious and poignant themes that isn't afraid to let out the full force of human emotion and confusion. Brilliant in its ability to draw parallels between the mind of a very "sick" individual and our own lives. Various unpleasant modes of motivation are also explored in the screenplay via archetypal imagery and polarity. More than entertainment, the movie is likely to touch a chord in the psyche of even the most jaded part of oneself, encouraging hope for change, while at the same time exploring the inevitable outcome pursuant to the present course as delineated by the characters personas. Let me try saying it this way. Intense themes of alienation, lust, power, anger and confusion are painted with broad and overlapping strokes in this powerhouse of a movie. The canvas of the screen time and again extrudes into the mind of the viewer through imagery, tone, familiarity and by the commentary of a fish. Don't over look the fish. Likely should have gotten a nomination for some screenplay award, and was, well overlooked. And then there is the hummingbird. We aren't really asked to look to deeply at these two pivotal characters in the film, yet they act as a prism regarding the various themes and characters in the film; arguably helping to blend and mix them so we can more easily identify with the film itself. Then there is the use of black and white at the very beginning of the film, one of the rare times I felt that it created more than mood or atmosphere; the footage there was poetic and beautiful. And then the descent into the everyday. Bound to continue to work on the mind, and possibly the psyche, days after viewing. I'd see it again with a friend, or as a film night kind of thing. I think that it would be interesting to listen to what other people thought of it, how they interpreted it, and also to listen to the naysayers of which there likely would be few. It deals with various taboos, and foul motives. Not an upbeat movie, I give it thumbs up.
