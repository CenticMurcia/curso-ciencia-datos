This movie did NOT portray the real Selena nor her family. They are very inconsiderate people. Very money hungry. They will literally "hurt" someone for it as well. Being in the tejano business, you know every band (since it is such a small market). I know bands that were involved with the Q Productions, and every band has been burned in one way or another. They did not get any royalties what so ever, contracts were breached, and the list goes on. At a show in Amarillo, Selena refused to sign autographs and her 1 1/2 hour concert turned into 25 mins because the concert hall was only half full. She was not dedicated to her fans, (it was even written in the Amarillo Globe News the day after). The movie really makes her and her family out to be generous and tight-knit. In actuality, A.B and his father do not get along. Lots of curse words thrown at each other(I witnessed it first hand). Poorly made. Made only for the money that would generate.
