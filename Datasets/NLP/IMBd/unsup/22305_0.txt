I'm not a huge science fiction fan, but I love this show. It's a great comedy with spaceships, planets, and alternate dimensions as simple backdrops. The characters are extremely likeable and the situations are very funny. Unfortunately, this show is hard to see in the states, but if you have a chance, WATCH IT! You won't be disappointed.
