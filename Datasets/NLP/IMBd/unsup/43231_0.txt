Rosalind Russell is a patriotic widow with time on her hands. She decides to volunteer her services as a spy for the C.I.A. Agreeing her retiring housewife manner makes her a good candidate for undercover work, the C.I.A. accepts "Mrs. Pollifax - Spy", and assigns her a mission - she is to obtain some microfilm from an operative in Mexico. The plan goes badly, however; Mrs. Pollifax is handcuffed to Darren McGavin, then kidnapped by Communists. The film starts off nicely, with Ms. Russell in good form, convincing both the C.I.A. and the viewer that "Mrs. Pollifax - Spy" is a good concept. Don't be fooled into thinking the movie is about a lady James Bond, however.<br /><br />Russell as Pollifax is abducted quickly, and spends the entire film in DANGER - she endures prison, scales mountains, and braves the raging rapids. It all looks silly, and unrealistic. We don't get a chance to see her succeed in a few cases, getting to know the character and seeing her worth. We have no idea why the "mission" is important. Mr. McGavin only begins to help later in the film; otherwise, he's bedridden and uninterested. A "lady sleuth" role might have been a better choice for Russell, at this point in her career. <br /><br />**** Mrs. Pollifax - Spy (5/12/71) Leslie Martinson ~ Rosalind Russell, Darren McGavin, Dana Elcar
