Ok, seriously, this is what Blair Witch should have been! Face it! Here's why: You SEE the creatures! It's made on Thanksgiving, making it a plausible time to have a videocam out. The special effects aren't all bad. It scared the $*!& outta me! This was great. It was so realisitic. possibly one of the finest things UPN's ever done. I'm so glad I taped it too! I was so scared all night, that when my alarm went off for me to go to wake up for school, I was so terrified, that I just let it ring for 20 minutes afraid to move! I don't get scared easily either! Sure, there was some things wrong, but the first time I watched it, I didn't notice, so its not bad. The credits actually list the actors! As if we wouldn't notice?!? The other problem is the way it had the fake static. We've used videocams before. They don't do that. That was just a special effect. All in all, this show was great. I think I'll watch it again tonight! Hope I'm not as scared in the morning!
