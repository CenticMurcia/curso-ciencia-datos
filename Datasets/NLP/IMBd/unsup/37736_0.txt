This is another of John Candy's bombs. For such a talented actor, he did so many bad films. This film does not make Canada look good. I was insulted at how stupid this film portrayed Canadians and Americans. The problem is there are people on both sides of the border that behave like this film. The thing is this film was written by a Canadian. Is this what he thinks of his fellow Canadians? Canadians always seem to write good scripts and this is what this film is lacking. The problem is the people who made this film show how silly Canadians can be. 2/10
