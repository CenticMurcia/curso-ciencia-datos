Well, here it is... the last Porky's film. The lowest of the low. Does it actually get any worse than this? I hope not. The first two movies had some(albeit not an awful lot) value and were just above being garbage committed to celluloid... this one is different, worse. The direction is lazy and uninspired. Scene after scene is misdirected and lacks effect. The writing, since the first two films, has taken a turn for the worse, something I didn't think possible before watching this tripe. Characters are messed up completely, going in a completely different direction from what was seen in the first two films. Jokes and gags are incredibly forced and unforgivably poor. The humor is taken down a further notch from the first two films; again, a surprise for those of us who weren't aware that it was possible to go any lower. Acting is overplayed and uninspired. Unlike the first two films, this one doesn't have one single redeeming quality... it's just bad. Really, really bad. I couldn't give you one good reason to watch this film... not a single one. I recommend this only to people who loved the first two so much that they simply can't stand the notion of there being a film in the series that they haven't seen... no matter how bad it is. Everyone else should avoid this... at all and any costs. 1/10
