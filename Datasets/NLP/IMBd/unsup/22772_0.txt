Takashi Sorimachi plays asias top assassin O hes quiet and regretful of his lifestyle but always gets the job done and is effecient. Andy Lau is the rival assassin Tok who is coming up through the ranks and challenging O for the title of number 1 assassin. Tok is the reverse of O hungry for attention and enjoys his job smiling, laughing and referencing movies through out the film. Caught between the two is Os house cleaner Chin (Kelly Lin) and interpol agent Lee (Simon Yam). Chin and O are attracted to each other but all the time theyve known each other they have done nothing about it. Then Tok meets Chin in the video store she works in at night and they develop a relationship of there own creating a love triangle.<br /><br />Johnny To has created a great entertaining film in the John Woo, Ringo Lam heroic bloodshed style. The performances are all good especially the two main leads who are great in there roles bringing coolness to the screen whenever there present but i feel Simon Yam and Kelly Lins characters werent developed as much as i would of liked. The ending was also slighlty disapointing taking the attention of the film away from the assassins to Simon yam. As far as realism is concerned dont expect much but you shouldnt with a film like this. Overall the film is really entertaining featuring some great action shootouts.
