I don't know a whole lot about William Girdler (I've only seen one other film that he directed, "Three On a Meathook", which wasn't nearly as entertaining as this one), but it's obvious that he put a lot of heart into "Asylum of Satan". Yes, it was done on a very small budget; yes, the script was corny; yes, the acting was mostly bad. But movies don't come any more GENUINE than this. And "Asylum" is fun to watch, too, dammit! Remember the horror movie you wanted to make when you were a kid? Well, Girdler made it for you. The plot is thin; a beautiful pianist (Carla Borelli) suffers a minor breakdown and ends up at an old, scary-looking asylum in the country, where she hears sinister chanting and has a number of extremely vivid nightmares. What's going on at Dr. Spektor's sanitarium? You'll have to find out for yourself! While most of the cast fails to impress (but come on, lay off bellbottom-clad Nick Jolley already, even if he does look ridiculous!), Charles Kissinger--as Dr. Spektor--makes a pretty good bargain-basement Vincent Price. As with other films of this type, the scares are, for the most part, executed in a heavyhanded, artless way. Still, there's a couple of truly creepy scenes (this is not sarcasm or irony!), and the makeup effects are interesting if unconvincing. Watch "Asylum of Satan" and you'll develop a soft spot in your heart--or your head--for it :)
