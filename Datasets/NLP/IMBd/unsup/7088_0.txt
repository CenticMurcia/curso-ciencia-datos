among all the scenes -- of which there are many many memorable ones believe me -- the one which has the key to the movie is when the father is frantically taping the attack on his house and speaking at the same time and among a frenzy of "reporter-talk" he says, <br /><br />"what are we supposed to feel?"<br /><br />the key to the movie is, you are never allowed to know what you are supposed to feel. these days, whether you know this or not, we are frequently "told" what to feel. Takashi Miike takes this fact around, pulls the carpet from under all of us. he builds his film around the phenomenon of TV/media, emotion-building, exposing, exploiting. yet keeps this tension through the movie and does not allow us for a moment to settle in our armchairs, does not for one moment let us get into that comfy zone of being told what to feel. <br /><br />and hence watching this movie becomes this eerie, stressful process as noted by everyone else. am i disgusted, indignant, amused, sympathetic, angry, confused? you are never told. you have to go through it on your own. and that is the point.
