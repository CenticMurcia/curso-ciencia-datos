1982's "Night Shift" which was one of legendary director Ron Howard's first works can now be considered a comedy classic. The film is certainly funny and it has plenty of funny memorable one liners and it was sharply written with intelligent wit. Yet it is most respected for it's off beat plot and clever nature of opening up a business(an escort service)which will lead to an unlikely friendship and it shows one man that love is possible for anyone.<br /><br />Set in New York City you have ex Wall street guy Charles Lumley(Henry Winkler)who's a worried and uptight type who now makes his living at the city morgue on the night shift. Things change enter Billy Blazejowski(Michael Keaton in one of his earliest roles)who's hired to be Lumley's night shift partner. And Billy is an opposite as he's more a party animal and care free type who wants to change things and he comes up with a clever ideal. That is he gathers up a group of women and you guessed it they run an escort service for profit! Shelly Long stars as a working girl and strikes up a friendship and even a love making encounter with the uptight Lumley who breaks free of some of his tightness, which was needed especially when he had a sweet tooth wife who loved chocolate! In the end a lot is learned as unexpected love is discovered and all three form a bonding friendship that's memorable and should last so special when it seemed so unlikely. Overall good and well done comedy a now remembered classic.
