This is a very unpretentious, likeable movie.<br /><br />I thought the entire cast including Brigitte Bardot did an excellent acting job. I was surprised Bardot had such a big role considering this was her first picture. No disappointment here that she's a brunette. As I remember she also ended her career as a brunette in the picture Don Juan.<br /><br />It's a feel good story. It's about a lovable simpleton who goes back to elementary school. In the process he wins the hearts of virtually all the people in the small village. It's somewhat of a Forrest Gump tale but on a much smaller scale.
