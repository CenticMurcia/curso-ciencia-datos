One of the most unusual things in Bollywood is a sequel or a trilogy. Ram Gopal Varma completes this circle with "D: Company". Another hard hitting and realistic look at the Mumbai (Bombay) underworld scene. Deshu is a Dubai-returned common man who gets involved in the gangster world and soon starts taking over established names in the business. This leads to peer rivalry and of course, endless daylight shooting on Mumbai streets. The movie takes another shot at the politics-movies-police-underworld connection without sparing anyone in the process. This movie has the "Ram Gopal Varma touch", as we have come to know it, written all over it.<br /><br />His previous outing with "Satya" and "Company" were equally amazing although none can match the raw power Manoj Bajpai brought to Bhikoo Mhatre(in Satya) or Ajay brought to Mallik(in Company). In this one, Randeep Hooda makes an excellent job as the aggressive yet ruthlessly calm "Dheshu" or 'D'. This movie ends where "Company" starts. So, in a way, one can see this movie as a prequel to "Company".<br /><br />Performance wise there are many amazing surprises. For one, Chunky Pandey makes an excellent comeback as Raghav - D's right hand man. Then there is the Varma favorite Isha Koppikar as his love interest. Goga Kapoor, Yashpal Sharma and of course, the talented Sushant Singh also chip in powerful performances. On the whole "D:Company" turns out to be another enjoyable Varma production.<br /><br />Giving it a 10 out of 10 for keeping us in touch with the reality for once.
