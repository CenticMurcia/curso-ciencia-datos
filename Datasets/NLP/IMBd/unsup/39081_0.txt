Let me add to the other unbiased, glowing reviews posted here by stating that this is truly the greatest achievement in motion picture history. The reviewer who suggested that some of the handful of positive reviews posted on IMDb might be written by friends of the filmmakers or the filmmakers themselves is way off base. Those reviews were clearly understating the massive achievement of this motion picture. To say this is "Way better than Shutter Island" is an insult to DreamKiller and the folks who made it comparing it to the minimally crafted "thriller" if you can call it that! Dreamkiller is so beyond that. The word Thriller barely describes the awesomeness of this masterpiece. The twists and turns just keep coming and coming. I was exhausted at the end. And it's got connections to Nazis. Name another movie did THAT! And the performances! Wow. Dario Deak sizzles as the dreamy-hunk scientist who solves the mystery and saves the day. He is perfectly cast as a super-intelligent doctor who is the object of all women's desires. And the production values? I couldn't believe this movie was made for less than $100 million. If these actors aren't household names, soon donning the covers of every entertainment magazine in the country, I'll be shocked.<br /><br />And another thing, if the other reviews were written by the people who made this movie, would they ALL praise the story, the lead actor, and the director and talk about specific details of the movie that only someone who really loved it would remember? Obviously the film resonated with people enough to get five reviews and 13 ratings.<br /><br />I had the sheer pleasure of seeing this at the Beverly Center about a week ago and I could tell by the stunned silence at the end and the way the other audience members quickly exited the theater to spread the word about Dreamkiller, that the two other people in the theater experienced the same life altering effects as I did.
