The Plot: Clive Owen ( before he was in "The Bourne Identity," "King Arthur," "Elisabeth: The Golden Age," and "Sin CIty" ) plays a "hire" who drives people places they desperately need to go. <br /><br />Often times, they are working for something "top secret" and can only give our protagonist limited information. <br /><br />Also, this is meant to show off the BMW car and is executive-produced by Tony Scott, Ridley Scott and David Fincher ( Panic Room, Alien 3 ).<br /><br />Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ( BABEL, 21 Grams ), this intense tale follows our hero in a foreign country torn by terrorist attacks trying to get a photographer (played by the excellent Stellan Skarsgard ) out of there and keep his photos unharmed.
