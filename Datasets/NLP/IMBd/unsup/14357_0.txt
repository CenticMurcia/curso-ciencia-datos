"The Petrified Forest" is set in a diner in the Arizona desert, and focuses on the characters there prior to and during the take-over of the diner by a notorious killer and his gang. The film is based on a play, and it is not surprising given that all but one scene is set at the diner.<br /><br />Bette Davis gives a fine performance as an idealist young waitress that is enchanted by a vagabond that happens upon the diner, Alan Squier. My favorite performance of the film was from Leslie Howard as Alan Squier, the directionless, weary and philosophizing intellectual. All of the dialogue in this film was well-written, but Squier's lines are particularly eloquent and his references to books and historical figures are interesting. Humphrey Bogart is also great in his breakthrough role as Duke Mantee, the notorious killer. Mantee is gruff, controlling and at times sarcastic, but he has a slow, piercing voice and a methodical manner. The supporting performances are also of note too, particularly that of the excited grandfather often ready with invented tales.<br /><br />The film's premise is simple, so this film relies on its characterizations and dialogue to retain viewer interest. Both are equal to the task, the dialogue remains engaging as the characters share their innermost thoughts and the film considers American society of the time, and especially love and self-sacrifice.
