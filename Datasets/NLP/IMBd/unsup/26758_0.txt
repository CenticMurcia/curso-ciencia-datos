Big Night is one of those rare movies that really hits every right note in great filmmaking. It's a passionate and heartfelt movie about the bonds of family and the love of class that gives you a sense of majesty and flavor. Tony Shalhoub and Stanley Tucci, (Who by the way co-directed this film with Campbell Scott) Plays brothers who own a struggling Italian Restaurant who puts everything on the line for one big night to save their business. Primo (Tony Shalhoub) Rather live for his art for fine food than be successful, while Secondo (Stanley Tucci) tries to keep Primo and himself above water while being tempted by the extravagances of owning a successful Restaurant. An all around superb cast of characters backs them up in this journey that includes Mark Anthony as their loyal follow coworker, and Sir Ian Holms as an rival Restaurant owner who tries to help them out. This is a true heartfelt movie that should not be missed under any circumstance.
