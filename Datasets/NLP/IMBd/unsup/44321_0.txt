A case when husband is short and common, ordinary person and wife is tall, model-type, is bound to create confusions and complexes. An interesting premise indeed as today's audience is ready to accept such unconventional subjects but what a pity that neither the idea is developed properly, nor the subject is explored well. This is second feature film of editor turned director Chandan Arora. The film shows lot of promise when it begins but such a thin storyline is not backed by powerful script that requires interesting incidents and characters. Dialogues are too ordinary. The performances of all three lead actors are good but that cannot save the film from becoming a very routine, dull exercise which moves with a snail-pace and follows a common, predictable path with not enough humor or those slice-of-life fine, touching moments to hold audience interest for long. The film we see from point of view of a husband but that also gets lost somewhere. When husband starts suspecting wife the whole premise becomes narrow as this is been done to death in past. Another problem here is characterization, as wife comes across so sugar-sweet and near perfect and husband the innocent, angel type-both very one-dimensional. One plus point of this film is that aspect of a middle class life of Lucknow city is covered well. Another plus is that common box-office ingredients are thankfully avoided here. I wish Makers in general, should understand the fact that when such uncommon themes are chosen, more effort and homework is required in presenting a new angle as well as packing it with interesting elements.
