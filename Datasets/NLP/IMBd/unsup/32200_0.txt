I purchased the Imitation of Life a few months ago, but in the DVD, I found that there were two versions of the movie and I never knew about the 1934 version. I watched it first and fell completely in love with it. I mainly payed more focus to the warmth of Bea Pullman and Delilahs friendship as it progressed over time. When one was down, the other helped build them back up and it stayed that way until Delilah gave her very last breath. Of course, some say that back in the 30's you never found blacks and whites to be so close, (but indeed there were some and Imitation of Life proved that.) As far as Fredi Washingtons character as Peopla, I found myself keen to her more so than any other character. I understood why she felt the way she did about outwardly appearing caucasian on the outside and being African American by race. It does hurt me to see her turn against and deny her mother as the movie ends, but when her mother then dies, it's even more sorrowful that Peola never has the chance to tell her, "Yes I did love you and I should have claimed you as my mother from the start" For anyone who loves a warm, heartfelt classic, you should certainly see Imitation of life (The year 1934)
