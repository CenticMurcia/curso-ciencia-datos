I think "The Wig" simply isn't a good movie. There's are many elements that make it what it is...<br /><br />First thing is the film takes itself way too seriously, while the basic concept the movie is based on is utterly ridiculous. A haunted wig? The idea is just laughable, and the movie isn't original either. Of course, like many other South Korean teen horrors, there's the signature long-haired ghost so obviously ripped from 'Ring' and 'Ju-on'. And overall, the movie isn't very scary (even though we're lead to believe it IS by the trailer): there's a lot of unnecessary gore, and some jump scares that once it's revealed what made you jump, you get mad at the movie for startling you for nothing.<br /><br />The only worthwhile value I saw in this was the back story going on, and it's a very real and sad one: a woman's sister has terminal cancer, and she takes her home to live with her for the time she has left. The sister goes out everyday to take pictures of her having fun, so she can leave behind good memories... And the movie goes towards it's inevitable ending. The problem with this back story is it casts a depressing shadow over the entire film, and makes it painful to watch. And the ending is one of the saddest endings since that of "A Tale of Two Sisters".<br /><br />The only redeeming elements are the acting and the music. The acting is good (but at the same time depressing), and the music is beautifully haunting (but once again sad).<br /><br />If you want scares, you'd be better off with the infinitely better "The Red Shoes (Bunhongsin)". Unless you love being depressed and nothing else, avoid "Gabal" at all costs.<br /><br />My rating: 4/10
