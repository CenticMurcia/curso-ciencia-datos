I like this movie, but it is kind of strange. What I like most is that it is one of those movies about a town where strange things occur. I love those types of movies. Here graves are being robbed and all this other weird stuff is happening and a group of guys investigate this undertaker known as "The Tall Man". Investigating him, they run into many strange happenings as well as supernatural stuff and science fiction stuff as well. This is the best of the series for me. The later editions just try to explain too much...I always thought it was best to leave it unexplained and mysterious. This movie definitely is both of those things...though the plot is a little hard to follow at times.
