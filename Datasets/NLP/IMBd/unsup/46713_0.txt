To be honest i expected to see a punk movie. Something in the lines of the movie SLC Punk but with real punks being punks. I'm a huge siouxsie and the banshees fan and was sad that the only scene she was in is where adam ant is watching the TV, and the band pops up for a couple seconds. The only part i liked was the fact that adam ant was in the movie. And the couple seconds of siouxsie and the banshees in a movie. Maybe I'm the only one that feels this way about the movie. Well i gave it a 4 out of 10, sorry. And what is up with the whole going to the "future" and ending up in just England? They could have gone other parts of the world and see other scenes. But i guess it makes sense because it was a low budget movie. well i do recommend SLC Punk if you haven't yet seen it.
