I couldn't really tell if this movie was suppose to be a serious horror or a comedy? The first opening scene, I figured this movie was going to be a weird horror film... and then it just ventured off into an incoherent teen horror. In which we did not get any character information, it just jumped into the movie and jumped into multiple curses.<br /><br />I must say, some of the starting scenes were creepy, but then they just totally missed the mark and put in unnecessary techno music.<br /><br />After about 45 minutes, I realized that the film was a really bad horror film or a really unfunny comedy.<br /><br />Best scene in the movie was a reference to the original Eye. I laughed pretty hard. Then the rest of the film is just really bad. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
