Out of all of the Studio Ghibli films this World War II animation is my favourite. Set in Japan during the Second World War the story follows Seita and his little sister Setsuko as they survive in a harsh war torn nation in which food and luxuries are short due to wartime efforts.<br /><br />As the narrative progresses the emotional strain of the war is apparent in the way the plot flows. The emotional bond between the brother and sister and the sheer effort of survival.<br /><br />As the film reached it's climax I began to shed tears. Some films move you but Grave of the fireflies simply shatters your hope and well being. As you sympathise with the characters their deteriating condition simply tears away at you emotional strings.<br /><br />The animation is a gritty realism, rather different from the standard principles of animation in which exaggeration is almost necessary to translate emotion to the viewer. But Grave of the fireflies is done so well that even with realistic animation the emotion of the scene translates to the audience.<br /><br />For those of you who haven't seen this film I truly envy you. Because you get the opportunity to watch one of the greatest films of all time for the first time, an experience I wish I could relive.
