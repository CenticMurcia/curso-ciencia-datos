I guess this 'comedy' is aimed at an early teenage audience, in that they are the only ones who will (possibly) find it funny. It is juvenile without wit, intelligence or any of the qualities that make other British comedies so successful. What puzzles me about this is the unbelievable hype that has surrounded and engulfed it. Usually hype is warranted at some level, but in this case I can honestly say there is nothing in this shambles that justifies its reputation. Perhaps this is an indication that there really hasn't been anything decent on British TV for the past decade, save for Ricky Gervais. Lazy catchphrases, undeveloped characters, mind numbingly juvenile humour and an extremely annoying narration from Tom Baker, this is one Brit comedy that should be avoided at all costs. Go watch The Office or Alan Partridge instead.
