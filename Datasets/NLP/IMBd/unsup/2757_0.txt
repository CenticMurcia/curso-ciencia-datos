I picked this DVD off the shelf and flipped it around, looking for the tipoff that this was, indeed, a British flick, since it is called "For Queen and Country". Not surprisingly, no mention of UK was on the jacket (perhaps that hurts sales), only megastar Denzel's face. Knowing Denzel takes good roles, I rented it.<br /><br />But i stopped the DVD halfway through. Although it seemed intelligent, it was boring and not believable. And everyone had a British accent, of course.<br /><br />It's about a black UK paratrooper, fresh from the Falkland war, back in his old crime-ridden London neighborhood. Denzel speaks like a Brit, but his stone face reveals little emotion, and so the viewer has little reason to even like him, other than he was a soldier, I guess. He exudes very little human qualities--the character is paper thin. But we're supposed to think he's a good guy. But the first thing he does is to cover for this hoodlum, and then I was wondering why I should even continue watching it. A good writer knows how to build a sympathetic character. Just because he's Denzel Washington--doesn't cut it. I didn't really care for this guy, and he was not even intriguing. <br /><br />There is no war footage. The Falkland War is filmed as a bunch of soldiers looking out the hatch of some craft (ship?) while it's pitch black outside and you hear some explosions. That's it. Probably not even a ship--just a studio prop they were in.<br /><br />Denzel hooks up with this woman, who happens to be the mother of a kid who burgled his apartment. No matter! They are attracted to each other and never mention the incident again. Huh? That's not believable.<br /><br />His war buddy with the crutch is stereotyped--feeling emasculated, lashing out at everyone, including his wife. Nice guy.<br /><br />Also, it's not believable that Denzel comes home, and his old crime buddies are very interested in having him around. Denzel treats them like they have a disease, but they still knock on his door. You would think they would not trust a guy who's so obviously cleaned up his act. Not these guys. Makes no sense.<br /><br />The film was dry, boring, unconvincing, slow and obviously low budget. And yes,it has annoying British vernacular which can be incomprehensible to other English-speakers. Avoid by all means.
