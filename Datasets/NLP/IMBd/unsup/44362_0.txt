I'm sorry, but I still can't understand why so many people like this movie? I thought it sucked the big one. If you're in to demons, then you should probably skip this one and rent Night of the Demons! The only good part about this movie is Army of Darnkness. It was way too long for the little bit of trash it had in it. And the tree having "sex" with the one chick, who went outside looking for the owner of a strange voice was just LAME with a capital SUCK! Who in the hell goes looking for strange voices in the woods in the middle of the night? Not I. The part with Ash's girlfriend all crazy and possessed, giggling like a psycho was kinda creepy, in a weird "WTF?" kind of way, but that was about it. That is why I asked for my money back when I took this P.O.S back to the video store. Take my word for it...rent Night of the Demons, and give this one a wide berth in the video store. (just make sure it's the 1st one, as the 2nd two suck almost as bad as this movie) 2/10
