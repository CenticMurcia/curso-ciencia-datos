Got see Species: The Awakening today and it was about as expected considering it is the fourth movie in the franchise ,a bit of a letdown from Species-111 but I could not say it was a bad movie. The acting was OK and associated special effects,definitely not a big budget movie and definite shortage of lighting for the most part. Helena Mattsson did not quite seem right for the part of Miranda,it was as though she was an understudy for Nicole Kidman with the soft voice and all associated gentle movements until it was time to be ugly, however I enjoyed it anyway for what it was,a good B grade Saturday afternoon entertainment movie.
