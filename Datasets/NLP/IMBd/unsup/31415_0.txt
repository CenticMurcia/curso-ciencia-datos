i really, truly regret wasting an hour and a half of my life on this adolescent piece of trash. the lack of subtlety is insulting to the intelligence, and the gratuitous nature of the sex and violence featured in this film is simply offensive. and then there is the title, which i doubt could possibly be any more contrived.
