Hersey Cok Guzel Olacak is one of the best products contemporary Turkish cinema can offer, with its modest but solid direction, clever script, and outstanding acting. It is the story of two brothers living in Istanbul, with very different characters, world views, and ambitions. Their differences prove effective as the generator of the comedic effect, although -in my opinion- this movie is also a solid drama rather than a simple comedy.<br /><br />Altan, played by the ever-popular stand-up comedian Cem Yilmaz, is a penniless dreamer, who has plans to open his own pub. He decides to steal some prescription drugs from his brother's pharmacy, and sell them to the mafia in order to get the capital necessary quickly. Long story short, the two brothers find themselves on a dangerous road trip to the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, and adventure unfolds.<br /><br />In his first serious on-screen job, Cem Yilmaz seems surprisingly able in his portrayal of Altan, and demonstrates that he can really act. Mazhar Alanson, who is the lead singer of arguably the best pop music group in Turkey, is also worthy of praise as the older brother. Not many know that he was actually trained as a thespian, and he reminds the audience of this fact with his commanding presence in the film. The late master Selim Nasit also gives his last performance as their father.<br /><br />The movie is exceptionally good, clever, consistently fascinating, warm and funny. Labelling it one of the best of Turkish cinema will not be an exaggeration.
