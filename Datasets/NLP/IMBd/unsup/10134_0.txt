I didn't expect much from this movie at all. Boy, was I surprised to see the most eye-opening story of early colonization of North America! Yes, the movie is rife with small flaws throughout. Sometimes they can be distracting (for example, you lose the illusion that a movie should create and instead you get the feeling that there are production people behind the camera) but still, the story and some of the characters depictions are so strong that you are still left with a haunting and depressing feeling long after the end credits.<br /><br />The best side of this movie is that it shows the life in those times to be as brutal and unappealing as it probably really was. It makes you think twice before you might think: I would like to have lived then! Well, I don't think so now!<br /><br />Unlike DANCES WITH WOLVES, this movie does not have Hollywood, dreamlike romantic qualities. It punches brutal reality right in your face. All the characters are human beings, they are vulnerable, weak, selfish and not even likeable. But somehow you still feel for them.<br /><br />So, would I recommend it? Absolutely, despite the flaws. The story will stay with you for a while. Rating it 8 out of 10.
