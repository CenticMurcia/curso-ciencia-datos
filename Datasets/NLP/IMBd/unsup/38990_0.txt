The premise of this "mockumentary" is preposterous.<br /><br />The idea that slavery was the was the only reason for the Civil War is untrue. Besides this film is filled with so many far fetched inaccuracies that it comes across as bitter and vindictive and not humorous or informative and the only thought it provoked for me was "what's the point". If the C.S.A. had been isolated by the rest of the world because of its neutrality in the Second World War. How could they have been fighting the "Gooks" in Viet Nam and the "Ayrabs" in the Persian Gulf? This is the most racist piece of garbage I have ever seen. Unfortunately many uninformed people who see this steaming pile of excrement will actually believe that the scenario presented is possible and that this is what America is really like.<br /><br />Not surprising that it is a Spike Lee Production.
