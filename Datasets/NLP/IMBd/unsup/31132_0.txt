Just got the game a few hours ago, and holy crap, once you get past the training level, you just don't wanna stop playing the game, its so fun, swinging around new york as spider-man and now BLACK spider-man!, and this time, New york is MUCH larger than in Spider-man 2. You can do so much, and on the Ps3 version, there's 10 Story lines, one of those being the movie storyline of course, this is a massive game, the voice acting is surprisingly great as well. The Swinging and getting up buildings quickly will be hard to grasp at first, but after an hour or two, you won't wanna turn off your ps3.<br /><br />9 out of 10
