Well what can I say except dreadful. Having been a Bottom fan and Young Ones nut I have to say this is awful. If your expecting laughs a minute like the tv show you sadly wont find it here unlike it's first live installment which remains the best.<br /><br />I'd also like to give some credit to the original tv show director Ed Bye, who was not involved here, that his direction with Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson was perhaps the key to the success of the series as with The Young Ones, Red Dwarf etc.<br /><br />As for an arse odditty - it's a wonder the audience never got off them and demanded they're money back.<br /><br />I cringed the whole way through the old jokes feeling sorry for the talented two.<br /><br />2/10
