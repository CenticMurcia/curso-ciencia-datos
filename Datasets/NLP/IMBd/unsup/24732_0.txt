I got this off Ebay for $9 including shipping for the 2-disc version. For that price this movie was a steal, I can't complain at all. <br /><br />I am a fan of the HBO series OZ, and seeing some comments on here comparing the two really had me excited to see this. It didn't disapoint, but it didn't leave me begging for more. It was a good movie, but not something I was jumping for joy over.<br /><br />I think a good attempt was made at giving as much background on the characters as possible, to try to make the audience realize where each person was coming from. You see this in OZ also, as they have flashbacks to life outside of prison leading up to their time in lockdown. The problem is OZ had 6 seasons, each having 8 hours of footage. What I realized over time (and they express this in Carandiru) is prison changes a person, so a lot of the real "character build up" per say actually comes from their life in prison more than their life outside. There wasn't enough time in this film to learn about everyone to really appreciate what some of them were going through. The character oldman for example didn't have enough history behind him to effect me. There were good characters and if given the same amount of time as OZ to build, would be just as powerful. I sit here as I type this and wish there was a series to be honest.<br /><br />The film was well done, and in some ways I enjoyed it more than one of Hector's other films Pixote. I have suggest some friends watch this, but I can't put it in the same category as an Oldboy, Bus 174 or City of God for example. It's just a bit short.
