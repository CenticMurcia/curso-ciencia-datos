Warning... This movie might contain spoilers, but since Im sure you're not going to watch another forgotten cult flick by infamous Ray Dennis Steckler, I won't hold up with spoilers (like there is anything to spoil!).<br /><br />This whole movie felt like one big deja vu. No, seriously. Whole movie is made from three scenes: 1.) The Hollywood Strangler strangles model (or how she calls them, sluts, garbage and "like the rest of them") and then goes of cooling playing with his pigeons(!?) or drinking bear all the time calling his ex Marsha (I think that was her name). Btw, his name is Johnathan Click and he is photographer.<br /><br />2.) The Skid row slasher played by Steckler ex-wife Carolyn Brandt (imagine that) who owns a book store by day and is well wino slasher by night. All she does in this movie is: going to the store to open it, staring at drunk, going for the drunk, slashing the throat or stabbing the drunk and then cooling of the beach. Yeah, I forgot to tell that she HAS to close the store every single scene.<br /><br />3.) Well I can't actually remember what was the 3rd scene...<br /><br />Anyway, whole movie is deja vu. You might think that you are watching the same scenes repeat over and over since all the killing in this movie are done in exact same way and all events are just repeated with different actors or actress.<br /><br />Another important fact of this movie is that it's a SILENT movie made in '70. I love those '70, those were the time (and '80) where you could put anything on the screen. Steckler hated sound and he also hated spending money on recording sound so he made a silent movie. When she showed up this movie to producers they thought he gave them some random footage of his vacation he shot while driving from the car. But no, Steckler was serious as always so producers decided to PAY HIM just to put some dialogs and sound into the movie. What Steckler has done is that he recorded lines and mixed them so it looks like we are in the mind of a serial killer (Hollywood Strangler) and narration in the movie are actually his thoughts. Clever idea even by Steckler's standards. Is there no sarcasm in my sentences? Not at all? there's a funny fact how the hell this movie was made. Steckler was on his movie-making class when he start discussion with students where he told them that he could make a scene in the dark with using only his camera and two lights. Result: He made a slasher scene where killer is slashing homeless drunk. Of course he got 75% of his answer incorrect, but who cares! THE Hollywood STRANGLER MEETS THE SKID ROW SLASHER was born from that scene! (since Steckler didn't want to waste all that used movie track he had) Why am I not telling anything about plot? Well... there is actually no plot except for the two scenes I told you about. There is lot of nudity, but no plot. It's a Steckler movie and you should know that he was PORN director in '70. He even used footage from his other movie in this one (from "Plato's Retreat West" the Rollerblade nude dance scene. Don't rush it, there are no hot bodies to look for here. Well, you might find it beautiful if you like to see naked body of a sixty years old virgins. I'm serious about this one. There is maybe one thirty years old girl in this scene which is NOT hot at all.) Bottom line: This movie suck like rest of the Ray Dennis Steckler movies, but if you are fun of his work you might like this (but you may not even if you are fun because this movie really sucks!). If you are a extreme lover of horrible movies check this one out, if not RUN LIKE HELL FROM THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />Ps. Don't be fooled by director's name of Wolfgang Schmidt, it's one of many names Steckler has been using during his unsuccessful career.
