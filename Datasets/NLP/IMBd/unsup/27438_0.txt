A black and white film that looks like animation but is none. The film is a very, very personal rewriting of Gulliver's Travels to Lilliput. In fact the whole film concentrates on two small kingdoms in Lilliput that are planning to marry their princess and prince but the fathers have a disagreement on which of two songs will have to be played at the wedding, "Faithful" or "Forever". And that leads to war. Gulliver is going to bring peace to this part of the world by making love win and by joining, merging, splicing them together. This rewriting is just charming but that's all. What makes that film unique is its date, 1939. That was a dream of this film maker to have peace in Europe, to bring together Hitler and Chamberlain, Freedom and Fascism like he was bringing Faithful and Forever together. A dream full of naive peace-loving but also blind humanism. In 1939, due to all kinds of mistakes for at least twenty years the war had become inescapable, unavoidable. But it is always refreshing to go back to the great idea that peace is possible in this world provided we accept to respect the other and to look for a reasonable compromise. But what happens when such a reasonable compromise is no longer possible? We look for Weapons of Mass Destruction, of course.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
