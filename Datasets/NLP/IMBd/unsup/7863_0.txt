It has been at least fifteen years since I saw a movie so bad that I nearly walked out on it (I did, in fact, walk out on 'Short Circuit 2'). Disney's attempt to capitalize on a halfway-decent theme park ride with this bowser of a movie was nearly as bad.<br /><br />I will admit, there were two things that I liked about it: First, the self-animated crystal ball, complete with its englobulated (oooh, new word!) gypsy-with-an-attitude. Second, watching Eddie Murphy get upstaged by the barbershop quartet of singing busts (one of which bore a suspiciously strong resemblance to Walt Disney himself).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I like Eddie Murphy as an actor, generally. His first 'Doctor Dolittle' movie was pretty decent, even though he'll never be able to truly replace Rex Harrison. He also did pretty well in 'The Golden Child' and the first couple of 'Beverly Hills Cop' movies.<br /><br />I really think, though, that he deserved better than this pale wraith of a flick. As far as 'Haunted Mansion' is concerned, I think I can safely say 'Bag it and tag it.'<br /><br />
