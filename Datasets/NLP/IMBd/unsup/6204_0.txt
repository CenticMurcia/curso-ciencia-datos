It is not a laugh a minute comedy there are some funny moments but the film really is about ordinary women in their fifties trying to do some charity work by doing the extraordinary i.e. posing nude to sell calendars. The scenes where they stripped off was very tastefully executed and the actresses concerned are very attractive despite their mature years. It was interesting to watch the effects on their lives after the publicity and this is something which The Full Monty did not touch on.<br /><br />I loved the film and want to buy it when it comes out on DVD. I gave it 9 out of 10 and would recommend my friends to go and see it.
