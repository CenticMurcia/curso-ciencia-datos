"Maniac Cop" is made with enough skill to be watchable, but don't look for anything even remotely original or creative here. It's formulaic stuff, just another pretty basic slice-and-dice entry. It probably had been a quite ambitious project, with an indestructible killer in the Michael Myers - Freddy Krueger tradition, but the result is thoroughly routine. (*1/2)
