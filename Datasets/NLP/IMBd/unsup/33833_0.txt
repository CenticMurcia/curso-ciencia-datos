I watch the movie because it's been rated in my local magazine. I thought I should give it a try. Then again, it's nice. But even though it's full of child imagination in it (robot friend in school, entering game's world, be friend with a cute girl friend...), the story is to typical towards the end. I know earthquake happened a lot in Japan, but please, why must you make the earthquake happened while Jun is on the top of the chimney? It's spoiled the whole movie. The climax has made the movie quality decrease... Like the story writer is so lazy to think about the scene. I think the scene is the worst part, because the earthquake made me laugh rather than be scared of Jun's fall...
