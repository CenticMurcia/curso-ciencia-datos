How idiotic was this film? How is this film even a Jaws rip-off? Jaws had a story, hell, Barracuda had a story - this film has real footage of a meandering Tiger Shark and it's NOT scary.<br /><br />The best part of this film was Susan George and Fiona Lewis, both looked stunning when they wear nothing.<br /><br />As for the 'plot' - 2 guys hang out, pick up women, have 3-somes, and hunt sharks - why? Does it matter? And the way these guys act when they pick up women - WOW - you know you're in a movie as this stuff would never work in real life.<br /><br />If you like beaches, boats, real shark footage, and Susan George pouting, watch it....but if you are expecting a good 'fish' film...steer clear...very clear...
