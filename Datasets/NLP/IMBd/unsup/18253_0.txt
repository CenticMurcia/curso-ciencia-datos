I think this film does a very good job capturing the period of 1917 New Orleans and shows a different side to early 20th century America. I love the music in film (i.e. Jelly Roll Morton and Scott Joplin), the set is wonderful, and the acting is good. Much of the nudity, however, is completely unnecessary. It tarnishes the story, which is actually quite absorbing.
