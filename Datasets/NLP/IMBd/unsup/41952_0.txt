I have just watched this film and found it completely boring. The only reason I watched it in the first place was the fairly high rating and good reviews. After reading a little about the director and his previous films, I can understand the attraction that other viewers may of felt and the respect for the director (based on his previous films) that gave rise to the high rating and good reviews, but this is my first (and possibly last!) Tarkovsky film and as such I can only rate it on the past two hours - It was very, very boring! In my opinion the director had no regard whatsoever for the idea of an audience, the people who want to be entertained, and had made this film with only himself in mind. It should of stayed that way - a home movie for Tarkovskys use only!
