An honest attempt at doing the same thing millions of movies have done before. Not even amusing in its horribleness.<br /><br />It's a familiar story, with extremely familiar characters. Scarily so. There is the fat one, the athletic one, the rebel, the nerdy girl and all of them do exactly what you expect them to while being stalked by an escaped bunny man.<br /><br />It starts off with a somewhat creepy yet overplayed idea of a twisted family...then it just turns to crap. After they find their friends dead, it becomes of dire importance to go back into the house to retrieve a pair of pants and Nikes.<br /><br />It's ridiculous. And the "acting"...I got the feeling they were fed lines as things were happening.<br /><br />One girl stabs another (it's not a spoiler because nobody can possibly care enough about the plot to be disappointed when the predictable happens yet again) and apologizes...but she's kind of laughing when she does it.<br /><br />Too many examples. Not even enjoyable as a terrible movie. I wasted my time so you wouldn't have to.<br /><br />Please, don't see this movie.
