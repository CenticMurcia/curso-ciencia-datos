I think it's a wonderful movie and it's been unjustly underestimated:it's oneiric,sentimental,poetic and the dramatic plot is dealt with a sense of humour.There are various issues like male bonding,homosexuality,friendship and I think every role is proper for the actor who plays it:my favourite actor JOHN MALKOVICH(GREAT)is a homosexual with some existential problems and he falls in love with Marty(Michael Zelniker)and they get engaged at the end of the film;Dennis(Kevin Bacon)has in vain tried to get successful in Hollywood as a musician,Al(Joe Mantegna)grows up thanks of Jamie Lee Curtis,Vinny(Tony Spiridakis)dreams to become an actor and Ray(Ken Olin)a painter.Even if the dreams of some of these guys don't come through,their strong and profound tie is the reason to continue to hope in the future.I also think the title is the only very funny thing of the movie(in Italian language it's "Dreaming Manhattan")but the film succeeds to alternate melancholy and thoughtless scenes:Mantegna climbs up the bridge which links Astoria to Manhattan,Ken Olin listens to his message "I love you guys" while he's thinking about his life,Kevin Bacon and Michael Zelniker play "ordinary people song" while Zelniker and Malkovich look at each other,Malkovich jilts Terry Kinney,who had fallen in love with him,because he doesn't like the way he talks about his friends(when Kinney asked him if those guys were his type,he replied "that I don't know but they are the best I could do"),Tony Spiridakis howls with a healer without a reason,Tom Waits reads his odd poem at Jack's,Jamie Lee Curtis takes Mantegna's gun and learns him to throw all away,Chloe Webb tells Madame Rose,a palmist, she's surrounded by idiots,the five boys shout out Arnold's name while they're having a bath under Hellgate during the night because he was the only guy,apart from Mantegna,who climbed up that bridge and they don't see Linda Fiorentino stealing their clothes out of spite,because her husband Mantegna spent all his time with his friends(he also kisses John Malkovich at the disco)...well,these guys are amazing!They are either crazy or gay,either sad or happy,sometimes they make you cry,sometimes they make you amuse.Personally I was a depressed sixteen year old girl when I saw this movie for the first time on a night during last summer and it made me dream:this movie is everything for me,it lets me to take refuge in another world and it makes me isolate from my reality,whom I hate as much as I can, but fortunately I'm not here,I'm under Hellgate Bridge to dream with other Queens.I thank Tony Spiridakis,who wrote the story,and all the actors very much for this wonderful movie!!!
