Spoiler-Peter Cushing does not drive a stake through Christopher Lee's heart in this movie. This is classic science fiction, make no mistake. It has a status quo established among isolated characters, interrupted by eerie events. In this case the status quo is a love triangle with some other interesting British type characters and interesting British atmosphere, not to mention giants Lee and Cushing playing remarkably believable people, particularly Cushing, whose character is so believable in his errors as well as his attributes. The isolation is an island which is burning in doom. The temperature is rising drastically, and the reason is all too clear for those who watch and know it is a horror film, but of course not to the people on the island. The characters make this movie fascinating. And the ending is very provoking. One scene, in particular, in which the gorgeous tramp and a minor male character are trapped with no hope, and the totally unexpected happens in their actions, but it rings of truth in such circumstances. Very suspenseful, very well done. One of the great science fiction movies, and one of the most underrated.
