I have to admit I didn't watch the beginning of or even the middle of the movie, I'm glad I didn't for fears of what it would have done to my delicate psyche. All I could think about was how horrible the acting is, I mean seriously some of the most insipid acting i've ever seen it was dull, unmotivated and completely fake i've seen more motivation in a Viagra Commericial. And did anyone NOTICE THE SNOW? Geeees, looked like confetti you bought at the Dollar Store.<br /><br />Anyhow seriously folks, don't waste your time on this piece of garbage.<br /><br />I have to say you'll leave the couch or wherever you happen to see this with a fear of horrible acting.
