Not exactly something for the 'whole' family, as the plot of the flick is about the porn industry (with a slight twist). However, if above the legal age of viewing, totally worth the look. I laughed so hard I missed a few of the jokes, they where one right after the other. Very well done. One to try and catch whenever/wherever you might be able to.
