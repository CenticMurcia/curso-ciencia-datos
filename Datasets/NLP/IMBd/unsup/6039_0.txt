Kathy Griffin is without doubt one of the best stand-up comedians of all time. She's hilarious! Her observations on life, politics and celebrity culture in particular are always dead on, witty and ultimately thought-provoking. She is unafraid to share her experiences no matter who she offends in the process and it is this honesty that makes her so funny. Allegedly is one of her many specials and as they are all excellent, I cannot choose a favourite. However, needless to say, if you love Kathy or comedy in general, you will not be disappointed! You'll be quoting her as soon as the show is over, if not during it! She is awesome!
