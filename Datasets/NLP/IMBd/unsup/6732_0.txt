If you like Jerry Seinfeld you'll like BEE MOVIE; if you don't...you won't. I'm in the latter camp, but watched to see what the hype was about. Barry B. Benson(Seinfeld)is a new graduate and must decide his future. Instead of being a worker bee with the same job everyday forever is not that appealing. He would rather be a pollen jock and go out into the world and collect nectar, but he knows that job is but a lofty dream for a young bee. Barry soars out into the world on his own and breaks one of the most important rules of beedom...he speaks to a human. He is saved from a bad situation by Vanessa Bloome(Renee Zellweger)a florist; and through that relationship Barry decides to sue the human race for manufacturing honey. Some pretty big named stars lend their voices: Chris Rock, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Kathy Bates, Rip Torn and Michael Richards.
