I was impressed by the non-judgmental view of Skinheads, as Cookson exposes the hatred you can find everywhere in the U.S. by simply turning on the cameras and letting these people reveal themselves to us. I'm sure some viewers will see this and think the opposite that I did about the people this exposes. There's a scene with people discussing different viewpoints on the streets of a city that I think illustrates the way this should be handled in America: open, non-violent discourse where each side listens to the other - I believe this is called "communication".<br /><br />Very well done, and just after filming the skinheads shown here were arrested on weapons violation charges, which is another method the law has of getting rid of "undesirables" who otherwise may not be committing any known crimes.
