Forget "Goodfellas" Forget "King Of New York" Forget "Casino" And YES Forget "The Godfather" The Long Good Friday makes them all look TAME. Without doubt the most convincing and realistic mob movie there has ever been. Bob Hoskins takes total and utter control and the man IS Harold Shand within the first moment you see him. When people ask me what is your favourite movie I have no hesitation when naming The Long Good Friday. Watch it, you'll see what I mean mate.
