I adored this show for the most part. The first season was offbeat, quirky and unique. Catherine Tate and Dawn French are both brilliant as always, and the writing was excellent, managing to create a thoroughly enjoyable black comedy. The second series, however, left something to be desired in my opinion. The writing seemed uneven and flat, and where the first series made you care about the characters, the second leaves you feeling rather unsympathetic. There also seemed to be forced "tender moments" that don't really resonate. However, even the second series is worth watching, and there are definitely some good moments to remember.
