I saw this movie when it was first released, and then again last week on video. I still think it is one of the most graphic, shocking depictions of the '90 s club scene to be put on screen. If any future sociologist wanted to examine the 90's phenomenon of the drug and sex crazed underworld of a large European metropolis' club scene, MAS QUE AMOR FRENESI would be a perfect document. Madrid indeed offers Europe's most intense nightlife, and it is depicted to the hilt in this wild film. No sterotypical character is left out, from the flashy drag queens to the self absorbed gigolos, from a lesbian madame to a fascist cop, who takes S & M to levels seldom seen on the screen. The sex scenes (of all persuasions) go beyond soft porn. The drug use is so pervasive, it seems sex is not practiced unless one is on Ecstasy or LSD (with side hits of cocaine every few minutes). Otherwise, alcohol and marijuana always accompany the omnipresent cigarette in the scenes not involving sex. All this behavior is played out by an all-star cast of established young actors, three years later already among Spain's most memorable actors of the last 20 years, including Nancho Novo, Ingrid Rubio, Juan Diego Botto, Javier Bardem, and in even Penelope Cruz, in a cameo role. This film is worth seeing for curiosity value alone.
