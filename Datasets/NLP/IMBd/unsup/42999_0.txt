Ia m trying g to watch the movie at the same time I am writing this comment. To be honest with all of you, I know there are man different kind of tastes but this sis simply too much for me. <br /><br />Johnnie To is one of the greatest directors ever in this century, but with this movie he showed me at what kind of a level a good director has to drop down so you get at least good money income in theaters. How is it possible that the people are so dumb to go watch rubbish like that and wanted for example. And the worst case scenario is that the actors don't even seem to think about what kind of movie they are acting in. <br /><br />Bad special effects, a plot with no sense at all, bad directions from Ka Fai and to and I think, the worst acting ever in a chines movie.<br /><br />I really wish people start to change and to go to cinema to see some good and interesting movies so the directors with talents can go back to their former passion of doing a movie.
