I bought this movie after enjoying the first two, and knowing that the movies would have nothing in common. While watching the film, I took note of a few things, these were: The acting was very poor and would have been better if performed by monkeys, the lighting was so dark that you could barely see anything correctly, the audio track was so quite that you could barely understand the actors, and it lost all meaning of the story rather quickly.<br /><br />The only good part of the movie, was the end. I was sorely disappointed and only keep in around as a place filler in my DVD rack. Seriously, Barney the Purple Dinosaur strikes as better entertainment.
