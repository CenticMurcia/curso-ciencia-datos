I'm not quite sure why this film has gotten so much hype and attention. It's okay, but I have to admit, I'm confused as to why (as someone stated) it has won so many festivals. And which festivals are they? The film is okay if you compare it to films made by young teenagers. But given the age of those involved in this one, I would've expected more. Rather amateur on most levels except one. The only thing that really stands out is the concept of the film. Not the execution of the story or the film as a whole, just the concept by itself. So, if you put it up against very poor student short films, I guess I could see how it might stand out, with a decent concept that was captured.
