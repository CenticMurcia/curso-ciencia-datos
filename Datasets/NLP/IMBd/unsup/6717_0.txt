Oh for the days when animated movies could be enjoyed by the whole family. Not only was this movie boring, it didn't even follow the science of bees! It had it's moments. The bee stuff was almost reasonable. As soon as the humans came into it the story completely derailed. A courtroom scene in a kids' movie? Come on! No chemistry, no story, little humor, and a completely ignorant and inaccurate portrayal of the bees' place in the world means I will not be taking my nieces and nephews to see this film. They had a great opportunity to subtly explain the importance of pollination, the way all life is intertwined, even the workings of capitalism, but instead they decided to take the oh-so-popular stand that humans are bad for the planet. It rates a three because I did laugh a few times and I didn't walk out in disgust.
