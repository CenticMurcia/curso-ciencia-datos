If you're a race fan, you may not have heard of Wendell Scott. He was one of the most under rated race car drivers of all time, and for all of the wrong reasons. It really makes a person wonder how great he might have been if someone looked beyond the color of his skin.<br /><br />This movie captures that struggle Wendell must of felt. This movie also shows what a great actor Richard Pryor really could have been if he was cast in more serious rolls, instead of just comedies. Sure there there was some humor in this movie, but nothing like his later movies. Richard and Clevon Little played well off of each other. Maybe this is why this movie is all but forgotten about because this movie is somewhat out of character for Richard. Sure, it is not completely an accurate account of Wendell's life, but it is one best movies Richard Pryor ever made.<br /><br />So if you see it, don't expect a scream fest. But may I suggest that you see it just to see what a great actor, not comedian Richard Pryor was.
