For my first review of a TV show, why not pick one of the finest programs of the 90s? Most shows about high school are overtly dramatic, unrealistic, dumb, and most of all dull. Shows such as "Dawson's Creek" and "Boy Meets World" turn my stomach into knots. Thats why I was so surprised (not to mention refreshed by) "Freaks and Geeks". This is more representative of my high school experience than any other show (I was a freak). Its a shame that some idiot executive took this off the air. It goes to prove that the head honchos don't know quality when they see it and instead allow a number of abyssal reality shows or sitcoms to run for multiple seasons. Still, what we have is near perfect.<br /><br />Admittedly this show suffers from some of the same problems a lot of other youth shows do. The acting ranges from very good to pretty poor (particularly from guest roles). Also, it can be awkward at times. Fortunately, the writing is so superb that it completely compensates for any shortcomings. "Freaks and Geeks" takes realistic and believable situations and makes them entertaining. The thing about the show that works the best for me though are the characters. Every character was multi-dimensional and lovable. There isn't a single false note or a moment when you don't sympathize with the protagonists. These are the kind of people you'd like to hang out with in real life. "Freaks and Geeks" is one of the finest shows ever on network television, and its a shame it didn't reach a wider audience. (8/10)
