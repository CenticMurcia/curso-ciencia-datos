I truly thought it was made in the 30s.<br /><br />The bad acting, the jagged B&W cuts, the seeming lack of a plot! (and GOD don't get me started on that unconvincing model the old bloke hides behind that our "vampire queen" reports to!) I don't care if it's supposed to be ironic - it's cheap & amateurish.<br /><br />The ABYSMAL sword fight - leave it out!!<br /><br />I'm really sorry, but I watche dthis film and deflated as it went on - it's everything Brecht would have hated, Schechner would have found it a joke, and Sarah Kane probably saw 30 minutes less in than I did.<br /><br />But hey! I adore Star Trek: Hidden Frontier.<br /><br />Judge for yourself.<br /><br />(It AIN'T "Fire walk with me" - that had gravitas!!) <br /><br />D
