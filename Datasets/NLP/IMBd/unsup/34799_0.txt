I had the privilege of meeting the great man himself, Al Pacino. He is a God to me. However even God makes mistakes too. This mistake was 88 Minutes. The man who portrayed Tony Montana in Scarface & Frank Serpico in Serpico has really disappointed with this latest release.When I met Mr. Pacino the day after he won his Best Actor Oscar for Scent of a Woman. I was in awe of this man.He was making another soon-to-be classic, Carlito's Way.I remember thinking this is a man who will never drop the ball as an actor- he will never give a bad performance- he will never not deliver....but you know what he has and it took only 88 Minutes.
