I saw this movie at The Hong Kong Lesbian & Gay Film Festival, though this funny, witty and entertaining movie about love and passions set against a cross-cultural, Glaswegian background could be featured at any film festival. I laughed at the witty, self-humorous dialogue, jiggled in my seat alongside the Bollywood songs, and drooled at the sight of all that delicious food. This is a rare gem which entertains the majority and identifies with the minority. You'll end up rushing to your nearest Curry House and checking out the chef! Here's one funny girl loves girl story which doesn't end in tears for a change. It can and does happen! Thank you Pratibha! Hope we don't have to wait another 7 years for the next one.
