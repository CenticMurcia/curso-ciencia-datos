If you can sit through this mess without wanting to vomit, i would say you either agreed with the slanted view of the world (that corporations are EVIL) or you hadnt gotten any sleep the night before and passed out during the film. It didn't even try to be fair, it was so one sided and filled with the typical liberal elitists (Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, etc). The film winds up "proving" how evil corporations are by linking American corporations with Nazi Germany. Preposterous. Absolutely vile. It calls the organized anti-freetrade mobs that burned and looted "grass roots" - when they are anything but (you don't get 5000 people to spontaneously attack a free trade meeting without some sort of support, logistics, planning, etc). Bringing on a straw man conservative to "rebutt" their liberal agenda, only to have him say the most inane and moronic things, which are instantly crushed by the liberal propaganda spewers that dominate this film is shameful. It was disgusting, it was one sided, and it reminded me of the 1960's retreads that come out every now and again to rally people to their cause only to fall apart again once they realize no one is listening. It was just a pile of junk. Look at the writer and director, he has done nothing but make films with agendas time and time again. don't expect a fair fight, but please don't try to laugh when the nazi flags are paraded around and "evidence" shows IBM, the evil corporation, somehow helped kill millions of Jews. Give us all a break already, you aren't fooling anyone.
