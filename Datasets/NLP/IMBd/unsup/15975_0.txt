Before watching this film I've already seen a third part and I was expecting this film to be similar with Death Wish 3 but actually these are pretty different films. In a third part there were a lot of action and in this one there is almost no action just some short shoot-out scenes. But this film is better in it's own way. Charles Bronson's character is a vigilante who is looking for criminals in the streets and killing them. He is also inspiring other people to fight crime. Actually there is a lot of this kind of movies but this one is much more intriguing. So if you are expecting to see some action - this movie isn't the best choice but if you just wand to see a good vigilante-thriller, then you may like it.
