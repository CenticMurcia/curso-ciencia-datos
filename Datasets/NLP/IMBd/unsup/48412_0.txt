Through hypnosis, a woman is able to visit a previous life where she is to be put to death for being a witch Â– a charge of which she is innocent. But if she is able to change her fate and avoid the executioner's ax, what will that mean for her future? How will changing history affect the present?<br /><br />Come on people! While The Undead does present a few interesting ideas and a couple of entertaining moments, it's not worthy of the praise it has received in many of the reviews on IMDb. I started to think that maybe all these people watched a different movie. The Undead is a low-budget Roger Corman quickie that's just not very good regardless of what Leonard Maltin thinks. I just don't get it. When one of the most positive aspects of the film I can think of is the fit of Allison Hayes' outfits, you can get a good idea of my thoughts on the movie. My 4/10 is incredibly generous.
