Done with great care, Judy Garland: By Myself (2004) underscores the fact that her legacy is on film. Some really wonderful musical moments are included in this film. The narrations were well done. As I watched performance after performance, I realized no one could tell Judy's story like Judy -- her songs tell it all! This film also touched on one of Judy Garland's greatest joys: motherhood. Some of my favorite moments in this film was the scenes with her children, they were so touching. Also, the unsuccessful string of marital relationships were alluded to, but, not elaborated on (perhaps that was a touch of discretion on the part of the film makers).<br /><br />I saw the Wizard of Oz (1939) on TV when I was a kid. I continued to watch her movies on TV down through the years, growing to appreciate her performances more and more. I loved it when Judy Garland paired up with Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. Watching these show biz heavy weights on film together, it was magic! And, viewing her later performances, one could see the fire still in her eyes, she was such a fighter! This film gives an apt representation of Judy Garland's career; her ups and her downs, her victories and defeats. It even touches on how the industry ravished Judy Garland's genius to their own selfish ends. Despite being at the mercy of the entertainment system and a stage mom who allowed the abuse to go on (over work, drug abuse & etc), Judy Garland was able to give timeless performance after performance.<br /><br />I do not think that you can do justice to her life's work in two hours, but, this film does her life's work some justice.
