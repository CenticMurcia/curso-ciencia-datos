I love almost every single moment of the movie, however all the "Americans" including the "Korean-Americans" were horrible actors! c'mon.... wth??? I think they were limited on selection "We CANNOT, Lose THIS, important, LOCATION!" the general speaks in segments, emphasizing at the wrong times, making it just so fake. The air squad that sky dived was also bad actors. So it just wasn't the main American actor from Dongmokgol. Speaking of actors/actresses, the others were excellent! Well anyways, I watched it with several others and they had the same opinion as I did, and I was really disappointed in the American actors. Besides some of the horrible acting, there was a weird part in the plot that I didn't particularly like.<br /><br />The squad that went to same Seu Miss (smith, lol still cracks me up), got killed by butterflies? These guys are supposed to be pros. Not only that, they didn't even bring radios either??? Not one of them had a radio or some way to contact their commander? Not very likely... and bombing an area with little information about the terrain. I don't know too much about military tactics, but it seems odd to me.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong though, I gave this a 9! I loved the movie and music, just some cons that bothered me.
