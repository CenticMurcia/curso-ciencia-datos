Cheesing heading for a review, yes I know but it was the scarification or bloody cuts on the womans back, on the DVD cover. I was going to give this movie an 8 due to it being a good movie of it's kind but now that I've just seen the whole story it's a sure 10.<br /><br />As with most Asian language-edited cinema, the acting seems corny but if you can by pass that, you'd see a great story. Of course there's gore but the thing is, that it's not senseless just for schock value. If you follow the story completely to the end you'll see everything has its place.<br /><br />I'm lucky to have picked this movie because with a franchise like _________________________ (insert corporate video franchise of your choice), you'd never know.<br /><br />By the way, Mr. Panor is so devilishly beautiful that it's a trip to see how cold and heartless she is.
