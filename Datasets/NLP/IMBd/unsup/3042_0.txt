Story of four friends growing up in the ghetto, with one going "nuts" on the others. Really good performances by Epps and Shakur, and Hopkins gives great comic relief at times. Eerie seeing Bishop gradually turning more and more evil and bloodthirsty. A lot of action and violence here, but hey, it's only entertainment, right?
