... this movie was lacking a great script and the touch of realism. The dialogue was muddled & confusing, and trying really hard to be philosophical and touching, but unfortunately, missed it completely. I often got frustrated and screamed, "what?!"... it was quirky and unrealistic. Sometimes the quirkiness adds to the charm of the movie (like Being John Malkovich), here it felt really fake. Like it was trying to match Sideways from a Mexican American point of view.<br /><br />Here's my other problem with it. The realism of having a tall, skinny, light-skinned Mexican woman with no boyfriend and a wonderfully behaved kid working as a live-in housekeeper just seems like a male fantasy trying to play reality. I mean, how realistic is that? The acting was average at best, but a really poor performance by the daughter of Adam Sandler's character (sometimes you can see her trying to cover up a smile while getting angry).<br /><br />While I tried to like this movie and the story definitely had a lot of potential, there were major problems and this one had a snore factor. Some things could have been explored more, like the dad's relationship with the kids (you rarely saw how they bonded) and the stupid dog thing could have been cut. Well, it could be worth a look/see if it's on cable, but save your rental fee or $20.
