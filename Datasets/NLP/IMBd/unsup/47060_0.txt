shaadi no 1 is a real bad movie. the most important point that makes it bad is the corniness. i mean, if the Indian audience found the lines hilarious, then they must get a reality check. i mean, even a third-grader would have difficulties in laughing at those lines. the only reason i was laughing in the theatre was because i was laughing at the actors but not with them.<br /><br />the acting too was pretty pathetic except sanjay dutt who did a decent job(although he got irritating in the second half). I also feel that sophie and riya sen must get some acting lessons.<br /><br />i give this movie a 0.25/100. an advise, don't watch this movie at all.
