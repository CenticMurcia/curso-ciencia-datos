This really is like Smokey and the Bandit in that there is a deadline, a great race, and an all-star cast, which makes this work like an unintentional (?) remake of "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World." This was my very first glimpse of Jackie Chan on the big screen, too, as it was for many Americans.<br /><br />This flick stars Burt Reynolds, Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Dom DeLuise, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Jack Elam, Adrienne Barbeau, Terry Bradshaw, Jackie Chan, Bert Convy, Jamie Farr, Peter Fonda, and dozens more! The only one missing from this work was Sally Field, and she WAS sorely missed.<br /><br />This has been held in chronological remake order as 2 of 3 in the set; the set being "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" , "Cannonball Run" , and "Rat Race," but in the #3 spot in terms of popularity. Unbelievably, Rat Race is a tad better rated.<br /><br />This is still one of my favorites from the early 1980's, and as such, it rates a 7.3/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
