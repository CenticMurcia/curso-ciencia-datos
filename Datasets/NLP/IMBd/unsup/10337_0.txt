If you (as I do) rate films & plays by how much after-show interesting conversation they provoke, then this film is at the top. Go with at least one other person and leave time afterwards to discuss: How far over the sanity line is she, or is she? Is he or isn't he? Did he or didn't he? How much of what her mother-in-law talls her is true? What does she believe and when does she believe it? What are her choices about what to believe, and what are the implications of each choice. Is she capable of making a choice?<br /><br />
