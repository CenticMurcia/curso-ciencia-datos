This movie is a true 70's classic! If you are / or have been a 13yr old girl, you have dreamed that you could be Jessie and have the experiences she has in this movie!! Every girl dreams of the perfect guy and Micheal is as close as it comes! <br /><br />It is pure fantasy but it is so entertaining that you can't look away! I saw this movie in 1978, bought the soundtrack on LP and then all of Rex Smith's albums! I am a true fan and this movie is an all-time favorite!<br /><br />Imagine "Michael Skye" writing and singing a song just for you! Stars that glisten, Lips for kissing, Honey listen, It's true, No one ever, Loved you better, Love you Honey, I Love You!! It's too good! <br /><br />The parents are so out of touch, it's funny, they are on the right track but a little too late! At least they have raised a pretty good/smart girl and she can take care of herself. Caroline is too cute as the best friend. And Karen, although she is not in the book, is a good addition, because she adds a layer to Michael that makes him more adorable because he resists her and holds out for Jessie, his true love!
