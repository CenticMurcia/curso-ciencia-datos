This is a straightforward, almost documentary style look at the status of women in the Taliban days of Afghanistan. <br /><br />The beauty of the movie relies on the clever photography on not going too graphic, not over emphasizing on the oppressors and at the same time does not draw too much melodramatics in form of emotional music. Its also a short movie which makes good viewing.<br /><br />Osama is the story of a pre-teen girl who lives with her widowed mother (a doctor) and grandmother. She will eventually crop her hair short and go out into society disguised as a boy to earn for her family (Women were not allowed to work so they basically starved without any resources of income).<br /><br />The movie does not preach in any apparent direction but it highlights the plight of the women under this feudal system. Most is left to the viewer's rhetoric.<br /><br />It may be disturbing for people who were never aware of facts described in this movie but for others it will be a reminder of what once happened. Watch this movie, not to build up prejudices, but to open one's awareness .<br /><br />Cheers
