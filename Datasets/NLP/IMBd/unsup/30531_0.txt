Perfectionist Hitchcock did not like the opening flaw of this film story, where the initial flashback does not match the rest of the film. But this film is so much more than that once I viewed it. It might be the only film where Hitch does 2 Cameos - though one is so subtle that it is hard to catch while the other is very obvious. <br /><br />The film does continue most of the themes of his prior work. Stairways are a central theme within the plot. Camera angles are used with very great care.<br /><br />Mostly this is a great performance film. For whatever reason, the cast all have some of their best roles acting on film. Jane Wyman & Marlene Dietrich are both great. While Dietrich might have a better performance someplace, this is the best Wyman I have ever seen anywhere. <br /><br />The male cast is fantastic, every one of them. In this film Alstair Sim (who would play Scrooge the next year) has his best performance in any film of his I have seen in addition to the classic as Wymans father. The support in this film is so strong that by the end, the viewer does not care about the beginning not making complete sense because Hitch & the actors have overcome that with a well made movie.<br /><br />Hitchcocks next Warner film would be Dial M For Murder. While that one is more famous, this movie filmed in London with a strong British cast is worth while viewing.
