This is an art film! It is weird, but take it for its beauty and its amazing animation, rather than a film to make a point. Foriegness is beautiful!<br /><br />Enjoy this film for its richness of animation, its color choice, its music. Every aspect of this film blows me away. It is like you are in a different place. And that is the beauty of this film. You get to feel as foreign as the young lady in the film. There is wonder in all that is new and there is a beauty in what is foreign.<br /><br />Also there is a bit of humor in this film. its humor is in the mockery of British life, the rain. The words she learns are part of this mockery.<br /><br />watch this film.
