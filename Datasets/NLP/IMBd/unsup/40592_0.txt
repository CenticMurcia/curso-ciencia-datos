I'm astounded that a show this bad could have made it on a major network. It would have been rejected as a cable access program. The only reason I gave it 2 stars, and not 1, is because the animation is beautiful. The writing, however, is about as amateurish as can be. I'm sure a 6 year old who speaks ONLY Bulgarian could have done better. It is insulting, unfunny and STUPID. The voices are so grating that it actually caused me physical pain to listen to the show.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, weird can be good and sometimes great, but this show is neither, and weird for weird's sake is just BORING.<br /><br />The person at the CBC who green-lit this junk should really be out on their ear. What on earth were they thinking! This really has to be the lowest that Canadian TV can sink.
