this movie has elements of other movies,some better(Cujo,Man's Best friend)some not as good(Rottweiler).the idea of a group of people stranded on an island and fighting for their lives is nothing new,either.this particular movie doesn't really add anything new to the genre.it's also pretty slow,with not very much suspense or tension.yet i found it just interesting enough to be entertaining.by entertaining,i mean,i think's worth a cheap rental,and i wouldn't buy it unless you can get it cheap.for me,the movie held promise,but just didn't deliver.i wasn't overly interested in any of the characters.for me,The Breed is a 4/10
