i just have seen this fiasco on cable, and i need to trash it, is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen.<br /><br />Eddie griffin an action hero?. my god!. the "clever" lines before and after kick some terrorist ass without even being touch were a joke, but the kind of funny stuff that doesn't supposed to be laughable. and what about griffin "im a bad-ass" faces when he does a karate posses or is spotting the bad guys?... damn, i always get the feeling that some undercover brother dumb joke was soon to occur. this is one of the most awkward movies i have ever seen, is awful. i have to change the channel in a lot of scenes... and Vivica A. Fox... my god... Vinnie Jones!!... damn... terrible career move. what and horrible movie.
