The Curse of El Charro is about a girl who sees visions about her sister's suicide. Apparently Charro is punishment for the girl's family for something her ancestors did. It wasn't easily discernible because the film was not that interesting to watch. She goes on a trip with some back stabbing friends, and everyone is attacked by El Charro. Her persistent dreams give away the film. The characters have no redeeming qualities and there is nothing that gives this film any reason to be viewed other than it is there to be watched. Some of the cinematography is interesting, but the film flips around between flashback, Charro, and the star. If you're looking for some mindless slashing, this film is for you.
