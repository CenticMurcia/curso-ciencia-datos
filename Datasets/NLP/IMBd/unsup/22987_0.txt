A wonderful episode that doesn't seem to get the credit it deserves. Brian Aherne does a special job with his role here, and carries the day, but that isn't all there is to this one. The writing was first rate, and I believe this writer (E. Jack Neuman) was a rookie to the Twilight Zone. The twist was not predictable, and was carried out very well by the supporting cast. Also fun was seeing Sydney Pollack when his hair was still dark. Its tempting to say this is not a run-of-the-mill Twilight Zone episode, but actually, none of them were, so I guess my point is that this one stands out for reasons one might not expect, and since I don't want to write any spoilers here, I'll leave it for you to watch and see for yourselves. For me, I'll happily watch this one again, even knowing what the ending is.
