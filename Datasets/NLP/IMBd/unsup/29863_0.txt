The worst movie ever,Even Howard the Duck was a masterpiece compared to this tax shelter. Ed Anders and anyone associated with this piece,should goto every video store and buy all the copies so there is no trace they worked on it. Ed,you should of put the director as Alan Smitty.You must be ashamed,i am for you,and we have never met. This has the production value of a well budgeted porno,and acting to match. I want my life back!!!
