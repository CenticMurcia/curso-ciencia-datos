There! One quick glimpse at this user-comments subject line and experienced horror/cult cinema fanatics immediately know what type of exploitation movie we're dealing with here! Wes Craven's horror landmark "Last House on the Left" spawned a copious amount of cheaply made and rapidly edited imitations (mainly Italian ones) and "Midnight Blue" is easily the most forgettable one of them all. Actually this film already righteously resides in oblivion and only crazed smut-freaks, like myself, are stupid enough to dig it back up. "Midnight Blue" features the exact same story lines as all the other revenge films, except one of the female rape victims in this film is a practicing javelin thrower so you already know beforehand which attribute she'll use to extract her vengeance. Three young girls (not the world's sexiest ones, I may add) unwisely separate themselves from the rest of their group of touring athletes to spend extra vacation time in a house near a private beach. Whilst sunbathing topless, three men approach them in the hope to score a bit of random and casual sex and they do; even though two of them are old and downright hideous looking. Numerous gratuitous sex-sequences later, one of the girls coincidentally discovers the three are in fact fugitive criminals who needed a hideout place. When her attempt to signal the police fail, the three reveal their true malignant nature. Physical abuse, violence, humiliation and  eventually  retribution inevitably ensues Not much to speak about here, "Midnight Blue" is completely mundane and by-the-numbers late 70's exploitation product. There's not even the slightest at building up tension, the cinematography looks ugly and the girls have more hair on their intimate areas than the average gorilla has over its entire body. Director Raimondo Del Balzo's input (who?) is entirely unnoticeable and none of the cast members has any other significant movie title on their repertoires. Not too hard to see why that is.
