Okay, now the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency, (that's an oxymoron itself)) is framing Jane Doe(or is it the company that's doing it?), but then her 17 year old son is a DIA operative in the company and her ex-husband is a DIA agent. Bad guys in the company she works for are into selling secrets to foreign agents, so she reveals happenings about this and is fired for doing so, then is set up by insiders in the company to cover up the killing of the company president. Now the DIA is in cahoots with the company big wigs from the get go, but makes out like it is trying to catch the company VIPs in the act of transferring the secret stuff. Next the DIA boss wants to kill her DIA agent husband because who knows why and also wants to take out she and her son. DOES ANY OF THIS MAKE SENSE? A movie you definitely will want to miss.
