Thank god i got to see this thing for free! this is probably one of the worst films i've seen in a long time! everything from the dialog, to comedic timing, to continuity, to cinematography...SUCKED! i cant even begin to explain how much this film blows. Parker Posey delivered one of the worst performances of her career. Paul Rudd's character is so unbelievable, i'd be shocked to find that he ever works in this town again. Mischa Barton actually did a pretty decent job. Or maybe its because everybody else sucked so bad! Devito probably took this role because he hasn't had an on-screen kiss since Twins! he was at his all time worst. Keith David was probably the only saving grace in this film. He was awesome, as always. But there is only so much one actor can do to save a horrible film. bottom line, don't waste your money in the theater, or at the video store...wait till one of your friends buys it at the 99 Cent Store...and borrow it. Billy Kent owes me 88 minutes of my life back!
