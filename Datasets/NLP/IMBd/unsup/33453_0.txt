The worst sci-fi series I've seen, I cant think of anything I can compare it too that makes it look good. The pacing is terrible, nothing happens without 10 second close-up shots, 30 second establishment shots, ten different shots of the encased brains and every single one is stock footage. Maybe if they had cut each episode down to 30 minutes they would used less film or video and have some money to spend on actors or props or effects. Everything surreal or interesting is stolen (Warriors of plasma came up with the idea of a planet made of bio-organic material and the melting of people to feed it. Hitchhikers guide the idea of a small group of people stealing a giant ship from a universal government and goofing around with it) I couldn't find previous examples of every idea but none felt original. Everything else is stupid or boring.
