I had very low expectations for this movie. It failed to meet any of them. I heard an interview with Seinfeld saying that they went through 40 drafts. It looks like they forgot to pick one, instead they ended up with a disjointed mash up of one-liners mixed into stupid plot devices. Some of the one-liners were funny - laugh out loud funny, in fact. A 30-minute show could have covered those one-liners and contained the about nothing nature of the show, much the way the Seinfeld TV show did. I do not expect perfect science or good lessons from a cartoon, but this one has such flawed science, and such poor lessons that it was difficult to suspend disbelief. Not clever, not funny and I wish I could get my time and money back.
