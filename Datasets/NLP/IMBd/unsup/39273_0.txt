I saw this for cheap at a used DVD store & picked it up, because I love the original "Harvey" and Harry Anderson certainly looks like he'd make a great Elwood P. Dowd. But when I started to watch this and got about halfway through, I realized that it has absolutely none of the charm or humor of the original, and that it wasn't getting any better as it went along, so I stopped it. Anderson is OK as Dowd, but this is a flat production with absolutely no soul to it. The story is kind of the same, but there were differences from the original that made no difference whatsoever, and no member of the cast particularly stood out. This can't hold a candle to the original & it's going right back to the store I bought it from to be traded yet again. 3 out of 10, you can't mess with a classic.
