i think the Bernie mac is one of the greatest comedies ever, Bernie always talking negative about the kids and how much trouble they are but the show seems to teach morals while still being funny at the same time. i think fox is making a mistake if they cancel this show after 5 seasons, which would be a huge loss, the sixth season has a lot of potential story lines which would be interesting to see. the show makes you laugh hysterically and when will Vanessa learn to stop being so rebellious and when will Jordan become popular and shed his nerdy image. the best part of the show is when Bernie be talking to the camera, saying America, and sometimes the most outrageous stuff comes from Bernie. even though he is tough, he loves the kids very much.
