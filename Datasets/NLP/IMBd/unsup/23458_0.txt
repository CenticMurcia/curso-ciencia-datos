This movie, like a number of movies that have been churned out since the New Queer Cinema days, suffers from a genuinely bad script and performances by actors who obviously don't want to be in a gay movie.<br /><br />Richard Ruccolo obviously didn't want to kiss a gay guy in All Over The Guy but gave a good performance, given the bad dialogue and general sitcom-quality of that script. The best thing that can be said about the main actors in this movie is that they give plausible enough performance IN SOME cases in A VERY FEW scenes, with some of them giving really bad performances nearly always. Bryan Kirkwood was patently uncomfortable that he brings new meaning to the word "trade." Some gay-for-pay straight models in gay adult films have given far more believable "acting" performances. If Hank Harris was supposed to be Dylan Fergus' (Eddie) and Eddie's cop/sister younger brother, he needs better skin care and makeup. The producer should have also, at least, sprung for the buck to buy some black hair coloring at the 99 Cents Only store to make the family resemblance at bit more plausible.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />But plausibility isn't something this film seems to want to care much about -- for example, the Luke character leaves a crime scene or shows up at the "West Hollywood Police Department" in a motorcycle, sans helmet without hearing word one about it from a "WH" cop; the Chaz character get not only sliced but decapitated on a crowded dance floor and no one notices, hears about it, or stumbles on him; Eddie ends up at the crime scene where his younger brother (whom he was earlier so concerned over and about) was killed, gets attacked there himself, goes to the "WHPD," runs into his sister and yet no one (not even the sister) mentions to him that his brother was the victim at that crime scene. By this point, even some stupid queen in a k-hole would have realized there was a bloody, decapitated body on the dance floor and since the "devil" wasn't taking wallets, it shouldn't have been that hard to ID the bodies. Yet, when he gets homes, Eddie walks around the apartment wondering where everyone is. . .<br /><br />I could spend another few paragraphs on the really horrible dialogue or plot points, but it's not worth it. Suffice to say that it would have taken about 1/3 the cleverness of any of the Scream movies with even this exact same cast, to make a movie 10 times better.<br /><br />This isn't even worth spending the time watching on Logo, much less paying $3.95 for it on Here! TV.
