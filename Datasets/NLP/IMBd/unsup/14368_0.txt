Totally violates suspense writing 101. You already know she survives the ordeal in the beginning of the movie.. duh ???<br /><br />And having seen the scenes in the trailer and the poster,, there was NO surprises whatsoever..<br /><br />The actors did okay with the material before them and I could look at Miranda Bailey anytime. (smile)<br /><br />Why is it that almost every movie with a pregnant heroine always seem to fall into a sense of her unavoidable doom. From "Rosemary's Baby" to last year's bloodbath "Inside". Just once I would love to see a different approach. ( I don't count "Cord/Hide and Seek" or "Hush" as I never even bought the premise that the heroine was even pregnant, they acted more like a pillow was stuffed under her shirt") At least in this film, you do feel she is due any second.. Maybe someone will make a movie about a 9 month pregnant Sarah Brady who fought a knife-wielding female maniac for 20 minutes and won. :)
