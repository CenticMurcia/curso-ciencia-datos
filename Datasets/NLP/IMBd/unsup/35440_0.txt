In Moll's world we let people into our house to yell at us, throw drinks at each other, provoke us, and ultimately commit suicide in our spare room. Then we let their ghost into our bodies to screw up our marriage. OK. Still, it could have been dramatic or entertaining. On the plus side the photography is good and even beautiful in the mountains. On the sort of plus side, there was a thread of tension running through the movie and an atmosphere reminiscent of Todd Haynes's "Safe", though with none of the commitment of that movie. But the story never becomes believable. The relationships are never compelling - none of the depth of character or feeling between people in a movie like Solaris, for example. Consider how much simple human issues like privacy, isolation and irritation add to our sense of the human condition. Then look at the characters of Lemming: any of us would have thrown these people out of our lives after 5 minutes.
