This show is so cool. I don't think there is any other T.V show out there that can compare to this. Les is such a great guy. He puts himself in life and death situations and films it all too. Even though his life is on the line in every adventure, he still makes it very entertaining and sometimes adds a little humor into it to. Some off the survival techniques he shows us is very extreme and should not be attempted by anyone unless in real danger. Thats another thing about the show that I love, its all real. Non of it is planed out or set up. Some off the stuff he does is pretty Gross too(like eating raw bugs!) But the main purpose off the show is to show you how to survive in the wild and in dangerous situations. You have to give this guy some credit.
