Good old classic horror movie which delivers everything a horror fan wants. More blood, more limbs, more scares. Overall: More fun!<br /><br />Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, the foolish but cool hero who has to fight for his life and kill his friends when they get possessed and turn on him. KNB Effects Group (Kurtzman, Nicotero, Berger) really did an amazing job with this movie. The amount of monsters, limbs and all others kinds of special makeup effects alone is worth watching this movie.<br /><br />Once again directed by Sam Raimi.<br /><br />Funny, Scary and one hell of a ride! <br /><br />10/10
