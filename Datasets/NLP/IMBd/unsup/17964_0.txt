This film is one of the few films to offend me. It proclaims itself to be a children's movie, but is so full of gratuitous (presumably meant to be "comical") violence, nasty "pranks" and the gruesome sequence with Christopher Lloyd being tortured (nearly to death) by the obnoxious brat Dennis makes DENNIS THE MENACE entirely inappropriate for children. The fact that it is a terrible film in all other respects makes it entirely inappropriate viewing for adults, as well! Would you want your child to repeat any of the "antics" Dennis gets away with in real life? They would land your child in jail or the hospital; vicious films like this and HOME ALONE, PROBLEM CHILD, etc. have no place in your child's life. Another alleged "children's film" to stay away from for its grotesque, unrelenting, mean-spirited violence and adults-only humor is Dreamwork's MOUSE HUNT. Let you children watch these films at your own risk!
