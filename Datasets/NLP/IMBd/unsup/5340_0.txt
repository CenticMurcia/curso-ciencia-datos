I watched Beverly Hills 90210 since I was in elementary school it has always been my favorite show. It deals with ups and downs you go through in life. My favorite moments were the first four years when Brenda and Dylan were the couple! When Dylan had to choose between Brenda or Kelly! Brenda, Brandon, Dylan, Kelly, Steve, David, Donna, Aundria,are the best! I miss the old cast the further I get into the seasons, the old cast is what made the show so great I believe even without them the show is good but the old cast had the better times and the most memories.I own all 10 seasons and I am still working my way through to the end.
