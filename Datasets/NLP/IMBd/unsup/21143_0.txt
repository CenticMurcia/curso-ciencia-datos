This film grabbed me right from the start with it's opening theme and stark but crisp black and white cinematography. There's something fascinating about the character of Major Clint Drango, intent on winning over the citizens of Kennesaw Pass one at a time. In part to right the wrongs of Sherman's Army and his own involvement in the War as well, Drango's challenge is to bring the murderers of Henry Calder to justice. In so doing, he must gain the confidence of the citizens that Reconstruction will proceed with an emphasis on the law for everyone, not for a single man or for the army that won the War.<br /><br />I found it interesting that Clay Allen (Ronald Howard) distrusted Drango because the Major was an honest man. There seems to be a corollary there that resonates with the current state of political correctness, but I digress. The ebb and flow of the story with characters slowly taking sides was my best takeaway from the film. It helped that there was a great cast of familiar character actors here from the genre, folks like Milburn Stone, Walter Sande, Parley Baer and the venerable Donald Crisp. Julie London and Joanne Dru are also effective in somewhat understated roles, even though important to the story. John Lupton probably deserved a larger presence as Drango's adjutant, but I guess that's how the saber rattles.<br /><br />Overall, an intriguing Western with an out of the ordinary theme that moves along at a nice pace. The traditional good guy ending is tested along the way by forces that pit the citizens of a small town against each other, much like the Civil War did to the country. As a microcosm of that larger conflict, "Drango" delivers it's message well.
