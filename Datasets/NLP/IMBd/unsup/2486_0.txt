Good film, really enjoyed when I watch the DVD over the weekend though one thing did spoil it, vampires walking in the daylight! Now I'm sure I didn't miss anything, I was paying attention but Mircalla was a really honest to god vampire, yet mincing around in the sunshine as she did she'd have been a crispy critter in 2 seconds.<br /><br />Great movie, for all the usual Hammer reasons. I grew up watching the Hammer movies on TV in the 70's and despite the flaws in most of them they'll always be very dear to me. One might hope that with the advent of next gen DVD which will have more than enough capacity it would be nice to have all the Hammer horror movies on one disc. That, as they say would be cool!
