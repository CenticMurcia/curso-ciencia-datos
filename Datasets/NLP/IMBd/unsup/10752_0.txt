I have loved this movie since I saw it in the early 80s when I was in Junior High. For 25 years I have liked to quoted this movie. Every actor was wonderful, and I find it difficult to pick one out as the best. T.K. Carter did such a great job, and he developed his character the best, I thought, as "Chester" the klepto-chaeuffer. When "Glenda" told "Nick" to give himself up, she said "If you're innocent they will never send you to jail." Nick responds by asking "Chester" if thats how it works, "Chester" responds, "Not in my neighborhood." Charles Grodin was great as "Glenda's" husband "Ira." I also wasn't that impressed with the scene in the guest room with Chase under the bed while Grodin was sitting on it. I loved that line, however, by Grodin where he said, "oh, he was limping. Then of course he's innocent, limper's never lie, limper's are famous for telling the truth." I highly recommend this. Your time wont be wasted.<br /><br />Just remembered that part with chevy chase "holding up" the gas station.
