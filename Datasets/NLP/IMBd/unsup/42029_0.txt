I saw this film as a kid, and for the most part I remember not all that much going on in this movie. I remember it being somewhat boring and not really exciting or creepy at all. However, if I ever see this movie for sale someday I will buy it just so I can see it again and see what the story was about as that is something that for the most part escapes my mind at the present time. So I may be giving this movie a low score now, however, in the future I may give it a higher score or rewrite this review in order to incorporate more of the story in the review. I am writing one now though as I may never find the movie for sale or on television so I may never get that chance. Oddly enough, I always think of that scene with the hearse driver coming to get someone, but this scene was not even in this movie, but rather in the film "Burnt Offerings" another horror movie that for the most part was not exciting. Perhaps this one too was a book first and it just did not translate to the big screen all that well. In the end though I can not remember this movie all that well, it was not gory in the least and was more suspense than anything, but I do not really remember the suspense being all that suspenseful.
