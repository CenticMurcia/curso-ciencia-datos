..... and you've got part 2. If you've seen part one, you've seen this sequel. Yes, the flashbacks do get annoying, and Ricky is a god awful narrator and character to follow. Flashbacks and references aside, it's oddly almost completely different. The murders here are dumbed down a bit, aiming for the more simplistic and spontaneous rather than the thoughtful and creative like in part 1. <br /><br />That's not necessarily a bad thing, as there are a few disturbing moments added into here that weren't in the original, but everything else about the movie is incredibly incompetent. The acting, sets, cinematography, and even the special effects are mostly amateurish, and even laughable. <br /><br />You'll figure out the scenes that make this film a classic among "bad" movie lovers, but other than that, I see no reason to watch this film (or even the rest of the series) after the conclusion of part 1.
