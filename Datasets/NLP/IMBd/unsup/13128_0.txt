As having followed the complete film series of Sharpe I was anticipating a follow up to this remarkable series! Sharpe's challenge has his flaws (begin of second part the story goes a little flat) but the last half hour makes up for this and is as great as it should be. There wasn't much action in this movie as in the previous movies. This of course there is no real war going on. Although Dodd is a great villain,you never get the feeling he is a real threat. For me this could have been done better. I mean India is a very large continent and can provide for great battles with ease. The story could have been bigger. But maybe this will happen in the future. For now I enjoyed this movie a lot and surely wasn't disappointed.
