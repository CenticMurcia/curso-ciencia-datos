Dolph Lundgren has lots of bad movies under his belt. This is one of his worst. Generally speaking, I love submarine movies. I've watched a huge amount of movies of this genre. Very few of them, if any, are worse than this. It's as bas as Octopus. First of all, there's a lack of action, like in most other ultra low budget DTV action flicks. The (very few) action scenes which made it all the way into the movie just aren't anywhere near the quality I would rate as acceptable. Lundgren isn't exactly a great actor (which shouldn't matter, because he's an action star), and when he has nothing to work with action-wise a project is doomed from the start. Agent Red proves this. I suffered heavily for more than 90 minutes. Don't make the same mistake as me.
