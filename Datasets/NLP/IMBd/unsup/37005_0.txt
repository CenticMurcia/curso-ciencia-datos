Oh my God! It was a miracle this movie was made! You have not lived until you have seen this movie. You have not lived until you have seen Batman violated! Whoah! This cowboy needs to hold his horses! I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning. I was looking for something on Batman Begins only a couple of hours ago and I found something in the list: The Death of Batman. Curious to see what it was, I checked it out. I read some reviews and some posts; the vast majority seemed to hate it, but some seemed to like it (probably recovering from some horrible experience, like loss of limbs or death of entire family). I tell you now this movie deserves to be neither liked nor hated, but to be loved. Loved! I looked the title up on Google and went to the movie's site. I clicked on Movie and it to me to Youtube. I watched the 28 minutes of bliss.<br /><br />I didn't feel that way at first, though. At first I couldn't believe how awful it was! The acting was just terrible! But I've kinda always had this philosophy (it only works with some movies, unfortunately): Acting doesn't matter if you have special effects. I had to change that philosophy for this movie: Acting doesn't matter if you have nothing else. There are no special effects in this movie; there is no good acting, no good writing. By rights this movie should be condemned to hell.<br /><br />But, wait! There is one little detail I am forgetting. A little scene that changes it all. A scene I like to call... The Butt-Rape Scene! During an Entertainment News report about Batman being the sexiest man in Gotham, be sure to look up in the top-left screen (you don't see any parts, but you know what is happening.).<br /><br />I don't like gay sex. I really don't like it when it's forced on someone. I am no pervert. But after the god-awful performance from everyone in that film, you can't tell me he didn't deserve it! I laugh at his well deserved punishment! It was awesome! This scene happens about 11 or 12 minutes in, so after that it goes back to suck. But, this movie has achieved a new level of suck that I call Supa Suck. I can't offer the makers anything but kudos. They made a movie more entertaining than an old man strung up on a flag pole, forced to dance the jitterbug.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and Batman dies and no one wonders why Bruce Wayne is never seen again.<br /><br />Incredible.
