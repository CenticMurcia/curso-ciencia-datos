The movie is really good due to Ajith's excellent performance in the role of a man with feminine character.<br /><br />Since most part of the movie is shot when Ajith was during the period of reducing his weight, his looks are not same throughout the movie. This is really intriguing in the flow of the narration. <br /><br />K.S.Ravikumar is in his usual stuff taking the plot of prostitution for the romance of the lead pair. <br /><br />A.R.Rahman's songs are hummable and good to watch.Overall Ajith's performance raises this movie and it lived to its expectation and the long wait was worth.
