I love this show. I love the interaction between Ina and her husband Jeffery. They make such a cute couple.I never miss this show (everyday at 5 PM.) :) It's better than watching annoying Rachel or WORSE that Sandra lee & her semi-homemade junk....Ugh... That woman is SO full of herself!! Ina is so refreshing she doesn't need get all dressed up like that Sandra lee woman,like it's a fashion show. Ina's personality & food speak for themselves . I also love the fact that she does the "Dinner party" thing or just a small meal / lunch for herself or a special dinner for Jeffery . It's different.Her food always looks SO Delicious too. I have tried a couple of her dishes & they were easy & fun to make.
