This movie was not bad, it was horrible! The acting was at best equivalent to that of a high school production. The special effects were by far the worst I had ever seen. If you could not tell that the alien is a puppet, then I am sorry for you. The movie was bad even by the Scifi Channel standards. The "Bad Guy" character is pretty much your standard villain who has a shallow disposition and crummy dialog, the same goes for the rest of the "marines". If our troop really were to act as they did in this film; then we would all be doomed. One of the only redeeming scenes was the "Alein Autopsy" scenes, the black and white with grain texture was by far the biggest expense to the budget; however, this scene is also has some of the worst alien acting in the movie.
