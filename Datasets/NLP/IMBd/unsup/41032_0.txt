What can I say? I'm really picky when it comes to musical movies, and this one really sucked. The music itself wasn't so bad, but plot was just annoying. The movie simply circulated around one man's memory of a friend and a band. I didn't understand the point of the film. Some did enjoy it, surprisingly enough. Watch if you care about personal struggles over dumb issues.<br /><br />1/10
