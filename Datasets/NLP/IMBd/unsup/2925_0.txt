I saw this a few years ago, and remember little except my poor reaction to it. It struck me as very childish, with one-dimensional characters, and an unoriginal idea. 'Save the crystals, save the world' was already getting old in the video game series by this point, and it felt like an attempt to milk something popular. You'll probably like this a lot more if you are younger, and Final Fantasy-obsessed, but it really wasn't worth the rental for me.
