as people knows,the public praise is very bad but box office is so high in china.it face an embarrassed situation,one side is ice,another is fire.<br /><br />as concerned as me,i take this movie Mo Gik as nothing,or just a steamed bread.one world,one steamed bread,just like the 2008 Olympic saying.Kai-Ge Chen is really not god,but he took him as,and even had been cheated by others(yes,the media and audience took him as god before,but it's more like a sneer,make him can't speak out human's word.).He thought the audience can't understand his movie immediately, of course,he is god,how can we poor human can really understand the thought of god.So,Kai-Ge,just stay on your paradise with your flower armature and noble blood,don't get down,on the ground,or less,you have to face sputa.<br /><br />recently,i hear of the comment has rebounded.promise me can doubt it conspiratorial like an inclemency commenter, i just can think those one who make it rebound are employed by production crew.if goddess man(Chen hong,Kai-Ge's wife)know it,she will say again:"what's on earth the bad man's heart,it is equal to murder my baby,why Chinese always fight with Chinese."but i think,you should thank all kind Chinese, especially the kindness of film bureau and movie theater,it is them who can give you so good feature period and in this feature,no other movies can compete with mo Gik,they even don't have chance to compete for they(Naria,King gang) can't be featured in your own time.
