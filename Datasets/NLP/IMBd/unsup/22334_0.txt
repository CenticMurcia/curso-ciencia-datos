Let me start by saying that negative comments motivated by it being a reinterpretation of the Beowulf story and not being historically correct are simply mistaken.<br /><br />All movies that exist are influenced by old tales, some rip them off blindly, some even claim to tell "the true story" (King Arthur*shudders*). But looking for historical correctness in a movie that says "Aliens vs. Vikings" is like going into an Helly Kitty movie expecting some good action scenes and blood.<br /><br />You choose what movies to watch, stick with the genre you like, then you will not be disappointed so often.<br /><br />_Now to the movie itself_ I expected this movie to be cheap, cheesy and uninteresting but watching it together with my even more skeptical girlfriend changed our both minds. This movie is well done, well shot, well produced, the props look good enough, the sets are good enough, the CGI is well done and the actors do a decent job.<br /><br />The Screenplay seems to be cut just right, it does not have too many lengths or shorts, the conversations have the needed information without venturing off too far into the romance story within the action. I like that most of the romance is portrayed simply through visuals and not words. The action is well cut, though i would have liked it to be a bit less "shaky" but it seems this trend will have to develop to its extreme before it starts to vanish again (hopefully soon i wanna see the effort the actors and stuntman put into their swordplay more clearly!).<br /><br />**Minor spoilers** The story has some nice tones to it, especially an untypical rivalry between the main character and a male side character, that does not include the typical "i will kill you if you touch her" or the typical fistfight and alcohol to make them friends again, very well done! :D The background story to the beast and its motivation close before the final and the portrait of it really gave the whole thing more depth to it and i liked it very much, because that way you can just be all "alienhating" over the course of the whole movie and get this slight "oh noes i feel bad for them" feeling right before it ends :D I like that the viking cast does not only consist of 2 meter man with 1 meter broad shoulders grunting and shouting, but that they are more displayed as humans, normal men (unlike Pathfinder / King Arthur), which i honestly had expected to happen, because of the "B-movieish" kind of nature of the main idea for the movie.<br /><br />As i said in the beginning, this movie is just cinema at its best. It does not have many faults, most of them are because of the lower production values of the movie, but they really pushed themselves and I wish this movie the best of success and want to see more of this kind of well-done-entertainment!
