This show is the most truthful portrayal of what men think about. I know men won't admit it to their significant others and women will never believe it, but this series very accurately portrays a man in a relationship. No matter how well a guy has it, the grass is always greener on the other side. That is the basis for this whole series. The internal everyday battle of men to stay faithful to the one they love when their natural animal instincts and testosterone are telling them to try and sleep with every fine piece of arse they see. I know it doesn't sound beautiful or poetic but its truth.<br /><br />Anyways, the show is hilarious, especially if you are more into darker, drier humour. Wish HBO never cancelled it.
