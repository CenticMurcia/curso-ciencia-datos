This film takes place in the infamous 1970 October crisis in Qu√©bec. After a separatist movement kidnapped a minister of the government, the army is in the streets of Montreal and makes hundreds and hundreds of arrest, with the help of the police. The arrested are students, activists, syndicalists, but also people who ''look'' strange, are at the wrong place at the wrong time and really don't have anything to do with the situation..... This film shows the complete lost of control of the Canadian government (Pierre.E. Trudeau) and how they orchestrated their plan of making all separatist look like terrorist...<br /><br />The acting of 'Jean Lapointe' as a textile worker and taxi driver is incredible...<br /><br />In my opinion, this film ranks with Costa-Gavras's ''Z'' and the infamous 'Battaglia di Algeri' of Gillo Pontecorvo, as the top 3 best political movies of all times..... A must see!
