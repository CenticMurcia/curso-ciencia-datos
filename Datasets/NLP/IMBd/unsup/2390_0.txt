This is easily my favourite nunsploitation flick. The atmosphere was strangely haunting, and the nuns themselves were quite sexy...all the good elements to this genre are here.<br /><br />The only scene I didn't enjoy was the rape of one of the nuns in the woods. Not only because it was ugly, but also the way she is made to seem completely helpless was unconvincing.<br /><br />I suppose one could look at the nun's excursion out into the woods as her unfortunately confronting the ugliness of the world outside the convent, but I think D'Amato could of done better by it somehow.<br /><br />Also, that scene is very ugly in relation to the other more beautifully erotic scenes between the nuns, especially those that occur during the final thirty minutes or so of the film. Though quite hardcore, they still are sexy, and even a bit humorous.<br /><br />Well, the genre being such as it is, I guess there's no room for subtlety! Recommended for those who enjoy erotic 70's cinema, with women with real curves, real sexiness and a bit of the arcane strangeness of the genre and the era.
