This movie was a really good movie. It really opens up your view of the world, and how sometimes things aren't really as easy as they look. It follows the life of Mr. Gardener and shows the hardships he has to overcome in able to make a better life for him and his child. It is really emotional and great to watch. Your attention will be captured the whole time. If you think that earning money, and buying the right things, or saving so that you CAN buy the right things is something that people do without any troubles, then you have to watch this movie. There are many examples of how poor people were treated differently then the more wealthy people. That shows a message to everyone about how we can be kinder, and try to understand a little bit more.
