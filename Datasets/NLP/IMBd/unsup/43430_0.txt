If you enjoy elderly men and women playing teen aged children, by all means, watch this silly piece of Hollywood. John Barrymore as Mercutio. You gotta be kidding me. And pretty boy Leslie Howard, minus Rhett and the gang playing Romeo, oh yes and mz MGM playing Juliet. What a joke. See the real thing, the Zefferelli version, circa 1968. I bet that is what Will Shakespeare intended.
