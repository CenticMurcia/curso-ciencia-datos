I remember seeing a short trailer for this superhero film, and I didn't think it looked too bad, but the critics give it two stars, so I had to see why, from director Mark Steven Johnson (Ghost Rider). Basically, in Hell's Kitchen, New York, after being blinded by a toxic waste chemical, which increases his other senses dramatically, young Matt Murdock (Scott Terra) loses his father Jack (David Keith) to an unknown man dropping a rose. Years later, Matt (Razzie winner Ben Affleck) has become a respected criminal attorney/lawyer, but by night he becomes "The Man Without Fear," costumed and masked hero Daredevil. He one day meets (by smell and touch) Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), daughter of a wealthy tycoon, and they fall for each other quite quickly, and she is quite a skilled fighter also, with her knives. Daredevil has a new enemy though, the super-enhanced Bullseye (Colin Farrell), who never misses his targets, hired by big villain Wilson Fisk, aka The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan). Also starring Joe Pantoliano as Ben Urich, Jon Favreau as Franklin 'Foggy' Nelson, Ellen Pompeo as Karen Page, Kevin Smith as Jack Kirby - Forensic Assistant and Stan Lee as Old Man at Crossing. There are some good special effects, I didn't think Farrell was that bad, and even though the premise of a blind superhero is ridiculous nonsense, there is still some fun to be had. Okay!
