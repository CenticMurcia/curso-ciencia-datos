Clerks. is one of those kinds of movies that doesn't need fancy camera work, the biggest actors, a huge budget, or even color. Clerks. is a very simple idea of one day at a job.<br /><br />The main character is Dante Hicks, a college drop-out who gets a phone call from his boss, saying he has to work on his day off. This is just one of the many things that makes Dante's day at work more and more unbearable. His day starts off with an activist who enters the Quick Stop Convenience Store, and complains about the health problems smoking causes to the other customers, in one of the most funniest moments of the film.<br /><br />The other main character is Randal Graves, a true slacker in the sense. He likes to come to work, usually about a half hour late, order Adult movies in front of a three year old, back talk to customers, watch Star Wars and talk about the innocent people dying on the almost finished Death Star in Return of the Jedi, or lock up the video store and talk to Dante.<br /><br />The other characters, Veronica, who is Dante's girlfriend, who always bugs him about going back to college. Caitleen Bree, who is still secretly loved by Dante, even after she cheated on him 81/2 times, and who is marrying an Asian Design Major. And Jay and Silent Bob, who are another pair of slackers who deal drugs, brag about there Russian friend/cousin, and on the occasion, dance.<br /><br />The movie is the kind of comedy that relies on delivery of lines rather than action. It uses a kind of gross out humor, that one describes, and never shows, which leaves more the imagination.<br /><br />Clerks. is something everyone can relate to. It's about a job the main characters hate, and do everything they can to fight the boredom of the long hours of a job, even if its playing Hockey on the roof or going to a wake.<br /><br />Clerks. is a comedy for those who appreciate good dialogue and superb characters.<br /><br />10/10.
