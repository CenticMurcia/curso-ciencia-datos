Magnum P.I. is about the closest thing I have in connection with Hawaii. I recall a couple who left New Jersey in 1995 with a dream to live in Honolulu, Hawaii. I'm sure Hawaii is a paradise to visit but they have problems just like everywhere else. It is an expensive place to live so is where I live, New Jersey. This show is escapism and a combination of intelligence and brotherhood. Tom Magnum played wonderfully by Tom Selleck who has since moved back to Southern California and created his own paradise by having a ranch with wife and daughter beside him. Besides the rumors of his sexual orientation are just that unproven rumors. ANyway, he's a gun-toting Republican so everybody's off base. Had Magnum P.I. settled down with any woman in particular, I think it would have spoiled the dynamic of the show. There was a great sense of brotherhood among the cast members who are all male, John Hillerman who played the butler or owner whatever you want to believe about this true identity was always a great joy to watch. Funny, he's not British but from Texas. Larry Manetti and Roger E. Mosley played the bar owner and helicopter pilot and friend to Magnum. They knew each other from Vietnam which deepens their relationship with each other in a platonic way. Yes, there were girls and only British resident Agatha was a regular but that was the point. If Tom had settled down during the show, the show would have been over. Anyway, this series was a great and I despise when Hollywood takes a good series and recasts with them anybody less than the original. Tom can still play Magnum and the rest of the cast can still come back. DUring the final season of the show, Tom threw the best wrap parties, gave raises to the cast and crew, and expensive gifts from his bonus for staying one year.
