Wow...what can I type that will make this seem like it is worth reading? Awful and atrocious sets...even for a low budget.<br /><br />Plot that stinks worse than week old diapers.<br /><br />Performanes of wood and not even good wood...rotten wood, full of mildew and mold and worms and stench.<br /><br />Plot...was there one? Oh yeah...I already made a comment about plot.<br /><br />Computer graphics...maybe it's time to start drawing stick figures and happy faces. They look better.<br /><br />Continuity...almost as good as the MUSIC...which is almost as good as garbage, but not so entertaining.<br /><br />Camera work and editing...the bad part is that it sucked...and the good part is that it sucked.<br /><br />Plot...oh yeah...none.<br /><br />The entire movie was just nasty mess of everything that should not ever be made on film.<br /><br />If there is one piece of advice that you will ever take from a stranger...take this. If you are so desperate to watch this...then count backwards from 5 million and do it while chewing bubblegum and skipping rope, because you will enjoy it ten times more and it will make just as much sense.
