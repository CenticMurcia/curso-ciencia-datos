I found this version of the movie inane. Even though the whole tragic mulatto concept is quite ridiculous, I find the 1959 version a much easier one to take. Whenever there has been a movie about a black person "passing" for white to enjoy a better life, the character is punished for being duplicitous. How primitive.
