Yes, Catherine Zeta-Jones is good looking and Sean Connery used to be The James Bond. But these two facts aren't enough to make a movie on. The acting is poor and some really good "high-tech" action scenes mixes with some attempts to "love-and-romance". I don't know but there is something wrong when CZJ tries to act as someone who is very clever but just acts like a stupid insurance agent. The supporting acting by Ving Rhames is good, very good, why doesn't he get a lead...
