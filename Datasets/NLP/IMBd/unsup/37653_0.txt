I've always been a fan of Midsomer Murders but here the law of diminishing returns seems to have started. The conflict between digital cameras and film was just plain stupid (would anyone care enough to get so worked up?) and the cop who took over from Barnaby was a ludicrous 80s clich√©. Maybe I missed something but I thought he was an Inspector. Not that I know anything about police procedure but I would have thought that you would have to be a higher rank to throw a Chief Inspector off the case. The biggest disappointment was Lisa Goddard. I remember the fizzing chemistry between her and Nettles in the old Bergerac days and I was looking forward to seeing that again. Instead she turned up in the final scene as some hopeless, pointless OTT character. Do you really need the money that much, Lisa? Still, on the plus side, at least Joyce got more to do than make jam this time. Jane Wymark must have been in more scenes than in the last ten episodes put together.
