This movie is great. The girls are gorgeous, the guys are funny. The guy who played Alex in the movie (Doug Copithorne) works next door to me and is a friend of mine. By the way ladies... he's married now and has a couple kids so don't get any ideas :P I give this movie a 10 simply because of the utterly gorgeous girl who plays Beth. Beth if you read this I love you and I want to have your babies... Oh, and Doug says Hi.<br /><br />All in all this was a great movie for what it was, and I think it did Canada proud. They managed humor and a playboy bunny all in one fantastic movie. Great Job Ski School!!
