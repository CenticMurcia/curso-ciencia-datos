Full of wonderful one-liners; my friends and I exchange quotes regularly. (See some of the Quotes elsewhere at this IMDb website.) We went to see the movie on a whim, and hadn't heard anything about it. At first, we didn't know it was a comedy. Then Ian McKellen's character gave his oft-quoted line about draining the well. The accent is a little difficult at times, and each time we watch the movie we find new humor. I'm still trying to determine the words to the song that the parishioners sing before Amos's sermon. The characters are wonderfully portrayed, and I've been a fan of Kate Beckinsale and Rufus Sewell ever since. This is the best performance given by Eileen Atkins.
