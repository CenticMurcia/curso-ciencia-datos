If this is not the least funny film ever made, then that honour must go to a title I haven't seen. This film really does plumb new depths. It's about as funny as watching an unpleasant eight year old child impersonate a spastic. So, what's it about? Zohan is a rock hard Isreali soldier who is sick of it all and just wants to cut hair. So, after chasing the imaginatively named 'Phantom' out to sea by hilariously out-pacing a jet ski whilst swimming butterfly, Zohan fakes his own death in the most excruciatingly unfunny comedy fight ever conceived. "A-ha watch me put this fish on my face, I am harder than you!", "A-ha, no you aren't, I can put a fish down my trunks to nibble at my huge bulging Zohan-penis". Freed of the pressure to single-handedly save Israel, Zohan sets off to America to pursue his dream, falls in love with a hairdresser from the "Palestinian side" of the street and brings peace to the middle-east, or something. If you haven't seen this film then for goodness sake don't - however bad you've heard this film is cannot possibly prepare you for the awfulness which has to be seen to be believed, but is much better left unseen.
