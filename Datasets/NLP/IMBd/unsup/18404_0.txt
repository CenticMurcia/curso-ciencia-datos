I remember this series very well!! It captured my attention over a period of several weeks.<br /><br />I have tried, over and over, to obtain a VHS or DVD of this series....but no luck.<br /><br />NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW IF IT EVER WAS PROCESSED FOR VHS OR DVD.<br /><br />Anyone know about the possibility of a future release on VHS or DVD? WHO WOULD WE 'petition' to release it??? It is one of those RARE Historical series that I would love to have in my collections.<br /><br />Adolfo Celi gives a performance of Rodrigo Borgia that is SUPBERB. Was this an A&E production, BBC or....? We can only hope that someday the production company that produced this series will see that there are many who would love to own either the VHS or DVD series.<br /><br />Thanks Claude King
