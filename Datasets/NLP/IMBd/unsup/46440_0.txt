This movie has warped my fragile little mind! Seriously besides Lawnmower Man II and I assume American Ninja 4 this has to be one of the worst movies ever to appear out of Hollywood. The stunts are more than poor, the plot is horrid, the acting worse and the cinematography of it is a joke. Spare yourself: Don't watch it. If you're a movie-lover this production will make you sad.
