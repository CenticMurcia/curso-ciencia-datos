I was very impressed with HARVARD MAN. At first, it looks like a basic college movie, with basketball, girlfriends and relationships front and center. It soon comes unglued, screwing with chronology, and deploying some of the most jarring, disconcerting jumpcuts I've seen since Godard. Toback manages to cut against any intuitive rhythm, just a millisecond before you'd expect him to. This provokes intense anxiety, which mirrors what the characters are going through. I won't give away any spoilers here, except to say, the situation (and the film form) only get more (in)tense as the film develops. This is a film which only nominally participates in genre conventions, only to knock the stuffing out of them. Extra points for seriously whacked-out, purposefully inappropriate casting. You haven't lived until you've heard Joey Lauren Adams (she whose voice makes Jennifer Tilly sound like freakin' James Earl Jones) delivering a lecture on Wittgenstein. Good job, Mr. Toback.
