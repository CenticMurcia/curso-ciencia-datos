I thought this was one of the worst movies I have seen in quite some time. I cry very easily during movies, yet this movie, which was supposed to be a tearjerker did not bring a single tear. I had several problems with it. I did not believe that Abigail Breslin's acting was quite up to par with what we have seen her do in other films. I also was very confused with the relationship between Jason and Alexia. She didn't like him, then she some what tolerated him, then she didn't like him again, then the second he comes back from Equador she's hugging him like they were married.<br /><br />And don't get me started on his trip to Equador. I understand that he needed to find out the truth about his father, which still doesn't seem relevant to me, but getting taken hostage by drug lords? How did that advance the plot in any way? They never mention it again and it took up way too much of the movie to be so irrelevant.<br /><br />The continuity was horrible. He was homeless for a month but he barely got stubble. He's taken hostage and grows a huge beard.<br /><br />The first time Emily sees Jason is at his grandfather's funeral. However, what was Emily doing there to begin with? True, she's a patient on his cancer ward, but if every patient who was in his wing of the hospital came, it would have been a lot more crowded. I kept waiting for them to explain that. I waited in vain.<br /><br />And I had problems with the scene where his ex-girlfriend came back. He just ignored her. This would have been the perfect opportunity for him to truly show how he had changed. He could tell her off for using him for his money. He could try to show her what he had learned in hopes of starting to change her too. Instead, he let her to into his bedroom and wait naked while he went for a walk.<br /><br />As for his father's death, a plane crash is a plane crash. It wasn't like his grandfather had been flying the plane in which his father died. Seriously, no matter whether or not he just left for the sake of leaving, or left to take medicine to a nearby town, the crash itself was still an accident that could have happened either way.<br /><br />In conclusion, save yourself the money and don't go see it. There are plenty of other movies that better handle the issues tackled in The Ultimate Gift. If you are that curious, wait for it to come out on DVD. I'm sure you won't have long to wait.
