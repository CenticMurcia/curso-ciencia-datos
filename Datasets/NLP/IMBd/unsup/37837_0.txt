This film is idiotic. Just idiotic. However, everyone in the film takes it seriously, and that makes it worse than laughably bad- that makes it pitiful. <br /><br />Acting: Overacted. All the time.<br /><br />Special Effects: great, if you like seeing jaggies in the slo-mo fight scenes or weird camera angles in the explosions.<br /><br />Sound: cheesy "epic" music that sounds little better than random orchestra tuning sessions.<br /><br />Camera/editing: editing is OK, but odd camera angles abound through the entire film- why do i have to look at some monster's double chin?<br /><br />Plot: Stupid. A bunch of star-trek monster wannabes take over the earth to look for gold. (here come the plot holes). They haven't found fort knox in 1,000 years of habitation on earth. They are extremely smart, and their best insult is "rat-brain"? They call humans "man-animals" instead of the more logical term "manimals", and besides, if humans were considered on the same level, why not just say animals? Then a deviant genius human goes to the ruins of a city and finds working fighter jets from 1,000 years ago. All of them work and are even preloaded with missiles/etc. No rust or wear at all. Oh yeah, and the public records survived 1,000 years of mining, explosions, and bombardment in perfect condition. And, not only did a flight simulator exist in the city, conveniently located so that genius and his pals can train to fly those jets, it's also powered and working after 1,000 years, electrically supplied by .... umm......dunno. And, to boot, the primitive humans learn programming, computer use, hacking, piloting, weapon usage, and reading in 5 days. I'd love to see the school they went to. What luck for them, anyway. The ending is generic; good wins, happy happy etc.<br /><br />Messages: Primitives can learn how to surpass thousands of years of advancement in the human species by sitting in a flight simulator. Oh yeah, and L Ron Hubbard is god.<br /><br />overall, this film should be renamed and it would be very successful:<br /><br />"How Not To Make A Drama/Adventure Film: Exhibit Vol. 1" i'd bet 1,000,000 copies
