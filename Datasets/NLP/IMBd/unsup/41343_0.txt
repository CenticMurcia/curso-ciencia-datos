A more stylish movie you are unlikely to see.<br /><br />However, 2 hours of gorgeous sets and costumes is scant compensation for sitting through Baldwin's wooden acting, and a plot which manages to be both contrived and obvious at the same time.<br /><br />Given its considerable legacy, The Shadow deserved better treatment than this.<br /><br />Director Russell Mulcahy was once an innovative music video director. This movie (when viewed in context of his forgettable 'Razorback') prove he his a terminal lack of attention span for anything which requires more than 5 minutes of coherent screen time and filling more substantive than eye candy.<br /><br />Finally, let me record my astonishment that anyone on IPDB could rate this movie highly. Unless of course they are covert PR agents for the studios. Best we check their ring fingers ;-)
