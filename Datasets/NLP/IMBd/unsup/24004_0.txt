This is , for me, the best comedy ever from Holland!! Its really funny and strongly entertaining, you will not believe what you see sometimes... Our neighbors gave us many many hours of good movies, i also like "Amsterdamed" or "Flodder" but this is very Good. Its for a bunch of people sitting around your TV and drinking beer or something like that... I don't know this original Film "old men in new cars" so...don't think twice if you can catch this movie in a videostore!!!! I hope to see many more films from this young dutch guy. Maybe Hollywood need some more dutch people like Verhoeven or DE Bont?? Great actors, great camera and very very unique characters what do you want more?
