This is not a great film, and certainly not a worthy sequel to the hysterical first film.<br /><br />The lack of any other characters from the first is a killing blow to this film.<br /><br />Its worth a look for the dog "ballsack" and for Taj. But otherwise its little more than giggle-worthy. Also, there is an incredible lack of research into real English society, This is the weakest Lampoon film i have ever seen.<br /><br />But worth a look when you're free<br /><br />Needed Ryan Reynolds.
