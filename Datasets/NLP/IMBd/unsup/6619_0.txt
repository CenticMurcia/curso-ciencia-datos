OK, i just finished watching the whole movie. let me start by saying that my love for Julia stiles has nothing to do with it. the first movie rocked. it was funny, interesting and had clever humor. Paige was just that really cool girl that we all wanted to know, who had a life of her own and hobbies of her own and did not really NEED the prince, but in the second film she is portrayed as some dumb blonde bimbo. they didn't make her as "normal" (maybe common) as in the first film, they also made her completely dependent on the prince- having no hobbies other than him. even her dream to be a doctor seemed to be pushed aside. luckily, it wasn't completely brushed under the rug, like say.. the Prince's little sister! um yeah, not mentioned once in the second movie. and WHAT is up with that ugly hairdo? it's like, they didn't just change the actress, they changed the whole person. i couldn't see an ounce of the old Paige in the second movie. how very disappointing. Anyway, i just read that they're making a 3rd movie, to which i would advise them not to. they've gone over all the things they could, taking a new and original idea (the whole college guy turning out to be a prince thing) and turned it into some cheap tween-ager Disney movie. there's nothing to be saved, they should just give up before they invest money and time in any more dumb ideas.<br /><br />in conclusion, i hope you understood that you should not expect anything from this movie. it does not remotely remind me of any bit of the first film.
