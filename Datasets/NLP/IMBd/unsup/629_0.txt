Antonio Scarpachi is dead! Adrian Monk Lives! Long Live Tony Shaloub.<br /><br />Adrian Monk is a former Police Officer with Obsessive compulsive disorder and a fear of filth. He hates germs, has a plethora of other phobias, and wants to be reinstated to the Police Department.<br /><br />Monk has a photographic memory and an ability to notice everything. He solves crimes by noticing the things most people over look.<br /><br />In the premier I was totally impressed at how they use his obsessive compulsive disorder and his fear of germs to put him in predicaments that challenge his character. I love the way he struggles to overcome his phobias in order to get the bad guy. The show has comic relief that is classic Tony Shaloub schtick!<br /><br />With his cohort Sharona, he solves crimes, impresses the police and confronts the many fears he has.<br /><br />This is the Columbo of the new millenium! Not to be missed. I predict a long run for this program. I am not a USA Network watcher in general but I will be watching "Monk"!<br /><br />I am also a USM grad in Maine and I am proud to call Shaloub a fellow graduate. Well done!
