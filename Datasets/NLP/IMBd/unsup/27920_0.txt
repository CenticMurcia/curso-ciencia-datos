It feels almost weird to review a game that was made almost 10 years ago, but the fact that it still holds a place as one of the best games I've ever played speaks volumes of it's qualities. The story, the game-play, the very world you play in are all parts that make up this masterpiece. In this game, and it's even better sequel, BG 2 - Shadows of Amn, I AM Talle, an orphan from Candlekeep, whom is forced to leave his home and try to survive in a beautiful and at times dangerous Faurun. Few games has made me feel so involved. In fact the only games that compares are the above-mentioned Shadows of Amn, Planescape Torment and Fallout 1 & 2, all products of Interplays daring and artistic vision. With risk of sounding like an old man I have to say it's a shame they don't do games like these anymore.
