That's the typical salad bowl martial arts movie from the early 70's, when hong kong low budget movies were the new wave in cheap entertainment. The acting is poor, yet not unwatchable. The white martial artist looks like a Miami vice ripoff Don Johnson ripoff ante litteram. Bolo makes his figure as a henchmen's leader playing two drug kingpins against one another. It gets scenes shot in Turkey, so it hadn't to be a really really low budget flick.<br /><br />The screenplay is a mess. You get drug kingpins & traffickers trying to cheat on their colleagues without a clear understanding of anything. You get lame subplots about romance. Many people run, like in the police thug telepictures, ex Inspector Bluey, etc.<br /><br />You watch it, and suddenly you can't make a difference between it, the many "American ninja" hotdog movies & hong kong rubbish.<br /><br />There is no Ninja in the movie, except for a fight scene where masked people overpower Bolo, who then just asks them who they are, and they take the mask off!!!<br /><br />Cheap VHS feed even during the cheap VHS boom of mid 80's.
