Recap: 30 years after a top secret research project was shut down, a team of the Special Investigation tries to deal with the aftermath. Someone with intimate knowledge about it kidnaps and murders anyone who was involved (and the lead SI agent's son - well, almost anyway). The SI unit has little leads until the Chief of Police is kidnapped and his daughter, a police and scientist herself, seem to set them in the right direction.<br /><br />As the investigation continues the team discovers how complicated investigations and life can be were cloning, cryo-treatment and genetic design is possible.<br /><br />Comments: Does the recap sound confusing? It did to me, but with a lot of potential. But in the end the movie did not help to resolve anything, instead leaving me more confused than ever. Or, quite frankly, I lost interest somewhere along the movie and don't really care that I didn't catch anything.<br /><br />One problem, the main problem in my opinion is that a lot, seems to be most of it actually, of the dialog is carried out by radio or phone. It is also disconnected from what is shown, so it's very hard to know who says what, and who belongs to which group. To meddle with matters even more the dialog changes between using names and numbers without really saying who is who. And as a last addition there appears to be some cuts in time as the dialog runs along, giving the appearance of some people being able to be everywhere at once.<br /><br />In effect, I wasn't sure who was firing at who and why, in the movies shoot-outs. There are a few of them, but not sure why really. Quite nicely done though.<br /><br />Visually, it is very beautiful. Mostly set in very dark and damp places there are some few bright futuristic specks of light and neon, and advanced buildings. Also we have some ghostly images of memories intertwine with the present. Very nicely done, purely visually, too. But it did not help explain or straighten anything. Only confused me more as you had to keep track of what did happen in the present and what did happen in the past.<br /><br />Not really bad, but can't really recommend it anyway.<br /><br />4/10
