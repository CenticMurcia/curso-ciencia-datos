After seeing and hearing some of Leny Bruce originals, kudos to great performance by leading man Dustin Hoffman (Lenny Bruce). Not by a chance any less of a great performance also by Valerie Perrine (Honey Bruce). Interesting completion of screenplay by its concept through interview with Lenny's wife. Super cinematography, excellent choice for black & white touch what actually makes the story even more complex and ready to sink in. There are some faults but I simply ignored them for the same reasons written above. So them (faults I mean), you will have to find yourself and decide how to comment them. Definitely in top range of Hollywood movie making.
