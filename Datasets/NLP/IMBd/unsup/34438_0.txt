This is one of the worst cartoons I had ever seen, and the worse is that the cartoon is about one of my favorite characters, I mean Sonic the Hedgehog. The cartoon is practically a remake of the actual videogames, with some new characters, but those characters are so pathetic that make this an awful cartoon. The worse thing is that the characters are almost invincible, I mean, one day I was watching this cartoon (the worst thirty minutes of my life) and Sonic jumped from a mountain, how could he survive? I mean, even if he is a super fast hedhehog he could easily die doing that. Then, he beats every villain so easily, even showing his blue butt while standing over a missile, please. This cartoon receives from me: 1/10
