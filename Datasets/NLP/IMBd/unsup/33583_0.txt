rented deadgirl nov 15's afternoon along with another, better horror movie, laid to rest. rented deadgirl based on a lot of positive reviews from various print and electronic sources. big disappointment, in my opinion. <br /><br />while watching deadgirl, i kept thinking/hoping, we get some backstory about the deadgirl. who was she? her connection to the abandoned hospital? how did she die? <br /><br />the teenage boys and their behavior was nothing new. if the actors were trying to be annoying and stupid, they accomplished their goals.... the lead characters were the most annoying. kudos to them. i mean, they were thinking with the smaller heads...........
