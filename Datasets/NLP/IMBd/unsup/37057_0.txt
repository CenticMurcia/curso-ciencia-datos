This movie could have been so good. It's a great concept. Someone reads aloud and can pull characters out of books. Unfortunately, a poorly written script that plods along like an old horse, a director who can't seem to decide whether he's making an action movie or a fantasy for kids, and drab, over-dark cinematography sinks this movie. Simply put, it's boring, it's humorless, it lacks any real heart, and it just never seems to make a bit of sense. The acting performances are good, but can't come anywhere near overcoming the problems this movie had. <br /><br />This movie was such a waste of a good opportunity to make something special.
