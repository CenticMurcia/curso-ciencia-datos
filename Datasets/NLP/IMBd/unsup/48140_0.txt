This film was doomed from the start. The ONLY thing it has going for it is the music. The film is about a rock star who wants to become the ruler of America. He gets all of Washington (pretty much!) high on LSD. The acting is abysmal and the story is even worse. The terrible acting is a surprise considering some of the names in the film. Hal Holbrook, Shelley Winters, Richard Pryor (before anyone had heard of him), Ed Begley and even Dick Clark are in this film. But the acting is still totally awful. The entire premise of the film is ridiculous, the story implausible and the directorship poor also. I gave this film a solid 1!!!!! If you ever have a chance to see this film, DON'T!!
