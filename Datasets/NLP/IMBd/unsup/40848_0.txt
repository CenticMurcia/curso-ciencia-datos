The commenter from Walla Walla got it right. The Joe Besser stooges shorts are masterpieces by comparison to this total waste of film. It's not even remotely funny or even amusing. Instead of laughing, I was angry at someone as minimally talented (and I am being nice) as Ted Healy beating up on my stooges. Talk about a third rate comic, this guy is worse than that. I guess they had to start somewhere. Maybe they were all funny on the vaudeville stage together, but they were not in this thing. Stay the heck away from this film. It is not worth wasting 20 minutes of your life. I'm not even going to mention where I saw it to spare you the pain.
