Before watching this movie, I've never heard of it. I watched this title because it was a spur of the moment kind of thing. I had no idea what this movie was going to be about, and no idea what genre it is. This movie was action packed, thrilling, amazing in every shot. Every scene and every shot is purposeful and totally meant to be there. The cinematography is flawless. The only flaw is that it was too good. It seems like a movie that seems worth watching again, but when you do watch it again, it seems kind of repetitive, kind of like transformers. It seems like it would be a good movie to watch if you're going to reminisce.
