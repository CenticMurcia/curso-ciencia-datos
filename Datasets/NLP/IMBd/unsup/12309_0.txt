This sequel is throbbing with cheap and cheesy scenes. Not to mention Jesse's homosexuality placed throughout the movie. Even if it was unintentional (according to director Jack Sholder) I didn't 'intend' to see horror movie classic monster, Freddy Krueger star in such a disgraceful flick to the series, or see one of the characters that Jesse kills nude. The first movie was INCREDIBLE, probably the best in the series because it didn't need special effects or anything high-tech it just was naturally frightening. In the second film they attempt to use special effects and fail, in the third film they use special effects to their fullest extent and create a very good movie also scary in some scenes. The second will be nothing more than a comedy to me.<br /><br />I would just skip this movie, if I must go into more detail why you should, I'll gladly tell you. 1.Nancy is absent through the whole movie. 2. The movie gets off on a bad start (Jesse is a creep riding on a school bus with two other girls, the school bus driver misses the stop, rides off into a sort of desert and stays there. Gradually, land falls off beneath them until the school bus is remaining on a single piece of land. Freddy reveals himself and fights them as they try to balance themselves. Jesse wakes up screaming and sweating, you can see what a crappy job they did on the whole scene.),middle(just about everything)and end(They are back on the bus going to school and Jesse gets worried, he screams "Stop you're going too fast!" his friend reassures him in the worst acting ever. She says "Its OK Jesse everything is going to be alright" at least I think thats what she says. Then there is a skip and Freddy's glove has magically came out of her chest and she starts screaming.) 3. This movie has left this reviewer and HUGE Nightmare on Elm Street fan for a loss of words because they aren't enough cuss words in the English language. In conclusion, if you are looking for a good Freddy, don't look here.
