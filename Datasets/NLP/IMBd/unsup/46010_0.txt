Whoever came up with the idea or script for this movie shouldn't have. This was basically garbage. Like we need more spoofing movies, but this was made terribly. It seemed as though the creators were trying way too hard to make this just like "Scary Movie", but it wasn't even close. I wasn't too fond of the acting, either. Most of the actors in this movie aren't known too well, and I don't think it would even matter if they got better known actors, because this movie would still be horrible. They spoofs such movies as I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream, and many others. All the characters were stereotyped, like always. The cruel beauty queen, the loner type, and basically any other type of person. It wasn't put together well at all, like it was just all jumbled together, and they tried to pull it off as a funny, well scripted, laughable movie, but it didn't work. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and there is probably only 2 scenes in the whole movie that are funny. If every movie is sold out in the movie store and that was the only one left, then that's when I would get it.
