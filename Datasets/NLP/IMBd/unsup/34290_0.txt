Mamoulian ruined practically all the songs in this musical comedy... Such beautiful songs as "Lover" and "Love Me Tonight" would have been presented by Lubitsch in a much more entertaining manner... Mamoulian seems to have been obsessed with moving the camera around (as if that is what makes a good film) .... "One Hour With You" was directed by Lubitsch and released in 1932. It is such a delightful film that I have seen it over 25 times.... and it is entertaining every time... I had trouble watching "Love Me Tonight" even twice... So many things could have been done better... His technique is unbelievably childish... He doesn't understand how to portray the actors properly... (both Chevalier and MacDonald look absolutely terrible at times)... their acting is unbelievable as well as the manner in which they handle the songs... they amade by Paramount in which she sings "Love Me Tonight" .. this short sequence is better than any musical sequence in the actual film) I don't understand why people praise "Mamoulian" so much... he was a terrible director..
