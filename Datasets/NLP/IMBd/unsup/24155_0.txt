it is a knock-off of butterfly effect, and the acting is sub-par. But keep in mind this is aimed towards kids, who won't typically care about acting.<br /><br />BUT, very enjoyable storyline, many of the scenes playing right out of your half-forgotten memories. Audio track feels thin at times (some scenes are not scored), but the indie-sounding songs are fantastic.<br /><br />Overall, had a great underdog feel that has you rooting for the side of good, and lets you forgive the failures in the film's production.<br /><br />P.S. the hilarious DVD menu alone was worth the $1 rental for me!<br /><br />rent it, even if it's just for you
