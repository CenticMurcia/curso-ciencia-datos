Mistakenly lured by the cast listing of John Hughes who turned out not to be the one I was expecting, I'm glad I had an opportunity to see this forgotten, low budget British comedy.<br /><br />This was a great absurdist comedy about a bunch of working class (and some unemployed) young British (and Scottish) lads who decide that a good way out of their persistent daily slump is to break into a warehouse and steal its stock of stainless steel sinks, for which they could make a killing on. The entire movie is pretty much introducing you to their misery (in a humorous manner, no less) and then the planning (which is quite amusing). For an extremely low budget with a sometimes difficult to discern dialog (poor audio, though there is some noticeable re-dubbing), I was pleasantly surprised, especially after being disappointed with director Bill Forsyth's American comedy, "Breaking In." Here, you have a pleasant cast of assorted (and somewhat clueless, but well-meaning) young guys and their rather innocuous, but desperate attempt, to make some money. Check it out if you can find it.
