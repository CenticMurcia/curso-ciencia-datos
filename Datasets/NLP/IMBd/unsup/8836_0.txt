I'd rather kill myself than watch Lipstick Jungle. The acting is TERRIBLE and there is NO humor in any episode at any minute at any second. Boring story-lines, really the story changes every episode. It is just like the twenty minute series, where the story changes in every episode. From the first episode I was a little impressed. Though it wasn't funny, they produced a fine 'Pilot'. But then- when we get to 'Pink Poison'. BOR--------ING------------!!!!!!!! Cannot believe these producers want to make a series like 'Sex And The City'. And now there's Cashmere Mafia. Oh God! Brooke Shields wasn't the best actor, Kim Raver was pathetic and Linsday Price acted like an over-excited child. Her voice just makes me want to rip her throat out... I beg you, all of you who haven't watch Dipshit Jungle yet, Don't WASTE YOUR TIME.
