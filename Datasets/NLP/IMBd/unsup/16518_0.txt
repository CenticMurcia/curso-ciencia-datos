This new remake is definitely one of my favorite Tobe Hooper films in years. Angela Bettis (May, Carrie) stars as the newest resident of an old apartment building, apparently housing aspiring actors for decades. Immediately, she despises the building with it's strange tenants, shady repairman, broken fixtures, and when she notices that the residents start disappearing, she investigates - discovering it may have something to do with markings engraved on the walls (forgive me for that long ass sentence). The sets are nice and creepy and there are plenty of good gory demises, of course resulting from the use of power tools. By the way, since most of these death scenes were heavily trimmed for the R rating, you'll have to check out the DVD for the complete scenes which is definitely worth it. The killer in here is cool, reminding me of that deformed oaf from The Funhouse for some reason. Must have been the grunting in one scene. Certainly worth a look, since it differs greatly from the original.
