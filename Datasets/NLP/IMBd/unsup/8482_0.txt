Never heard of this movie, well not surprised.And yes this is real. In 1992 a batman cartoon was made. It was more serious than any other children's cartoon on TV at the time. The success of this children's TV show was later made into a film in 1993 called Batman Mask of the Phantasm. A new supervillian is killing gangsters in Gotham city and everyone is thinking it is Batman. Meanwhile Batman's old love interest is back in town. A lot of the movie is told in flashbacks of Batman's affair with his love interest as well as in the flashbacks it is giving the question if batman should lead a normal life or if he should don the mask of the batman. The movie is kinda of like the animated version of batman begins, but I think it's better than Batman Begins. It has some good action scenes, possibly the best storyline of any batman movie and a great voice cast. Most of the actors returned as their roles from the show. One of which is Star wars's Mark Hamil who voiced the joker in the show as well. If you're a superhero fan (espically a batman fan) then try and find it on DVD and give it a watch.
