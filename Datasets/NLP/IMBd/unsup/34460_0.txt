A complete flop. This is one of those "people finding themselves in spite of themselves" type of stories. Lame script writing, unrealistic situations, dreadful overacting, and aimless direction lead this movie on a meandering voyage to nowhere.<br /><br />It's New Year's Eve, and some 20-somethings are having an overdue dose of coming-of-age, mentally, socially, etc. Already, I hear you snoring. Why should anyone care about losers who are 10 years behind in their intellectual development? The film engages on a wild dance between several groups of characters, each more dimwitted than the last, as they try to seek out some big "in people's party." We all know that we find ourselves by getting bombed on New Year's Eve, don't we? Every single character is a familiar "Dumb and Dumber" stereotype, and the pseudo-philosophical speeches they deliver fit these stooges about as well as The Gettysburg Address would fit being recited by Michael Jackson. The cornball link for the disparate group of random fools is that they're all chain smoking nerds. Inspired? Thought provoking? Maybe you'll be thinking about what you'll do after the film is mercifully over; that's about it.<br /><br />Nobody achieves anything useful, and the story just plods along until you have an epilogue sequence on New Year's morning, most of the characters waking up in strange beds, and realizing that they learned nothing from all of this. The audience ends up feeling the same way.
