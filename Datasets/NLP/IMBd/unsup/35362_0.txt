The first of 3 diabolically unfunny films which were spin offs of an equally atrocious television show. Of course it's not PC and there are elements of both sexism and racism. But that was acceptable in the 70's. What is not acceptable is the awful script, poor (over) acting, shoddy production values and complete lack of any lines even remotely funny. Each 'joke' is telegraphed minutes in advance, for instance spilling something or falling over, and is so painfully obvious it's amazing not one of the cast complained about the lack of quality. Only Arthur (Michael Robbins) leaves the show with a modicum of dignity, the rest of the cast are pitiful. If they had any talent, they didn't use it on this show.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague, it's dreadful.
