Flawed in so many ways, hard to pick at anything in particular. What's really terrible are the horrible performances by a slew of fine actors and actresses.<br /><br />Every single performance in Tombstone shines above Wyatt Earp. Obviously, this movie was only made to compete with the other. Quaid's Holiday seems to be very fit and spry in comparison to Kilmer's well thought out and researched version. When Wyatt Earp III informs the viewers on the special edition DVD that he believes Kurt Russell's performance will go down in the history of filmmaking as the most accurate portrayal of his Grandfather, you have to listen. I doubt anyone can argue his credentials on the subject!<br /><br />What is really bewildering is the vast number of people on IMDB who really liked this one, one should not tout his/her cluelessness in such a manner.<br /><br />Here's a clue, rent Tombstone!
