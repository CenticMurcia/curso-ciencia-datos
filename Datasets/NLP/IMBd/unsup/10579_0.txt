This film is fun. What a refreshing change from the usual po faced Sci-Fi time travel theme. That's not to say that it doesn't have a serious side to it though. I loved Sean Astin's speech at the beginning which reminded me of some of the best moments from Blade Runner or 2001 but I also enjoyed the sheer energy of the film. Another thing I loved was the strong character played by Ivana Milicervic. As a female Sci-Fi fan (not the only one surely!!) it's great to see a woman kick butt especially against a guy like Vinnie Jones! My favourite part of the film was near the end - don't worry no spoiler here!! - but suffice to say there are some amazing visuals that combine with a clever story tie up and soaring score to make for a pretty spectacular climax. Don't miss this one or you'll be sorry.<br /><br />Laetitia
