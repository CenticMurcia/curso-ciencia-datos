A completely pointless remake of the 1942 film "The Tank" starring Humphrey Bogart. The Bogart film at least had some propaganda value in inaccurately depicting US troops in the Battle for Tobruk, which was an almost an entirely Australian affair. The overblown portrayal of all Germans as nasty, fanatical Nazis was frankly laughable. The only believable acting was of James Belushi as a typical loudmouthed American, or was he just playing himself? Surely 50 years after the event we can have some intelligent films about the Second World War.
