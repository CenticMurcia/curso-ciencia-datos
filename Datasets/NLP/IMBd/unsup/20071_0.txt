It's actually more than like Big Brother. It was like in a sect. The difference is that cameras are everywhere.<br /><br />All the contestants have to live in the dark for a period of one month. They are virtually prisoners.<br /><br />In fact, to add to the reality of it the director never informed the actors that the actual filming would be done in the dark.<br /><br />This caused a lot of problem. <br /><br />After a day of filming in the dark, one of the actors went completely mad and smashed a camera.<br /><br />He refused to go on and left the set. <br /><br />Soon after his lawyers threatened to sue if they didn't remove him.<br /><br />I wonder who it was. Anyone knows?<br /><br />They had to remove another actress who was shot in the nude, in the toilets and in the bathroom having a shower.<br /><br />She had second thoughts about the whole project.
