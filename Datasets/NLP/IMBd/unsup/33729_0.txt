I thought maybe it was just old age creeping up on me. The Jimi Hendrix that I remember from my youth sounded a whole lot better than what I saw on this DVD. I thought I had just changed my tastes and wasn't into his songs anymore. Then I read some reviews here....and I feel better. It wasn't me: it was this concert - it sucked!<br /><br />I just wanted to have something on film of one of the most famous guitar players of all time, so I thought this long concert would do it.<br /><br />Well, this disc has already been traded for something else. All it turned out to be was noise, which was really disappointing considering the songs I liked best from him were all included in this concert. Unfortunately, they were hardly recognizable. If anyone knows of a really good Hendrix DVD, please PM me. Thanks.
