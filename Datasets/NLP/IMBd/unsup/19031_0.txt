SERIAL MOM, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy which will leave a big smile across your face. If you ask me, Beverly (Kathleen Turner) was very liberal about the way people should live their lives. After Carl (Lonnie Horsey) got bumped off, I was truly grossed out. If you want to know why, you'll have to see the movie. I really didn't like Dottie (Mink Stole) and Mrs. Jenson (Patsy Grady Abrams). However, when Beverly made those crank calls to Dottie, I laughed absolutely hysterically. When I saw an extreme close-up of the Sterner's (Doug Roberts and Kathy Fannon) mouths as they ate their dinner, I was absolutely disgusted. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did an outstanding job. Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Kathleen Turner, you should see this excellent comedy which will leave a big smile across your face.
