I don't know what it was, maybe cause I was 18 when I saw the film and a Letta us guys had girlfriends (or were in love with girls) that were a fies years younger and it just didn't fit in back then (mostly with the fathers) and the movie kinda made it feel better for us, made us all feel like we were OK and that the feelings were real and OK, I was overwhelmed at the time, being in a relationship with a girl that was 16, it helped me sort it all out. Or at least made me feel better, I am still to this day believing that Rex was so much better than even he knew, I know he has gone on to do so much in Broadway and I have heard real estate, but "you take my breath away " was our wedding song, I would have liked to see a "Sooner or later 2"<br /><br />Dam I miss those days
