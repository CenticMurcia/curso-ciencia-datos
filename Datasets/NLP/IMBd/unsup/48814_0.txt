Just watched it...a Blair Witch Project ripoff...How could anyone believe that modern video equipment would produce such poor quality...like shoving a guy and the video goes bananas...carrying a monitor around the woods, what a joke, these guys could not carry a monitor across the room...ATF investigating, not a chance in the real world. Even the actors cannot keep a straight face in most of the shots. Blair Which Project built characters from the ground up, this backyard quality movie doesn't even have characters. The title of the movie has it right, the producers, writers, editors, and actors should have seen their last broadcast. I would never pay to see anything of this poor quality.<br /><br />Luke
