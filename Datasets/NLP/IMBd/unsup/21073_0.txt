Forget the Passion - THIS is the film to view if you really want to know more about who Jesus is, and His life here for 33 years on this planet. Unlike any other version I've watched, the producers, directors, most of the main actors and supporting staff of this film were ALL Christians themselves, who prayed regularly over every single scene AND again unlike any other edition, they held EXACTLY to what scripture said as the ultimate script - absolutely nothing was added in - some occasions required a voice over where to reenact the scene may have proved somewhat inappropriate (e.g. the Angels at the Tomb), but other than that, this is absolutely categorically the best one in my view. Sad that it's often neglected or overshadowed by more 'secular' versions. Bruce Marchiano who played Jesus in this one continues on to have an awesome ministry following his portrayal of a 'different' Jesus to the stereotype.
