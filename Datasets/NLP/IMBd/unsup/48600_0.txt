This is a turgid melodrama, very loosely based on a Maugham story and designed to appeal to people during the Second World War. It's an odd movie in several ways. It wastes the huge talent of Gene Kelly, and does little more for the gifted Deanna Durbin. Deanna cries and sobs and looks hurt a lot, while otherwise amiable Kelly is forced to appear to be mean and insensitive. Two flashbacks tell the story, the second being set earlier in time than the first. The music throughout is a mess, becoming so loud at the corny and predictable ending that you want to shout at the screen. Several scenes in the film are just filler, including a symphonic orchestra scene that must have cost Universal a bundle. Gale Sondergaard was good, but then she was playing her usual villainous role.<br /><br />In short, here is one to miss. In the following year, Durbin would shine in Can't Stop Singing, and Kelly would delight in Anchors Away. They both no doubt shuddered at war's end to think of Christmas Holiday.
