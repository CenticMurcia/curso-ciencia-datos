Great Movie! This is a movie for adults disguised as a children's movie. Chris O'Neil (Noah) and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn (Emma) turn in an excellent performance as two kids who've found a box full of amazing things on the beach. Their parents David and Jo, played by Timothy Hutton and Joely Richardson are perplexed as their kids quit acting like kids and start focusing on their new "toys". Noah's teacher Larry (Rainn Wilson) taps into the awareness that the kids are connected to something much bigger than all of them. This movie is difficult to compare with other movies. While it remains down to Earth and family oriented, it might be a little too complicated for young children. Expect young kids to twist, squirm, and talk while you are trying to catch the story. The special effects are great eye candy, but they are backed by a great story. It was particularly fun to see real life mathematics prodigy and physicist Brian Greene play a scientist in this movie. His presence alone is like an endorsement that the plot has some intelligent thought behind it. It's a fun movie. It's suitable for all ages, but perhaps an older crowd will appreciate it more. It's worth buying, renting, or seeing in the theater.
