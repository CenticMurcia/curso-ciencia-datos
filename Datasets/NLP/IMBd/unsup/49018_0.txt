Maybe other people appreciate this, but if you are a fan of Zucker Abram Zucker type films (airplane etc.) or Ben Stiller movies, you won't find much to laugh about in this film. I didn't find anything save for (spoiler) the finger cutting off scene at the end, which is a twist on the way movies usually do things. Even that was not laugh out loud funny, more funny in the sense of "We are in on QT's joke about the film industry". Big Deal.<br /><br />This movie is worth it's 5.9 rating, i.e. it is below average. Don't bother. It must have gotten that rating for the elements of drama that it had, it seems that great comedies such as Austin Powers series etc. can't push more than mid 7s without having an element of "social significance" or drama as Dr Strangelove might have.
