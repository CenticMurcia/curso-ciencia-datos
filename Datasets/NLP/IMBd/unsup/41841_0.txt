First the good: Scott Lunsford is great as Caleb, the straight college student who lusts after Gwen. Besides being gorgeous (he reminds me a bit of Hugh Jackman), Lunsford gives a really good performance. Emily Stiles also gives a pretty good performance as Gwen; sure, she's way over the top--but it mostly works in context of the film.<br /><br />Now the bad: well, to be blunt, everything else. The plot is basically straight out of a bad sitcom, peppered with one-liners I mostly did not find funny. The sound and lighting were terrible; some of the dialogue was muffled and all the images had the same dull, flat look. Jim Verraros (who I'd never heard of) wasn't very good, and Ryan Carnes is cute, but did a mediocre job. The minor characters were uniformly bad--the worst being Caleb's parents and sister.<br /><br />That being said, this will likely be big hit on the gay film festival circuit--but will probably get no audience outside that tiny group.<br /><br />Before and after the film, when the director spoke, he seemed like a nice guy, and was certainly very cute--so, I wish him well in the future, but this is really bad first feature.
