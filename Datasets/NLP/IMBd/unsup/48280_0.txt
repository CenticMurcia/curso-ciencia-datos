This movie is nothing to be psyched about! It was hard to follow, confusing, and just ridiculous to ever put the label "Horror" on it.<br /><br />Something about a psycho woman witnessing her sons death and becoming obsessed with finding her sons killer (and i only know that from reading the movie cover). <br /><br />Its a waste of time and money, not even bad enough to be laughed at. The only reason the actors could categorized as "good" actors is because they had a maximum of three lines each in the movie! The entire time my head was ringing with some shitty Michael Myers/Circus/hypnotizing music sh*!...<br /><br />The only reason I rated it a 2 instead of a 1 is because I was put through the high school movie production of "Near Death" last night.
