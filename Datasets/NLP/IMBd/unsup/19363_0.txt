"The Circus" was made between the classic "Gold Rush" and what is, arguably, Chaplin's masterpiece, "City Lights." It dates from 1928 and is, without doubt, one of Chaplin's great films. It opens slowly, but don't let that put you off - it quickly accelerates. And, as for the ending? Anyone moved by the ending of "City Lights" will love the ending of "The Circus:" Chaplin's character, strolling toward the horizon, leaving love and friends behind, disappears into the distance, setting up a scenario to be repeated in "Modern Times". Simple, touching, beautiful. Sandwiched between, "The Gold Rush" and "City Lights," this film is often overlooked, but it is a wonderful Chaplin classic that deserves to be more widely known.
