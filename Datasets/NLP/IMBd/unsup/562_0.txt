yeah, well we begin. I will start with the introduction for asking if any of you ever watched a b horror movie from the eighties, yes you will adore this one because the movie gives all the clich√©s and serious acting applies for another star for the movie, except "Larry Joe Campbell" from "According to Jim". He is really enjoying for filming a b type thriller movie(I love him). Our another star is for "Lola Glaudini" from "Groove". I am so glad to see her again. She is so into the movie.(I know they are having so much fun) Gossip Girl star, Leighton Meester, she is really shocking for me such as being in this kind of a movie and I think she is a secret gem like Ed Westwick(it was an compliment). I am a fan of the b movies, especially 80s. I say if you know the bad movie history of eighties and if you have a couple of friends in same taste, you can have so much fun. this is one of the good ones in its following the 'let's appreciate and respect the genre of thrillers in 80s. My top is, yeah, comedy and horror, I say Evil Dead, which is more fun and Braindead which is more drama. I'm giving you ten because I'll be watching you. Warning! Not Stable.
