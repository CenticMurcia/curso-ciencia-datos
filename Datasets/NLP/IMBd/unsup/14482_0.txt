Though the storyline was slow at some points the dancing at the end with Patrick Swayze and his wife was just amazing. You could see the love and trust between the two as they danced. It brought tears to my eyes. The final dance between the three main characters just had me spellbound and had my mouth just gaping throughout the scene. I never realized the hard work that dancers go through and they deserve credit for sticking with such a difficult occupation and the training they go through. For anyone that loves music and dancing this would be an excellent movie to see. I always knew that Patrick Swayze could dance but,this was so revealing as to how well he does,even after all the injuries that he has been through. Perseverance pays off.
