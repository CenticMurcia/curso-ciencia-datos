"Donkey Punch" is another movie in the sub-SUB-genre I have personally categorized and labeled the "trouble on a yacht" genre (other such films include "Dead Calm", "Open Water 2", and "Visitors" or anything that predominantly takes place in, on, or around a f!cking yacht...) and it certainly isn't anything remotely compelling. The concept of the Donkey Punch - a sex act involving aggressive contact, applied to the back of a chick's neck whilst performing anal copulation - was interesting, but that was really IT for the "thrill" aspect after that particular scene... We start off with the standard group of pea-brained party-girls vacationing in Spain, who meet up with some guys with a boat. There, it feels like an hour of pointless prattle, then a hot scene of group sex, Donkey Punch resulting in an accidental neck-snap, followed up by the whole "lets ditch the body and get out of here" routine... Strange how I've heard such positive things about this UK flick, because I actually found it enormously dull and drawn out. Not a whole lot of violence either - the best scene is an expected flair-gun blast that's pretty funny, but otherwise there's not much on that end... If only "Donkey Punch" had SOMEWHERE to go, plot-wise, after the first 30 minutes or at least tacked on a bit more T&A and a lost LESS of that hair lipped-meth-head and overly forced "alpha-woman" BS, it might have been able to hold my interest a little better. It's just a weak and pointless flick, overall...
