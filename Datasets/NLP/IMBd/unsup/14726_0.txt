Just for Madhuri Dixit! This is MD's first movie role since Devdas (2002) and it is worth a watch just to see the India's beauty on screen again.<br /><br />HOWEVER...THE MOVIE'S PLOT LINE SUCKED. It was beyond ridiculous and boring and unrealistic at best. Plus, Madhuri Dixit (now a mother of 2 boys) certainly did hold back in her acting, as she is known as being a bold, confidant type of female character.<br /><br />The songs are good, and the movie has a number of great actors such as Madhuri, Akshaye Khanna, Konkona Sen Sharma, Irrfan Khan, Kunal Kapoor and Divya Dutta.<br /><br />However, Madhuri if possible should return to films but accept small supporting roles as well (such as Rani Mukherjee's character in Saawariya) because there won't be a great shooting load and she has aged and no longer can carry a film judging by Aaja Nachle's failure.<br /><br />AGain, I do say watch the film if you want to see Madhuri again, the movie does solely get a 7/10 for her presence (or else it would get a 2/10) or watch one of her other films instead such as HAHK, Devdas or even Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam.<br /><br />Also, there should have been more focus on her relationship with Akshaye Khanna than the "theatre play" and politics.
