Recap: The fight against the Arachnids are not going too well, despite the efforts of popular Sky Marshal Anoke. The war effort must be better, more recruits must apply. So an aggressive commercial campaign is launched, spearheaded by a singing Anoke, at the same time as dissidents are executed as a statement to the public. On the frontlines where Colonel John Rico is commanding that doesn't matter much. The Arachnids are still far more numerous than the humans, and is ever testing their defenses. But when the Sky Marshal crashes on a apparently deserted planet in the middle of the Arachnid zone matters look grim indeed. And they get worse when Rico get tried for insubordination and no one seems interested in rescuing the Sky Marshal. Rico's friends must now first save Rico, and then mount a covert rescue operation deep into enemy territory.<br /><br />Comments: This is definitely a sequel too far. Haven't seen the second installment in the series, but the first one, the original based on Heinlein's novel, is really good. Even then I didn't expect too much at all out of this. And I still managed to get disappointed.<br /><br />Even if Casper van Dien (how desperate must he have been?) returns from the original cast, and manages to bring about the same that he did in the original, his support is too weak. I think only Jolene Blalock, a veteran from a Star Trek series, manages to escape with her dignity. But it isn't by much, and certainly not thanks to her character or the story. Supposed to contain a big twist it is predictable as rain and the characters are mostly thin. The dialog is almost stupid and delivered in a completely unbelievable manner. Sometimes the acting is disturbingly poor.<br /><br />What really kills a movie like this, if it hasn't got a strong story to lean on, is the bad effects. They don't come close to the effects in the original, and it further weakens the plot. When an entire platoon, armed with automatic rifles and grenades don't hit a even one of hundreds of monsters that charge at them, due to that the effects doesn't cut it, it is time to stop. It is time to pull the plug. Why do a movie at all if you don't try to do it good.<br /><br />The sole chance it got is to be so bad it turns comic. It fails even at that, cause it actually tries to pass as a serious movie. The only redeeming parts are the somewhat funny news reels that intersect the story.<br /><br />Even though I do like the genre, and did like the original, I really disliked this. Can't recommend it at all.<br /><br />3/10
