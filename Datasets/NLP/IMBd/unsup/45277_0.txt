I walked out of Kill Bill. Why? Because the Gen X/Y/Zers were enthralled with this bloody, violent kufu exploitation movie. It is a sad state of American or International Western society when movie audiences state that "they loved this movie". A movie that only Uday and Qusay Hussein would find entertaining. GEN X/Y/Z are so desensitized to violence in the movies they have grown up on (e.g. Bad Boys II) that it's no wonder they find this movie f**kin' cool. The truth is Tarantino is a sick, demented, bloodthirsty soul who was forced to watch bloody, '70's exploitation movies in "grind house" theatres as child from a broken home - no place to go - the movie theatre was his baby sitter like Cable TV and VHS/DVD's are to<br /><br />many of the X/Y/Z'ers today. Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Natural Born Killers....more...Kill Bill all sick stories. The best thing that can happen to Tarantino is that he will discovered how powerful a G-Rated story can be sans gratuitous violence, foul language, and really bad humor. Grade: F+
