This movie lacks in every aspect. It is neither entertaining nor educating nor funny nor scenic nor factual. Don't waste your time. It has no plot line other than subliminal smear on the Arabs. Acting was stiff and transparent. The leading actress truly embodied snobism and lacked realism. It was boring, badly shot, uninspiring and totally flat. If there was any less than a rating of 1 it would have deservedly earned it. Nothing good can be uttered about that movie other than thank goodness it ended. The scene at the dinner table, with the 3 ladies, in the ship was so lame and meaningless and a cheap emotional commercialism nonsense was added to it with the little girl being there among childless women.
