The only reason I got sucked into this drab, dull, slow paced, nowhere-going movie is because there was nothing else on TV at 3am and I had insomnia! There were a couple of characters that were somewhat interesting, however, the storyline never delved deeper into their personalities the way I had hoped...and left them being empty shells of people with no real backgrounds or insights into what made them tick or why they were the way they were. The ending was a HUGE disappointment with with one of the major characters...(I won't say who or how, so as not to ruin it for someone else who might be into this kind of film)...but I was left feeling like I totally wasted my time watching this movie!! I would have been better off taking a sleeping pill and tossing in my bed until I fell asleep.
