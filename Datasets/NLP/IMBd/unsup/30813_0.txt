This series takes place between episodes II and III and depict the Clone Wars, where the Glaxay becomes a war zone and Jedi Anakin Skywalker rises to knighthood and discovers more of his inner darkness. Darth Sidious continues to rise and the stage is set for the final tragic events of Revenge of the Sith.<br /><br />The prequels were a dark time for most fans up to this point. Episode I felt like an overblown prologue. Episode II infuriated them by depicting the Galaxy's most legendary villain as an infatuated youth. Enter Gennedy Tartakovsky. Lucas commissioned a series of animated shorts to depict the contents of the clone wars and explore many secondary characters, since he had run into a wall by only starting the war at the end of Episode II.<br /><br />"Clone Wars" is THE reason to forgive any mishap in the prequel trilogy. It packs a rhythm, inventiveness and humour almost absent form the first two films of the prequel saga. Though it allows itself to explore darker elements in the story, it also has moments of inspired lunacy that will make the most reluctant adult viewer giddy and hysterical. The animation is smart and gives the whole thing the important feeling of not taking itself too seriously without being self-conscious. Finally, since great characters like Yoda, Grievous and Mace Windu have seldom been better used than by Tartakovsky, we should rejoice that his input in the Star Wars universe is destined to continue for a while.<br /><br />If History loves Star Wars as much as I do, then Episode I will be forgotten forever, replaced by Episode II. The Clone Wars series will fill the void and we will then be left with the prequel trilogy we had all hoped for.
