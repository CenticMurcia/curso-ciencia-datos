Reading over the bulk of the comments here, I have to wonder if I even watched the same film. Good lord, this is just a pathetic waste of celluloid (or whatever film was made of at the time).<br /><br />Here you have a smug, TOXICALLY pretentious Frog, discussing the supposed weighty matters of life with a ridiculously insecure, middle aged lackey.<br /><br />For hours they debate the lofty virtues of owning an electric blanket, what their dreams REALLY mean, and how they should eat dinner. And then it's up to the audience to insert meaning into otherwise insipid blathering. And - sad to say - we seem more than eager to do just that.<br /><br />A monumental waste of time...
