One of the best Turkish movies that I watched in years! It is certainly in the class of great Italian movies; the script, acting, cinematography, and the music are all great! <br /><br />This movie tells the story of an era in Turkish political history full of military oppression, violence, prosecution, and ignorance in a satirical way. The choice of the song "International" as the theme music in the movie is smart and wonderful!<br /><br />I have only one criticism about the script and that's why I did not give a perfect score: the events in the last 5 minutes of the movie have evolved very quickly and ended in an unusually dramatic way, which made me think if there were financial reasons for ending the film so abruptly. Otherwise, it had the potential to win prestigious international awards. Congratulations to the crew who produced such a great movie with a small budget!
