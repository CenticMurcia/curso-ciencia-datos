These games are AWESOME. If you have any way of obtaining a copy, I suggest you do. Not only are they fun and challenging (not too hard, though), but they also are filled with jokes! Guybrush Threepwood is my favorite computer character... and, if you're more into "modern tech.", then look up Escape From Monkey Island, the fourth in the series.
