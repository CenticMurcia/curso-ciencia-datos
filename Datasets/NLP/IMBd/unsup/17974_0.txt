Dennis the Menace was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The actors were brilliant, there was not one part that no one would not laugh about it. Out of ten I give this movie a ten plus. The actor Mr Wilson (Walter Matthau) was the best of them all. Knowing that a 72 year old man could be that great in the making of this movie. it is a terrible shame that he passed away in 2000. I will miss him terribly. He had made heaps of movies that were fantastic and really funny to watch.<br /><br />Joan Plowright was great playing Mrs Wilson. She really knows how to act.
