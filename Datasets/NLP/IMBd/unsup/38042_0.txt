Blatantly profane, smarmy attempt at a comedy, dealing with the uber-intense plot of a slovenly softball team trying not to get kicked out of their league. Perhaps if I grew up back east, where apparently close friends engage in non-stop insults of each other, their wives, and even small children. Or more importantly, was still a 14-year-old boy who could delight in laughing through a cupped hand at the hardcore sexual references. Maybe I'd be singing praises from a rooftop somewhere. Instead, I stared embarrassingly at the amateurish mess in front of me.<br /><br />I'm sure the target audience will cherish their dvds, but the limited release is the tell-tale of how unacceptable this is to most crowds. It borders on the same humor that made "Virgin" and "Anchorman" hits, but those films --- though I hated them --- at least limited their vulgarity. This film just purposely goes for the throat in terms of tastelessness and constant four-letter dialogue. <br /><br />It was good to see Macchio again (you could tell he asked that his cuss-words be kept to a minimum), and even Seymour Cassel play against type. But the casual nature of tossed off lines dealing with ejaculation and bj's was utterly desperate. And must we see another implausible romance between a hot slut and a greasy pudge? It's getting old. Did I mention the stripper that can launch ping-pong balls from her vagina? Nuff said.
