I've seen this in 1978. I've really been there and done that, myself. How True! Lost a Soul Mate at age 17 (1967). Found her in 1976 (age 26), Lost again in 1986 (age 37), found again in 2001 (age 51). We both saw the movie in 1978, again 1980 (HBO). We'll see MY video from HBO, soon. We both know the real story, it's us. We agree, this is it. WE won't loose each other again (both age 55.5). Each time I see it, since 1986, I always get choked up. Even tonight at 9:30 PM (EST) (12/19/2004), It was harder to relive the truth, of the plot and lyrics. It wreaks, of ME. Facts are Facts. You don't realize, until you loose it. In the meantime, we share the same feelings and a 22 yr. old Daughter. That will help us all be together. we NEVER say, "Goodbye". WE SAY, "GOODNIGHT". Questions?
