A pointless plot and bad acting characterize this film that needs to be thrown in the garbage. Master P isn't master of anything except stupidity in this movie. This movies features some of my favorite comics but they come off looking aimless in this film. Word to the would-be watchers of this movie: Ghetto fabulous + hip-hop non-culture + bad acting + pointless plot = A film that ain't.
