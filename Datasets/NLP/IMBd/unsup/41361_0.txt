Who would want to see these 4 girls act together in this movie? I'm glad they won those categories at the Razzies! Seriously, Yasmin can do better acting than that! The plot was awful, the actors were awful, and I caught more than 20 goofs, no lie! What's so important about this movie, anyway? The basic summary is about 4 female losers who get caught up with other losers for 730 days! Then they get in a food fight and become friends again and they try get rid of the dumb blonde! Then the Mexican becomes a moron and neglects her friends, and then everyone's happy at the end! What a good movie! It should have won an Oscar (like that would happen if it were the only movie ever)! The only thing I liked about this movie was the song "Out from Under" sung by whats-her-name. So I give this movie a 1, though it should get a 0!
