I am quite the horror buff, so after seeing that this movie was in the top 50 horrors of all time, I had to rent it. I must admit that the low budget filming and the strong English accents took a bit to get used to, but once I got past that I was able to see a movie with great acting, a decent script and some great brutal scenes. The lead actor playing the soldier coming back home did a magnificent job at playing a "pissed off mother fu*&er"! I will definitely make it a point to see some of his upcoming films. As for the supporting actors, they also did a wonderful job, including the thugs and the mentally challenged brother. All in all, this was a good thriller with quite a twist!
