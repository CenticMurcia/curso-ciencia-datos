Though the acting was ok...I'm tired of seeing big name actors on the cover of B-movie video boxes(was this made for video or was it released in Japan?)...did they just need a payday? Not as bad as LAPD with Dennis Hopper but I still gave it a 1. I apologize to everyone who believes that this style of movie-making is art!
