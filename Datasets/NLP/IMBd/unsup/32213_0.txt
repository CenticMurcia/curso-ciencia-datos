How much do you know about intercourse? Well, Woody Allen's wacky masterpiece "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask" tells all. Whether it's the nerdy court jester (Allen) who wants to do it with the queen, Dr. Doug Ross (Gene Wilder) having an affair with a sheep, the most unusual game show, a man's experiences in transvestitism, the attack of the giant breast, or the epic tale of an ejaculation, the whole movie is a laugh riot. As you might imagine, there are some great lines, particularly in the medieval sequence.<br /><br />One thing that I've always wondered about is what in Woody Allen's life prompted to make so many movies like this. Granted, he grew up during the sexually repressed '50s, so when sex became an acceptable topic in movies, he was ready to show it. But still, how does he come up with these sorts of things? Oh well. The point is that this is one hilarious movie.
