I usually like Mike Meyers and have enjoyed his Austin Power movies. I knew this was supposed to be a silly comedy so I did not expect real 'value' by the movie experience other than entertainment. I was thoroughly disappointed. I don't remember laughing once. I was annoyed at the stupidity. The acting was over the top. Gwyneth does not have acting skills - I still wonder how she got that Oscar! Don't waste your money on this one.
