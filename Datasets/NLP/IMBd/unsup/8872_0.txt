"The Leopard Man" is the third and the last horror film made by Jacques Tourner in collaboration with RKO's producer Val Lewton, others being "Cat People" and "I walked with a Zombie". Made using the same visual and narrative techniques as the previous films, this one is not so successful in achieving the same quality as other two of them. "The Leopard man" is a sort of "mixture" between a horror film and a film "noir" or a "balance" between them, if to say it correctly.<br /><br /> The story is simple: a leopard escapes from a traveling circus in a small New Mexican town and terror begins to reign when the corpse of a young woman is found apparently dead as a result of leopard's attack. The hunt for the leopard begins while more people become victims of a ferocious animal, meanwhile the question arises: Is it really the leopard who is guilty of all those murders? 7/10
