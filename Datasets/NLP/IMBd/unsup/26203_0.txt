i really liked the movie. although there is one thing that i still don't understand very well. my question is about the end so if you haven't seen it don't read this.... alright everything that involved Julie was her imagination just the story for the book. but she met Julie right. so how come in the end when she passes by Julie they don't even look at each other as if they haven't met..... if someone could explain me it would be very helpful. my other interpretation is that she didn't even go to France and everything including the space (house and the swimming pool) was created by her. but that doesn't make much sense. thanks
