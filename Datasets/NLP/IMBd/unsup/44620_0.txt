This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Let me tell you the bad things about it.<br /><br />1. Acting. It is so bad, I've seen home movies made by 12 year olds with better acting than this garbage.<br /><br />2. Plot. It's so stupid, and it makes no sense. I've written better stories in elementary school.<br /><br />3. Dialogue. Deplorable. And the delivery of it was so bad. If a big-budget film maker saw one of his actors talking the way they do, he'd kill them.<br /><br />4. Sound Effects. Every time someone moved their arm or turned around, it'd make this "whoosh" sound. <br /><br />5. Special Effects. Squibs were off-center, blood had no consistency between shots. (In one scene, a man gets shot in the head. The blood that splatters on the wall is dark red. The blood that leaks from the wound and smears on the wall is almost orange.) Avoid this movie at all costs. If you see a copy at the store, throw it down and smash it, you'll be doing everyone in the universe a favor.
