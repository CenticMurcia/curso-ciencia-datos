I've been watching the show since it started back in '97, so of course i went and saw the movie when it opened. I was a little concerned when hearing that it was done as a musical, as all the voices are pretty unique and wasn't sure how they would convert over to singing, but was pleasantly surprised. The songs are very well done, and the 'singing' voices of the characters are all actually pretty good!<br /><br />I was definitely excited to also see what they would do without needing to be censored for TV. The comedy of the TV show shines through, and you can easily see how "different" the authors are when they're not required to keep some things out for TV viewing.<br /><br />As the show continues to do well and keeps coming back for more, they should definitely make another one!
