I am a mother of two boys aged 6 and 2. Both my son's are avid Thomas the Tank Engine fans and we purchased this film about 4 years ago when the oldest hit the 'Thomas is everything' stage. We watched the film a few times and he seemed to be hooked. At one point the film was getting played twice, every evening in my house. It is now having the same effect on my youngest son, who is also an avid Thomas fan. We all love this film and enjoy it every time it is played. It has a real warm, feel good effect and we will never bore of it. The way the film makers have managed to mix the real life with the animation of the trains is excellent and having the trains speak themselves is brilliant too. We love Thomas the Tank Engine and we love this film too.
