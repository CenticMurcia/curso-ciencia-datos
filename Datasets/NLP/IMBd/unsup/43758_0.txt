Boy {Matthew Perry} meets Girl {Salma Hayek} in a queue for the toilet in a club. Cue both people from different ethnicities ending up in bed together doing something that neither of them have done before. Cue three months later and Girl tuns up in Boys life announcing she's pregnant. Cue emotions pulled apart, a hasty marriage, family strife and many stumbling blocks getting in the way of potential true love.<br /><br />Sound familiar,? not surprisingly this retread of a formula that is as old as the hills has very little originality. The script is desperately dull, the ending is exactly what the world expects and the leads have zero chemistry. That only Perry and Hayek are "names" in the film speaks volumes one feels. You get the sense that what budget there was went on getting the sexy Hayek and Perry {riding on the crest of his Friends wave} to appear. Little flashes of comedy do from time to time surface, and, yes, those who like a cheery cup of the love froth with their rom-coms will feel fuzzy come the end. But really it's a poorly constructed and executed picture, the type that unfortunately seems to come out on a yearly basis. You have been warned, stick with a Cary Grant movie instead. 3/10
