This movie is DA MAD ONE!!!!!!!! The best russian crime-ralate flick since Banditskij Piter! of course, Lis is not as stylish as Celishev, and Otec ist as good as villain as Antibiotik was, but movie has a piece of our mysterious soul:) And the "power-to-the-beats" or "valhalla" scene? No comments, folks, just watch it yourself!
