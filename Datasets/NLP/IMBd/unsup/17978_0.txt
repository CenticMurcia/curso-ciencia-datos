Nick Castle directed this hilarious family film that did better then what people give it credit for today.<br /><br />This is a live-action version of the classic comic-strip that i still read to this day. Walter Matthau and Mason Gamble fit their characters so well and have such great chemistry together. Joan Plowright plays Mrs. Wilson in this movie. Lea Thompson and Robert Stanton also make an appearance as Dennis's parents. I was questioning Christopher Lloyd's role when i saw this in theaters because that almost overshadowed the fact that this was a family film and his role as a robber caught me off guard. I didn't like his role until the end, him and Mason Gamble have a great moment together in the end when Dennis is torturing him, i laughed to tears on that seen, the knife nailing him the butt.<br /><br />Overall, an 8 out 10. There really is no plot to this film, just a good hearted comedy with a great cast and some great comedic moments.
