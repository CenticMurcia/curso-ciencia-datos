Much has been made in these pages about this film, as far as not being a true story. This inspired account about an injured horse the Crane family bring back to life, is one of the most engaging films about the racing sport in memory. Of course, this is no "Seabiscuit", but the film makers are not claiming it to be.<br /><br />John Gantins, the director and writer of this picture, knows what to give the public. Aside from the heart warming feeling in the film, he was blessed with a cast that does justice to the material. The love of a young girl for a horse, that by all accounts should have been shot because of the injured it suffered during an accident, is the stuff that makes good family movies. <br /><br />"Dreamer, Inspired by a True Story" is totally dominated by Dakota Fanning's presence in the film. Miss Fanning, is a luminous young actress the camera adores. She is a natural, as she shows in this film. Dakota Fanning has the uncanny ability of being real at all times. Her love for Sonador and her determination to take the horse to the Breeders' race consumes her, as well as her family.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is also good as Cale's father. He is a man of principle who loves what he does best, bringing horses to their full potential. Kris Kristofferson plays the grandfather who wants Cale to succeed and in the process he is reunited with his son. Elizabeth Shue is seen as a mother who has to work to help meet ends when her husband loses his job. David Morse, one of the best character actors around doesn't have much to do, and the same goes for the wonderful Luis Guzman, playing one of the stable men.<br /><br />The film is recommended for families with children. Mr. Gantins created an excellent entertainment that will satisfy young and old because it shows a young girl with a firm resolution to do the right thing for the horse she loves.
