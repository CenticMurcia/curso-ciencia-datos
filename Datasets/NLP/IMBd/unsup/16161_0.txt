I don't know why they do this direct-to-video sequels. Like recent "Wishmaster 2", this sequel to the very enjoyable "Candyman" and "Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh" only intends to offend the fans. It reashes the ideas from the originals, and its plot setups. It has twists like the leading woman discovering she is the great grand daughter of the Candyman. Well, I'm the great great great grand son of those guys from "The 13th Warrior", so let's make a sequels. Bad visual and gore effects, worst direction and lousy acting, specially from Tony Todd. The dramatic ending is pathetic, ridiculous.<br /><br />This "thing" humiliates its original. It's the kind of sequel no movie should haver had to have.
