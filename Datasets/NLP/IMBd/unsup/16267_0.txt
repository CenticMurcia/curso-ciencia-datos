Rupert Everett as the Master Detective? Yes please! It's all in the nose. You can spot an actor who is ideal to play Holmes as soon as they turn sideways... they just have to have The Profile. And the fact that Mr Everett can act is obviously a given... A glorious bit of arrogance with a few insights in Holmes's more unsavoury side. This is clearly a Holmes for the post Silence of the Lambs generation. To say any more would constitute a spoiler. One question (and I shouldn't think this is in any way a spoiler) - did they use the word 'pimp' in Victorian times? I'm not so sure... Well, I've ticked the spoiler box, so that's me covered! I was rather fascinated by Watson's ears... but a wonderful bit of acting as literature's most put-upon-best-mate-and-colleague. It's a good story which was a lot of fun to guess along with, with quite modern twists to it. The supporting cast did exactly that, and with aplomb. The main star, London itself is seen through tantalising gaps in the fog. Which, let's face it, is about all one would have seen!
