It is quite important to remember when watching comedies that humor is a very personal thing.<br /><br />If you are offended by vulgarity; if you hate Benny Hill, and can't see the fun of Barbara Windsor's bikini popping off; and think that concept that breasts have nipples is outrageous; if you think broad humor is a pointless waste of time then this really is not the film for you.<br /><br />If you thought that France = sophistication, therefore this must be high-brow: then I simply suggest that you get out a bit more.<br /><br />But if you had read the packet before you watched it you would already know this.<br /><br />This film is a 'diversion'. A farce. An enjoyment. Treat it as such and you'll be rewarded.
