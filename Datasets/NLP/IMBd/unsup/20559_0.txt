Minority Report is one of the best sci-fi/action film that I have seen in a while, it is in the same vein as Blade Runner.<br /><br />The story is a very interesting one. In the future, they can predict murders before they happen (who will be the murderer and who the victim) but as the film proves it doesn't matter how perfect the system looks, it still has flaws and can be used unscrupulously by someone with a bad agenda which happens in the case of John Cruise's character John Anderton. He lost his son and he believes in the system and even enforces it but it isn't till it is used against him that he realises it is not a perfect system.<br /><br />The special effects are amazing and the action really does have you on the edge of your seat. I like that the film is very unpredictable, you really don't know how it will end especially when Anderton is faced with the man he thinks took his son and you wonder if he will really kill the man. Also, you wonder how Anderton will get out of the situation when everything is against him and you are really left wondering right up to the end of the film how it will be resolved and how Max Von Sydow (Lemar) will be brought to justice, I really enjoyed the twist at the end.
