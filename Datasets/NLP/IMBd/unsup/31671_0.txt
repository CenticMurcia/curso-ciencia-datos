This movie is very similar to Mary Poppins, but with a crude twist - the nanny is not a looker. No disappointing acting performances, although one of the children looked like she came from a different family all together. Either she got her features from a gene that was passed down from long ago, or the former wife has a lot of explaining to do. I guess the casting agent was asleep or just attempting to be fired so he/she could collect the unemployment and eat govt. cheese.<br /><br />There wasn't anything offensive that I recall. There is a little "gross" humor, but the reaction of the audience was very positive. <br /><br />Regardless, the movie is fun and keeps your attention well. My kids loved it.
