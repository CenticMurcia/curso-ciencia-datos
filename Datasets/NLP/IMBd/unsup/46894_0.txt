Imagine being lectured at by Muslims on the awfulness of slavery. Being lecture at, in other words, by the people who were trading in African flesh centuries before the Europeans reached Africa, who taught the Europeans the slave trade, and who are trading in African flesh today in places like Sudan, Mauritania, Mali, and Niger.<br /><br />This movie is produced by Halaqah Media. Although the movie's Islamic flavor is kept tastefully toned down, you cannot miss the message, since you will get hammered by it from beginning to end, for the whole of the movie's seemingly interminable 116 minutes. The message: the Atlantic slave trade is the worst thing that ever happened.<br /><br />And why, exactly, the Atlantic slave trade was worse than the Muslim slave trade? Hey, why don't we ask some African slaves to see if they think so. You will have to go to some Muslim majority country to do that.<br /><br />Naturally, our Muslim documentarians do not do this. They explain that when an African was ripped from his family and from his community by Europeans, this was awful, awful, awful. But when Muslims ripped an African from his family and his community, he just became a member of a new family. Really. That is what they said in the movie. No kidding. In other words, Muslims come with guns and knives, raiding and killing, because they love Black people and want to take Black people into their families. Unlike the Christians who must have been very bad people.<br /><br />Finally, they manage to interview just about every race hustler in the U.S., including some representative of the Nation of Islam. My favorite was Frances Cress Welsing, author of the book, "The Isis Papers". I read that book some years ago and I am sure Welsing is mentally ill (she thinks the word "semite" comes from the Latin "semi" meaning "half", as in "half a man"). You will not get that impression from the movie, however, since they did keep her appearance mercifully short.<br /><br />Well, if you want to see how propaganda is done, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, go have a cup of coffee, instead.
