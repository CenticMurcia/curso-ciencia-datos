Clearly someone trying to relive their youth, through bad animation, is behind this. I am not saying that this person can not make good animation but the wanted to pay tribute to really bad animation my mimicking these awful styles. These animations were done out of lack of care or lack of sobriety and now someone wants to painstakingly recreated that?! I think it's more of a let down than an homage. I chuckled once, the material is fairly good as far as story but I think a more refined style would have even made this better. I understand that this was created entirely in 3D and then forced to look 2D but I think the process is similar to using a nuclear bomb to kill a fly - which may be the next adventure of Hoverboy.
