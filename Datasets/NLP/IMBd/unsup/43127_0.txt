"There's nothing funny about Meat Pie.<br /><br />It's a bunch of set pieces with people getting sh*t on and ejaculated on, blokes kissing blokes, and things happening for no reason. The acting's worse than a skit on The Footy Show, the "jokes" are bastardisations of gags from other films and The Simpsons, it's borderline racist - and much worse, completely nonsensical." And I'll just add that it's rude, pointless, stupid, unfunny, pathetic, and it cost me 80 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. It's the worst thing I have ever seen, and I hope that nobody makes the same mistake I did of being nice enough to give it a chance
