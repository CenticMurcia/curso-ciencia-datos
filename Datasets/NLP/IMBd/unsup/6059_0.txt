When I saw this film at The Grove with my parents, I was truly disappointed at this film. I loved the whole Scary Movie Trilogy, but why this!? Shaq couldn't act, I didn't laugh at any part except the part of the president showing his ass to the nation. The theme wasn't funny at all, the Brokeback Mountain scenes weren't even clever or FUNNY, mostly any scene the writers wrote weren't funny. So why making this movie??? I don't understand why New Line Cinema would buy the script. However, don't even bother seeing this movie. Go rent Happy Gilmore or Meet the Fockers, but don't waste your money buying/borrowing this mediocre film.
