This sucked. I only watched it because "pusher" was entertaining. The only good thing about this is that filmmakers can see how a hand-held camera, and available lighting can make a film cheap and fast. Bummer.<br /><br />I was amused to see how white racism is universal. As a black person from the U.S., it was interesting to hear Danish Muslims referred to as "niggers" when they looked like white folks to me. I guess all non-whites are "niggers" when you feel threatened by immigrants. Sad.<br /><br />I'm not sure i would watch any of the directors other work based on this. Like I said before "Pusher" was engaging, and you were sucked into that world. Here, you just didn't care.
