You know a movie is bad,I mean really,really bad when your 11 yr old tells you that they want it on DVD - because its the funniest film they have ever seen. No criticism ever written can truly describe this wonderfully botched attempt at a horror film.The actors even look embarrassed as they run around empty buildings dodging the CGI "ants" that in the finished product appear absolutely nowhere near them! What was Mitch 'X-files' Pileggi thinking when he took a role in this Turkey? My only guess that appearing in this was better than doing the 'convention' round between jobs (ala just about anyone from Star trek!). Maybe it is SO truly bad that as a comedy it's great! G'day from Melbourne!
