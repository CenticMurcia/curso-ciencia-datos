This beautiful and moving film provides via a sensitively handled love affair an intriguingly subtle morality play.<br /><br />The owner of a restaurant saves the life of a German who is trying to commit suicide after being turned down - by the restaurateur's mistress.<br /><br />This character goes on to achieve power as a Nazi. He uses his power to save 1000 Jews from the concentration camps, and makes a fortune for himself in the process.<br /><br />He does good simply to benefit himself. Was it right to save his life? Had he died, so many other lives would not have been saved. His life is interlinked with the lives and deaths of other people.<br /><br />It would be unfair to elaborate further on this theme, as it would give away the plot.<br /><br />The film also returns to the idea of life and death with its theme of suicide; suicide being the ultimate way to take control of your own life.<br /><br />With all of these thoughts, it is still an entertaining and uplifting movie, with the most exquisite theme. Life and death are united in the English lyrics given at the end, which combine gloom and hope in the most extraordinary fashion.<br /><br />A fair bit of philosophy built into a simple and tastefully done move makes for good entertainment.
