I was about 15 years old when I saw this movie, in 1969, I think. I never saw it again but I never got it off my mind even until today. Why? because It was very funny and it was just a hilarious story and well thought out.<br /><br />It tells a story where this guy has a number of girlfriends, they all found out he was cheating and decided to teach him a lesson that he couldn't refuse. Lots of laughter and hurting sides and you would keep wanting more and more.<br /><br />It would still do well even today and would fit right in with today's society. I would love to see it again. It really was ahead of it's time.
