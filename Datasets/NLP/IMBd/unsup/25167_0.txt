SIDE EFFECTS is a film about a young man who volunteers to be a guinea pig for a drug study. The mood set for this study was great and you wondered why this guy and the others would allow themselves to be so severely abused by the researchers. That's because there are so many negative side effects of the drug--nausea, illness and weird hallucinations by some. In addition, the food appears barely edible and the subjects are kept confined--almost like in prison. However, the hero of the film manages to do well for a while thanks to the help of another participant--a very pretty and sweet young lady. They hit it off well and it's only with her help that he manages to hold on as long as he does. However, he doesn't realize that despite their blossoming love, their relationship is totally doomed.<br /><br />I am a compulsive film reviewer and one of my favorite genres are independent short films. I have probably reviewed at least 500-1000 of them, so I am a pretty good judge of a quality short. Well, this one is simply terrific--with quality and intelligent writing, directing and acting throughout. I can't say enough positive about the film and sure hope you get a chance to see it.
