quite simply this film put me to sleep in under 30 minutes. Why bother using live footage of great white sharks and try to edit it into a movie. The whole thing stunk of being cheap and nasty and spoiled what was left of my night. i'm stunned to find they have made a Shark Attack 2, i certainly won't be entertaining it.
