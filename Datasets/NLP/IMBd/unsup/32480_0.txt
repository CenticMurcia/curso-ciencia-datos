When i read the comments here, i was hoping for a nice gory Zombie Event. What i got was a cheap piece of amateur trash! Sadly the overjoying comments here have to be from the Moviecrew themselves.. Every other "normal" people couldn't possibly that misguided, to praise such a trash movie. The Acting is ridiculous, the Effects are laughable at best, and even for a "Zombie"Movie the Story is just Crap. Wouldn't the makers praise their trash-movie so much, one could prepare for a nice piece of trash and it would be OK. But so, users hope for a decent Horror movie, and all they get is a piece of Sh.... Anyways.. only good thing at this are the nice, young, Greek girls - so everything has it good sides too, it seems.
