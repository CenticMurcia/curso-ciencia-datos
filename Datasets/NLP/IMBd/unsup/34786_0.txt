I don't like the fact that this show proclaims to know what god would do or say.<br /><br />No human can know the ways of god (if he exists), anyone and anything that tries to tell you what god ways are is a sinner who tries to scam you.<br /><br />Anyone who acts like gods spokesman is a sinner according to the bible, and for good reasons, people who believe someone is talking for god might go murder people thinking god told them to do it.<br /><br />Also, this show has bad looking actors, I don't want to sit in-front of the TV looking at ugly people, there are enough of them in the world I don't need them in my living room.<br /><br />The girl who plays Joan looks bad, her father looks awful, her off and on boyfriend also looks ugly.<br /><br />The might not look too bad but I believe if you are going to make a TV show, at least use people who look good.
