SPOILER I should get a refund for just sitting through the Core. It was a whopping 2.5 hours of boredom. Within the first five minutes I knew that the two main characters would get together, the rest of the crew would die, and they would be successful. The movie hit rock bottom when the characters got out of their ship into a geode that couldn't possibly exist. The temperature was about 9000 degrees and they're walking around in aluminum foil suits(witch conduct heat and energy). The only good part of the movie is when the guy who made DESTINY dies. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who has ever had a conscious thought or has an IQ equivalent to a small stone. If you want to see the movie, don't; Just watch the preview, it shows you the entire movie in 30 seconds.
