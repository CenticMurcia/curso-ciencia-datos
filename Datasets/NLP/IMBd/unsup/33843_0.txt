Oh God, where do I begin? The murder in the alley? The bad guy with the shark mask? The Nazi Pope? The clumsy lip synching by the plastic woman in the wheel chair? The plastic woman having sex? All the above? Yes and much more.<br /><br />Lets cut to the chase: this movie is awful. The first thing is the bad script. Crappy burger chain using human remains funded by the 'Nazi Pope' with crappy F-rated detectives on their tale. And somehow related to a shark-man who wants revenge. Already makes your head hurt.<br /><br />Then you got the crappy sound editing and the lousy camera work. Could they get the mannequin to lip synch right or was that out of the budget? And what is up with the mannequin sex scene? Just plain retarded in every aspect.<br /><br />Quite frankly this is the worst movie I have never seen such bad acting in all my life. In fact, this is the worst movie I have ever seen so far in my life. The only comparable film in horrible quality is "Deady Drifter" - aka "Out" with Danny Glover. But this one, with its non-ending ending and lack of brain power prove to be the undoing before this one ever began.<br /><br />Sucks, sucks, and yes - sucks. "F"
