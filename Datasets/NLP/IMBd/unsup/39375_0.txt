Well, I've seen a lot of really bad movies in the horror field the last few weeks, but this turkey is really bad!! Apart from the very good looking Melissa Moore (probably the most beautiful face in the Scream Queens roster), this movie about a demon possessing several hard-rock singers, it has nothing to make it watchable. Avoid like the plague<br /><br />
