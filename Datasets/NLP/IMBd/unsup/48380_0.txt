I guess Jlo just couldn't help her self, perfect opportunity she must have thought, I'm sure her and Marc Anthony had themselves winning Oscars in their triumphant film. Who cares if the film is all lies with enough clich√©s to fill Madison square garden. Thankfully the public stood away from this disaster. Anyone who knows the Lavoe story laughed at this farce. Not only did she produce a totally dishonest film she single handedly ruined her husbands once flourishing career. Shame on her for exploiting probably the Greatest salsa singer of his generation. Jlo today is an actress with no career just observe the golden globes on Sunday giving out an award because Angelina Joli wasn't interested in doing it. Sean Combs has more credibility than her.
