I recently bought the special edition DVD, and it is beyond all of my expectations. It has both versions of Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz, the 3-episode OVA and the theatrical movie with more scenes than the OVA. Gundam Wing is my 2nd favorite anime series, and I love the prequel/sequel Endless Waltz. I recommend the series and the movie, they are both a must-see. A space opera with realism, it reminds me of STAR WARS a little bit. Zechs Marquise/Milliardo Peacecraft voiced by BRIAN DRUMMOND RULES!
