Ivanhoe: A nice experience for a romantic fan<br /><br />This was a TV-movie I liked when I was a child, I still think it is okay, but maybe not a realistic end battle between Brian and Wilfred, and the same with the make up, some of the costumes and hair styles. But you will find a lot of good joustings between the knights. Some of the actors are better than average, I liked Sam Neill as Brian de bois Builbert and James Mason as Isac of York.<br /><br />Rating: 7 of 10.
