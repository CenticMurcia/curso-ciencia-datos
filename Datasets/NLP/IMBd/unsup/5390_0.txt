There is so much crap on TV, too many reality shows, bad sitcom shows.<br /><br />But this show is like no other, it stands out with it's interesting story about a collector of the devil who tries to save the souls of the people who made deal with the devil.<br /><br />The collector in this show is limited to one city, he can't tell anyone about what he do or else that person will go to hell if he know about it.<br /><br />Also every person who made a deal with the devil can't tell anyone about his deal or he will go to hell with the person he told about the deal.<br /><br />I still don't fully understand but apparently that kid Gabe knows about the collector and he can see the devil and has something to do with the redemption of the collector himself.<br /><br />The show is not confined to one set and in every episode you see a new place and new guest stars.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
