It's obvious that the people who made this have no feel for the characters or the comics. The story is full of holes, lacks logic (why did the Red Skull cut off his own hand to escape Cap instead of plunging the knife into Cap's chest? And why was there no blood gushing from the Skull's wrist?) While they did some things right (they did manage to make Matt Salinger look scrawny before the experiment), overall it was another attempt to take a character with a long history in the comics and put the filmmakers' own spin on it to poor effect. Captain America is a great character, and I'd love to see him done right, but after two poor TV movies and this wasted effort, I just don't think there's anyone in Hollywood who's willing to take the chance and make movie about a straight arrow superhero.
