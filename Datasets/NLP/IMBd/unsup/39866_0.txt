I am a great fan of vampire movies. When I saw the cover of this VHS, I immediately bought it without reading the reviews of IMDB. The storyline of `Dead of Night' is not bad: about a hundred years ago, a man loses the great love of his life. He becomes a vampire, expecting to find her reincarnation in future lives. Along the years, he stays with his sire looking for his former passion, and they feed every fifteen days with the blood of a lonely woman. In the present days, a detective is investigating their crimes, assuming the existence of a serial killer, and he meets a nurse, who is the reincarnation of the vampire's love. There are some good dialogs along the story. The problem is that the objective of this Playboy's production is not to be a vampire movie, but only an argument to show nude women. Therefore, there is no blood, no fangs, but lots of naked women. Fortunately there is no silicone also, and the naked bodies are indeed very beautiful. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `Sangue nas Trevas' (`Blood in the Darkness')
