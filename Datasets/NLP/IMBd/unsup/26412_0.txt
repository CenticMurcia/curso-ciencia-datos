Although she grew up in what many would describe as a fairy-tale world, this movie shows that not all Hollywood productions are "happily ever after". I was glad to see that, unlike many biographies, Annette chose to tell the true story, both happy and sad. Her failed relationship with Paul Anka, her divorce from Jack, and her subsequent revealing of her MS, shows what a strong and wonderful person she is. A true stroke of genius by the writers, directors, producers, and Annie herself to use the real Annette throughout the movie and to use her real family during Gina's wedding. I hope her surgery in 1999 was successful and that she is doing well.
