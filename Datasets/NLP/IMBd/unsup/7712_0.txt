Although I try not to miss any episode of "7 vidas" now, I have to say that I never watched it on its first seasons. However, the impression I have is that, like it happens with wine, this sitcom has been getting better and better throughout the years. Does anyone really remember that its initial premise was the awakening of a young man who had been in a coma since his late teens?<br /><br />Nowadays "7 vidas" portrays the lives of a bunch of people of different ages and backgrounds who constitute an atypical group of friends. However, the plot is the least important feature in this series, since it's mostly based on its humor. Puns, witty remarks, some physical comedy and an ironic view of Spanish society make a few millions of Spaniards await their weekly share of "7 vidas". <br /><br />Amparo Baro is the heart and soul of the series, but very few remember that her character was originally a supporting one. Blanca Portillo and Anabel Alonso have proved their great ability as comediennes, but the great discovery here has been unknown Carmen Machi, who had mostly worked in theater before and is now heading for a spin-off based on her character, Aida. Javier Cámara and Guillermo Toledo are sorely missed since they decided to leave the series, but new faces like Santi Millán or Santi Rodriguez have managed to keep viewers stuck to their TVs.<br /><br />This is, in fact, the live proof that a witty, well-written series can actually be successful in our country, and I hope it will still run for a few more years to come.
