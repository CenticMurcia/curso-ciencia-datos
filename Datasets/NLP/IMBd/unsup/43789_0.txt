I knew right from the beginning that this film would not be very good. For a start, the books just don't seem like the sort that should be turned into a film. I don't think Mr Snicket adapted it himself, either. There was so much sentiment and emotion in this film that I almost threw up. The same things would be said over and over again and I just didn't feel sorry for them. I was bored of their moaning. Does that make me heartless and cruel? Also, there was not enough explanation of anything. They just kept coming up with things from nowhere. Having read the books, I knew roughly how they ended up in the places that they did, but I still felt a little in the dark about it all. Speaking of which, the plot seemed to have come from a completely different book. So many brilliant and clever ideas were missed out, and whole new things were put in altogether. They might as well have given the film a completely different name. It seemed unnecessary to have compressed 3 books into one film because they were getting each guardian over and done with in about 2 days. They were out of Olaf's care within 10 minutes. Everything seemed very rushed and pointless. I expected something awful, and that's what I got. I was cringing all the way through. And telling Mr Carrey to get off the screen (even though he can't here me) because his interpretation of Count Olaf was dire. He's just too Jim Carrey-ish.
