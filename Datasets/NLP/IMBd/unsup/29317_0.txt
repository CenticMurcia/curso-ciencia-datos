Obviously, this film is not for everyone. It is quite a postmodern movie with lots of background meanings. There are hidden connections not only to the movies "Sukiyaki" is a remake of, but also to the ancient Japanese "Heike Monogatari" (The Tale of the Heike) and even Shakespeare's "Henry VI". So, this work could be compared to the Japanese poetic genre "haikai no renga", Ð° comic though quite emotional poem. This movie is not a deep philosophical opus, it is quite light and easy to watch, though it is for "those, who know". I am quite sure "Sukiyaki" will take a deserved place in the connoisseurs' movie library like some other "experimental" movies (i.e. "Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead").
