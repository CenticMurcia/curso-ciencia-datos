A total waste of time, this sorry excuse for a soft porn (that doesn't dare enough, anyway) is a botched thriller, with a Budapest scenario, where three sexy, perverted sisters try to lure a naive police inspector (falling to all three of them - well he has his reasons to not resist to these sirens) in making him believe none of them is guilty of the killing of the husband of one of them. Apart from a couple of interesting nightmarish sequences (very gory and cannibalistic, a trademark of the director, Deodato) and the well exposed graces of the ladies involved, the movie stinks as a thriller, even as a late example of Italian giallo, the plot is crude and convoluted, and the result is a mess. To watch only with fast forward.
