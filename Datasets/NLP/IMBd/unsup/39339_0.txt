Detective Breslin (Quaid) is after someone who is killing people and hanging them on a contraption with hooks boring into the skin. Ouch! Double Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!<br /><br />I like horses. I thought this was going to be a horse movie. Fooled again. No, it has to do with murders and Bible prophecy. OK, but Dennis Quaid is in it so it can't be too bad. Fooled again.<br /><br />There is a mixture of Quaid's character Detective Breslin agonizing over not being there for his two boys after his wife's death and the bizarre murders cropping up all over the place. The mixture needed more stirring. The murders are gory, bloody, perverse and it's hard to watch the crime scenes where the victims are hung up on some contraption with hooks boring into the skin. Makes your skin crawl when you see it. But, they do a very good job of showing this. Are they to be congratulated for this? I think not. <br /><br />I like Dennis Quaid. I thought this was going to be a good Dennis Quaid movie. Fooled again. Something went very wrong. The story for the most part. The clues are loosely presented to represent The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and what will happen to mankind when the veil is lifted. Give me a break. <br /><br />The ending is not surprising because the people in charge forgot to introduce other characters who may be the suspects so that leaves.well, I'll let you figure it out. You won't like it. You won't believe it. You will want your money back. Also the ending is incomplete as one cannot put oneself onto a contraption with hooks in the skin. So who put this person on the contraption? The killer or accomplice wasn't caught.<br /><br />I like horses. Next time I see a movie title with "horse" somewhere in the title, I will read the box to make sure I will be watching horses and will try not to be fooled again. <br /><br />Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, some, not much
