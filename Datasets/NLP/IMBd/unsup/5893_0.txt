I saw this movie almost immediately after watching Veronika Decides to Die, another film just released based on a book (by Paolo Coelho). Marginally I liked time traveller wife more, but its marginal. I started to read the book a couple of years ago and couldn't finish it; going to revisit and try and finish it.<br /><br />This is a nice 'time' love story and enjoy it for what it is. it has lots of twists and I have thought about the killing and the 'deer' business quite a bit. Yes a lot to pack into this movie but I cant really fault it, except I find characters such as the geneticist Hendrick suddenly introduced and we have to guess from that point.<br /><br />Perhaps this is a hard film to establish continuity but overall they succeeded. Was the film really two hours? Didn't seem like it on DVD. Quite a few things I still have not grasped from the movie, hence the need to finish the book.<br /><br />I never expect the two to be the same and never should they be.
