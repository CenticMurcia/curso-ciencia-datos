The Duel at Silver Creek refers to the place where the final confrontation between the good guys led by Stephen McNally and Audie Murphy and the bad guys headed by Gerald Mohr. <br /><br />Mohr heads a nasty group of bad guys who go around shooting hard working prospectors after they've signed over their claims. One of them is the father of gunfighter Audie Murphy.<br /><br />Marshal Stephen McNally is also on their trail, but he's slowed up by a gunshot wound that's left his trigger finger a might unsteady. He turns to Murphy as an ally of convenience.<br /><br />There's a lot of action in The Duel at Silver Creek even more than the usual Audie Murphy western. Unfortunately it's to cover up some really serious problems with the story.<br /><br />I don't know about how you would feel, but even to the kid crowd for which this western was clearly intended, when someone shows up with title to those claims it's going to be rather obvious who was behind all the homicides. My guess is that Don Siegel's film got butchered in the editing. In fact you know there's a piece out of it because McNally just all of a sudden shows up in an army hospital being treated for a gunshot wound you never see take place.<br /><br />Susan Cabot plays the good girl with first a yen for McNally and then for Murphy. Faith Domergue is the bad girl, bad as they come in westerns. She's in cahoots with the bad guys and shamelessly flirts with McNally and young gun Eugene Iglesias while all the time she acts as Mohr's moll in a more modern gangster film style. Domergue has the best role in the film, too bad the film itself is so weak.<br /><br />Look for Lee Marvin in a small role as one of the outlaw gang, if you're looking at all at The Duel at Silver Creek. Definitely for die-hard Audie Murphy fans.
