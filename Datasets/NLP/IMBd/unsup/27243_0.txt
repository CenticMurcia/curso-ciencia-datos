Impressive styling of the 1940s era and fine direction from Francis Coppola, whose middle name is Ford (ha!), makes TUCKER a historical tribute to the revolutionary, all-too-superior "car of tomorrow" that never was destined to bury the Big Three. It's not an entire biography of his life, but an account of triumphs and trials in his short-lived business. Jeff Bridges' character he portrays is a cheerful, mind-mannered guy who dreamed of making these autos since his childhood. There's plenty to like in this nostalgic trip, as this was made in a genuine vintage style. The opening best compares to a true classic sales promo, an indication of brilliant film work. Joe Jackson's cool 40s tunes he composed are extremely well made, although they get in the way sometimes. Drive on over to the video mart and check this selection out! Perhaps if we all had a Tucker....
