This film was overshadowed by it's live action counterparts by Burton and Schumacher, but this goes beyond any of them. For an on-screen adaption of a cartoon series, you'd think it'd just be eye-candy for kids. But this is true film-making, with a romance tale that rivals even the stuff of Shakespeare. The animation and art style doesn't feel like a cartoon, but more like a moving- better yet, living-painting. Just the poster for it feels operatic, and when Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, it truly feels so. The film really stays true to the comics, with an at times shocking and thought provoking origin story. The performances are pretty spot on, with Kevin Conroy delivering a true Batman, and Mark Hamill being show-stealing as the Joker despite his small screen time. It's much better than Burton's and obviously better than Schumacher's Batman films, and over all it's my 3rd favourite out of the franchise.
