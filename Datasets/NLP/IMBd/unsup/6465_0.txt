The sumo ring on the beach when they imitate the game made of cardboard. I will never forget that scene for the rest of my days. How Kitano ever thought to enter that in the middle of this serious movie is beyond me. I don't know anyone else that has seen this movie and I needed to share. Also the suicide at the end threw me.....why kill yourself after taking all of the assholes out? He could have still retired like he wanted. Was it guilt for the young guy that got killed on the beach? I don't know but I have a feeling that Kitano would want me to answer the questions myself. If anyone has any insight or would like to recommend some other Beat movies let me know.....
