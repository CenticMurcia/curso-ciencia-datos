I had no idea what to expect from this movie, so I was very interested to view it. Once it began, it was easy to see the premise and then I decided to have it become a guessing game to see who was behind all of the action. This review will contain some spoilers, so please don't read on unless you've seen it.<br /><br />The movie opens up with a very grizzly murder and just goes from there. It begins as a normal slasher flick... innocent people dying for no apparent reason and everyone seems confused as to what's happening and how to make it stop. Throughout the beginning, I was guessing to myself who was responsible for the murders, up until my choice got his head taken off by a power saw. At that point, I decided that I wasn't going to make anymore guesses. The movie is very well done, the action scenes are well-shot and very gruesome. The use of music is very good to heighten the mood. All-in-all, it was visually a very well done movie.<br /><br />Once you finally get to the ending and see what's responsible for all the killings, you realize that it's like no movie you've ever seen before and that's what makes it great. In this movie age, it's always good to see something new and fresh. I recommend this one highly... watch it with the lights out. It gets really creepy.
