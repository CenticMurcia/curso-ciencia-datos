Bad rip off of British Movie SNATCH.... if you haven't watched the British version of the movie.. you might enjoy the movie!!! The story is got some good presentation... shown as a bits of comic novel. Vivek Oberio as usual OVER OVER ACTING... SUNNY DOEL - again as usual screaming!!! Jackie - thank god - he doesn't walk like a zombie in this movie... Paresh Rawal and Johny - make u laugh!!! But again, as i told you... its not well in-acted movie..<br /><br />Ayesha Takia - looks totally trash - more like a small kiddo... Somebody needs to tell Shahid Kappor that he is no Superman!!<br /><br />SNATCH is fast paced movie and Brad Pitt is really good in the movie!!!
