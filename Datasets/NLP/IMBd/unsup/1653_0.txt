Though he's the title character, Welter Pigeon plays a back seat to the villain. The villain is played smoothly by the superb Joseph Schildkraut. The rest of the cast is fun. Nat Pendleton is Schildkraut's bodyguard. Donald Meek is Pigeon's sidekick -- and a beekeeper, to boot. Florence Rice is very good in what looks like a sympathetic role, and is, though she's initially on the wrong side of the law.<br /><br />What makes this stand out is its plot. We see this at the very start; so I'm giving nothing away: Schildkraut is blowing up ships at sea to collect on their insurance. It's shocking to think of such cold-blooded behavior. But to underline the heinous nature of his crime, we see the captain and some crew members chatting just before theirs is blown to bits.<br /><br />This isn't the greatest of Jacques Tourneur movies. But his masterly touch is evident. Schildkraut is often photographed in profile and generally partially in shadow. He reminds one of a streamlined, custom-made sports car of the time. He is stylish -- and almost impossibly cruel.
