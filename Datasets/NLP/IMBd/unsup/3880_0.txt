Guaranteed to make you feel like a dirty old man (if you aren't one already, and I'm NOT) - "Son Of Sinbad" is nothing but an excuse to ogle a bunch of scantily clad harem girls.<br /><br />The plot (such as it is) pauses frequently to allow another bimbo to wiggle her hips in an unnecessarily long dance sequence. The most ludicrous example being near the end of the movie, when one of the Good Guys thinks they won't have time to perform the spell which would defeat the Bad Guys. Well, gee, maybe you would've had more time if you hadn't just sat around for the last 10 minutes watching an Arabian Pole Dance! <br /><br />Most offensive however, is the speech Vincent Price delivers, wherein he convinces a certain group of women to give up their independent lifestyle so they can "love" men and bear their children instead! Still, Vincent Price is the only saving grace here (and the only reason I tuned in). His droll line delivery elevates the far-from-clever script. <br /><br />Needless to say, nobody else in this stinker was hired for their acting abilities. For instance, when one of the girls loses someone dear to her and finds herself in danger (I'm being cryptic so I don't "spoil" the "story" for you - Ha!), the "actress" displays no grief or fear as anyone would in her situation. Instead she pouts like a pampered floozy who didn't get the fur coat her sugar daddy promised her.<br /><br />Howard Hughes was notorious for stashing away lotsa women for his own personal harem. So it's no surprise that he produced this crapfest of a film. What is surprising, is that Vincent Price agreed to be a part of something so beneath his talents, and so very sexist. And don't tell me that *he* was a dirty old man too, 'cause I really don't want to know. Let me retain a little faith in humanity, 'kay?
