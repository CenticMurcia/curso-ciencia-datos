I enjoyed this film immensely. I had never seen a Bollywood film before this, and given that I love to sing and dance and watch romance, this film filled my needs and desires. It may not satisfy others' needs or desires, especially if realistic action/fighting scenes are required, or fantastic acting skills, or seamless dialogue. Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor meld delightfully in their romance, but after seeing a few other movies with these two superstars in them, I admit their acting skills are not exceptional-I noticed that their facial expression and vocal fluctuations are almost identical in other films. It seemed to me that they each brought themselves and their stardom to the scene more than the essence of the characters they were portraying. Maybe this is simply a trait of Bollywood actors and actresses across the board-understandable, since they make so many movies, it would be quite difficult to really learn each character and portray it believably. That being said, I loved Shah Rukh Khan's big hooked nose and his eyebrows, and Kareena Kapoor's beauty and personality beamed through this film. I have yet to see a Bollywood film with comparable dance scenes (I love dancing along to "O Re Kanche") and unforgettable music. The elements used in the cinematography for "Roshine Se" were beautiful. There are some other memorable shots that stick with you,for example, the memory of the spilt milk, that hold the magicalness of the chance gathering of all involved in making this film, the essence of something beautiful and perfect that will probably never come together again. That essence is as poignant and lingering as Indian spices, and that is why I love Asoka.
