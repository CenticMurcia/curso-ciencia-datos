I have always loved Agatha Christie novels because she never cheats in her mysteries. We're given all of the information and if we're clever enough, we can unravel the mystery and all will be revealed. This is true with the film adaptation of Death on the Nile. I adore Mr. Ustinov's Poirot and Maggie Smith, Betty Davis, Angela Landsbury, Mia Farrow and David Niven are just fabulous. Just so that no one is surprised the murders are very grisly even by todays standard, but the scenery is breathtaking and the sets and costumes transported me to Egypt and I loved every minute of it. Watch and enjoy!
