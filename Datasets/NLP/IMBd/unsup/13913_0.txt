"Bambi 2" is one of those rare cases which one can possibly say that at least they tried to create a sequel as good as the original. Despite the fact that the original is a far superior film, this one at least tried to be at the same level in many ways, even if this aim wasn't fully achieved.<br /><br />Unlike most Disney sequels, this one has great artwork. In fact, the artwork of this one is very similar to the artwork of the original "Bambi". The difference is that in the original the artwork is more refined, while this one combines the fabulous artwork of the original with computer/digital techniques and technologies.<br /><br />Patrick Stewart deserves recognition for his work as the Great Prince of the Forest's voice. He does a very good voice by replacing the original voice actor of this character.<br /><br />This sequel focus mostly on Bambi and the relationship with his father, something clearly missing on the original. Bambi's father takes care of him now, after the death of Bambi's mother. Not only we get to know the relationship between Bambi and his father, but also to know his father better. We also get to know Ronno when he was little.<br /><br />However, although "Bambi 2" is quite better and more "logical" than most Disney sequels, it suffers from the same "syndrome" of the rest of Disney sequels: it doesn't fit well on the first one's story. The time when this takes place makes one wonder and to make this question even more difficult, there are things that do not make sense when we look at the way how things happen in the original.
