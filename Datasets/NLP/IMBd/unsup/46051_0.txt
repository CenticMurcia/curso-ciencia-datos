i usually hold in good esteem low-budget C Japanese monster movies, simply enjoying them with a child's eye ( as i saw them first ) and giving them credit for what they are (Eg i'm not expecting Orson Wells acting, nor Star Wars VI special effects ). This one -however- is very clumsy, messy...nearly unwatchable. The plot is not the main point: extreme pollution triggers chain reactions. A new half breed mineral-animal mutant creature is born, fed by poisonous gases etc...and Godzilla is there to fight it before humankind gets destroyed...although the new monster has 3/4 time the upper hand...in the end the idea of the child characters saves the day after many ups&downs. The problem is the clumsy salad bowl, hippie, 1970-ish mess... Hippie 70-ish Japanese teens dancing & babbling John Lennon trash take as much screen time as Godzilla. Hippie, 70-ish crappy music takes too much time, as well. There are ugly cartoons reminiscent of communist block cartoons. There is this sob little child clogging our screen running here&there...a lame attempt to cater to children. When worse comes to worse, most scenes are shot in the dark, or near dark ( presumably to fake the just ridiculous & apparent shortage of special effects: the "smog monster" is simply pathetic ), thus making it difficult to follow. The dire special effects are awful to say the least, and i'm talking about your average Japanese monster movie. As i said, i had to sit through this predicament... utter garbage. The idea of a monster created by pollution will return later in Go Nagai's (the famous Japanese cartoon/comics artist ) dragosaurus movie, where his robots (eg Mazinger, Getter, Grendizer-Goldrake ) fight a monster born out of oil pollution.
