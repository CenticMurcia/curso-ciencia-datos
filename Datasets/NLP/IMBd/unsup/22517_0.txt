OK, not all the acting was top-notch. Or maybe not understanding much Hebrew deprived me of some of the subtext (especially the policewoman). But a plot with little motion is very hard pull off successfully. And I think Gitai succeeds wonderfully. The plot in our lives usually moves no faster than this. Does that mean our lives are without meaning? I was five years old when I was in Tel-Aviv, and I remember it being beautiful and modern. This was a bit of a shock for me. But this is actually life almost everywhere, even in the US. Politics is mentioned only peripherally, leaving us to ponder on the actual lives of individuals. The people are real, and politics is still there and does affect people, no matter how much you want to ignore it. But the movie is still about people. And this is a beautiful portrayal of their lives. Every character has some sort of frustrated passion. I recommend this movie.<br /><br />I'd like see someone from Israel comment on the policewoman. She has an unusual way of talking, a strange hairdo, and some important story significance. Does she represent a stereotype of an anti-Arab? Or is there some other comment the author wants to make?
