I use to think Tenchi is the best Anime show well Inuyasha beats him up Inuyasha is the best anime title I ever saw it has everything good storyline Authentic characters emotions love a bit fantasy and suspense the series is a masterpiece you get drawn in after two eps I was sceptical until I realised i found mt self looking for new epson the web <br /><br />The Authors and the series directors deserve all their credits I feel bad That Kanna will die but I cant wait till they continue with the series !<br /><br />If you watch an episode you'll love all the characters (how to bo to love inoccent Rin) (even Naraku is an evil character you'll like) also its genius how all characters including Naraku lead you threw the storyline ! just as if they were talking to us this series is a must see
