I could not believe the good reviews that I saw on IMDb for this movie. Everything about it is tired. Kirstie Alley and Diana Highland play transparent characters. This may be the result of weak acting, a weak script, or both, but finding anything in this movie worth connecting to is very difficult. The characters stumble through a mediocre story that attempts to pull on the audience's heart strings but the whole fiasco just fizzles under the flaccid plot. Don't be fooled by the "Indy" reputation that this film attempts to hide under. It is not indy, it is just cheap. The divorced female version of campy sci-fi. The inclusion of music made by a British swing band mirrors the contrived nature of this lukewarm soap opera. A must see for anyone with insomnia.
