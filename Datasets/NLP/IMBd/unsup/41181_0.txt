What a load of pretentious, pompous nonsense this flick is.<br /><br />Dear oh dear......absolute rubbish.<br /><br />The movie begins with someone being murdered in a French museum, and there then follows a unbearably tedious 'detective' trail with people having murderous intent and the hypothesis is Jesus had a wife, children and there exists a present day blood line blah, blah, blah.... Yawn....<br /><br />Without exception every actor/actress given ridiculously hammy and unconvincing performances.But every one of them seems convinced of their own self importance. Yawn.....<br /><br />The movie goes on for over two hours, but it seems like two years, and I fell asleep in it several times. Yawn.....<br /><br />If u can't get to sleep watch this as you will be slumbering within minutes:<br /><br />1/10
