I say that a mark of a good movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book, play, etc that served as the basis or inspiration. So, having said that, and, subsequently, not having seen nor read Marlowe's play "Dr Faustus", I can honestly say the first 10 minutes of Burton's film adaptation bored me so senseless that I didn't even bother sticking around for the always-compelling Ms Taylor to make her entrance...and couldn't have cared less.<br /><br />It was that bad. <br /><br />And since it was solely Burton and his monologues, along with Burton's campy directorial choices which ate up those tortuous 10 minutes...I would deem this film as Burton's, and only Burton's, rotten egg.
