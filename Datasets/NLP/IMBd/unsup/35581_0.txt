*Warning* Spoilers* I bought this video, expecting it to be another movie! However, I decided to watch it and was soon caught up in this horror-thrillers complicated web of intrigue. Because it is complicated and the movie take more than enough time to arrive at the rather obvious conclusion. But there are some pleasure to be had from this "sub-Hitchcockian" exercise in terror. The leads are interesting and well played by unknown Australian thespians. It should also be noted that the two main characters are strong women. The only man to be seen more than fleetingly is soon out of the picture (the heroines boyfriend). However, if you are gay or, especially, lesbian, you should have quite a few problems with this movie since there is a homicidal lesbian depicted (not an altogether ugly portrait, but still...). All in all, nothing special, but done with a certain flair for the medium and the genre (the final 15 minutes ARE tense and the attack by the mask-wearing and sword-wielding maniac in an empty school is a creepy sight). And since it is set in the world of a music academy, it contains many beautiful pieces of classical highlights!
