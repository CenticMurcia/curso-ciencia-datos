I am not going to try to outdo the preceding remarks regarding "Zenda" with it's superlative cast and their matchless performances I will however, give my opinion of the high point of this great film. Colman enters the cathedral in the coronation scene masquerading as King Rudolf and is confronted by the king's brother, Duke Michael. The hatred that radiates from Massey's regard of Colman is so powerful that it can actually be felt by the viewer! Colman(being Colman)is not to be outdone. His response is to regard Massey with wonder and amazement at the level of hatred directed at him, now realizing the true extent of the duke's malice. A truly remarkable scene between two great actors, no dialog needed from these two. A rarely achieved moment in moviedom -- perhaps overlooked as a rule due to its brevity. Another scene like it in films does not immediately come to mind.
