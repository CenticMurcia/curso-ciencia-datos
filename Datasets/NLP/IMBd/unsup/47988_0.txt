...that you're on the set of LEPRECHAUN. You look around and see the cut-rate production, the poor makeup, the confused crew eating catered lunch meat. You search the "script" for your next line, and it hits you...you're in one of the worst films ever made. Epically bad. The worst. But you're getting paid and possibly getting your SAG card, so who cares. At least it's a production that lacks any pretense of prestige, so you didn't have to sleep with the director. The only problem is, is that with the touch of a button on IMDB.com, anyone can trace you back to this film, and you'll never have really accomplished anything...ever. Was it worth it?<br /><br />I will give LEPRECHAUN this much, it may be the funniest damn movie I have ever seen. 0/10.
