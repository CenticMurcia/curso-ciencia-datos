Coming from 1956 is another of Universal-International's science-fiction pleasures. They made about twenty of them in the 1950s, brought on by the enormous successes of "It Came From Outer Space" (1953) and "Creature From the Black Lagoon" (1954). An interesting prologue with a real professor on the Earth's interior cores is followed by a great title sequence accompanied by a superb score. John Agar leads an archaeological expedition in Himalayan mountains to search for an underground lost civilization. Eventually they find them, an albino tribe, who have trained the half-human "Mole People" to be their slaves. Agar falls in love with the lone pigmented character, lovely blonde Cynthia Patrick, who invokes a bit of Kim Novak. Sacrifices, revolt and chaos ensue, with the Mole People actually the sympathetic characters, an unexpected ending, shadowy photography, and solid direction by Virgil Vogel, make this enjoyable.
