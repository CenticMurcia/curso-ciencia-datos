I LOVE to watch people make a good faith effort to make a film that other people will want to watch. I truly enjoy seeing the efforts of independent movie makers, people like Jon Keeyes or "The B Movie Master himself", Ed Wood, working hard to provide something that is entertaining, or informative, or challenging, or maybe even a combination of those. The only thing challenging about this movie was forcing myself to watch it all.<br /><br />This movie seemed to me to be nothing more than an ego-trip by a couple of guys with access to a camcorder and wanted nothing more than to be able to call themselves "movie stars", or "directors", or "producers". I don't know who backed this thing (note that I didn't even call it an "effort" because that would imply some sort of love for the project and not just your own image on a screen), but my suspicion is that the writers/producers/directors/stars either had more money than talent or are salesmen (in person certainly, because I didn't buy anything that was happening on the screen) on the scale of the infamous Ponzy.<br /><br />*********Here there be Spoilers***********<br /><br />OK, I don't want to beat the same dead horse that the other reviews have thoroughly killed, but I have to ask some questions: 1) Why should we care about a dead wife we never see? 2) Why is the first time that we even know this guy has a home life is when we are in his wrecked home where he wants to get his sword? 3) Why does he want the sword? 4) Why does his "lair" appear to be a desk in the back room of a storage building? 5) When did he get a lair? 6) Why did he need a lair in the first place? 7) Is he a true vampire like the Dracula character was in the book and free to walk about in the daylight? If so, that would have been nice to establish at some point. 8) Who or what is "The Council" and why should we care about them? 9) Why did I waste $5.50 at the store buying this movie? [Ok, I guess that one is on me.] 10) Didn't anyone hold auditions to try to find someone who had at least met a former American Marine? 11) or at least someone from the Southern US? 12) Why would someone who was supposed to be an obviously stereotypical redneck ride ANYTHING other than a Harley Davidson? 13) Why is everyone such an incredibly poor shot except the lab geek? 14) Did the lab geek take Kendo and firearms lessons after organic chemistry and before theoretical mathematics? 15) Why was this movie made? 16) What value does it have other than as autoerotic stimulation for its primaries?<br /><br />I have watched this movie over and over again (usually in small blocks until my eyes and ears feel as if they are about to bleed) trying to find its redeeming message or worth. I have finally come to the conclusion that there just isn't any.
