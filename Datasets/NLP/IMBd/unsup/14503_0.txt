Bert Archer's review in Eye Magazine pretty much hit the nail on the head.<br /><br />Popcultured is one of those shows that comes along once in a great while that is so incomprehensibly bad, you find yourself waiting for the camera to pan out revealing an appalled Jason Bateman watching it on his set as some sort of clever comment on the state of the TV nation. But no, this is a real show, with stand-up from Elvira Kurt as stale as that joke about her comically foreign mother thinking her daughter's Lebanese she told for the first decade of her career. The show's schtick -- what if the hosts of Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood just snapped one day and said exactly what they were thinking? -- falls flatter than Debra Messing as one unfit comic after another tries to deliver abysmal, uninsightful and fatally unengaged material with the sort of utter absence of screen presence you expect only from German accountants talking about the decline of the euro, and Ben Mulroney. Do these people actually watch TV? An incompetent show written by untalented writers, performed by embarrassingly inept comics. The funniest thing about the premiere episode was their guest, a guy who came in third or fourth in last year's Canadian Idol. Their second guest? Homunculus-about-town Shinan Govani. And that about wraps it up.<br /><br />Popcultured is the worst show I have ever seen.
