This film was edited in Catalán a few years ago. The film was also translated and dubbed into Spanish (Pedro sin cola). In Catalán it's named Pere sense cua.<br /><br />When I was a child I loved this film. The only thing I can't like about it is the treatment of a she-cat like she's stupid. But it's the only "bad" thing. This film is great, beautiful, funny...<br /><br />The little cat had no tail. The farmer saves his life hiding him inside a car... and then he's adopted. He is a kind cat, he find some friends in the city and also an enemy and his followers. <br /><br />I recommend this film to all the people who has children at home.
