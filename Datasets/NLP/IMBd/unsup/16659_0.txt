Woody Allen did all but direct this film, which is why it sometimes misses lists of his best films, the truth is he had moved on to another project while it was still a stage show, and such is his desire to create, he didn't want to go back too directing. Realising it is too good a piece of work not to direct, Herbert Ross takes up the reigns, and it becomes a clever, interesting experience; to see Woody playing the fool, so bad at dating, but directed by not-Woody.<br /><br />He seems to be slightly freer on-screen here, as if the directing shackles have been lifted and he can concentrate on his performance, the slapstick edge makes it seem like a cross between Annie Hall and Sleeper; it's really funny, and it would make a good film for couples to watch, such is the spectacular ineptitude of Woody's characters.<br /><br />In short, he dates women, and a vision of Humphrey Bogart dispenses advice on how he (Bogart) would handle the situation, helping him along the way, it makes for brilliant viewing. Woody's sometime comic partner Tony Roberts plays the straight guy so well, he's very funny himself just doing nothing, they seem to feed off each other. Diane Keaton is gorgeous as always, it's a great addition to the Woody Allen catalogue.
