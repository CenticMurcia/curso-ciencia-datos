This is a western that should have been better than it was, considering the fine cast and production values that went into the making of the film. Picture is about an Indian agent John Clum's efforts to have reservation Apaches police themselves and the surrender of Geronimo are the picture's highlights. There are the usual animosities between soldiers and Indians, and the agent's clashes with the military's preference to disarm the Apache police creates further tensions. An unnecessary sub-plot has an Apache widow smitten with Clum, who is already married. Audie Murphy, was perfect for this kind of role and is good, as is the supporting cast. The movie was filmed in colorful wide screen CinemaScope which captures the beauty of western vistas.
