I first saw this movie more than 30 years ago whilst studying French in high school. At the time, I thought that the movie captured the atmosphere of the place (well as I thought I understood it as a callow youth!); and of the state of the "hero's" mind, which is ultimately the most important aspect of this book/movie.<br /><br />We studied this book as an example of Albert Camus' existentialist philosophy (which is succintly stated in my summary above); both the film and the book seem to encapsulate this perfectly. The hero lives a life in which it seems that he doesn't really care what happens to him or what he does to others. Perhaps in another age he may have been labelled a psychopath. Certainly he seems to both under-react and over-react (and quite grossly too, in both directions) to many events that occur to him. And indeed he simply seems to float along the stream of life so that events occur TO him; rather than he be in control of his life.<br /><br />One fascinating sidebar was that the book we were reading in French was supposedly the untouched original; yet an English translation that one of my fellow students had contained the odd extra paragraph! One of these was quite significant in that it described a rather violent homosexual relationship that the hero had whilst in prison.<br /><br />Another amusing point is that the book has one throw-away line about a sexy red and white striped dress that Marie is wearing on one occasion; and the movie faithfully shows this. Please don't attach any significance to this other than as a bit of throw-away humour.
