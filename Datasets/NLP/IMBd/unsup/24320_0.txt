I just saw this movie on lifetime tonight; before this week seeing all the commercial for it on lifetime I would have never of knew it was out there to be seen. May I say this is one of the few jewels Lifetime has shown in a long time. Not only was the story line interesting enough to keep you watching the acting was great. I though the male lead Ben was great and nice looking in that down to earth boy next door way and not the I'm a male super model worship t my feet way, which is very unique for male role now days that have to be the knight and shinning armer type. Nola she was so much different from many of the charters out there and I loved how her character development through out the story and how she actually learned something in the end.People creating movies think that if th guy is hot or the women is hot and a story is horrible the the movie will still do good and yes that is true but this one had all thing tied in it! <br /><br />PLus the whole Ideal of a ***** ( not to let any spoilers out) being clean was real nice. I like the movie and the music to the movie it is amazing to see am movie where the actor actually sings their own songs and sounds good doing it. I would love to see this movie another time and I hope you also pick up a copy of it. If you like lifetime movies you will love this one so much better, it wasn't even made by lifetime.
