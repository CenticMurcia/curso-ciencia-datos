I had the unfortunate experience of viewing the Prince & Me original movie just before the sequel, the Prince & Me 2. The sequel had none of the charm and believability of the first, Whatever on-screen chemistry Julia Stiles and Luke Mably had in the first is completely lacking in the sequel. It's safe to say that Kam Heskin can't act her way out of a paper bag. When the marriage is called off, she's shows as much emotion as one hearing it would rain that day; a momentary contemplation, a shrug and off.<br /><br />The only enjoyable part was seeing how Luke Mably matured from a care-free student to a more serious King of Denmark. As it should be.<br /><br />This movie was completely disappointing, not only in the majority of new actors from the original, but the overall cheesiness of the production. Anyone who viewed Lady Diana Spencer's marriage to Prince Charles knows what a royal wedding looks like. The Prince & Me 2 perhaps paid $99 at David's Bridal for the wedding gown. The church was woefully empty of attendees. Very little pomp and almost no circumstance.<br /><br />One thing that really gnawed at me were Paige's parents, also new actors. They dressed the father well in a very nice suit, but the poor bride's mother looked as if her clothes came from a rubbish bin. Yes, she's a farmer's wife, but believe me, lots of farmers I know have very attractive and well-dressed wives. And how did the parents fly from Podunk, America to Denmark in two hours? The space shuttle? <br /><br />The script was predictable, the actors weren't stretched by any means and, sadly, when needed most of all, Paige was a dud. She had none of the sparkle, determination, honor and depth of character as written in the first film.<br /><br />Others have gone into the historical inaccuracies and blase' treatment of Danish history, but 5,000 years indeed!!! There wasn't even a Denmark 5,000 years ago, much less a monarchy. Were they so low on funds that scene couldn't be re-shot??? If the writer made the mistake, was there no one - producer, director, even an actor - who didn't catch this? The role of Soren, so ably portrayed by Ben Miller, with sly sarcasm and stoic wit, in the original movie, was taken on by Jonathan Firth, the brother of able Colin. Unfortunately, the writing wasn't nearly as clever as the first, and subsequently, left Mr. Firth with nothing to work with.<br /><br />The ball scene was also unbelievable. That a princess of the blood (Kirsten) wouldn't know how to dance? Commmmme onnnnnnnnn. And that an American girl could pull it off flawlessly with no visible training? My suspenders of disbelief were stretched to the max throughout this film, although I stuck it out to the end to give it a chance.<br /><br />Best thing about the movie? The horses, purebloods all, unlike the actors.
