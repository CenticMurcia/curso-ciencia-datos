The very beginning of this movie was truly promising and so compelling it was just too hard to surpass. But the directing and some truly great scenes made up for it. This was maybe the first movie dealing with the Victorian period that I saw and wasn't an utter drag. It was funny, witty and overall entertaining. Sean Connery isn't at his true best, although he is believable in his non Bond role and Donald Sutherland isn't given enough chances to really develop his character. If the ending was a little different this movie could have been an instant classic. Slightly on the predictable side and with some (too)big coincidences but still a very good effort by Michael Chrichton. 7/10
