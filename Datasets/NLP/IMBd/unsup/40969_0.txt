Terrible slice'n'dice film. Brian (Donovan Leitch) has just been released from a mental institution where he had extensive electroshock therapy. He falls for sweet lovable Paula (Jill Schoelen) but she loves "bad boy" Dwight (Brad Pitt). Then murders start happening. Is it Dwight or Brian? You won't care.<br /><br />The murders are pretty bloodless--the story is stupid--the comedy horrible--the dialogue lame. One of the worst horror movies of its time--and that's saying quite a bit! It would be completely forgotten today if not for Pitt's role in it. He himself has said it's the worst movie he ever made. Also don't let top-billed Martin Mull or Roddy McDowall fool you--they're hardly in the move.<br /><br />Abysmal. Only watch if you're interested in seeing Pitt embarrass himself. A 1.
