I'm not sure what negative reviewers were expecting; I went in looking for the very rare high-budget 3D experience and got what I was looking for. I personally spend most of my television viewing time watching TLC, TDC and History Channel and I think my interests and tastes mirror Cameron's to a great degree. For me, it's fascinating and exciting to go down and penetrate the wreck of the Titanic for the same reason that I will be eternally fascinated with the Apollo missions to the moon. It's really exciting to see the previously unseeable. I found watching the scenes outside and inside the wreck to be as exciting as watching the first pictures from Mars Pathfinder... a sense of excitement and wonder in seeing something so remote and so exotic and bizarre.<br /><br />When I read these reviews I try to find someone who appears to have a similar outlook to myself and then predict if I will like the film or not before I go to see it. My guess is that if you really loved Apollo 13 then you will have a great time watching this movie. You must love science and that frontier spirit to truly enjoy this movie. I think I can say with fair conviction that if you didn't like Apollo 13, you should stay home. There won't be that much here for you. For example, if the fact that the pressure down there is (I just worked it out) is 5482 pounds per square inch doesn't add to the coolness and excitement of watching film from down there, but Jennifer Lopez being on board would, look elsewhere.<br /><br />If you like 3D, this 3D is as good as I've seen and to be honest I'd love to see this movie again just for the really enjoyable and unique experience of "feeling" right off the bow of the Titanic in 12,462 feet of water.<br /><br />This is in no way a rehash of the movie Titanic and it has no plot. It has a little funny dialog but it's unscripted. I liked one moment (during the long descent to the bottom):<br /><br />Bill Paxton: "So, if the motors or battery died, we could get back to the surface by dumping the um.. uh..."<br /><br />Russian Pilot: "Ve have many options in this situation."<br /><br />Bill Paxton: "So, we could dump the batteries, though, right, and we'd come up no matter what?"<br /><br />Russian Pilot: "Yes, but we do not want to do that. This battery costs, I think, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars."<br /><br />Bill Paxton: "Can I write you a check?"
