Monk is a great detective show that you can sometimes solve along with Monk if you are a genius. The show is entertaining and despite what most people say, Monk's obsessive compulsive disorders are so funny! Not annoying! The commercials are sometimes long, but not often. For any person who even lightly likes mysteries, this show is for you.
