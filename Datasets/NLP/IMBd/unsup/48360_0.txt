You know, I wonder sometimes how stupid a film promoter can be....<br /><br />Every review but one here is by a person extolling the different virtues of the film in PR speak, and bad PR speak at that.<br /><br />If you want to shill a movie, then at least have the decency to credit the members here with some degree of intelligence.<br /><br />3 pages of PR, all obviously written by the same amateur promoter does NOT entice anyone to watch what is basically a single fart gag retold in 10 different ways.<br /><br />I rest my case. If anyone considers watching this junk then they deserve everything they get Including me. :) Cheers, Will
