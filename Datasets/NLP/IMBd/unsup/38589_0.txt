why, oh why I wonder is HL II this bad for me (and a great deal of others)? I asked myself this question many times, and I believe I found the right answer: it's an 80's action b-movie with very lousy bad guys, that was expected to live up to the Highlander myths. Having the immortals come from an alien planet is kind of making "Scent of a Woman 2" with the main character a vampire. just not right.
