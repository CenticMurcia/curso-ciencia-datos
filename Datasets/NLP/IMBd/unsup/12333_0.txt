A really good effort. Great acting and great direction. the climax is somewhat far fetched but anyways the movie is good.<br /><br />The movie has shades of Shawshank Redemption but its a good movie my its own. It is not a remake (frame to frame copy), as our bollywood directors usually do. Its a poetic descriptoin of the life in Jail, with inclusion of the troubles which come with prison.<br /><br />People have very nicely put up good points of the movie on this site. I am gonna try and put up soem points I didnt like<br /><br />One was over-use of English in the prison. Jacky shroff was in his usual over acting, overly stylized self. Many a times, he seemed out of the place. But yes, the poems were quite good.<br /><br />Second, somehow most of the people in prison looked somewhat overly nice and sophisticated for being in a prison (I say it from what I have read and seen in movies)<br /><br />**********MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />Jacky Shroff's release wasnt very believable. He did stab his wife. So what if she was already dead? It might result in a lesser punishment but not total release.<br /><br />my rating 8/10
