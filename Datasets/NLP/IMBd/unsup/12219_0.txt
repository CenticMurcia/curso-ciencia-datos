Came across this movie late one night and it captivated me completely. Acting across the board was superb.<br /><br />Dakota Fanning delivers a wonderfully controlled performance and shows what a raw talent she is.<br /><br />The movie tackles the issue head on and never came across as if it was being overly dramatic for the sake of it. In some scenes it is really heart rendering and i was fighting back the tears frequently.<br /><br />Many people knock Sean Penn because of his personal life (myself included) but his performance of the mentally challenged man was inspiring and never came across as corny! How Denzel Washington beat him to the Best Actor Oscar for Training Day ill never know? <br /><br />A truly wonderful movie that I've made all of my friends sit down and watch with me!
