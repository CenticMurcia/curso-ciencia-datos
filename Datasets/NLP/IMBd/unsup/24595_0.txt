I've been looking forward to this film for about 4 months after I saw the description. Though Clive Owen isn't one of my favorite actors, I was so blown away by Children of Men and his very good performance that I had to see his own little action movie. As you've probably read from other post, this is just an action movie and really nothing else. But that is OK because it was very fun and entertaining.<br /><br />In no more than 3 minutes, you see the first gun shot and quickly the movie turns into a violent gun fight. The coolest part about the beginning scene was Nirvana's Breed started playing. Not often do you see a guy deliver a baby while shooting people at the same time. Then you see Mr. Smith (Owen) run with the baby tucked between his arms like a football! It's hilarious! The plot is just plain stupid but who cares. If you love your action movies, this is the most action you'll see crammed in 80+ minutes in a long time. A lot of people argue that Owen should of been the next Bond (Craig was just too good). This movie is almost like the Bond that Owen never was able do. This movie was like this years Crank. You can't take it seriously but just enjoy the ride.
