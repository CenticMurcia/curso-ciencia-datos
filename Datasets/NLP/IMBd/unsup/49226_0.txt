This has got the be one of the least entertaining movies I've seen. Absolutely never ever had as little a shy smile on my face, there just aren't any jokes worth laughing about in this movie.<br /><br />Both Vince and Jennifer's characters are not appealing to me. They are flat, undimensional and tiresome.<br /><br />The antics shown are also completely un-inspired.<br /><br />I was very disappointed by this movie.<br /><br />The only thing I found refreshing, and here be spoilers, is that at the end, very UN-American, they don't get back together again.<br /><br />But that isn't enough to warrant this movie a viewing.
