This has always been one of my favorite movies to watch. Looking at it objectively I suppose I could pick apart this movie until there was nothing left. But I'm not going to do that nor do I want to do. Yes it was a little cheesy at times but I liked all the songs and it of course had a good message. One thing I have noticed is that some people have to point out that this movie was made for commercial reasons. So what? Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter have been commercialized and no one seems to think it takes away from them. Commercializing a movie and making a profit is just part of the industry. This was a cute funny movie with a positive message, I liked it and so I give it 10 stars.
