when i rented this film , i expected very little from the movie , the title seemed intriguing enough for me to rent it ...what i got was a well made film about a couple in love or maybe more about their breaking up ...it reminded me of when harry met sally at times , but must say this seems so much more close to real life . some nice humorous scenes are like icing on the cake ... they love each other , everything's right but the eternal doubt , so subtly put in one of the scenes ** SPOILERS ** where russel crowe's character asks ' what do u mean by IF we marry ?'...one of the best scenes ** SPOILERS*** is when steve (russel crowe) gets set to leave in the middle of the night ...its funny yet at the same time it reveals an important aspect of any relationship ...the insecurity ...the insecurity of what if this wont work and the whole sequence is beautifully treated . a movie worth watching especially if you can relate it to it ....true to life. i especially liked the subtlety with which it sends out messages to the viewers , never in your face . yet it speaks. well written movie with a lot of maturity and depth .
