Confusing, that is what this cartoon was. I feel sorry for the children that had to watch this. This cartoon was too confusing. I didn't understand the jokes, I didn't know any of the celebrities. I think the woman that turned out to be a man in the end was a parody of a movie directed by the director of Plan 9 From Outer Space, and I knew the three stooges. That's it.<br /><br />This cartoon gave me a headache because I tried hard to understand what people were talking about. It was just random people every few seconds. Half the movie was just people doing the cha cha and one guy saying he doesn't know how to do the modern dances, so he moves to Washington so he won't be made fun of.<br /><br />Anywho, I do recommend this cartoon for historians. That might just be it. This cartoon was too confusing for children, and also not recommended for them either. It had people smoking.
