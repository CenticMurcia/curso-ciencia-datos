Finally, a movie that says so much that needs to be said about the relationship between latino and anglo-Americans. A few people seem to thinks it's racist, but I don't see how. Some people may not agree, but I think most people will find it to be an enlightening experience. Even as a person who is half Latin American, I was surprised at how many inaccurate stereotypes I accepted about my own people until I saw this movie (the little pop up facts on the screen were both entertaining and informative). <br /><br />Also, the film's star, Yareli Arizmendi, was in "Like Water for Chocolate", so it's worth it just to see her again. And Eduardo Palomo makes his final appearance in this film, if your a fan of Mexican TV. Despite the controversial ad campaign, this is actually a fun, entertaining movie that I would recommend to most people. See it and decide for yourself.
