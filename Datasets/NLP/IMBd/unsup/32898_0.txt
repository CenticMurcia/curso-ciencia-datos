Not far in the movie I realized I was watching a terrible version of 'Ringu', the Japanese movie that inspired a very good US movie named 'The Ring'. It has the same elements. A medium that kills because you watch it (in 'The Ring' a videotape, here an internet-site), a little girl that is probably the key to solve the problem, a woman and a guy searching for the answer, both saw the site and therefor they both have to hurry, and why they have to hurry has something to do with earlier events. Here they have 48 hours to solve this mystery that involves The Doctor, a killer who broadcasts live killings over the internet. Well, not just killings. He tortures a woman for a long time and in the end there must be a point where the woman asks him to be killed. And so it is done.<br /><br />To tell more about the messy plot would be stupid. I am not even sure if I understand everything. After you have seen the internet-site you die of your worst fear in 48 hours, that I did understand, but why do 'infected' people see the little girl over and over again while she herself was killed as an adult? I probably missed it but like I said it doesn't really matter. The scary visuals have something admirable. The images are really haunting but again I liked the videotape from 'The Ring' a lot more. May be you will like it for the images and some scary moments, but I think you can find a better movie. 'The Ring' may be.
