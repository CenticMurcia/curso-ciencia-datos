I have a lot of movie endurance. I have sat through almost all of the bottom 100, including the godforsaken "Troll 2". So when a man at the video store said this was the worst film he had ever seen, I had to rent it out. Man, was that a mistake. I had to shut this off halfway through(making it the only movie I havn't sat all the way through). This movie was so impossibly bad in every way. The acting was atrocious. The plot made no sense. The dialouge was as interesting as a blank wall. But the worst part was the monster. Note that the cover shows the eye of a reptilious creature. So imagine my surprise when the monster was shown as a giant "love pump". Seriously. no one involved with this picture graduated from grade school. So please, please never watch this movie. If you come across a copy, you should probably burn it. Zero out of ten, and wishfully lower.
