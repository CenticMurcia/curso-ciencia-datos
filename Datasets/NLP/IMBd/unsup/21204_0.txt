When I was studying up on my own career as an amateur filmmaker, I learned that two high school kids in the early 90's had made a movie that supposedly was very good.<br /><br />Well I hunted it down and didn't expect much, I mean, I've lived 60 miles from where it was filmed for my entire life, so i know what the area was like and being a big fan of the Indiana Jones series, I wasn't sure if they could pull it off. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />I'll admit, the acting isn't the best, but being at the same age as they were when they made this, I've seen in my own movies what limitations you have. But the humor and the style hit me. It was cleverly written, and although oftentimes seemed a bit TOO much like a copy or parody of the Indy series, it always saved itself in the end.<br /><br />At risk of going overboard with compliments on the movie, it actually has inspired me to do my own movies full-feature, and I've since been impressed with the Linn brothers' other works.<br /><br />So if you get a chance, and can set aside that it's an amateur film a decade old.....watch this. You will laugh and be amazed at what a fine job a group of high school students can do on a movie.
