Fortunately I bought a ticket for this film when it showed in 1988, without knowing anything about it. I say fortunately because otherwise I would have had another film on my "worst film ever list". This however beats them all. I remember people leaving continuously during the showing, my friend and I staying on just to see if it could get any worse - which it did. In the end there were 3 or 4 people left. Been a long time now - but if I remember correctly, Amanda asks, after having sliced of the cowboy's penis, "don't you think he wanted it this way?". You bet he did... Anything positive about this film? Amanda Ooms is pretty, that's about it.
