What a disgusting TV show. For some reason (perhaps it is really cheap?) at some point it seemed to be on E channel 24 hours a day. Just flipping by you would catch some bit of this show. I actually watched a few minutes on various occasions, and it never failed to be gross. Stomach-turning, grotesque, and disgusting. A show about the life of a perpetually drunken woman who is usually also on drugs and is barely smarter than fungus as a result of the years of brain damage. Between her Playboy jobs and her marriage to the 90 year old billionaire, Smith has apparently socked away enough money that she can live in a nice house with a couple of parasitic friends and spend her time shopping, partying, and deciding who will have sex with her lardy side of beef. As a TV show, it must have had some viewers, since it was around for at least two seasons. This show is something like "The Faces of Death" videos. Really gross, disgusting, and pointless.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the Anna Nicole saga ended with her death from unknown causes. Her son died around Christmas, and this grotesque humanoid left a baby to fend for herself. When Anna died, she was partying in Florida while her infant daughter was in the Bahamas being cared for by unknown persons. She has reaped the seed she has sown.
