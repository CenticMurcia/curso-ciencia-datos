The brothers Bloom were orphans and from a very early age learned that being con-men could get them through life. But their escapades usually meant they stayed with a prospective family only a short time. As a result they grew up without a family.<br /><br />The older brother, Stephen Bloom, was really the instigator, his younger brother was timid but good at following instructions. Their first con that we see, when they are 13 and 10, get them 30 dollars from the neighborhood kids, and a kickback from the local dry cleaner! <br /><br />Mark Ruffalo is the adult Stephen, and Adrien Brody is his younger brother, always referred to simply as Bloom. Bloom has decided to get out of the con game, he wants something different out of life. But Stephen convinces him to do just one more con.<br /><br />Their target is the pretty and filthy wealthy Rachel Weisz as Penelope Stamp. Because of a botched allergy test when she was a young girl, she grew up virtually isolated in her large home, but on her own learned many things, including languages, card tricks, music, etc. Now that her father has recently died the Brothers Bloom figure she will be easy prey.<br /><br />The twist is that Bloom falls in love with Penelope.<br /><br />The assistant to the Bothers Bloom is Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi who virtually never speaks, as Bang Bang, good at blowing up things. A co-conspirator is Robbie Coltrane as a Belgian, The Curator. And it was good to see Maximilian Schell, almost 80, as Diamond Dog.<br /><br />Good movie, entertaining all the way.<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILERS: As the movie unfolds we see that many of their cons involve fake shootings with blanks and fake blood. In the very last scene Bloom finds his brother Stephen in a deserted building with blood and facial swelling. He assumes it is fake also. But after he leaves Stephen to motor off with Penelope he notices that the "fake blood" on his shirt is turning brown. It is real blood, Stephen really was mortally wounded. But Bloom got what he wanted, to be free from the con business and with Penelope. Stephen sacrificed his life for his brother's happiness. As Stephen always said, "The perfect con is where everyone gets what they want."
