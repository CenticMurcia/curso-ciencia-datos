Very seldom is a movie a collection of really cool photographs. Phil Joanou is an amazing director and this movie is one of my favorites. Such a cool story with some amazing actors. A total all star cast. Please give this one a shot if you like dramas that don't move so fast that its all action and no story. There are some great moments in this film. Some cool slow motion stuff. Just good, real moments. I am looking forward to more movies from Phil. As I watched this one, I just kept picturing that he must have been a photographer, a still photographer at some point. Cuz every shot is just so well done and so well lit. Not to mention the stellar acting job by everyone. Just read the list of actors and you will see how awesome it is.
