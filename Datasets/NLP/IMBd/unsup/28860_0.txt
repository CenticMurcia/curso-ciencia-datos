I never noticed that before, but I guess you have to really sometimes look for the small things. Besides it's a movie and I guess mistakes have to come once in a while, that's life. But overall, it was a great movie, that unfortunately hasn't come to DVD yet, so I hope since "First Shot" has, this one will finally make it. Sort of having your cake and eating it too. Peace-out! Hollywood would make a lot of money (like if they need it????) if they released most/all TV shows. I'm still wait for "The Third Twin" from novelist, Ken Follettt, "Sole Survivor" from novelist, Dean Koontz. All these were amazing TV movies and I hope they will come soon to DVD.
