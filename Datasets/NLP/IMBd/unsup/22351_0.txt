I liked the concept, very much. While the film has some very special moments I do feel that with extra funding this could have been very special indeed. With so many films today being based on generic content the time is well overdue for a new IP. It reminded me a little of both Silicon Knight's 'Too Human', and 'Beowolf' all to the good. My heart went out to both John Hurt and James Cavaziel both excellent actors who with better direction and script could have made this film far more memorable. <br /><br />All in all a good effort.<br /><br />Moorwen!<br /><br />End transmission.<br /><br />TB
