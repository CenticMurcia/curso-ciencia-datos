Perhaps we have come back to where we started as Jet Li takes up the mantle of the great Oriental martial arts heroes.<br /><br />Li is excellent in his role as the police officer who has come to France to assist the Police in Paris with a conspiracy. Things turn sour for him, and, along with the excellent Fonda [who gets better by the film] he has to take control and investigate for himself or lose his own life.<br /><br />Well directed and with some brilliantly choreographed action scenes, this is definitely one to see.
