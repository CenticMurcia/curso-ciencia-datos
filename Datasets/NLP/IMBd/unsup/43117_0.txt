Terrible. We all could come up with a fictional storyline of if the President died with the here and nows.<br /><br />Ugh...this was painful to commit to watching the whole show...because I knew it was going to be 97 minutes that I will never get back.<br /><br />The dialogs. The too-close to reality of a story that never happened and the 'victim' ~ the President is still alive.<br /><br />Dum duh dumb...dumb<br /><br />I'm still stammering to figure out what the purpose was to even spend the time to write this story? <br /><br />I can get barely ten lines in on what a waste of time this was. BTW, most of the acting was terrible and so contrived. The CIA guy who was almost crying...very unreal. The only satisfaction I got out of this is no one would think this was real because of how bad the acting was.
