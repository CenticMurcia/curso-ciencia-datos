7 teens on Spring Break trek up to one of their Uncle's cabin in the woods just in time for some kind of alien being to land nearby looking to eat some people and find a mate. While this might sound kind of campy, the film manages to approach the project by surrounding all the situations with elements of fear and suspense. A few things to take in mind if you've never seen this film before: the alien is supposed to be scary and undoubtedly some teens will survive.
