"As Perimenoun Oi Gynaikes" ("Let The Women Wait" is the exact translation in English) is a movie every Greek man should watch, according to my opinion. The 3 protagonists are married to 3 sisters in the movie, so that has made these guys relatives. Of course the sisters never appear on the film, their names are only referred by their husbands, while they try to make their way to Thasos (a magnificent island at the north of Aegean Sea) to find their wives and children for their summer vacation. The movie goes over almost every topic a man talks about in his normal life: Women, politics, football, easy-money... And all of this talking is being done with an incredible smart sense of humor. Almost every cue being spoken by the actors is hilarious, these actors are many years together, not only as partners, but also as friends, and are some of my favorite Greek comedians. In contrast to more Greek comedies, this one does not go all the time about sex. It talks about women, but in its very own delicate way. Everyone of the 3 protagonists is unique and different from the others, while the same time they are identical. Panos (Yannis Zouganelis) plays great the love-in-first-sight victim, while he cannot betray, not his wife nor his family, but PAOK, his really beloved football club, the greatest one in North Greece. Antonis (Sakis Boulas)is a high-ranked member of PASOK, the political party which governed Greece almost 20 years and Michalis (Argiris Bakirtzis) is somewhere in the middle, trying to balance things, trying to bring a state of equilibrium, which is an utopia of course. Personally I found this film almost genius, a real mirror image of the Greek society and people. I could not comment it to a non-Greek, but as I said in the beginning EVERY Greek man should watch this film...
