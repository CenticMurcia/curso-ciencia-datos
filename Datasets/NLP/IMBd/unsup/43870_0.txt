The shoddy opening scene of a pretty ugly fat chick clumsily running away from something, pathetically falling down and faking fear sets the tone for the whole movie. Which is to say it's a really bad flick overall. Much of the acting is stuff you'd see in a bad high school play. The editing is a joke; parts just go black for several seconds as they try to transition from one scene to another. And, it's a drab looking production; they should have followed the advice in their opening song and used some color.<br /><br />So it's a bad movie, but it's also disappointing because the premise of a campy slasher flick seemed to have potential.<br /><br />There are a few funny parts/lines in the last twenty minutes or so, but maintaining enough interest to get to that point is extremely difficult.<br /><br />It gets two out of ten stars as there are only two positive aspects of this flick.<br /><br />1). The drag queen is pretty funny toward the end. Partly because he has good lines and partly because he plays the role well, but only when he is in drag mode. Prior to that he is just a dull character.<br /><br />2). The opening song and go-go girl are pretty good. The segment has a very cool vibe like the opening credits of a James Bond flick but with a campy twist. So that segment is good, which also means that it is totally out of sync with the rest of the movie.
