I love this movie, I have seen it over 20 times and I just noticed something.<br /><br />After Christopher McDonald says "Yeah Right, and Grizzley Adams had a beard", after he walks away the screen goes to the green where all the people are and the car that hits Happy Gilmore later is already crashed even though the seen has not happened yet. I cannot believe I never noticed that before, that is hilarious.<br /><br />Anyhow, just wanted to post that, how many others have noticed that?<br /><br />Also, Julie Bowen is one Gorgeous Woman, I'm very envious of Adam Sandler getting to hook up with her!!
