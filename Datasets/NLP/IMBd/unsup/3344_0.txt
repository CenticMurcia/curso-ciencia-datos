Firstly I should admit that I do like the war genre but also realize that like anything else there are good ones and bad ones.<br /><br />This for me was a good one, a really good one. Like others have mentioned the dark lighting, claustrophobic tunnel sets, realistic looking location and uneasy score. I found myself not wanting to relax back in the chair as I felt the tension and body count build.<br /><br />A problem with many Hollywood war flicks like Pearl Harbour or Saving Private Ryan, is that they are just some all American good guy runs around, shoots heaps of enemy with 1 gun while tens of enemy guns have no effect, saves the day and the US and Allied forces are glorified and the enemy are demonised. At least in Rats everyone dies, and it is shown that there are all types of soldiers on both sides rather than just good Americans and bad Vietcong.<br /><br />As far as the technical side of things go people have to realize that when 98% of people will find the costumes and props fine, the studio isn't going spend a bunch of extra money to satisfy the extra 2%. My take is that you just have to give films a break if you have expertise in their area.<br /><br />If sickening Hollywood endings make you want to spew then this is for you.
