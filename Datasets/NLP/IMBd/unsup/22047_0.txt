I just saw 'Durango' yesterday on Hallmark. I was kinda put-off by the title but the movie is beautiful and Matthew Keeslar makes you go droool.. Anyway, the movie is basically about how this guy named Mark refuses to be victimised by a corrupted swindler and takes up the cause of the villagers and undertakes an ardrous journey to sell a flock of cattle. The movie is set in Ireland, in the 30s and providing as a background are references to the World War and the IRA. Adding to the appeal of the movie are many humorous situations and Mark's affair with Annie who has a rather domineering father. It's basically a nice sweet movie and you won't feel you've wasted an hour or two but the scenery of the Emerald Isle will linger on long after seeing this movie. The acting is good and Matt Keeslar does have potential excluding his looks.
