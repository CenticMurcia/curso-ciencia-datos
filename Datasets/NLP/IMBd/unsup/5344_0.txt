Judging from this movie, truly really very bad.<br /><br />I never ceases to amaze me that people think they can better an classic book by an extremely good author.<br /><br />Based on this movie the screenwriters probably spent under five minutes to read the actual book, after that they probably told the core story to their kids and asked what would be like really cool, so in come giant insects, pirates and whatever.<br /><br />This movie has close to nothing to do with the original book and as a movie it's poorly acted, poorly scripted, poorly done effects and horribly directed.<br /><br />What a waste of time.
