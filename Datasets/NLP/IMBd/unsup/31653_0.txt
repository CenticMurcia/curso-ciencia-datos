This movie "Magnifico" is one of the most extraordinary films of all-time and it's worth watching in a lifetime! There maybe a lot of sad stuff on this film, but hey: film is set to poverty.<br /><br />Jiro Manio's character (as Magnifico) is one of the amazing characters on this film even though his character is the lead of this film. It has shown that his character has been responsible for his family and care, and it has made the audiences surprised. I'd say, Jiro Manio - Even though his a kid, he has played a very tough roll on this film but he act very awesome and his took parts very well.<br /><br />This movie can be really sad to watch but this shows the life of people in poverty and what's the people like in the province in the Philippines. There are no negatives about this film, and there are no conflicts etc. This is the only drama movie that was made as the best and the extraordinary film that was made in the Philippines. This movie has also been the best picture in other Film Festivals as well.<br /><br />I'd say, this movie is a 10/10 even though it's a really sad film to watch. But this is something to watch and this is something that no one has seen the best that was created in the Philippines.
