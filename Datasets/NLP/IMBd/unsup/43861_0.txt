On the box it put this film in the same company with greats like Night of the Living Dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I completely disagree. For one thing, I was expecting to see at least a little gore in this film and there was almost none, other than a scene where the male character cuts himself shaving. For an "erotic" film, there was very little actual sex, apart from the first scene, which incidentally does not feature much nudity, and a shower scene. OK, so there wasn't much sex or violence, that doesn't mean it's a bad film. Some of the best films simply imply sex or violence. This however is not one of them. The acting is not bad, but the characters are written really flatly. The male character's mother who is dying of cancer is unconvincing. The wife is even less convincing. She doesn't seem to have any past at all. Where did these people meet? I still don't understand why the mother does not like the wife. The relationship between the vampire and her mistress is confusing. What is the mistress' purpose? It seems as though there is a symbiotic relationship, but what is the nature of that symbiosis? Overall, a disappointing film.
