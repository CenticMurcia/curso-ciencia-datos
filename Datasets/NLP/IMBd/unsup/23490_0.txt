The worst movie I've ever seen, hands down. It is ten times more a rip-off of Lake Placid than it is a sequel. Director David Flores clearly did not go to film school, and the way his cast delivers they're lines, you'd think they were learning English for the first time. Not even Cloris Leachman tries. The first Nintendo games had more convincing special effects. Needless to say I didn't make it to the end of Lake Placid 2, but you don't need to watch more than five minutes to know that this is the biggest waste of celluloid in modern film. Do not let your love of the original tempt you to try this, even if you know it's bad. It's a turkey, no not even a turkey, it's nothing.
