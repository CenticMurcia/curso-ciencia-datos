To say the only positive about the film first: the interior of the space station looks impressingly claustrophobic and some of the details in it are well thought. You will find nothing else positive in this film. <br /><br />The prisoners do not have any relevant characters, you will most likely mix them up. It doesn't help in this case that all wear yellow prison uniforms and all have their hair cut off. They all have ridiculous names after historical persons. Who ever came along to name a character who likes to eat and is very chubby "Moloch" ? Is that supposed to be original or what? Their leader is named Cesar, oh come on!<br /><br />The space stations personnel isn't modeled any better. Just cut-out cardboard characters. <br /><br />Moreover, there is almost no real story. The pace of the film is painfully slow. The new prisoner "heals" some of his fellows in a way that doesn't make sense at all (you have to call that "mystical"). Every time he does it, it looks exactly the same. <br /><br />The most annoying thing about this film is that it tortures you with obvious religious symbols and gestures until even the dumbest viewer will notice it.<br /><br />Avoid this film at any cost.
