Why do they make crap like this? And why do credible actors like Dennis Quaid lower themselves to appear in such garbage? Someone needs to inform the cocaine befuddled writers in Hollywood that grizzly, disgusting blood and gore do not make suspense. The only suspenseful thing about this movie was wondering how much longer it could go on, how much more hideous torture we would be subjected to, and when the totally predictable ending would finally arrive. Suspense movies these days seem to get progressively worse. This film had no one to identify with and no one to care about. My first reaction was to shut it off half way through. I wish I had.
