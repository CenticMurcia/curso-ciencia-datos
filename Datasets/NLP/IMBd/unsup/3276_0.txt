Well! I'm sorry to disagree entirely with everyone else here since I enjoyed this film tremendously. So, it's not original - what of it! That doesn't stop me enjoying 90 minutes of pure escapism. Michael Dudikoff is always well worth watching and many of his movies are great fun, indeed. This one is one of his best and I am delighted to have now bought it on VHS so that I can watch it many times, which I plan on doing.<br /><br />I do feel sorry for everyone else who has seen and not enjoyed this film - perhaps they simply cannot let themselves go and enjoy the film for what it is, not what they think it ought to have been. Maybe I am too simplistic for their tastes - in that case I'm glad I am. There must be somebody else out there somewhere who, like me, has enjoyed this film!
