"Balls of Fury" is an absolutely dreadful comedy. It amazingly would work better as a drama (not much better). With most films, I can find some redeeming quality. I looked hard and I this is what I found on this. The main character was slightly more tolerable than one would expect from such a poor movie. Christopher Walken was occasionally funny, simply because of his delivery...and well, that's it. Other than that, there are only negatives. Every joke could be seen by anyone a mile away. I could practically give the entire outcome of the film, including all the jokes, halfway through.<br /><br />The plot, if you can call it that, started off slightly promising, but quickly became too stupid. Randy Daytona was a ping pong child prodigy. His father bet on him, and he lost, so he was killed. 18 years later Daytona works at a bad magic show. He is needed by the FBI to catch a Chinese mafia criminal. He gets lessons from a blind man, and it just gets dumber from there. <br /><br />To go along with all of this, ping-pong just isn't an interesting sport to make in to a movie. It's repetitive and you can only do so much with it. I really hated this, and I have a feeling this will earn a well deserved spot in the bottom 100 very soon.<br /><br />My rating: BOMB/****. 83 mins. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
