I saw Alien and Aliens when I was little and they scared the hell out of me with their originality of the aliens, along with the feeling that you have been brutalized after you have seen them. Now comes Virus, the latest rip-off of Alien. At least it's not the worst. That title goes to Deep Rising, which really stunk. The acting in this movie is passable, but some of the special effects, including the gross stuff range from good to crappy.<br /><br />The acting is passable, but I never really took an interest in it. The characters were almost rip-offs from other movies. I don't think Stephen Baldwin is going to get out of B movies. What is Jamie Lee Curtis doing in here? I never really liked her, but she's done a lot better movies than this.<br /><br />The animatronic creatures are good, but the make up for the guts and gore looked really fake. After seeing Saving Private Ryan, most horror movies look extremely fake.<br /><br />Well, I don't like to say it, but I actually fell asleep watching this movie. It's not crap, but it has nothing going for it either. I wouldn't recommend it unless you really like the sci-fi/horror genre. ** stars (out of *****)
