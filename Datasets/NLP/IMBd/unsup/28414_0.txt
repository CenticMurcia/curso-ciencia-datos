A parasite that's "a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease, and will hopefully turn the world into one beautiful, mindless orgy" is unleashed in a luxurious Canadian hotel. Despite director/writer David Cronenberg's script, "Shivers" isn't any great shakes as a bloody erotic horror. Mr. Cronenberg shows promise, however; and, there are at least three sexy scenes. First, you have luscious Lynn Lowry (as Forsythe) sexily undressing. Also, still beautiful Barbara Steele (as Betts) takes a bath; and, later, engages Susan Petrie (as Janine Tudor) in a seductive Lesbian kiss. Other than that, the movie features more bad hair than anything else. Cronenberg could have gotten off more steam by setting the maniacal sex parasites loose in a college. Paul Hampton (as Roger St Luc) emerges as the last man standing. Imaginatively re-titled "They Came from Within" and "The Parasite Murders".<br /><br />**** Shivers (10/10/75) David Cronenberg ~ Paul Hampton, Lynn Lowry, Barbara Steele, Joe Silver
