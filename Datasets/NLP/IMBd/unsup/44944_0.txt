One viewer stated that this move addressed some issue, one being racism, the relationship between an older white southern women and a younger under age black man? I believe the issue here is pedophilia. If this had been presented as a man of Sissy Spacek's characters age and a 15 year old girl, everyone would be calling this child molesting, pedophilia, crime of the heart? No this crime is what it is, child molestation and they move tried to present it as a tender touching moment between a lonely older woman and a younger man, he was a child. Enough said, besides that issue this movie did not do much for me, depressing and lacked a point for me. Not one of Jessica Lange's better films.
