so, on we go to round three of the "House" series.we(my sister and i)had watched the first entry all the way through and were underwhelmed,to say the least.the second one lowered the bar for crappiness even further.how bad could number 3 be?it starts off promising enough.after all,it had Lance Henricksen (he should've passed) in it and it looked like it had a bigger budget.however,it soon became apparent that this movie was also a dud.another ridiculous plot,bad acting,bad everything.i think this one made it 40 minutes tops.any longer and my head would have exploded.again,no horror,and no comedy.i must be missing something.i wish i knew what it was. this thing gets a low 1* note:this movie is sometimes referred to as "House 3" including the copy i have.SO,although it may have little or nothing to do with the "House"other than name,i chose to refer to it as "House" 3 in my summary.i hope this clears up any confusion.
