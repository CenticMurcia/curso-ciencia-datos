I don't have to say much. Everything is already told by the other users. All i have to say is that this "movie" gave me those rare moments in life when you literally stay with your mouth open. Especially at its ending. It was THAT bad. And thankfully and i didn't watch it from the beginning. I put 2 stars instead of 1 just because i didn't change the channel and made me stay and watch how bad a movie can be. The acting was laughable, the cgi effects are ridiculous (i mean, why didn't just use animatronics or something cheaper if they didn't have money? it would be more real than this!). I can't believe that people actually put money on this (no matter how low the amount), there are much better and more "professional" movies on youtube.
