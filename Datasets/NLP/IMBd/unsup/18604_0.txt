This time, Robin Hood (Daffy Duck) tries to convince Friar Tuck (Porky Pig) that he really is Robin Hood, but the circumstances keep working against him. Maybe "Robin Hood Daffy" isn't the greatest cartoon from the Mel Blanc/Chuck Jones crowd, but it's still great. With some of the things that happen to Daffy here, you just have to remember what we learned in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" about a given cartoon character: you can drop anything you want on his head. And let me tell you, Daffy has a lot more to worry about than that! Anyway, this is another cartoon from the Golden Age. You may just feel like Robin Hood after viewing this.
