On the video cover is a four star rating with the large words 'An explosive performance by Richard Gere'. I thought Bai Ling's performance is equally good if not better. It is the performance of these two leading characters that made this a powerful movie. However, I am disappointed that Jon Avnet chose to have the leading lady speak in English on some scenes that could be more authentic if she had spoken in her mother tongue. Still it is a must see! One of the few that will stand the test of time.
