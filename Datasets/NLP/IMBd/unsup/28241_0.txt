What the hell happened?!! Imagi's work is top notch but what happened to the story? the origin is ALL wrong and there are barely any characters from the manga or TV show in it. I've just recently read the astroboy manga's and I see none of Tezuka's genius it this film, what waste!<br /><br />where was Atlus? Pook? Inspector Tawashi? or Deadcross? who btw would have made a better villain. I don't mind re-imagining something but the idea is to make it better not worse!!<br /><br />In truth I figured it would head this way when I read the director had no clue about Astro before he started production. It would have been nice if he had at least watched one of the TV series. Movies like iron and and spider-man did well cuz all the basic's that made the character popular all these years were retained.<br /><br />Folks seem to like this film but then I've heard that IQ's have been dropping so that might say something as well. I am also sad cuz I want Imagi to do well, I like their company mission statement.
