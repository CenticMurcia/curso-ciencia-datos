This is such a substandard, poorly acted, written and directed with no sense of reality. I have no idea how did it get any award. <br /><br />People in ESL classes look more like upper class Mexicans, the main actor himself look more like a substandard American playboy who pretends not knowing any English. Dialogs are empty, saying too many things and slightly reminds you of a bad Latin American soap operas with exaggerated acting. Posh mother cleaning house just to find "pregnancy test", far from reality. I personally liked her wig and erotic sleeping attire near the end of the movie. <br /><br />In fact i don't wanna waste any time talking about this movie, I am highly disappointed with this movie.
