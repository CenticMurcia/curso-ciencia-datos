Madhuri Dixit has done it again. She mesmerizes with her powerhouse performance, dancing and on-screen presence. The story is absolutely unique and well paced. It keeps one glued to the screen. Dances have been choreographed excellently living up to the reputation of Madhuri's dancing. The musical climax scene leaves you spellbound is an absolute joy to watch. A completely clean and entertaining movie. Go watch it and enjoy. Me and my family loved this movie. All the supporting actors have also performed very well. There are no unnecessary songs and action in the movie. Full credit to Madhuri to have maintained her so well even after having 2 kids. KUDOS to AAJA NACHLE. 10/10.
