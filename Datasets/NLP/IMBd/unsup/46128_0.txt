They butchered the original. If you are going to make a movie based off of a book, try to make it somewhat like it. Otherwise, don't. Give it another name for goodness sake! I liked the creativity and all put into this film, just don't ruin the story line for me. I have loved this story since I was a child and as an adult I would still like to have it in my memory as a good story, not some type of killer film. That is not how it is supposed to be...<br /><br />I don't care if you make the movie "original." Just if you are going to name it after something, try to a least make an attempt to make it like it... Otherwise, name it something else.<br /><br />PLEASE!
