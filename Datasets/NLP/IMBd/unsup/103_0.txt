I agree totally with the others. Fire Sale is one of the funniest comedies ever made. <br /><br />I have not read Maltin's review. But if it is negative, the man is suspect.<br /><br />As for the few who were extremely critical of the movie, I'm speechless. How could one not love this film? It is one side-splitting scene after another. It is nigh impossible to summarize it. One has to experience it. Further more, it is Jewish comedy at its very best. They don't make films like this anymore. <br /><br />Like the others, I have searched for this film in nearly 25 years. I would welcome contact from anyone who can help me find a copy.
