When I sat down to watch this it was purely because I had nothing else to do; this subject area's been done to death. Unlike anything else I've seen, this film showed the young mother's perspective and I could actually feel Jacey's pain as she didn't know whether she'd rather have her baby or keep her secret. I also think it showed the incredible sacrifices mothers will make; most other films and programmes about this subject show cold mothers who either kick their daughters out or resent them if they stay, which is not always the case. I would recommend this film to anyone and I hope to see Danielle Panabaker in something else soon as her acting is second-to-none.
