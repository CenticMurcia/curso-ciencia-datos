Superior to the first two movies, anyway.<br /><br />The film maintains a good deal of tension for the first half. Then it all falls to pieces. I think the writers gave up & just decided to make it up as they went along. The thing between the two half brothers was pathetic & ruined an otherwise average movie. Oh yeah, by the way I'm the son of Satan.
