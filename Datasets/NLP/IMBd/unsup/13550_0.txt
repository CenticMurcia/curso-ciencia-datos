ORVILLE KETCHUM WILL NOT DIE!!!!!!!<br /><br />that is the overall theme of the unsung hero in this movie. ORVILLE KETCHUM RULES!!!!!!!!!! if you want to see plenty of hot chicks showering Goofy violence and the overall awesomeness of Orville check this movie out i first saw it on USA network years ago and have been wanting more Orville ever since Check it out!! and bring back Orville!!!!!! but what this movie is about is basically a serial killer chases around scantly clad women who have the weird urge to take showers while they are running from the killer. Orville is stabbed thrown off the building and other ways that would cause the demise of ordinary men. but not Orville. i think this movie is very underrated and wish that they would bring it back to put it on DVD. a famous quote from Me Ketchum throughout the film is "I Just Got To Tell You..." what does he have to tell the girls..... just watch to find out!!!
