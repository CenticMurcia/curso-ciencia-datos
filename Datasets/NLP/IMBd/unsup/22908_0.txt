An ambitious piece of work from a man who seems to genuinely want to create original art. Whether his ambition is fueled by true inspiration or just pure delusion is uncertain but whatever its source I am happy to have seen this movie and look forward to showing it to friends. This movie attempts to do what all good art should do, which is offer the experiencer a new perspective on humanity. This additional perspective can then be added to the innumerable other perspectives that a person has accumulated and which ultimately serve to expand his or her consciousness. Or maybe not, I don't know really. But it bothers me when people see movies like this and label them as being weird just for the sake of being weird. Instead of determining the validity of the piece based on its actual substance, this type of person uses a cheap character attack on the artist by bringing into question his motives for creating. This is an argumental fallacy and is not a valid criticism of the movie itself.
