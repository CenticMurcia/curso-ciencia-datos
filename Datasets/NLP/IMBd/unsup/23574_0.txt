I guess I'm sort of out of my league discussing this movie as I'm not a silent film fan and know absolutely nothing about silent films.<br /><br />Still I'm going for it because this movie was good. I liked Jurassic Park and similar movies. And, of course, those had better effects. But what blew my mind was how GOOD the effects were in this movie made 70 years before Jurassic Park. I've seen worse stop-motion animation on movies made 30 years or more after this one ("The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" and "Jason & the Argonauts" come to mind).<br /><br />I never read Doyle's book and don't know if it's true to the story, but I liked the idea of the dinosaur being brought back to London and getting loose. (I like those types of movies where the big beast gets loose and wrecks things...Godzilla, Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Reign of Fire, etc.) For all the technical aspects of this movie, you'll need to check out the other reviewers. But from a purely "watching for enjoyment" standpoint, I have to recommend this movie even if it is silent (although the disc I have has a pleasant audio accompaniment).<br /><br />To sum it up, this movie is not just for silent movie buffs. I really think the average person will enjoy it. I did.
