Breathtakingly, stunningly bad. Production values seem to be even lower than the average adult movie.<br /><br />Total acting skills displayed by all participants: close to zero. Poor shooting, directing, editing, script, DVD transfer, etc. If anybody connected with this movie was paid more than bus fares and lunch money, they were overpaid.<br /><br />Some movies are bad, but entertaining because they are bad. Not so with this turkey.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it one star is because there isn't a zero-star voting option.
