Admittedly, the premise of Doc Hollywood is more of a sentimental ideal than an actuality: high-powered big city surgeon falls for the charms of a small town full of colourful characters and in need of an old-time country doctor.<br /><br />But Michael J. Fox is perfect for his part. He can be manic and money-oriented, or compassionate and charming. Whether he's keeping a beribboned sow on a tight leash, spreading his scent through the woods, or floundering around with fresh fish, he's right at home in this film, down home.<br /><br />When I first saw Doc Hollywood, I didn't expect to fall under the spell of this Mayberry of Squash either, but the locals really grow on you. Like kudzu.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox winds up as happy as a pig in silage and so will you.
