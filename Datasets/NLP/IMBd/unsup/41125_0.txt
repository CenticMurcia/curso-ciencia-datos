I never have got why this show was so popular. I honestly never knew. I know that my sister is a big fan and she introduced me to this show. I honestly tried to sit down, watch it and tolerate it, but I just could not!<br /><br />Not only did the animation and ugly character designs makes the animation in "Clutch Cargo" look like an animated film by Hayao Miyazaki, but the plots are oh so ridiculous. I just can't stand that obnoxious hideous Sponge. All he does is run around annoying and making fun of people and trying to be competitive and pull corny un-funny jokes. How anyone finds that appealing is beyond me, especially the ADULT AND OLDER TEEN audiences!<br /><br />Here are some Animated titles I recommend:<br /><br />Astérix and Obélix : A funny spoof of Franco-Roman history and those European "Mythical Sword and Sandals" epics I grew up on. And *gasp*, it is faithful to the euro-comics as well!<br /><br />Spartakus and the Sun Beneath the Sea (The Engulfed World): An original Sci-Fi Fantasy euro-animation series by the creators of "Mysterious Cites of Gold" and "Ulysse 31". Has interesting(!) plots and the humor is tolerable.<br /><br />Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends: Yes, a good cartoon that's not so predictable and has likable characters.<br /><br />My Gym Partner is a Monkey: Another good cartoon network show. Man Nickelodeon, I think CN has beat you hands down.
