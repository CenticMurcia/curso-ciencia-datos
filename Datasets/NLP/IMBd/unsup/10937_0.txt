Like the "Special Collector's Edition" DVD says, "'Footloose' jumps with spirit, dazzling dance numbers, and an electrifying musical score. It portrays the timeless struggle between innocent pleasure and rigid morality, when city-boy Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) finds himself in an uptight Midwestern town where dancing has been banned. Ren revolts with best friend Willard (Chris Penn) and the minister's daughter (Lori Singer)." Veteran director Herbert Ross guides everyone's steps well.<br /><br />"Footloose" makes a few of the mistakes "teen" movies make, but it still kicks up some fun. In a way cool haircut, Mr. Bacon and his stunt doubles perfectly accompany a terrific soundtrack. He and the young supporting cast have, in hindsight, the kind of chemistry casting directors can't manufacture; they're fun and unforced. Introduced like the prerequisite stupid adults, John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest get to add more depth than you'd expect. And, Mr. Penn's dance instruction is topflight.<br /><br />******* Footloose (2/17/84) Herbert Ross ~ Kevin Bacon, Lori Singer, John Lithgow, Chris Penn
