One of the worst movie I ever seen. Very bad acting, horrible script and the comedy is not funny. "Fart fight" that was awful. If you want to see a good KUNG FU comedy like "Kung paw" or "KUNG FU hustle" don't see this movie because is pathetic. I don't know why they did this movie. I rent it because Pat Morita and Lorenzo Lamas are in this movie but this actors don't help the movie, because is very bad. Maurice Patton was very non-original because he was imitating the good actor Chris Tucker. Maurice Patton was trying to talk, walk, move and express like Chris tucker, but was very non-original and pathetic. And James Lew is not funny very bad performance. Please don't waste your money buying it or rent it.
