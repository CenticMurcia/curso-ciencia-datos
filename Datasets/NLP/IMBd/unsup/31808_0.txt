Awesome movie, especially if you love musicals..you will enjoy this movie. This movie has everything you need if you seek comedy, high-school, musical, cars..it has absolutely everything it needs of a memorable high-school fun.<br /><br />I have watched this movie over and over ever since i was a little girl and i still cant forget this movie, its so enjoyable. I remembered i<br /><br />even acted as one of the Pink-Ladies at school..pretended to be one of them..it was so much fun. Me and my friends laughed and having fun, i cant forget those times. This is absolutely the best classic ever made and Olivia Newton John was so fantastic in this movie. She was like my idol in life before. And John Travolta was really sexy in this movie. i loved the comedy of the T-Birds and especially the teachers ..lol.<br /><br />Greeat especially for family and teenagers:D
