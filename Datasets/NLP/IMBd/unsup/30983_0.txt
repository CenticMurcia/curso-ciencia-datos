The outstanding talents of director Lodge Kerrigan and leading actor Damian Lewis have combined to create an outstanding movie. Through Keane we enter the world of the fringes of our society. We see this world very realistically, with no excuses but we still feel great sympathy for Keane as he struggles to find his missing child and recreate his life through friendship with a woman and her daughter. The story swerves into unknown and unexpected regions and we are spellbound waiting to discover what will happen. Keane is one of the finest movies I have ever seen and it will stay in my memory for a long while. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys thoughtful, intelligent, intense films.
