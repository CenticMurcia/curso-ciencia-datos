At first I thought this show might be a more energetic approach to discussing pressing issues. Big mistake. I read a previous comment that used the word 'propaganda' and i couldn't agree more. this show is horrible, and it becomes even more horrible when you realize that some people actually think that this show has a shred of credibility.<br /><br />They don't make the slightest attempt to engage in objective discussion on anything. the entire show is just their opinion on whatever the subject may be. for instance, the show on abstinence was a complete joke and took on the familiar anti-Christian spin. They constantly pull percentages out of thin air and think that they are proving something. They find the worst representatives of the other side in a transparent attempt to discredit their view. I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life than the nonsense in the abstinence program. They had some so-called expert on they saying that babies the womb routinely pleasure themselves. They had a rep from planned parenthood say that abstinence programs teach that touching someone's genitals will result in pregnancy. Best of all, the capped off the show by saying that you should make you own decision and not left someones religious 'fairy tales' guide you. This order coming from someone saying not to take orders.<br /><br />The show is laced with so much unnecessary profanity its difficult to watch. Every other word if profanity, and it adds nothing to the show.<br /><br />This show is just another wolf in sheep's clothing tool used to spew its agenda to the public. Horrible.<br /><br />The most troubling part of it is that some person is actually going to go into this show with an open, unbiased mind think that this show is objective and journalistic, and because they have to fun-loving, non-confrontational goofs starring the show, they won't take this show for what it is, just a piece of propaganda.
