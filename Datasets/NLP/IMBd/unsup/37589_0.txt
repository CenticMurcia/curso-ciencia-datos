Please, never fly with "Columbia Airlines", it is the second time, that they get a hole in the cockpit and a hero must climb through the hole in order to land the plane.<br /><br />A maniac murder is transported in this plane, sure he overthrow his guards and take over control of the plane. After a little shooting an explosion break a big hole in the cockpit. The First office isnÂ´t able to land the plane, the pilot is dead.<br /><br />You already know the plot of a plane with a hole in a cockpit?? Already saw a man, coming inside the plane through this hole?? Already know "Columbia Airlines", already saw the plane??? Yes, the story was ( better ) told rather 30 years ago, "Airport 75". Differences? It was Karen Black as stewardess, who was not able to land the Boeing 747, here it is an attractive female first officer! Here it is a maniac murder, who cause the hole, in "Airport 75" it was an accident with another plane. In "Airport 75" the acting was quite good, here it is horrible.<br /><br />Also the outdoor scenes,when you see the airplane over snowy mountains... the jet, the helicopters. They are taken from the original "Airport 75" movie.<br /><br />At least, if you would like to see a good airplane action movie, take one of the old "Airport", "Passenger 57" for example, but not this cheap crap here.
