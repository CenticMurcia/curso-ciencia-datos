I couldn't remember the title to this movie at first, but I remember the plum tux as plain as day.<br /><br />As a few other people have written and I'll re-iterate, why does Hollywood mis-label movies so much? Are they as insecure as Angus when it comes to picking a genre'? Although there is some comic relief ( as in life - there also is ), this is not what I would call a comedy. This movie should be shown in every single school district in this country when bullying is being discussed. It is the best case for anti-bullying efforts in school that I have ever seen.<br /><br />So why the "bleeping bleep" is this NOT on DVD? Considering all the TRASH that Hollywood puts out every year, here you have a golden gem that would make a ton of money as more kids who are "first timers" in school would buy.<br /><br />This isn't the first movie that Hollywood has mis-labeled in the name of sales and won't be the last - but for pete sakes PLEASE put this on DVD ? My kids would watch this in a heartbeat !!! Hey - anyone at Disney listening ??? Snap this film up while it's cheap and re-release it. Guaranteed money maker every year.<br /><br />The only other film that I've seen come even CLOSE to showing a kid standing up for themselves is "Sleepover" - while I like that one too, it's not anywhere near as real as this.<br /><br />10 out of 10 for the movie, ZERO out of 10 for the idiots who haven't gotten it put to DVD yet.
