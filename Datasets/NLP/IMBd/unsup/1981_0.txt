What happens when you don't pay the editor? This kind of disjointed storytelling. While some of the performances were good, the movie suffers from poor plot development and a very confusing timeline. A shame, because it starts off quite good, then slows to a crawl and the interest peters out. You spend the last 2/3 of the movie trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Nice try, but no cigar.
