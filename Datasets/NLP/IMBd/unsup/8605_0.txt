This aired on Disney a few years back as one of their infamous "Original Movies." The concept is something from a "Simpsons" Halloween episode: a computer home is won by a family and they move in only to find their lives dominated by a glitch in the system.<br /><br />In this case the glitch is a visual representation of a woman who seems to think she's the mother of the new family that's moved in...she takes control of their lives and locks them inside the house. Ryan Merriman plays the whiz-kid genius who wanted to win the house, then decides, "Hey, Dad, maybe we shouldn't have moved in here"...after having complained about wanting to throughout the entire beginning of the film.<br /><br />No Disney Original Movie is going to be very good and this follows all the clich√©s - bad actors, bad script, inept director at the helm (probably a TV veteran and first-timer when it comes to film-making).<br /><br />Overall this is not really worth your time as it is something "The Simpsons" managed to do in 30 minutes and even their version seemed more realistic and less insulting than this...
