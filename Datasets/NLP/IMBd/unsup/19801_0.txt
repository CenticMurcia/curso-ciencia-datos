I have been trying to catch up with this for years...ever since it was barely released...critically slammed...and buried. Now that it has finally been allowed to escape back into pay cable play (and is out on DVD....in pan and scan only....since it and it's fans get no respect)I have finally been able to discover what an over looked gem it is. This is not only one of the quirkiest, bravest, and flat out funniest comedies of it's decade...it is also among the handsomest and best cast "Period Pieces".<br /><br />I was prepared to enjoy the film....if only for the chance to savor the enormous amount of talent involved....but I had not expected to discover that each member of the cast was at their absolute peak! What a year Bridget Fonda had...wonderful in "It Could Happen To You"....and so heart stoppingly radiant in her period finery here!....One has to ask "What Happened?????"...She looks so ready for a HUGE career...and the past decade of film could have so used her beauty, talent, and class. Her costars Cusack and Broderick have, of course, had better luck....but this should have put them in line for a level of mainstream A-List stardom that never quite came true. Anthony Hopkins and Dana Carvey are so unexpectedly flat out brilliant and hysterical (I will never be able to hear John Huston's voice again without thinking of Hopkin's wicked riff on it) that they seem to be operating on a plain far removed from there usual level.<br /><br />I could also go on for many paragraphs about the sensational supporting cast....every member of which was perfectly chosen....I have to at least mention Cameryn Manheim....who glows with such sexy charisma that she dominates every seen she appears in....So refreshing and erotic in the modern Hollywood universe of undernourished Barbie Clones.<br /><br />In Summation....all I have to say is sit back...savor it for two hours....think about it in comparison to almost all of this years "Blockbusters" and understand what is really wrong with Hollywood...Too many critics recognize class hen they see it...and too few audiences get a chance to discover it for themselves....HERE IT IS PEOPLE....Enjoy.
