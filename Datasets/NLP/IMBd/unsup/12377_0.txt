Ving Rhames has made a very important movie that needs a much wider audience than it has received thus far. The story is that of a man who is living a life on a road to nowhere, with a wife and son (Terrence Howard) but without a clue how to be a husband or father. He ends up in jail, and meets a man (Jim Brown) who changes how he sees himself, those around him, and life itself. He returns only to find that his son has become the very man he once was, and is now trying to forget. What follows is a moving tale about how a father does all he can to make life better for the next generation.<br /><br />Rhames and Howard are excellent in their lead roles while Chazz Palminteri and Jim Brown are solid support. Though not of the highest cinematic quality, the film serves its purpose well and delivers a message to a young generation in desperate need of guidance. If you want to be moved and provoked to think critically, this movie is the perfect recipe.
