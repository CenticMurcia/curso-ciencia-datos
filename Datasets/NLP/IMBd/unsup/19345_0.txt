Slightly overrated in its day, this is still a solid western with good scenery (Death Valley?) and a striking Indian attack involving barrages of incoming arrows. However, the costumes for Eleanor Parker, who's just arrived by stagecoach, are laughable. She seems to have brought with her a warehouse of large, elaborate dresses with matching hats and accessories! William Holden has a bare-chest scene and, yes, there's a good thatch of hair on them thar pecs. This was his last "hairy" movie for awhile since in PICNIC, LOVE IS A MANY-SPLENDORED THING, RIVER KWAI, etc. he went with the shaved-chest look.
