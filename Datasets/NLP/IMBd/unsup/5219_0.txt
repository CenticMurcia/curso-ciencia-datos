I first bought this movie because i had grown up with Robotech and absolutely loved the Macross-part of it, plus that i love Macross Plus, and I thought that the original could'nt be that bad. I started the movie and when i finished i was in love with it. One of my first thought were that Robotech was just the pale copy it is. The animation in Macross: DYRL is great, especially when you consider that this was made in 1984! The music was fantastic (although a bit outdated) and realy set the tone of the movie. The mech designs are amazing (and by the way the Valkyries would work in real life if someone just put some money in to the project) and still some of the coolest ever in anime. The story and characters evolve in a beautiful way throughout the movie, and they managed to fit the bigger part of the whole long series storyline into just about 2 hours. Buy this anime and if you have any sense for good movies and anime you will love it. Very highly recommended. Personaly I give it 10/10.
