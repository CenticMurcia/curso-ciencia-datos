First of all i want to make something clear: THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE, if you think this is scary, go back to watching tellytubby or whatever they are called, (I've never watched that show so i seriously don't know.)<br /><br />Now that we have gotten that out in the open, let's start! You can really see that they have put down some time on this movie, they've not just slapped something together to make lots and lots of money. The starring in this movie is pretty good, there are some actors who seems to be a little... What should i say...? Newbiez...<br /><br />Moving on the plot and story of this movie is also great, i think that it's cool, good and original. The zombies looks really computer-created, but the movie isn't brand new so...<br /><br />Everything is At least good.<br /><br />9/10
