"The 4 Musketeers" is a terrible movie. Three painful hours of utter crap. Milady is a ninja and made a pact with the Devil, who gave her magic powers. These powers consist of Sci-Fi level special effects, and zooming in on her eyes a lot. Oh, and D'Artagnan has a magic white hawk, who follows him around and saves the day. I think that's what gave him the power to row across the English channel within the space of only a few hours. And have I mentioned the really bad dubbing from the original French? (There was no option to watch it in French with English subtitles). Anyway, what I really wanted to say was, Stay away from this movie... it's three hours of your life that you'll never get back.
