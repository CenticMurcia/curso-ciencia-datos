Not at all a contender for being overly amusing as Stooge shorts go but when another supporting actor/actress is added that can obviously hold her own, comically, then there's hope yet. Maxine Gates was certainly far more capable of working with the Stooges than say that one with the lame psycho singer "Tiny" as Joe's sister. BLAH! I only wish that Joe had been more cooperative in taking punishment from Moe. They actually may have clicked and become the "Three Stooges" of the 1960's. Should've, would've, could've. It's all academic now. In any case, this is not overall a very bad short. Joe seems to be getting it right here especially when he has to clean up some cases of eggs that he spilled out and broke. Can you hear Curly doing his trademark "la lee, la de la" here? That's what Joe attempts and does pretty well too I might add. Also the "idea" he gets about using a blow torch to first fry up the egg residue and then sweep it up. Something I can hear Curly thinking out loud about: "Hmm!That's an idea!" The scene where Moe and Larry are going through lockers looking for the stolen ring is somewhat of a quandary to me though. First, why aren't all three looking and why isn't there any real slapstick going on about this episode? Also, in some of these "late era" shorts, why are Moe and Larry appearing without their traditional hairstyles? It's like Laurel & Hardy without their bowler hats or their personal hair styles. In any case, on the whole, not a bad short to catch sometime. Too bad not all the shorts with Joe in it are up to this one.
