I remember watching this on TV in 93 to 97 and loved it then and love it more now.It takes me back to a better time in my life. The show had great music, scenery, bikes, chicks, Hummer H1, great story lines and Dutch Dixon. The acting was subpar, but who cares? The bike and Bobby Sixkiller make up for that! Lorenzo played the part of Raines perfectly.. and has never had a role that good and never will again. It was a great show to watch and kept you interested throughout the year. They don't make them like this anymore. I highly recommend getting the seasons on DVD ( Seasons 1,2 and3.. 4 and 5 are not available yet) Long live Reno Raines!
