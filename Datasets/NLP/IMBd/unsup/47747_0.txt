After seeing the title of this movie a man can't help but be a little intrigued, so I picked it up. Wow, and is that saying right..."curiosity kills the cat" and it nearly killed me. This is by far one of the most sick and twisted movies I've ever laid eyes on. The movie is about the Karl "The Butcher," an unrelenting mass murderer who shows no mercy to his victims. Judging by the title, you can imagine some of the things he does to his victims...no nevermind, you can't because a sane person in their right mind wouldn't think of the sick ways to kill a person. 'Violent Shit' is filled with dismemberments, disembowelings, castrations, and even feces eating and it's some of the most sickening stuff I've ever seen. If you're into extremely low-budget (this movie is shot with a camcorder) and torture films, this pointless gorefest is the movie for you! Otherwise, if you're easily offended, avoid at all costs or else you will die of a heart attack after the first 10 seconds of the film.
