Not even Leprechaun can compare. Though the girls on the Fear website are freaky, that's about all this movie has going for it. And it still won't help raise this stupid thriller above a one rating. It is number 64 on the list of bad movies. Very apt. The acting stank, the plot was confusing and made no sense, the characters had not even a sliver of depth. I truly despise this movie. Do not rent it. Do not even waste your time if you happen to catch it on TV. That's all I can bear to say.
