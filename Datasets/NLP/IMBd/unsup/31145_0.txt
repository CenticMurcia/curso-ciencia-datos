I actually dated one of the girl in this movie (Karla Podewils). She was given a free copy, so I watched it. Her part was not too big - Naked sorority girl. I may not have her anymore, but I now have a digital copy of her topless that will last forever. LOL. I am sure her super religious parents would be proud of their daughter! Oh, I guess I should review the movie too. The movie is funny. Don't even try to take it seriously. Ridiculous amounts of gore, Cheesy lines, strippers. What more to you want out of a mock horror film. I'd watch it again! It is also really cool that it was made by a group of students for next to nothing. Props to Full Sail.
