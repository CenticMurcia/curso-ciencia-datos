This game has been out for a while, but if you don't have it yet: DON'T BUY IT!!! This game is absolutely horrible. It's just another one of those stupid games where you go around killing things, while in the background you experience a horrible plot that was obviously put together over a weekend. The books of this game had some promise, the horrible lack of depth and emotion behind Halo's plot was ultimately it's downfall. I hated Halo, but I bought Halo 2 just to see if this was any better. It was better, however, I gave a Halo a rating of .00001 out of 1000. Halo 2? Halo 2 gets a .0002 out of 1000. Seriously, regardless of what your friends may tell you about how this game is "TEH ROXORS", I assure you, this is a sorry excuse for a video game that looks like it was done over the course of a week. It has no focus on gameplay or plot, and focuses ONLY on graphics and eye-candy, just like Halo 1. There's no point in buying this game. Save your money and buy something worthwhile.
