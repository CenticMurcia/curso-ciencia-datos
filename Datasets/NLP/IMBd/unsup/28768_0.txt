This highly under-rated film of the early 80's is not only a masterpiece but a film of immense cultural significance. One that really should be studied in any film course that is on offer at tertiary institutions around the world. It not only shows good versus evil it has such grand themes as science versus nature and a meditation on the religious right that is often over looked by the more carefree viewer.<br /><br />These grand precepts joined with a killer soundtrack just reinforce this film as a piece of cinematic wizardry.<br /><br />Furthermore the cast and the special effects contribute to these points and it is imperative that when one views this motion picture these underlying themes and points are taken on board to ensure a true appreciation of possibly the greatest film ever produced.<br /><br />A must see!
