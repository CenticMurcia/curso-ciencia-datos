This movie completely lacked focus. Was it about her career? Her relationships (both family & romantic)? Her own personal issues? It was just a complete mess- all over the place! There was not enough development in any of these areas for any of them to strike home and come across as important. Things would happen, then change in the drop of a hat, so much so that you'll find yourself thinking "what just happened here?" There was absolutely no true chemistry between Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alec Baldwin, and their relationship just came out creepy and awkward on screen.<br /><br />The whole film was full of completely unrealistic happenings right down to the decor in her hideous apartment.<br /><br />I suppose if you're looking for something light and slightly sloppy you'll enjoy yourself. Otherwise skip it.
