This is a very under-rated movie. OK, it is not the best movie ever but its rating is 4.8 by now and this is way too low. The movie starts great but unfortunately gets cheesy after the first half hour. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is great. The house is detailed brilliantly. One problem can be the action plus horror content of the movie. It is not scary for an adult but may be a bit much for kids. They could have taken this into account and made this a nice family movie. In terms of cinematography, I think they did a great job. This much CGI loaded movies usually do not look as natural as this one. Light and material usage is certainly eye catching. I personally enjoyed the movie. Give it a try, you won't regret.
