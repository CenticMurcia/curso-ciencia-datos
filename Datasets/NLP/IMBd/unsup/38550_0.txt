After sitting through a TV viewing of Pumpkinhead II, I was never so glad to *not* have spent $3 on a rental in all my life. I am usually a fan of low-budget, low-talent horror flicks, but this was just awful! The fact that Roger Clinton was in it should've been a tipoff, but I was in it to see Andrew Robinson ... An actor is only as good as his script, and even he couldn't save this thing. Now my question is this: what sort of hallucinogenic drug were those writers taking? I'd just like to know so I can stay away from it.
