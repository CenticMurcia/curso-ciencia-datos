having recently watched the Austrian horror film " in drei tagen bist du tot" (english international title "dead in three days"), which was, as far as I'm concerned, a very decent experiment, I was interested in recent developments inside the Austrian film scene towards making genre flicks; so the prospect of seeing a science fiction film made in Austria instantaneously spiked my curiosity. But, to make it short, I was deeply, deeply disappointed by what I saw. if it wasn't for the score that makes a huge effort in trying to generate at least some kind of suspense, this movie simply is unutterably boring. having seen the German original version, I was suffering immensely from the poor dialogs, which are equally poorly executed by the actors. after the first 15 minutes the story seemed to turn in circles- which actually was a good thing for a friend of mine, who got out of the theater to buy some drinks and returned 15 minutes later: I didn't have to tell him what was going on while he was gone, because actually nothing happened at all. I know how difficult film making with a small budget is and that the production of a film like AINOA should therefore be considered as an achievement in its own right, but to me this would only be true if the result was in any way at least interesting to watch. but watching tranquillized actors in poor star wars/mad max replica standing around saying things like "it is meant to be" over and over again, my initial goodwill concerning this project evaporated- by the end of the show, I considered "AINOA" to be my personal "ground zero"- in this sense, a "groundbreaking" movie.
