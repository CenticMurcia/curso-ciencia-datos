I can only describe this film as one of the delightfully insane motion pictures ever made. Weller,Goldblum, and Lithgow were all in magnificent form, while the script is a hilarious, surreal masterpiece of heroic absurdity. I've always wanted the sequel to appear, but I realize that that's as likely as a new Twin Peaks film or restorations of The Magnificent Ambersons or Greed. One last thing: I AM New Jersey!
