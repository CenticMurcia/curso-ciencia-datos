This must be the worst film Kirk Douglas ever appeared in during his long and very successful career and it's amazing he agreed to do such a lousy film. Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel, however, are more in their element as both have done some terrible movies. You can safely assume they took these parts because, at the time, these may have been their best offers.<br /><br />Another interesting decision for the movie was the director, Stanly Donen, who had a long and respectable career doing mostly MGM musicals (such as Seven Brides for Seven Brothers). It's very surprising that they lured him into doing such an odd-ball picture. Maybe he, like Kirk Douglas, has a skeleton or two in his closet that they used to blackmail them into doing the movie (this is the only LOGICAL reason I can think of).<br /><br />Whatever the motivations, the story is about a strangely mismatched couple (Farrah and Kirk) who man a small space station. They are happy to be alone because it gives them a lot of time to dress and undress and dress and undress. I guess maybe Farrah being nude COULD be why Mr. Douglas chose to appear in the film. Hmm--maybe I CAN understand why he chose to do this film.<br /><br />Anyway, Harvey Keitel's character stumbles into the station. Given that it's the 1-dimensional Keitel, you can rightly assume that he is a slimy scumbag sociopath (that's pretty much all he's played since) and he wants to score with Farrah. Well, along the way he is killed and somehow implants his consciousness into a sex crazed robot who terrorizes both of our heroes.<br /><br />Gee, with a plot like that, it sure sounds like a surefire recipe for success (or at least giggles). As a comedy, it kinda works. You could laugh at Farrah's acting, the stupidity of the script or the excuses they come up with for the leads to take off their clothes. But, considering it is supposed to be straight sci-fi, it's a total mess.
