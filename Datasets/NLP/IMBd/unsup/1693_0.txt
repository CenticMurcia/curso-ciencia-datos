Mike Jitlov is a lovable genius of animation. The Wizard of Speed and Time, with its silly humor, fun special effects and really catchy theme song is worth seeing once if you have a short attention span and several times if you root for the "little guy".<br /><br />Wizard makes fun of the film industry's obnoxious red tape and the heartlessness of money-grubbing studio executives, while highlighting the generous spirit of friends and of directors who want what's good for a film but have their hands tied by the stuffy studio.<br /><br />The grand finale of this film is worth sitting through some very slow parts. For those who have this movie on video or DVD, I suggest using the slow-motion option to read some of the cute subliminal messages found throughout the finale.
