This movie temporarily lost my sex drive with blood sucking boobs, weird Japanese demonic molestations, a blood sucking succubus, and finally an overgrown tapeworm and the little girl that loved it. <br /><br />I've seen movies like Tales From the Crypt and Tales from the Hood. Trapped Ashes (known as Death House in Japan) clearly fell along these plot lines in the wrap around segment. It is clearly obvious that this was directed by 5 people with the different settings. The short stories were unique but they all amounted for an uneven and mismatched hodgepodge.<br /><br />I could dissect each story line on a different paragraph, but this movie isn't worth much more of my review. But to summarize...<br /><br />Blood Sucking Boob segment - Boobs look nice on Phoebe but it was just weird. Okay I guess.<br /><br />Japanese Demon segment - Started out good, but it clashed with the brief animated features.<br /><br />Best Friends girl segment - Again started out decent, but dragged me to the point of boredom.<br /><br />Tapeworm segment - Should have been a made-for Sci-Fi channel special. Crappy.<br /><br />And finally they all meet their "end" with plot twists that the writer pulled out of his buttocks in order to "piece it all together". <br /><br />I think the biggest flaw was that there wasn't any real consistency in the flow of Trapped Ashes. If this was directed by one or two directors it would have been pulled off a little better. Also, Trapped Ashes had ZERO fear factor in it. Although the Blood Sucking Boob segment was rather disturbing. It had a cheesy Science Fiction feel to it. <br /><br />Overall, I can't really recommend this movie primarily due to its over all sub par execution, it's not atrocious but this definitely is a forgettable film. I can say that the 5 directors at least tried to piece together a creative masterpiece but they fell very short.
