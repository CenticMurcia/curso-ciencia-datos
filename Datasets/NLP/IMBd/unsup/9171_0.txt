Soooo NOT "another attempt to exploit the clich√© of what Colombia is not." I have seen Colombian movies, and most of them do fit perfectly into that description, but this movie is different. It shows a new format in Colombian films, the story is fresh even though it does deal with drugs, and the conflicts of the characters are perfectly plotted and put together into a delightful, artistic movie. Don't think "Mary full of grace" is all Colombia has to offer. This movie is full of wit, and was cleverly written and filmed. One of my top ten. Oh, and if you're into Colombian movies, you have to watch "La Estrategia del Caracol." That's a classic and is also very, very good.
