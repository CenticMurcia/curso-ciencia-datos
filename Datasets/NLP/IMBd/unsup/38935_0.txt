Horror movies shot on video were once a genre for the scrappy independents. I now believe that part of horror history to be over. This was not shot like a horror film. It uses shaky camera motions and cutaways instead of real technique or any inspired moves. The fast motion shots are very obviously sped-up footage. The lighting does nothing but expose the flaws of the production. They look wacky and gimmicky. The horror SFX are lacking in believability. The good performances and a good script were wasted. I looked up the production company so I would be sure not to watch any more of their films. The Movie Channel should have found a find better cheaply-made horror film than "Fingerprints."
