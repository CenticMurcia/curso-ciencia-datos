I had the misfortune of seeing the movie on the SciFi channel just a few days after finishing the book. The movie was almost nothing like the movie. I was disappointed! There were new characters, sex changes, and a huge hole in the explanation of the technology, and big gaps in the plot.<br /><br />I think if the movie was a SciFi Original, I would have liked it better. It's quite obvious to me these people made a feature film on a TV movie budget. Whoever did the screenplay was definitely a B movie moron. And as mentioned by someone earlier, Donner has "ring rust".<br /><br />If you see it in the $.99 cut out area, get it so you can complete your anthology for whichever big name that is in this picture that you love. Otherwise steer clear.
