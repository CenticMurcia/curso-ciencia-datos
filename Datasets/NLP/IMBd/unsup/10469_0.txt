A man stuck squarely behind a past he can not regain and a future he can not avoid. The past being happiness with the woman he loved, and the future being alcoholism and a premature death. All this in the guise of an upbeat comedy. Steve Buscemi is established here as a master film maker. Every word every gesture is perfectly placed and important to the forward flow of the film. And not a hint of the usual self-indulgence that finds its way into so low budget films. See this film! Then see it again! Then see it twice a year for the rest of your life!
