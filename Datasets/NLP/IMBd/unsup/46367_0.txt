I'm writing this review from Italy where i've rented this video just to see something new with Mickey Rourke in it (i'm a big fan of the man!). So i was looking around at the video covers in the videostore when suddenly my attention get caught by the cover of 'Invasion X' (the italian choosen name for this movie). Well, in the high corner on the left of the videotape the first name written was Mickey Rourke. I was glad, finally something new with Mickey was available. Ok, now i've read the other review on imdb where a guy tell us that Mickey is in the movie just once and for about five minutes but it's not true; believe it or not Mickey is in the movie just once but for three minutes!!! If this isn't enough this movie is also boring and not scaring at all. What i really can't understand is why a director (in this case Allardice) that can have Mickey Rourke in a movie use him so few and just in a scene (it's unbelievable and no-one can understand a choice like this). For the italian distributors of the movie there are no right words: to all of you just a sincere f*** off!
