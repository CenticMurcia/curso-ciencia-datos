Tiempo real was all shot in one take. It made the Guiness Book of Records. Now, in my opinion any work of art that applies for the Guiness Book of Records is questionable. Without doubt it is a logistically fairly impressive effort to shoot an entire movie in one take, but so is delivering a paper round on a bike without brakes. What I'm trying to say is that this movie is little more than a circus trick and as a movie itself quite poor. There is no real need for improv acting in a movie, that is the great thing about the medium. In the same way, there was no need to do all of it in one take, if stopping to do it in more takes would have improved the imagery of the movie. Now the movie is neither visually attractive nor well acted. The actors repeat themselves, are clearly lost at some points and all of it looks like a few buddies had a fun afternoon with a video camera.
