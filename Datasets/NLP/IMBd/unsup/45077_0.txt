It takes something "Jurassic-ly" abominable and monstrous for me to get up and walk out of the theater room and you know, Pluto Nash did just that. All I can deduce from what I've seen is Eddie Murphy refusing to sell his club to the local Lunar mob (who also has some grandiose plan to takeover the Moon or whatever), and as a result, he and company are chased around for about 2 hours (I assume 2 hours). Add to it some of the lamest jokes ever exposed to celluloid since Carrot-Top and many eye-gouging, sleep-inducing twists and we have here a total disaster. No big surprise considering this was never screened for crtitcs, and shelved for about a year.<br /><br />Oh well, I'm sorry if I can't divulge anymore info for you. My eyes and ears can only take so much.<br /><br />1/10 for the first hour or so
