This is a great adaptation. It is well cast and all the performances are excellent. I particularly liked the performances of David Morrissey as Bradley Hellstone and Stephen Mackintosh as John Rokesmith.<br /><br />The script remains fairly faithful to the book, and the costumes and scenery give a very convincing Victorian look.
