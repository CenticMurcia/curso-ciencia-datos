I did find reason to watch this movie to the end although I fast forwarded some of the more seemingly irrelevant parts. I say seemingly because there may have been plot clues that I missed.<br /><br />Possible SPOILERS Here: Unfortunately the DVD box presents this movie as more than it is, almost supernatural, when it's really a psychological drama. I understand this movie to be about a woman whose life is going the way she wants until she becomes pregnant. She represses not wanting to have a baby to the point that her personality splits as she tries to be the mother and wife that's expected of her.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a look into the minds of people who do things we can't understand; a look at how the subconscious mind can overcome the conscious mind with its darker, suppressed desires or fears if the subconscious thoughts are stronger. The director/writer appears to do documentaries as well, so maybe that's why this movie has the feel more of a learning experience than entertainment. If a person enjoys looking into the workings of the human mind, this movie may be worthwhile.
