This is...the funniest movie...EVER!!!! I literally...LITERALLY laughed so I cried, I laughed all the way trough, my I could barely hear what the actors were saying I laughed so much. Even the plot is cosy and cute, but even if the plot stinked, this movie(with its humour) would still be the best movie ever!!!
