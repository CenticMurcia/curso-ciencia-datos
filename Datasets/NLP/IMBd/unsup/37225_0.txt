May contain Spoilers,I doubt it, but I'm not taking chances.<br /><br />Early TV trailers touted this movie as being based on the true story of the most prolific serial killer in history, and I was excited!<br /><br />When I sat down with my popcorn and Dr.Pepper, all set to watch a hopefully well made serial killer flick, only to discover that today's feature was actually going to be "Lake Placid Redux", I was mad enough to kick a puppy -into the mouth of a seriously p.o.ed mutant crocodile!<br /><br />I hate bait and switch! It drives me up the wall when a scene featured in a trailer isn't in the movie, but I can understand the editing process. To me there's no excuse for the way this movie was marketed as one thing and delivered as something else! It's the same as if Disney had marketed Snow White as a porn movie. All they accomplished in doing this was boost their opening weekend totals. As soon as the word got out, this flick tanked, tanked HARD!<br /><br />Now that I've gotten that off my chest.<br /><br />For what it really is, this is not a bad movie, even though I kept expecting to see Betty White leading a water buffalo down to the river's edge. Orlando Jones was damn strong in this movie, a solid performance, probably the best thing about this movie.<br /><br />I think that Steve Corwin's estate should be considering legal action considering the particularly unflattering parody of the"Crocodile Hunter". I also found that character inappropriately funny given that the movie was released so soon after Corwin's death.<br /><br />I'll not be buying this one, maybe if it had been marketed honestly, but the bad taste left in my mouth from being tricked into seeing this movie far outweighs the fact that it's a decent (and not more than decent) film.
