Jason's Lyric wasn't a great film theatrically, as it had small promotions. Judging by the title and cast, i didn't expect a good film. It was actually a great film with powerful performances. It tells the story of Two brothers (One good and One Bad) living with their mother in a rough area. Jason played by Allen Payne is sensible and taking care of his younger brother Joshu. Joshua played by Bokeem Woodbine is a little crazy and has a violent side to his personality. Its a half love story and half action movie thats worth the watch. Allen Payne delivers a good performance. Bokeem Woodbine is terrific, see him in Dead Presidents also. Jada Pinkett looks ultra sexy and plays the love life of Jason. There are some fabulous Sex scenes, Jada looks fantastic. Overall, Good realistic storyline and deserves a chance.
