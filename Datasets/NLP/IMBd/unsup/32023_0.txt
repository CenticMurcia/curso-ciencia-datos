I enjoyed this film very much because in many ways it was a change of pace; it takes the unconventional, homosexual couple and then puts them in a military setting which provides for an interest backdrop to a very human story. I enjoyed it particularly because all of the characters from the cook to the main characters were very likable, and in spite of the brief nature of the film, I felt that they were still well developed. I did not feel as if the contents of the movie were lacking at all, and that the overall production was very professional. <br /><br />The film was quick-paced and very quickly got to the point and resolution. In no way was it a tiring or boring to watch this movie -- I found it to be a very easy, very fulfilling watch. This film is nothing over the top but with great jobs done by all of the actors and the uniqueness of the story I recommend it to anyone for a decent film to watch.
