John Steinbeck's classic tale of two depression era migrant workers - resourceful "George Milton" and lumbering "Lennie Small" - is required reading, or viewing (not a good substitute for Steinbeck, but if you must). This version's main weakness is staginess. Strangely, Lewis Milestone frames much of the film with obviously staged "bits" not present in even the original play. Less a problem are contrivances like the small flea power dust storm emitted when Burgess Meredith (as George) examines his bunk. Still, this cast is the standard by which all subsequent characterizations have been measured, with Lon Chaney Jr. (as Lennie) being especially memorable.<br /><br />******** Of Mice and Men (12/30/39) Lewis Milestone ~ Burgess Meredith, Lon Chaney Jr., Roman Bohnen, Betty Field
