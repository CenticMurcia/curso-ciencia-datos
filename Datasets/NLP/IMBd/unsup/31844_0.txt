The quality of the ice-revue depends above all upon Eva Pawlik, who was four times Austrian Champion, European Champion and runner-up both at the World´s and the Olympics. She was not only a world-famous sportswoman, but also an outstanding show star and a good actress as to be seen in "Frühling auf dem Eis". The old-fashioned choreography fits in the early fifties. Pawlik´s spins are faster than those of many a European or World Champion of today. Her most difficult jumps are the double salchow and the double toe. The film earns a maximum of 10 points because it is one of the very few movies in which a European figure skating Champion also plays a main role in the frame story of a revue film. No one interested in ice shows should miss it!
