This is terrible. One of the worst movies I think I have ever seen. It is bad in every possible way. The original series for its time was actually quite challenging, and exciting. Watching reruns on satellite, I am now enjoying it all over again, and I realise just exactly how awful this film is. One tiny bright spot, Snoop Dogg is a worthy successor to Antonio Vargas. However, the lame script lets him down badly. I expected better of Owen Wilson, but somehow this weak witted stuff is precisely Ben Stiller's level. One question I do have, do the script writers actually believe that shooting a child's pony dead in a garage is in any way amusing? It isn't.
