I don't usually write comments about movies but Well this movie broke me down in my heart. i've seen "the girl next door" in the title and i thought it's the comedy "the girl next door (2004)" one with Elisha Cutbert.<br /><br />As i started watching i've seen this is not the comedy one but the horror one from Ketchum's book. When i was watching, the story grew worse every minute. I've thought i was going to watch a kiddie story movie but that torture and everything gave me a headache. knowing it's a real story feels much worse. I just wanted to be in the story just to kill those boys all with their mother.<br /><br />This movie is not for anyone under 18 or anyone who is sensitive or anyone who doesn't want to see a young innocent girl die....<br /><br />there are such perverts in the world, they are not just a few i feel!
