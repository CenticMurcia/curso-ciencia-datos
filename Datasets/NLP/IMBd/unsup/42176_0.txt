This movie is a prime example of people being too messed up from the 1960s after taking too much LSD. People are reading way too much into this movie. If this movie was made today it would be panned and dismissed. It is boring beyond belief. You keep waiting for something to occur. Nothing ever does. By the time it ends you are thinking I'm going to kill myself if I have to endure another minute. The acting of Nicholson and Black is above average but you wonder what they saw in choosing to do this horrible script. The comment that this is one of the key films of the 1970s is ludicrous. These are the kind of movies from the 70s that should be forgotten. Give me "Apocalypse Now", "Patton", "Godfather", "American Graffiti" or "Star Wars". This movie sucks. One great scene does not a movie make.
