This movie goes strictly by formula, this cast made a much better movie, "Pittsburgh." This movie still has camp value.<br /><br />The make-up and wardrobe for the women is worth watching. How did they get all those marvelous dresses to Nome? And how did they keep them so clean and sparkly? La Dietrich wears hats that are strictly from outer space and makes her look Christmas tree-esquire.<br /><br />The script banter that compares getting in women's pants to playing poker goes on way over the top...but watching Randolph Scott and John Wayne go at it is pretty darned funny.<br /><br />So a 4 of 10 for movie overall, but an "8" for camp value.
