This movie has something for everyone, comedy romance back in a time when Disney knew how to make a family film. The Love bug is the story of a man who meets an extraordinary car and how said car changes his life. This movie has a bit of everything, comedy, appeal to kids, romance, racing, Disney villains who are as likable as they are bad. One of the essential to watch Disney movies in my humble opinion. The background music really went to support the film. The footage wasn't always best shots but hey it was the 60s and I think it helps keep the feel of that era looking like that. Overall this movie is the reason that people know who Herbie is today and the reason he has become as iconic as many of their cartoon characters.
