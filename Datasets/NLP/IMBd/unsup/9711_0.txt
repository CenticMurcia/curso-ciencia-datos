Bonnie is simply the best among all female r&b vocalists (and anything else...). During her Cincinnati concert in fall of 2004, I was blown away by the juiciness of her guitarin', vibin', and singing plus the band was superb to boot. It was a big-time head trip and certainly a good time was had by all, even among those over 50 who were groovin' in the aisles and friggin' shaking it!!! Having watched the DVD numerous times, I'm always struck by the harmonies that can be easily followed and I join in every time. "I Can't Make You Love Me" is always poignant as ever. Bruce Hornsby plays the accompaniment so well, as always. I am on the constant lookout for her next concert. Because, ...Bonnie rocks, period.
