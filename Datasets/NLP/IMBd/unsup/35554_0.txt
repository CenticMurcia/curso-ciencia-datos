I thought this was going to be another "Skin-amax" flick that pops up late at night on cable and stars Shannon Tweed. But this is basically a low budget thriller with the emphasis on low budget. Film is about a woman named Kate (Kari Wuhrer) who is totally infatuated with Sara (Farrah Forke) but she lives in California. Kate tells her lesbian lover Zoey (Natalie Radford) to come with her to the west coast and gives her a phony reason to come. Sara is living with Dylan (Matthew Porretta) and planning on getting engaged which spoils Kate's plans on buying a flower shop with Sara in New Orleans. Kate gets Zoey to help her kill Dylan and make it look like a robbery. Kate stays with Sara to console her and creep back into her life! They decide to open a flower shop in Los Angeles and Kate blackmails a man named Jack (Joel Gretsch) so he will seduce Sara and then dump her but Jack really learns to like her instead. Kate's also been giving Sara the date rape drug to knock her out at night and take advantage of her. This film was directed by Eric DelaBarre and for his first effort its adequately made. There are about two scenes where characters are talking to one another but you cannot hear them and you only hear the background music. I thought these scenes were well filmed and it shows a spark of real creativity. Wuhrer and Forke and...oh hell, everyone in this film is good looking. Thats why this has the appearance of one of those soft porn films late night on cable. I was surprised by the small amount of nudity in certain scenes. Even in the lesbian love scene they both keep their clothes on. There are some quick shots of breasts but fans of Wuhrer might be a tad disappointed. Not a bad late night thriller and Wuhrer is always worth a look. But the overall script is silly and goes way over the top! Fans of Wuhrer have a head start.
