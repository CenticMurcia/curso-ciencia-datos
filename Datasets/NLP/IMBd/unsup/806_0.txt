I just had the opportunity to catch this at the 2007 Madison Film Festival and thought it was such a wonderful film; equally entertaining, touching, and funny. The content of this film, which is Mr. Reilly's stage show that recaps his life and work, is absolutely fantastic. Equally important was the editing and capturing of his performance, where I felt the impact and intimacy of a live show.<br /><br />Thanks for sharing your wonderful life, Mr. Reilly! And for all the lifetime of laughs, even if you want to forget about the TV material. Thanks to the film makers that brought this performance to a wider audience.<br /><br />I can't recommend this enough and look forward to its release on DVD, so I can share it with my friends.<br /><br />While watching his performance, I realized that performers of his caliber just don't grace the screen anymore. A thought that is quite depressing.
