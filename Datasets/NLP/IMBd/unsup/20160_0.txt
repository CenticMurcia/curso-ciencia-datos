If you are looking for a good family move, this is it. But beware, you might want to have the Kleenex handy. I know I and my wife did. The whole movie is touching but the ending really hits home. Especially for me being a parent of a little girl myself. I rented the movie and was told by my wife to have the Kleenex handy. It really makes you think about your life and what you want it to stand for. The acting is good, but the cast itself really makes this movie special. James Garner, Brian Dennehy, Bill Cobbs and Lee Meriwether make this movie worth seeing just to see these great actors together in the same movie. Abigail Bresslin as the little girl makes you stop and think. Her character may be brash but she really makes sense.
