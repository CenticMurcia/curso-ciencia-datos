Okay, I should realize one should avoid French films at all costs.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is that they build this really complex space station to house all of seven criminally insane inmates. A new scientist comes on board the station to introduce a nano-technology cure for their insanity, only to discover one of the inmates is in fact a super-being who can resurrect himself and others from the dead. Her mandate is to make it work even if she has to kill them all.<br /><br />The characters are all given evocative names from mythology and history... Sadly, they really didn't do much more to make them more distinctive. In fact, their heads are shaved and they all wear the same clothes, making the characters even harder to distinguish from one another.<br /><br />The ending makes not a lick of sense. Is there some rule that if you are making a pretentious Sci-Fi film, you need an ending that doesn't make a lick of sense?
