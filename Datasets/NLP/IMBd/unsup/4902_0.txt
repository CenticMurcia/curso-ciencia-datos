I really could care less who wins Auburn - Miss State, and i wanted a good laugh, so I turned to an old favorite with Henry Winkler and Micael Keaton, along with Shelly Long, Richard Belzer, and Vincent Schiavelli. You'll even find Kevin Costner and Shannen Doherty in here if you look closely.<br /><br />Winkler got a Golden Globe nomination for his performance, but it was Keaton that got a big start with the film.<br /><br />Winkler & Long were magnificent, and Keaton was so crazy that you laughed every time he opened his mouth. It was a pleasant experience.<br /><br />Great soundtrack, too.
