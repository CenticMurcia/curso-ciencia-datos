For anyone with even a fleeting interest in human rights, this is a difficult movie to watch. This is the story of an Afghan mother who lost her husband in the war and has no brothers or sons. Women are not allowed to have an autonomous life without some male. With no means of support, she dresses her daughter as a boy, so her daughter can get a job.<br /><br />The direction and cinematography create an intimacy with this (I would guess) 11-year-old child, as we experience her very real fears. Since the gender roles are so disparate, she struggles trying to present herself as a male.<br /><br />This is a very sad movie to watch. We feel the pain of these characters without seeing any graphic abuse. It is the daily abuse encountered by all, especially the women, that make this such a compelling movie.<br /><br />While the central characters drive the movie, the other technical aspects of the movie are extremely well done. The direction is very good. Some of the shots are done with a beauty and grace that is in such sharp contrast with the lives of the Afghan people. The movie opens with a documentary-like feel with the point-of-view of a camera man interacting with a boy begging for money. We get closure on that scene later in the movie. Very good story telling.
