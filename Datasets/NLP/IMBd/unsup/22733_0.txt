As much as I hate to say it, Saawariya did disappoint me. It had everything, new stars, lovely songs, a magical and enchanting set...but it lacked soul.<br /><br />There are many "whys?" and "hows?" raised in certain parts of this film and for the purpose of those reading I shall not include any spoilers within my review but if we look away from these things then all in all Saawariya is an average movie. If anything is going to bring this movie forward it will be Ranbir Kapoors acting. He is simply superb...you almost see shades of Raj Kapoor kicking in at times (which my mum was very happy about!) and of course shades of his own Dad Rishi which was excellent.<br /><br />Ranbir Kapoor is truly an absolute Gem in this movie and I felt that if he wasn't in the frame that something was missing... thats the impact he made on me. He's innocent eyes and charming persona really will make a few hearts flutter! Sonam Kapoor is again a good actress although I don't think we really got the chance to see what we she made of as her character didn't really have much to do...but from what we see things are promising.<br /><br />Salman Khan was quite wasted in the movie, he is looking older (and bigger) but nevertheless I will still remain a fan of his.<br /><br />Rani Mukerjee I feel does bring some life into the otherwise dull blue surroundings, especially in her song. She has done well in her short but important role.<br /><br />All in all, although Saawariya fails to meet our expectations from a great director like Bhansali, it still has that pulling factor I feel to make it do well at the box office.<br /><br />Go watch it for Ranbir Kapoor, he deserves it.
