There are numerous movies out there that handle psychosis and paranoia and some of them handle it pretty well. Danika most certainly does not.<br /><br />The only way you could defend the setup of the movie is by saying that we as viewers see the world through the eyes of the disturbed Danika. Well, after 30 minutes of that, it becomes pretty annoying and tedious.<br /><br />At first I thought the movie was setup to make it hard to follow what was happening. But in the end there was nothing connecting to anything in it. Non of the plot-points that were introduced during the repetitive scenes had any relevance to the eventual end of the movie. And the result is a viewer who is left feeling like a fool.<br /><br />I believe that it was the directors intend to let the audience be unaware of what was real and what wasn't. But the moments of unclarity were too obvious to achieve that effect.<br /><br />This movie has not much to show for besides a woman and her delusions. It is devoid of plot, impressive special effects or memorable acting.<br /><br />Not recommended.
