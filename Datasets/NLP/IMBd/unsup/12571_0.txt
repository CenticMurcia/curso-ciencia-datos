possible spoiler - don't read if you don't want to know. The talented Kimberly J. Brown reprises her role from the first Halloweentown, with Debbie Reynolds playing her grandmother. I find it impressive that Kimberly can interact effectively with a star of that magnitude, it says a lot for her professionalism at 16 years old. While the plot of both movies is pure fantasy, the second movie adds more characters to the mythology of Halloweentown, and builds on the foundation of the first movie by reviving the villain in a new guise, and shows both the naive nature of the teenage Marnie - and of her vulnerable mother. Watch out teen actresses - a 10 year old is nipping on your heels! Sophie has a much greater role in this movie than the first, and is a real charmer. Give her three years or less, and we may see that young actress in a title role in Disney movie! The younger brother has also grown quite a bit, and has a greater role in this movie. Pure enjoyment. The only negative is some occultism, which is troubling - particularly the very real occult practice of reading spells backwards. Treat as fantasy only, and make sure you or your kids are not interested in trying out the magical techniques presented.
