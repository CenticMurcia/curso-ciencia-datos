Simply a MUST SEE.<br /><br />An intelligent look at many separate views on the word, a little history and origin but mostly on how it affects us today.<br /><br />The film deflates the power of the word the religious right have put on it (or at least gives good basis for it) and brings up many reasons/ideas and situations describing how silly the obsession and demonizing of this fine word is :)<br /><br />Btw, don't be afraid to bring your kids, I mean...if they don't already know the word there is something seriously wrong with them. If anything the movie will help put it into context :)<br /><br />The film would have gotten a 9 if it wasn't for the crappy animations >:) but we can live with that, it's a brilliant piece of film anyway.
