If "Slaughter Studios" has anything going for it, it is that it is much more bloody than the contemporary teen slasher flicks that we have seen lately. Equally as significant is the revelation of the killer, which I have to admit was quite clever; I never, ever would have guessed and that is rare for one of these. Overall, I did enjoy the film. It looked good and the special effects were impressive. <br /><br />Where the movie lost points is in the incredibly dull and dragging middle. Nothing of any importance happens for at least 45 minutes, except bad acting. Yes, the movie also looses points because nobody in can act worth a crap. Yes, we know you are in a no-name, low budget, direct-to-video horror flick, but at least TRY to act excited. The plot centers around a group of young filmmakers who go to the legendary but now abandoned Slaughter Studios, where years before a popular actor was killed in a freak accident (or was it?) to finish the film that never was finished. Of course, a killer shows up and starts mutilating the cast in very bloody ways. As I mentioned, the killings in this are pretty bloody; we get pick axing, head smashing, head-spearing, and head hooking. Most of this comes at the end-the middle of the film is basically nothing but these actors trying to make the movie. The end comes from left field too and I really, really enjoyed the simpleness and cleverness of it, though nobody will ever figure out who the killer is until he is revealed. A good effort, especially for a direct-to-video feature. A little cheesey in parts, but enjoyable nonetheless.
