Few series have more ably depicted the complicated communication between two people from different backgrounds who are trying to forge a relationship. Mike and Laura start out associating by accident and then by design. Laura is prickly and easily offended. Mike is well-intentioned but inarticulate. Laura is an intellectual with strong family ties (especially to her long-suffering sister). Mike is a landscaper with no family to speak of. They both feel like outsiders looking in most of the time. This series details their mutual yearnings and blunderings in a warm and humorous manner. By the end, I wanted terribly for these two awkward people to get together. A sign of a successful series.<br /><br />Good acting, good writing, and good supporting characters. Highly recommended.
