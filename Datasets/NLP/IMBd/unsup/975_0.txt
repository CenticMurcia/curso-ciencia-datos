The mostly decent performances from Shannen Doherty, Colm Feore, and Tamara Gorski were the best thing about this forgettable film. The dialogue is laughable and the plot is overflowing with twists and double-crosses, but it's hard to tell who's fooling who -- is the *character* bad at pretending to be loyal, or is the actor just bad at portraying the character? I can see why this one disappeared without a trace.
