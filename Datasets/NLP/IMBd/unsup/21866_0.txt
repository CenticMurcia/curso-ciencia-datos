I enjoyed the last installment of the Dracula 2000 series. The real Romania as the landscape for the story was awesome, it added to the sinister aspect of the plot. The Romanian actors in the movie were also a bonus (in the opening scene of the movie). There were a lot to like in this movie. I am proud that the entire series did not fall into vampire movie clich√©. The series remain unique in this way.<br /><br />I do understand this is a "B" flick movie (not worthy enough to be shown in theaters across the nation), but it is superb B flick.<br /><br />I had reservations about Rutger Hauer playing Dracula simply because the actors used to portray the previous Draculas in the first two movies were hip and hot. But he did pretty well, he does a good villain.<br /><br />My favorite scenes are the "suckfest" at Dracula's place, the opening scene, and the end scene.<br /><br />This was a well done movie - the script, the directing, the acting. The Amercian actors did an excellent job. The Romanian actors stood out to me. I particularly like the ending of the story.
