USA Network Pictures captured the true story of Vlad the Impaler. This movie was as suggested by my summary a Haunting Tale of Justice and Love.<br /><br />The story of Dracul, was masterfully brought to life, with Rudolf Martin bringing just the right edge to the Vlad (Dracula). Jane March was radiant and haunting as Lidia (Vlad's wife).<br /><br />The cinematography was stunning, the battle scenes short and frenzied. Seeing the way in which this film was done, it is no wonder that the Dark Prince is still a national hero in Romania, whose return is anxiously awaited.<br /><br />I can only hope that USA Pictures has the common sense to release this film to Video and DvD as no Dracula collection can be complete without it.
