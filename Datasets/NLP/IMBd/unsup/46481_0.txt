Dude, I can't even begin to describe how awful this movie is. The inconsistent and dull story, ridiculous action scenes, terrible acting, horrid dialog, just...everything.<br /><br />I don't even want to waste my time writing about this crap. The only thing I can really say is to stay as far away from this as you possibly can. If you have a friend who says: "Hey, let's watch this just for fun," firmly tell him "NO" like he just offered to jerk you off with barbed wire. Of course, that would probably be much more enjoyable than Street Fighter.<br /><br />Bottom line: this boring little turd of a film will make you want to kill yourself for spending money on it.
