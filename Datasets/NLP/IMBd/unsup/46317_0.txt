Please forgive my ignorance, but I've never even heard of Don Quixote. (sorry!) Unfortunately, this movie failed to ignite my curiosity or enthusiasm for the legend. The English dubbed version is very weak and I found ALL the voices rather annoying.<br /><br />But I can see how this story has become a Spanish favourite. The ideas of chivalry and adventure are always popular and this story reminds me of a crap Spanish version of say.. robin hood, king Arthur or the french three musketeers story.<br /><br />Anyway, this film is dismal and fails to capture the imagination or produce any laughs from it's lame comical moments. The soundtrack is also poor but the animation is 'ok'. If you decide to watch this film then I will not be held responsible for your inevitable regret.
