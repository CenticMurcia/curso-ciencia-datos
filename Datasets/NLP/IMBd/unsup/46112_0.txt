First off, I have to say I like Danny Kaye -- I really do. We were watching "White Christmas" on Turner Classic Movies tonight for our annual holiday tradition. I used to watch that movie as a kid with my family and that was where I was first introduced to Danny Kaye's comedic genius.<br /><br />Then when I saw that tonight TCM was highlighting Danny Kaye movies and that "Wonder Man" was on next, I rushed over to IMDb.com to read the reviews on it since I had never seen or heard of this Danny Kaye movie before.<br /><br />All the reviews here were so glowing (many remarking how this is Danny Kaye's best), that I convinced my own family to sit tight after "White Christmas" was over to make sure that we wouldn't miss this unexpected treat. Well, all I can say was that it was almost a waste of time.<br /><br />Yes, there were a few good bits in "Wonder Man" and the special effects were very good for that time (deserving of the Oscar they received), but the overall film just seemed so sub-par to all of us.<br /><br />We sat here for the full 98 minutes, and kept hoping that it would get funnier as it got along. Somewhere around the first half-hour, it became painfully obvious that it wasn't going to get any funnier or better. Two of us fell asleep before it was over; the other two of us stuck it out to the end just to make sure we wouldn't miss anything in case it did get better. It didn't.<br /><br />How bad was it? Let me put it this way -- I was videotaping it because after reading the IMDb.com reviews, I felt sure this would be one movie that I would want to watch again and share with friends. But then after the movie was over, I rewound the tape so I can re-use it to record something else. I can't see myself ever wanting to spend the time to watch this movie again.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying it was terrible; it just wasn't a continuously funny movie. There were a lot of long dry bits between the few laugh-out-loud bits.<br /><br />For my money, "The Court Jester" was Danny's best and funniest movie --a great script with excellent pacing, well-designed and executed set pieces, hilarious situations and songs, and just a great and satisfying storyline overall. When we first saw it last year on TCM, our whole family literally busted out laughing uncontrollably, with tears coming from our eyes during the rapid-paced knight-certification scenes (and this is with somewhat-jaded teenagers yet!).<br /><br />Then you throw in the jousting tournament shenanigans, the dueling-under-hypnosis scenes, and the creative climatic fight and rescue and you really have a very funny and entertaining movie. The dueling-under-hypnosis scenes are classic for best showcasing Danny's singular ability to change faces/personalities/whole personas back and forth on a dime.<br /><br />See "The Court Jester" if you want to see Danny Kaye at his best with a great script, great writing, beautiful production, and rib-aching comedic entertainment.<br /><br />But back to "Wonder Man" -- besides some of the positive bits mentioned in other reviews here, what really first struck me subconsciously early in this movie and then I became more consciously aware of as the movie progressed is how much it seems that Jerry Lewis lifted from Danny Kaye the manic, physical bits and persona he (Jerry) later became famous for and identified with in the 1960's. See if you don't get the same impression.<br /><br />In closing, watch "Wonder Man" only so you can say you've seen all of Danny's film work but don't go in expecting that this is his best or anywhere near it. (Did I mention "The Court Jester" is the movie you ought to see?.....;->)
