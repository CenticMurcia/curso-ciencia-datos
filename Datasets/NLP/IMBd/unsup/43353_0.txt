The fact that Coppola directed this absolutely floors me!! From this tripe to The Godfather-possibly the best movie ever made!! It does not help that I loathe Tommy Steele and Petula Clark equally so it makes it impossible for me to be objective about this movie.Steele cannot act at all and seems to think he is on stage the whole time! I cannot believe that when I was a kid I thought him the bees knees!! Petula gives both me and my wife the heebeegeebees! There is just something about her I find repulsive both acting and definitely singing!! I gave FR 2 points because Astaire was in it and I love him to bits. A terribly unbelievable storyline (albeit with a good moral base)does the whole concept no good at all. I would like to say that I do love a good musical, but this was not good at all.
