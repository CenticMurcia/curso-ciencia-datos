This movie was awful. It seemed to me that the movie went from idea to finished product in about 2 weeks. Here is why this movie (and others like it) makes me so mad.<br /><br />I can suspend disbelief for a movie, to a certain point. I can buy into the existence of ghosts and demons, the supernatural, space travel, laser guns, and so on. I cannot ignore the patently ridiculous when realism should be expected. Some examples:<br /><br />Diane Lane is a low level night shift key pounder. All of a sudden, she is the task force leader of the most high profile FBI case in the country. She didn't show a single instance of leadership before or during her tenure as task force "leader". In fact, when her friend called in and said I think I am on to something, I'll tell you about it later, I laughed out loud. How about saying, "no, tell me about it now. This is more important than your dating life". Or "Why didn't you tell me about this at our twice daily update meetings that a task force of this magnitude has?" As soon as he hung up without passing on the information, my movie brain said he is the next to die, and my professional brain said if he dies it is her fault for being a terrible leader and manager.<br /><br />They have discovered a hacker with the ability to make his IP address untraceable. This is a huge deal, and I can easily suspend disbelief for that piece. I cannot excuse the idea that the NSA wouldn't be interested in helping. Untraceable IP addresses could potentially cause a huge security risk for the country, and could also be exploited to be used BY our country for espionage. The idea that the NSA wouldn't be interested is ludicrous.<br /><br />There were many other smaller issues, like when she picked up the phone on the bridge and said "I am an FBI Agent! Connect me!" I laughed out loud. I'll have to try that next time. Apparently operators these days are pretty trusting. But by this point the plot holes were so glaring that I was only continuing to watch because I was with my wife.<br /><br />Overall, a decent and original idea, terribly done.
