Sorry I don't get it.<br /><br />Explain it to me. Why does this guy had any kind of success. I've been studying cinema in university for more than a year and stumbled across two Jean Renoir films including this one who was particularly painful.<br /><br />It might be my suspension of disbelief being the problem, but i've watched some movies from this era(including Citizen Kane that I loved) and never hated'em with so much passion. Everything in that movie is overplayed and annoying. The music is damn horrible, the acting is BEYOND overplayed and the editing ain't anything special.<br /><br />The ones who knows semio-pragmatic, I might agree that it contains some interesting twists of that theory, but the movie is way too damn boring for the 40 minutes it last. It looks like a theater play with comedians on mushroom Very bad
