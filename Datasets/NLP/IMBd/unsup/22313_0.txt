This series was just not working for me - Neither characters, cast, storyline, nor jokes did it for me. Sorry. I would like to stop here, but since IMDb requires 10 lines of text in every comment, here goes... The series bugged me, but maybe that's because I'm not too fond of series and fond of sci-fi movies. I think, in order to have anything work in a sci-fi setting, you have to make an extra effort to put in something new for the geeky outfits etc. to work. For me, Star Wars pulled it off most of the time (although my wife would probably argue), Star Trek never quite did it for me ["Captain, we've never seen anything like this life force before" -"Oh, well I have, last episode"] Red Dwarf doesn't pull it off, it's neither funny, nor new in its sci-fi ways, but it takes the price as the only blend of Space Balls, Eastenders, herbal tea, and James Brown. And since sci-fi comedy series has not been done a lot, I guess there is something new here after all - so I give it a 3. Cheers.
