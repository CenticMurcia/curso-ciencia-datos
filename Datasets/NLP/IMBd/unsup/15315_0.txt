Like the first reviewer here said, this is a mess of a movie.<br /><br />It's really more of a 70's black exploitation type film than anything else. Not a genre I am a fan of.<br /><br />I should have known it would stink when Snoop Dogg is the lead. The only rapper I have ever liked in a film was "Ice Cube" in "Ghosts of Mars".
