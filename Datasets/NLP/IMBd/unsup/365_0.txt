Another two hours of my life that I've wasted and will never get back! How did Bridgette jump from the 1700's to the 21st century? That was never even hinted at. Poorly written, plot was obvious and predictable. Who was the male werewolf following her? Other than it wanting to mate with her "WHY" was it following her? The masturbating clip was trash and needless! The only good parts to the movie was when Grandma got nervous anytime Ghost got near her. Couldn't the mental health personnel able to tell that Ghost was a seriously sick individual? How is Ghost going to deal with a werewolf in her cellar? The first Ginger was better written!
