And, it's one of the funniest, most outrageous B-movies you'll ever see! I pity MetalMike for not finding the humor in this. Of course the acting is terrible and the plot deranged and the action scenes silly, but that's the humor in it. What's even funnier is that it may have been a serious attempt at making a decent movie. There are so many classic scenes it's so hard to know where to begin. The karaoke scene, the fight at the end, the three nearly identical montages and various points in the film, and the list goes on and on and on. This movie was far more entertaining than most of the crap put out by Hollywood. Again, if you can't find this funny, then I feel sorry for you... stop taking yourself so seriously! Jeez...
