Asian women appear to be having an identity crisis in the last decade or so. It seems they are desperate to look and act western. From the bleached hair, to the coloured contacts, and the ever increasing trend where asian women turn their backs on asian men and only want to date white guys.<br /><br />And here we have yet another movie which romanticises that, just like this years effort "The Quiet American" and countless others where asian women find love in the arms of some token white guy. A movie which increases the prejudice against asian men by asian women and in general.<br /><br />The basic plot of this movie is as follows: a Japanese wife gets bored and decides to run away from her husband by pretending she is kid-napped, ends up as a hostage in a robbery then falls in love with one of her captors, a big beefy Aussie bloke played by Russell Crowe. So they tear across the outback without a cause, where she bleaches her hair blonde and gets a pair of denim hot pants in a desperate attempt to "escape" the being asian.<br /><br />In the meantime, her spurned husband discovers the truth and heads out across the desert to reclaim his wife. One of the most disturbing scenes was where Crowe's father gives the Japanese husband a long, stupid and racist speech about karma and about "your little country with millions of little people" getting what it deserves.<br /><br />A stupid, pointless movie strictly for little asian women who sit at home and dream of their big tall white guy coming to take them away, and those who would be entertained by any of the trash that appears on TV.<br /><br />The ending is particularly disturbing, where everyone gets shot and dies... but nevertheless, Bonnie and Clyde this isn't. Russell Crowe is lucky this garbage didn't kill his career.
