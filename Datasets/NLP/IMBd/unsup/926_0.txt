Granted- I haven't seen this movie in quite some time- but I had to drop by and defend it's honor after reading some of the others reviews written about it. I once stumbled upon this movie, a couple years back, as a young teenager and adored it! In fact I am always checking to see if it comes on again but unfortunately I haven't been able to find it since. I remember that Rob Lowe played someone in debt to the Devil and fell in love with an Angel who was working in disguise as a waitress. There were many funny scenes and Michael York made a fanstastic Devil; they always filmed scenes with him after taking the usual 'express elevator' to Hell. Anyway, I believe - if I'm not mistaken - that the Angel's duty was to in fact 'save' him in the end. It was very touching and magical in a sense. If you do not expect more, than you will love it, just don't take things too seriously.
