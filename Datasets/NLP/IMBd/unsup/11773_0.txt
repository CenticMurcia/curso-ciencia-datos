MUTATOR aka TIME OF THE BEAST (1989) & PROJECT: METALBEAST aka METALBEAST (1995).<br /><br />Two *very* similar B-movies. A dubious choice for this double feature, perhaps. But I know I'm most definitely not the only one around here who would voluntarily watch rubbish like...<br /><br />-----<br /><br />For some reason, I always recalled some scenes from "Mutator" being from "Metalbeast". Both films are not worth this kind of confusion. Nevertheless, "Metalbeast" is *slightly* better (even if they're practically the same movie, with people just running around in a facility with some beast after them). A little bit more money was spent on the creature design, including make-up sfx for various stages of the transformation and animatronics in the head-piece of the final creature costume. The real werewolves from the opening scenes, seem styled after the ones from Joe Dante's "The Howling". To my knowledge, "Metalbeast" is the only movie ever to feature an, ehrr... mutant werewolf synthetically enhanced with metal skin, extendible / retractable steel claws and red-glowing eyes.<br /><br />Honestly, I like this movie.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Level of Appreciation: Moderate
