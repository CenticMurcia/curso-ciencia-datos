Let me preface this by saying that I would not ever have sought out this piece of garbage if I wasn't such a big fan of Ken Leung. I can't believe that intelligent people would actually think they'd be enlightened by this. This is liberal propaganda at its finest. The excessive nudity was put in place to shock the viewer or repeatedly try to drive its its liberal message home. The dialogue was awful although the performances of all the actors, especially Maggie Gyllenhaal was exceptional.<br /><br />My question is: would they have made this movie in Iran or Iraq where freedoms are truly limited? My guess is no. Only in America, would a film like this be aired and eventually circulated. I'm glad HBO pulled this nonsense off the air. It's not worth the time, energy or money spent.<br /><br />I would love to see a movie about how many innocent lives were SAVED as a result of the Patriot Act.<br /><br />God Bless America!
