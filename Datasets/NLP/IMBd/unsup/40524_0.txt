It is difficult to comprehend how such an appalling movie was made. My family sat there shaking their heads in disbelief as to what was unfurling before their eyes. How did Naomi Watts ever get herself involved in such an awful production.I have no idea what the German original was like but it had to be better than this. Presumably in an effort to inject poignancy and engender some sympathy for the victims the director applied static cameras concentrating on the contorted expressions of the suffering Watts and Roth.During one living room scene of more than 15 minutes the camera did not pan or zoom but on just one occasion moved six feet left. The action was so slow I thought the DVD had frozen. Ultimately you couldn't careless what happened to Watts and company and I still don't know what happened since it became so excruciating that I called a halt to proceedings with less than 10 minutes to go.
