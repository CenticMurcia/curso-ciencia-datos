And then pulled behind a wagon through a mile of cactus and dropped off a big cliff into a deep ravine full of giant man eating ants.<br /><br />This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen.<br /><br />Did anybody else mention the introduction scene for Kansas (Kurap, by far the lamest actor I have ever seen,) where we see three of his cards being a King, Queen and Jack of spades and he then calls out that he has a full house? They're showing us a straight flush and then.....ugghhhh. And the next scene is that horrible sword slashing thing. And then the lady with the dynamite on her belly, who cares? shoot her, it's not like that dynamite is gonna hurt you from that far away. What kind of idiot robs someone by strapping dynamite to yourself and then standing thirty feet away from them? <br /><br />They're trying to get us to believe that any of this could have happened in the American west of the past, when they can't even get us to believe that any of this could have happened at any time on the planet Earth. <br /><br />The worst acting<br /><br />The worst clothing (notice I don't call them costumes, because they didn't even attempt to make period clothing.) <br /><br />The worst directing<br /><br />the worst plot, dialogue, scene editing, music etc. HORRIBLE.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH, DO NOT WATCH, DO NOT WATCH!!!!!! <br /><br />I'm going to have to do a months worth of brain teezers just to gain back the IQ points I lost from watching the first quarter of this?
