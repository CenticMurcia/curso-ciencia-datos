This plot line is totally unbelievable- who would actually fall for this guy? I am sorry that I wasted ANY time on this made for tv movie. The only movie that I have seen that is worse stars Susan Lucci, and she can't act her way out of a paperbag, so that isn't saying much (French Silk). Anyway, DON"T see this.
