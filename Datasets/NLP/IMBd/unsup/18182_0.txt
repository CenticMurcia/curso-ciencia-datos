Milo Ventimiglia is actually NOT the star of the show. Which was a bummer cause he was the only household name in the credits. But people are knocking it a little dramatically. I saw this show when it first aired and it wasn't as bad as they make out to be. It was a little on the sexual side, but it wasn't "boring". I liked it. Maybe if it would of had a chance at a whole season things could of picked up. And about things being left opened and unsaid or whatever, that's what usually happens when a show gets canceled. They can't cram everything into one final hour, even though the audience expects them too. It's not bad, it's pretty good. There's somethings I didn't like about it, such as some of the pairings, but besides that it was pretty good.
