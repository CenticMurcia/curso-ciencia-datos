This spin from the Daily Show actually originally had another aim- Stephen Colbert wanted to imitate a guy on FOX NEWS known for the "No Spin" Zone. Unfortunatey the idea failed for some basic reasons.<br /><br />(1) Colbert is obviously a Democrat which shows quite quickly when you watch about 1 or 2 of these shows.<br /><br />(2) The "No Spin Zone" will attack Democrats & Republicans who do stupid things. Colbert is strictly hands off the Democrats.<br /><br />(3) The format got worn out very quickly when the Democrats took power, so the humor no longer takes chances or has a edge like when Bush & the Republicans had power.<br /><br />The word got out quickly as Comedy Central moved this & the Daily show to a less attractive time slot as soon as O'Bama took power. The gig is up, and that is THE WORD on Colbert.
