This was the most ridiculous piece of wasted media I have ever seen. Warner Bros. and DC comics should team up, and sue the writer/director of this garbage. Come to think of it, anyone who has ever been a fan of Batman, should sue this guy. First of all, he has Batman being felled by a scrawny junkie with a stun-gun and a well-placed kick to the Caped Crusader's groin. (I guess the old body armor doesn't extend south of the utility belt.) Then, the little thief chains up the Dark Knight, gets him hooked on heroin, and SODOMIZES him! Hey, guess someone finally found the secret entrance to the Batcave! (rimshot) The actors did what they could with really bad dialog, and I'm sure everyone worked really really hard to get the project done... But, why?
