Horses and Zac Efron, a match made in cinematic heaven, right? Oh, how you could not be more wrong. Although I find Zac Efron to be one of the hottest (if not the hottest) man on the planet, his perfect body and alluring charm did not even captivate me enough to keep my eyes open. From an equestrian's point of view, this movie was also terrible. The fact that it's impossible for someone to become a steeplechaser in several weeks makes the plot completely fallible (I've been riding for 7+ years and I am no where near ready, and I compete at 3'). Not to mention the plot already was completely predictable. But whatever. Apparently if you are a really hot, oppressed teenage boy whose parents want you to be a "real" athlete and play baseball, you can get on a horse (after falling more times than is really necessary, the horse was already trained and it was rearing/bucking? Come on. A horse does not need to gain "trust" necessarily for you to sit on its back), be jumping cross rails in a week (over and over, might I add, which proved absolutely nothing), and be steeple chasing in a few months. If you don't know what steeple chasing is, it's basically a race, but you jump. So a race with X amount of horses all jumping the same things at the same time going speeds that regular racehorses are at. Pretty much racing only 100x more dangerous. And it's definitely not Zac Efron jumping, obviously, since none of the camera angles are of his whole body during the entire race scene. Oh, and guess who wins?
