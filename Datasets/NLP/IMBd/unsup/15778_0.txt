Bookstore employee Virginia (Jenny Wright) reads a sick if oddly poetic horror story by an author named Malcolm Brand and in so doing resurrects the demented creep, who kills off real people in the same fashion as those in his book. Virginia has a tough time convincing anybody, starting with her detective boyfriend Richard (Clayton Rohner), that she's not just some fruitcake and that her information actually has merit.<br /><br />Genuinely interesting and rather imaginative terror film that could possibly satisfy both the audiences that desire creative writing and those who crave blood (even if the blood in this movie doesn't exactly look real). Well acted by Wright and Rohner, with some unfamiliar but competent players in the supporting cast, and featuring decent effects work and gore. Effects expert Randall William Cook himself plays the part of Brand and does a creditable job. Overall, "I, Madman" (named "Hardcover" in the theatrical trailer) is a reasonably impressive piece of work that I would recommend that others seek out.<br /><br />For once, this is a movie that doesn't show the gore merely for shock value but incorporates it as a necessary element to show the madness of the villain.<br /><br />Written by David Chaskin, whose credits also include the first "Nightmare on Elm Street" sequel.<br /><br />8/10
