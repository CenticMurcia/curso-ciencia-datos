Sci-Fi Original written and directed by Jason Bourque. Don't take over-seriously, but enjoy some decent special effects. A group of scientists on a top secret military base make a discovery that may even be bigger than the Atomic bomb. Code name Eruptor, a device that supercharges matter and changes its molecular structure of its target. The project malfunctions and a top notch scientist Daniel Gray(Stephen Baldwin)is personally effected by 'Dark Matter'...infected is more like it; and it allows him to at will change weather and surrounding atmosphere. This project also has the ability in the wrong hands threaten the entire world. Is Armageddon far away? <br /><br />Maybe guaranteed boredom. Baldwin shows effort, but just not enough to change this stinker. The cast also includes: Carrie Genzel, Gardiner Millar, Camille Sullivan and William B. Davis.
