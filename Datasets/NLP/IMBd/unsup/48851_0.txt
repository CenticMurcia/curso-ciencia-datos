I rented this movie because (a) I come from Orange County, CA, and (2) I wanted to see how Colin Hanks did in his first starring role. For the thirty or so minutes I could stand of this film, I thought Hanks did all right, as did Schuyler Fisk and some of the rest of the cast. Jack Black was passable, although perhaps he got better later in the movie.<br /><br />However, the writing and the characterizations were just dreck, the worst of TV sitcoms rolled up in a film canister. All of the supporting characters were one-dimensional (if there aren't any lower options), and only seemed somewhat familiar with human interaction on Planet Earth. As a result, situations that the writers must have thought hilarious turned out to be excruciating. I finally shut it down during the scene with Garry Marshall, after they were interrupted for the third time by some extremely contrived, embarrassing spectacles, culminating in Jack Black's entrance in his underwear. Maybe it becomes Citizen Kane from that point forward, but believe me, I don't care. I give it a 3 for continuity and the performances of Hanks and Fisk.
