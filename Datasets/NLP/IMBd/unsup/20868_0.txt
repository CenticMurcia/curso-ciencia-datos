Little Britain is the greatest show to come out of British television. The show follows the dysfunctional residents of Britain, in several different sketches over a current 22 episodes. A series 4 will not be out for at least 2 yeas though, as the guys have taken the show on the road, with Little Britain Live.<br /><br />The Characters include Vicky Pollard - Who has 6 kids to seven different men and follows her adventures through the show.<br /><br />Lou and Andy - Andy is in a wheelchair, but what Lou doesn't know, is that Andy is just lazy and has full use of his legs! <br /><br />Sebastian Love & The Prime Minister - Sebastian (the PM's Assistant) has a crush on the Prime Minister and Expresses it, yet the PM doesn't get the picture.<br /><br />Dafydd Thomas - The "Only Gay in The Village".<br /><br />Mrs. Emery - Let's be blunt - She pees a lot! Emily & Florence - Two very unconvincing "Ladies".<br /><br />Carol Beer - A Banker and A Travel Agent - The Computer always "Says NO"! <br /><br />Bubbles De Vere (and Desiree) - Bubbles is an extremely large woman - who is naked in every one of her scenes. Desiree is her ex-husband's new wife (series 3 only).<br /><br />Dudley & Ting Tong - Ting Tong is Dudley's new mail order "Bride".<br /><br />Marjorie Dawes - She takes the Fat Fighters classes.<br /><br />Mr. Mann, Roy and Margaret - Mr. Mann is quite picky in what he wants to buy from Roy, everything from a disappointed horse!<br /><br />That is only some of the great characters of the amazing show!
