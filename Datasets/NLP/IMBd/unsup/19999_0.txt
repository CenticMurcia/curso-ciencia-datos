** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /><br />Recap: So called explorers threaten to plunder and pillage the land were John Clayton, aka Tarxan, once was raised. He is summoned by a vision, leaves his fianc√© and returns to save his "home". The prize that everyone searches for are the lost legendary city of Opra. Now the explorer Nigel Ravens believe he has found the way. But Tarzan is determined to stop him. Matters become more complicated as Ravens has the technological edge and Jane Porter, Clayton's girlfriend, suddenly turns up.<br /><br />Comment: Boring and uneventful story. For the most part the most exciting event is Tarzan's trademark and ridiculous shout. At the end however the movie goes from dull and boring to pathetic, turning the story in another silly way using really bad computer graphics. Evidently some violence has been cut, the movie appears like a family movie, but there still are some violent moments, were people are killed (mostly off-screen though). Hmm... anything else? Nope, don't think so. You could probably find something better to watch or do...<br /><br />3/10
