Residents of a French village attempt to stop an American from using monkeys in place of human workers on his newly-acquired olive farm. Poor screenplay from G.K. Wilkinson's book "The Monkeys" actually wants us to sympathize with the land-owner, who should perhaps be forced to do his own olive picking! Forgettable Disney product with the expected slapstick interludes is well-made, if not fresh. OK performances by Dean Jones, Yvette Mimieux and wily Maurice Chevalier (in his final film), but the argument at the center of the story isn't expanded upon, and the romance which sketchily develops between Dean and Yvette seems like an afterthought as well. Obviously, this was aimed at a younger crowd, but why not give kids something to think about as well as to laugh at? *1/2 from ****
