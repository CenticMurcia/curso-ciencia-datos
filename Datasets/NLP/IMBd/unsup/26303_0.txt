Airwolf is a classic, action adventure with a great story, good actors and of course good effects. This is what I believe could be one of the best movies ever made for television. The idea of a supersonic helicopter with 14 firepower options and bulletproof body, just seem to go straight into people's hearts. The movie keeps us watching from start to end and that with great style. Airwolf is probably a drama as much as it's an action/adventure. The main character falls in love with a female CIA-agent that was working with the same global problem - recovering Airwolf from Libyan forces. The movie is full of good humor, thanks to Ernest Borgnine and the characters are strong and well simulated. The helicopter really is something, and the opening scene where they are introducing the chopper, is fantastic. Donald P. Bellisario is known for his creativity and he has created a lot of very good TV-series/TV-movies, but Airwolf is the best one of them - in my opinion. A highly recommended movie.<br /><br />JAH
