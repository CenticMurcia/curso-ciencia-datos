Eight years after the original 48 Hrs., this sequel was released. Nick Nolte reprises his role as Jack Cates. Of course Eddie Murphy also reprises his role as Reggie Hammond. Reggie is back in prison and Jack is still a cop. Jack has been after a drug dealer named the Ice Man. The film opens with some bikers murdering 2 cops and a bar tender. At a raceway Jack gets in a shootout with a couple of men and kills one of them. The other gets away and Jack finds a picture of Reggie that one of them dropped meaning there's a price on his head. Unfortunately no other gun is found at the scene so Jack's claim of self defense looks like it's BS.<br /><br />Jack then asks Reggie help him, but Reggie asks for the money Jack has been holding on to for him. Jack tells that he won't give him the money unless he helps him, but Reggie refuses. As Reggie is being released from prison on a bus, 2 of the bikers from the beginning start shooting at the bus causing it to tip over. This forces Reggie into the hospital, and Jack has the hospital release Reggie into his custody making them partners again. There are a lot of action scenes including several shootouts and a big bar fight. There are also lighter, funnier moments as well. The formula is very similar to the original, although it's not quite as good.<br /><br />I won't give away anything else in the movie. Overall this is an entertaining action-comedy and a worthy sequel to the classic original. Nolte and Murphy have good chemistry once again. If you liked the first 48 Hrs. then definitely give this a shot.
