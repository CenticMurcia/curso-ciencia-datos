This film is slow and boring and tries far too hard to be 'realistic'. The story of a guy obsessed with a girl and films her 24/7. Don't know about anyone else but I find no entertainment in watching someone sleep, brush their teeth, shower or do their housework; but whatever rocks your boat I guess. The film is mostly the main character, Ana doing everyday things viewed through something with the same resolution as a web cam. Watched for 5 minutes, fast forward, fast forward again, probably watched for 15 minutes total but feels like watched for 15 hours.<br /><br />Very little action, weak characters and the camera is irritating.
