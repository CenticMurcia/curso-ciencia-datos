Normally I don't comment on films, until now. In short, I've been a huge fan of Genre, Euro-Horror, Art House, Grind House, Underground, Independent, Low Budget, High Budget, basically all aspects of films. We all know that Euro-horror films tends to be misunderstood or not even taken seriously. This particular film is the essence to why Great Italian or Spainish thrillers are never taken Seriously. I Despise this film beyond belief!! Andrea Bianchi lost points in my book along with the cast, crew and producers and distributors of the Giallo genre. The lead character is PURE SLIME!! I wanted so badly to see him CASTRATED and Bled to DEATH! SLOWLY!!!!!! In short, this film is an INSULT to the better films by Argento, Fulci, et all. AAAHHHH, (SIGH) I feel better now. Please, some one, for the sake of quality Euro- Thrillers that deserve an audience. BURN EVERY COPY OF THIS CRAP!!!
