This is as the cover of the video says a romantic comedy. A fun movie that although it is not going to change the world gives you a moment away from the day's trials and tribulations. Isn't that the best thing that a movie can do? <br /><br />Jeremy Piven is a great comedian who can take any material and make it his, so any fan must see this movie. He and Ms. Fenn should make more movies together because their chemistry is right. This movie was made by men who have never before or since made another film. If I understand it correctly the producers are dentists who love movies and wanted to make this one based on their script. <br /><br />Rent it and share it with someone you love with popcorn.
