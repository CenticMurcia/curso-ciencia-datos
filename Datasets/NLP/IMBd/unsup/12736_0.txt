"The Secret of Roan Inish" is a film for those who want a taste of the Irish myth. It is wonderfully filmed and heartwarming in its characterization. The whole world revealed by director Sayles is enticing and intriguing magic. But it's believable magic in the way some life elements defy normal explanation. That's why this film stands out and apart from equally sweet tales like "Into the West".<br /><br />I warn you that it's old-fashioned storytelling. Its pace is slower than what most are accustomed to these days, but that doesn't mean it's boring. If you must have fantastic elements and don't like subtlety and family focus, this film isn't for you. But if you like rich and original old-style tales that make you feel good and happy to have heard them, see "The Secret of Roan Inish" and relish its perfection.
