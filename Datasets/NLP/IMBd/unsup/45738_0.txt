This movie is so so so so bad! I love watching movies, and I love most steven segal movies, and I mean most as I would have said all up to I saw this movie.<br /><br />This movie is rubbish<br /><br />Anyway, no use going over the plot because most of you people out there want to know whether the big man has any good fights. The answer is NO! You only get a few fight scenes at the end where the camera is so close you can't see any moves other than a flash of the hands or the feet.<br /><br />In fact, if you had never seen a steven segal movie before you would very much question whether he is doing any fighting in it as you couldn't tell whether it was really him fighting....oh what a sad day.<br /><br />I gave this movie 1 out of 10.<br /><br />btw; the dvd region 2 I saw was only pro logic just to add to the insult!
