This is so bad it isn't even funny. Their are some films that are so bad it's funny, but this is not one of those films. I really don't understand films like this and how they are even made! I hated every part of this embarrassing flick. I hate that all these sci-fi channel flicks are continuing to be made and people all hate them. Even the god awful blood effects are less than a mediocre video-game these days! It is truly awful in every respect. The pathetic acting, the story is non-existence, the idiot actors that dance around and try to act are just plain embarrassing! Financially I just don't have a clue what is trying to be accomplished by doing all these (Hell I won't even call it a B-movie because that would be a compliment) D movies in the first place! I feel sorry most of all for the lead actor Brad Johnson. It always makes me wonder how actors end up working for such crummy fare after working with, not just working, but being one of the main stars of a Steven Spielberg picture! (He starred alongside Richard Dreyfuss, Holly Hunter, and John Goodman in Spielberg's "Always.") I just can't understand how it happens that an even decent actor would attach his name to this pathetic attempt of a film! I can see the pitch,"Alright Brad want to be in a movie about a giant Crocodile, but the script is not really there, the effects are going to be laughable, and everyone involved are has beens. So want to do it?" Just for god's sake do not dare waste your time w/ this garbage or you will be sorry. Pointless, Pointless, Pointless is all I can say about this "MOVIE." I use that term extremely loosely.
