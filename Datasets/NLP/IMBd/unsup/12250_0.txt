The other night a friend stopped by with a copy of The Incorporated. I had never heard of it before and as there were no big names in it I was tempted to watch Seinfeld reruns instead. Wow. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not an independent film kind of guy. My interests usually lie in the big, Hollywood type films. But this was really good. It had as much action as some of the films I go to the theatre to see. Now my friend says I should see "Life is Beautiful." After hearing about it, I don't think I'm ready for that yet.
