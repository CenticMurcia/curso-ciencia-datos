I've bought PROFIT on DVD. Genius. I've bought THREE's COMPANY on DVD. Wonderful. I bought FREE ENTERPRISE on DVD. Fun All from the same video label. They put out THE GRAND and I bought it. It's easily the worst comedy ever made from an unfunny man named Zak Penn. Zak, please stay away form comedy as you're not talented at it. Stick to lousy comic books and filling in the dialog bubbles. Awful, awful, awful!!! You are not Christopher Guest. What are you trying to prove? Listen to the astute TV critics that scolded you and said funny was not in your DNA. You are not talented as far as humor. Stick to garbage comic books where the upside is spelling things correctly.
