Bernie believes in tough love and as long as the kids follow the rules, he'll always try to do the right thing, but sometimes Bernie's right thing is the wrong thing. Bernie's hilarious rules in the show were It's his house. Second rule: All the stuff in the house is his and no one touches anything without permission. That goes for the TV, the VCR, the DVD and especially Bernie's James Brown CD collection. The idea of the show was originally pitched to NBC, ABC, CBS and The WB put FOX got the show of course. Bernie Mac does a great job playing a TV uncle! Great!
