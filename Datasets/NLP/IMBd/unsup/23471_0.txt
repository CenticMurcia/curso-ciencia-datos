Wow! What a fun ride! Just as good as any breeder teen slasher flick. Fun Halloween setting in West Hollywood gives the perfect opportunity for four hot guys to be beheaded at the hands of a 'horny' devil. The film adds a love story to the mix that miraculously never turns saccharine. The story (what there is) is skillfully doled out to provide maximum tension, so don't worry why someone working in a police department is not a uniformed cop, all will be revealed by film's end. Those looking for substance over style should look elsewhere, but if a homo roller-coaster ride to fright-land is what your after, this flick is it.
