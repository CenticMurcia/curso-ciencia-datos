first off, I'd like to say that one of my favorite movies of all time is Abel Ferrara's _The Addiction_. I also loved _Bad Lieutenant_, and I'm a fan of William Gibson's writing. So, needless to say, I had high hopes for this film. The best excuse that I can make for this complete waste of time is that it was obviously low budget, since there are only about 50 minutes of unique footage, with the other 42 minutes being flashbacks of previous scenes (exaggeration? yes, but not by much.) So, without really analyzing the film (which I wouldn't do before I read the original 13 page William Gibson story, which incidentally has NO dialogue), I'd just like to cast my vote for using your 92 minutes wisely and viewing some of Ferrara's better films instead of this one. Or, go see some of Asia Argento's dad's films. You'll be happy you did.<br /><br />
