"42nd Street Forever" is a great compilation of vintage exploitation film trailers. This is back when b-films were delivered with lots of ballyhoo, and watching these today is still a lot of fun. Often, the trailers for these films were much better than the actual feature. Watching this collection only adds scores of films to my want list. The only depressing thing is a lot of films on hand here remain either unreleased in any commercial form or lost to time completely. Still, anyone who considers themselves a fan (or was interested after seeing the new Tarantino / Rodreiguez film "Grindhouse") of this kind of trash, the "42nd Street Forever" series comes highly recommended.
