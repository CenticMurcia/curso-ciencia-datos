Come on, you can do better than this. The first one great. The second was practically a copy cat. Think about it. He's alone. He gets discovered by the two criminals while he's out buying something. The person that becomes his friend was someone he was once terrified of. That person was separated from his/ her family. He completely defeats the two baddies. He is caught by them. His friend saves him. Meanwhile, at the family vacation site, the family is unsatisfied. They go home. It's too similar. If they really wanted to make a sequel, which I highly disagree with, at least they could of altered it. After all, sequels aren't meant to be copies of the first movie. But I must admit, the tricks he played on the bad guys, which was something that was actually different, were pretty funny and clever. I also liked how he fared in the Plaza Hotel. Smart guy. Any way, they shouldn't of copied the first movie so much. 4/10
