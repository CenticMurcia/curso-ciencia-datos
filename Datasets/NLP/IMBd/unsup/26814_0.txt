This is a wonderfully entertaining "mocku-u-mentary" by Peter Jackson (of LOTR and King Kong fame) and his friend Costa Botes.<br /><br />It is the story of a imaginary New Zeeland filmmaker named Colin McKenzie who, within the content of the movie, predated many of the cinematic history's great achievements.<br /><br />I understand this movie, when it aired on New Zeeland television, caused quite the commotion for being "false-thruth" proving how easily people can be misled by a convincing presentation and a documentary format. <br /><br />Not saying that the new Zealand audience in particular is easily misled, i think any nationality would have been fooled. I have even seen worse examples here in Sweden<br /><br />Though one factual error actually caught my attention, when Colin is filming the first airplane flight they use "digital-enhancement" to check the date on the mans newspaper.<br /><br />In any case it is a highly interesting film featuring many impressing names sharing the hoax and i would recommend it to anyone with a interest in either movies or Peter Jacksons Pre-LOTR career in particular.<br /><br />That sort of digital enhancement would be, to my knowledge, impossible with a film of that age.
