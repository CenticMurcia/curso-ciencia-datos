I saw this movie when I was in the army back in the 1970s. Along with Murder on the Orient Express and Cactus Flower, this is the only other movie I ever walked out of the theater on. My wife came with me to see the movie for something to do. She agreed that it sucked and that we should leave the theater, to do more important things, such as watch the linoleum curl on the kitchen floor. Hey, at least that had some suspense in it. Do yourself a favor, and rent Road Trip or Harold and Kumar instead, they were funny and entertaining, this was artsy stupid crap. Since I have nothing else to say and there is a ten line minimum, I just want to say that this thing stunk.
