A gem of a series which despite the great scripting and the talent involved, failed to catch on.<br /><br />Everything takes place when 'Frank Nolan' (Jack Coleman) and 'Fay Perovnic' (Lindsay Frost) find themselves in a strange café after dying on the same night and in the same river as each other. The mysterious owner, 'Blackie' (Robert Englund) gives them a second chance to correct all the blunders they have made in life and as a result of their success, lets them stay on as the new cook and waitress at the café.<br /><br />The café serves as both a central location for the action and as a plot catalyst, primarily by exerting its influence upon each episode's protagonists, or antagonists, to bring them into contact with the regulars. Aside from transporting itself from place to place in its entirety, once settled, it can also create portals between itself and various locations, which are traversed (often unexpectedly on the whim of the café) by crossing the threshold of one of the café's many doorways. These portals are not restricted to the Earth, the café can also travel to outer space and, apparently, even heaven, which hints at a supernatural origin.<br /><br />The café also has the ability to make both idle and heartfelt wishes come true, which of course are not always what the recipient actually wants or needs, and the café seems to take a perverse delight in "misinterpreting" such wishes. Frank and Fay often take advantage of this ability by wishing themselves from place to place, when this occurs, or when the café otherwise deems it important, those remaining in the dining room can watch the exploits of their companions on the (sometimes interactive) television set mounted in the far wall.<br /><br />Of the cast, Robert Englund (better known to the public as 'Freddy Kruger') was the stand out. Blackie was a creepy, sarcastic know-it-all but Englund's portrayal of him gave you no reason to dislike him. Jack Coleman was terrific as Frank, looking past his facetious manner you can see deep down he is a warm hearted guy. Lindsay Frost's insecure Fay made a big impression on yours truly, mainly because of the waitress' outfit.<br /><br />As I said, with the show's cast and excellent scripts by Wes Craven and Thomas Baum etc, its a travesty that 'Nightmare Cafe' only lasted for six episodes. Was it too clever for some viewers? Who knows? I enjoyed it thoroughly, and so will you if you manage to see it.
