Normally speaking, the name Edgar Ulmer conjures up the idea of a good, solid film made on a shoestring budget. That was the tough part of working on Poverty Row during Hollywood's Golden Age. <br /><br />I say normally speaking because Ulmer missed this one completely. He was undone by a lousy storyline and a humdrum script, and by enough plot contrivances to sink several pictures. Sorry to see Warren William down on his luck or out of money, but he turns in a better-than-routine performance in a thankless role. Jimmy Lydon also passes muster, and his career was such that he took whatever was offered after a good run in the Henry Aldrich series.<br /><br />Anyone looking for a recommendation for Strange Illusion must look elsewhere as I feel it lacked plausibility and clarity. I think the fan base overrated this one.
