As it appeared with the outcome of the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" series to date is that it's capability of maintaining it's stability as an effective franchise decreased more and more with each film. Where the original took horror to a new, edgy level, the follow-up took the turn into comedy, yet this third installment merely set up a similar, yet bland premise, that really isn't worth more than brief, mild entertainment. Following a near deadly encounter with the demented attendant of a remote country gas station, two road-tripping friends find themselves hunted in the dead of night down a long stretch of backwoods road. After being run off the road by a mysterious monster truck, the helpless duo are pursued by a familiar chainsaw wielding madman and soon stumble across a prominent hunter (played by Ken Foree) who assists them. The terror doesn't end there, as they later find themselves captive in the new Sawyer family's residence for a night of sadistic torment. Compared to the splatter-fest "part two", the gore factor of this movie is nothing to write home about. Aside from the weak-ass cannibal family, and the Leatherface acting like an overgrown teenager, the film itself moves along at an alarming pace that left me feeling unfulfilled, in a sense. The on-screen mayhem is minimal and forgettable and just plain disappointing. Not a good addition to the series...
