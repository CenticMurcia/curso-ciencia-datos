For a first film, this shows a great deal of visual confidence. The subject matter, about the treatment of women in Taliban-era Afghanistan is, of necessity, depressing. This is a bleak, despairing film about unrelenting oppression, told with a chilling beauty, and blessed with an even, steady gaze at one of the most brutal regimes of recent times.
