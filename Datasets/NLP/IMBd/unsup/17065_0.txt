Howard Hawks was completely on top of his game when he shot this film. It is an enduring, eternal film classic.<br /><br />He took an already popular story, "The Front Page", and fixed it by creating the female Hildy. This came about during a party, at which Hawks, holding forth, was going to have the party goers read "The Front Page" for a lark. So he hands around the scripts, and discovers there aren't enough men. A woman gets the Hildy part.<br /><br />And the rest, movie-lovers, is Cinema History. What a master stroke!<br /><br />Great casting! Great acting! Great direction, and photography! Great screenplay that nicely serves up Big City Corruption and dances around the unscrupulous abuse of 1st Amendment freedoms by the Press.<br /><br />All with taste, artistic and noble. And unbelievably funny throughout.<br /><br />Perfect.
