Somebody took the money and ran. C. Thomas Howell, Stella Stevens, Martin Kove and Andrew Pine put forth a minute portion of their abilities and compete with what looks like blow-up plastic ants the size of a house cat. Of course, an experiment goes wrong and giant genetically-engineered ants become out of control in search of human flesh. A small group of folks happen to be in a skyscraper on a Saturday afternoon and become the prey of these overgrown blood-thirsty insects. Howell tries to play so laid-back its pathetic. And Miss Stevens, the once sexy knockout...becomes stuffy and guilty of bad over-acting. Here is another case of the DVD package being more interesting than the movie.
