Today I had the pleasure of screening this film for an upcoming film fest. We are in the proses of picking films and I have watched many duds. This one I through in with no idea what I was watching and was amazed. The story was a lot of fun. The characters very natural and well acted. The script also natural and witty. The Directing was great. The production value was better than most Hollywood family films. A lot of people will compare this to such films as spy kids or catch that kid but this one has far more real characters. It is not a totally clean G rated film it defiantly hits a PG mark but in the same way that Second hand lions did for some realistic fist fights as well as a few people shot. If I have my why this will head up the family portion of our festival.
