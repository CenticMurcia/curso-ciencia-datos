One of the "sweded" films in Be Kind Rewind, this starts out as a ripoff of King Kong, then switches to a Tarzan movie as Johnny (Danny Lee) discovers Samantha (Evelyne Kraft), an absolutely gorgeous babe that was raised by The Peking Man after her parents died in a plane crash.<br /><br />Just like Tarzan, she talks to the animals, all except for a snake that bit her on the thigh, necessitating Johnny sucking the venom out very close to the jungle treasure. Of course, Peking Man arrives with special leaves that Johnny crushes up and applies to the wound. Miraculous! We go back to King Kong and Tarzan in Hong Kong, as they transport the Peking Man to the city. You can imagine the carnage as The Peking Man becomes Godzilla-like after he sees Samantha being raped (not really, it's PG-13).<br /><br />Only Quentin Tarantino can bring us this much fun.
