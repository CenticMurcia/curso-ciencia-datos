Classic adult feature with the legendary Kay Parker and Mike Ranger (as the stud, her son). They just don't make'm like this anymore. Good interesting story along with some pretty intense action. Not by the new millennium standards (action wise), but great acting and a story to go along with it.<br /><br />**** out of a possible ****, rent it or buy it wherever you can find it. Availible in a recently remastered DVD version. This even has an audio commentary by Kay Parker, which is pretty great to listen to. An also excellent sequel was made a year or so after this one,aptly titled, Taboo II. Which once again starred Kay Parker,in a smaller, less meatier role, although she still played the same character as in the first.
