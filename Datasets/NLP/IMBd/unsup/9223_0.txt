i liked the movie and think it was well done. it was not so much about anarchy as it was about the rite of passage into adulthood of one kid. the anarchy and nihilism were just backdrops. the film did a nice job of depicting the journey, the coming of age process, that the main character goes through. puck had a history of being a part of one group or another, and he was very comfortable as part of this anarchist collective. the movie depicts his personal growth, how he begins to reflect and think for himself and become discontent with the collective. he takes a few tentative steps away from the group, and returns - after coming up against challenges when he strikes out on his own or gets pulled back in by other members. finally when it comes down to the line, a crisis situation that is going to affect the rest of his life, he grows into his own skin and decisively chooses his own path.
