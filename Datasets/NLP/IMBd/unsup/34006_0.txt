Blasphemy! That's all that can be said about this film! This shouldn't even be considered a sequel to the Exorcist as they are two completely different films that have completely different directions. T<br /><br />he only thing they share is Linda Blair (who I don't mind saying has 'grown up' a little more in this one! BOINGGG!) who reprises her character of Regan McNeil. <br /><br />And what's the deal with that brain synchronisation machine? Who thought of that? James Earl Jones lends his powerful presence to the proceedings but doesn't really do anything. Avoid if you want a horror movie, I don't know what it is, but it ain't horror!
