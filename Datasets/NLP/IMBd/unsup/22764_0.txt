Frankly, I don't understand the people who reviewed this film as terrible. This movie is not one of the greats that will go down in history, but it is certainly not terrible. In my opinion, if you like the genre, you should like this movie. In addition, if you enjoy searching out inter-movie references, you should enjoy this movie. There are many scenes obviously intended to be homages to other well known action films. The characters are shallow compared to some of the messages the film seems to wish to convey, but the film is fast-paced entertainment that has plenty for fans of "run and gun" movies.<br /><br />I rate this movie 8/10 in it's genre.
