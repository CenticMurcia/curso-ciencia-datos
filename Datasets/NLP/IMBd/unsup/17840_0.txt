I hope the actors in this film kept their day jobs before going into acting because they put forth the worst effort I've ever seen. The screenplay made little to no sense from the beginning to the very end. The dialogue was confusing in that most of the time what one person was saying had nothing to do with what another was saying.<br /><br />The director should be shot. You can blame the actors for sucking, but you can also blame the director for not doing anything about it. You can also blame the producers for not realizing that toilet paper is worth more than that script.<br /><br />The story begins with two strong men looking through a warehouse for Jack, who owes them money. The warehouse is filled with empty boxes and plastic wrap. The guys find Jack asleep. They hit him a few times, then inject what one can only guess is speed into his neck in an attempt to kill him. The movie would've been a lot better had he died and the ending credits rolled. Instead, he awoke, picked up a jackhammer and drilled the first's face in. In the process, accidentally showing that at least one person involved on this film knows what he's doing. And that's the props guy. The blood and gore, although unrealistically excessive and unnecessary, looks realistic. Now, don't get me wrong  the death scenes are unimaginable, and the amount of blood was impossibly copious from certain wounds. And the lack of bones raised a question mark.<br /><br />The death scenes are indeed questionable, and tend to be laughable. There's one where Jack takes the jackhammer to a guy's shoulder, and that kills him. How? We'll never know.<br /><br />After the first scene, we go back in time to sort of show how Jack got to that point. Jack's friend overdoses, and Jack flees. Then Jack loses his job and becomes a junkie, and he can't pay for his fixes. That's it. Then it goes to the first scene, and we watch that again. Then we watch Jack kill more people. The best part of the movie is the ending credits.<br /><br />Just so you know, almost every character takes off his or her shirt at least once in the film. Don't get too excited: there are only three girls, and one of them stays clothed, but the female nudity is within the first twenty minutes, so there's time to watch it and shut it off, which is probably your best bet if you're looking for a nipple shot.<br /><br />Watch for parts that don't make sense if you do in fact take the lesser chosen path, and watch the film. Notice that in a series of death scenes in the same room all take place in a curiously clean space, even though someone died brutally in the same spot not five minutes before.<br /><br />The ending was far from surprising, and the only part not expected was that it does not in fact end. It's around ninety minutes, but it feels like a lifetime. The ending leaves hints of a sequel, and that's the scariest part of the movie  realizing that the idiots who made this just might make another and another and turn it into a franchise.<br /><br />Final grade  0.5/10
