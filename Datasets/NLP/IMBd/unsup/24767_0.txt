What a treat to watch. Having recently portrayed the role of Mr. Whiteside in a local civic theatre production, I was reluctant to view the movie beforehand, so that I might give the pompous "Babys Breath" my own take. I am proud to report that as much as a a non professional can, I approached the character much like Mr. Lane did.(Only with a bit more heavy handed shouting)Jean Smart is always a treat to watch in anything she does, and I agree, that the role of Banjo was handled with the appropriate lunacy. Also excellent was Harriet Harris. She was able to convey the intimacy that comes from years of being someones right hand, and then to lose that when you have been sidelined by that very same person. It is a wonderful movie to watch. And one of my most favorite roles on stage.
