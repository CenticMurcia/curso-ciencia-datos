I'm no ultra hard-core batfan, but love Batman I do. This film just left me feeling a little sick.<br /><br />I heard about this from someone who was drunk at the time, and expected some sort of satire. At first, with such horrendous acting and Bats getting crotch-zapped (while wearing a rubber suit?) there was no way this wasn't a joke.<br /><br />As it became clearer that they were honest to goodness serious, everything just got confusing. There's so many ridiculous plot holes that I won't even go into them, but the director seemed to address a few of them by simply having the junkie protagonist or antagonist or whatever he was supposed to be make mention of them. "How ironic that it was I and not the Joker to catch you." "You're not trying very hard to escape, master escape artist." The contradiction of Bats's basest character elements is never explained further than that.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of rape in general, but seeing it happen to Batman, and especially in such an irrelevant and syntax-lacking way, is something to shake you. It's like seeing Mr. Rogers, or the Power Rangers, or the Street Sharks, or whomever your childhood heroes may be getting...well, getting raped, I guess. And it begs the question (particularly being that this is a "fan" video) who walks around daydreaming about what it would be like if Batman got raped? Why was this thought in place? This was 28 minutes of my life lost. I wish I could explain that in clich√©d heroin metaphors.
