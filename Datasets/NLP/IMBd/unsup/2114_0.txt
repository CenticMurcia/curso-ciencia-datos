I was entertained by this movie, and I wouldn't call it biblically "incorrect," but biblically "incomplete." The movie fails to include one of the most important parts of the story, which is included in the Seder service for Passover, which Jews celebrate every year: after the Hebrew people were freed, and they are in the midst of their rejoicing, God basically yells at them and says "How can you be joyous when my children have died?" This acknowledgement of the loss that the Egyptians experienced is a really important part of the story, but it was fairly irrelevant in the context of the movie. The songs were sometimes unnecessary, but overall better than I expected them to be. One to see, (mainly for the graphical excellence), but there are better animated films out there.
