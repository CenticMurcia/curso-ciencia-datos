What we have here is not a failure to communicate. And what we have here, more to the point - is not a movie.<br /><br />Therefore, there is no point to hiring names to spout fact and opinion in this thing, "movie". I don't believe I've ever seen such a terrible waste of talent (the poor neglected actors). This "thing" is a history lesson, with an after dinner philosophy mint (stale at that) and a dramatic ending pasted on the last four minutes. But it ain't a movie. It wasn't a drama, as suggested in category, but the last freeze frame qualified it as a comedy for me - John Malchovich's frozen face of shock, credits roll...I couldn't stop laughing, went out on the back deck, and told my husband "I just saw the worst movie I think I've ever seen".
