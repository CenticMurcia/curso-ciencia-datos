Haunting, taut and dark is this story of conjoined twins played by real life identical twins Michael and Mark Polish. Michael directs and shares writing credit with Mark. These shy conjoined twins temporarily are living in a run down hotel as they summon the courage to reunite with their estranged mother(Lesley Ann Warren). A homeless hooker named Penny(Michele Hick)finds herself befriending the Falls brothers. They wander outside the apartment to attend a Halloween party with Penny pretending to be wearing a "Siamese Twin" costume. Blake(Mark Polish)tends to his sick brother Francis(Michael Polish)and tries to interpret his mixed feelings toward the thought of losing his sibling. Then to complicate matters more is the relationship developing between himself and Penny. Albeit a strange story, it is well acted. Others in the cast: Patrick Bauchau, Garrett Morris, William Katt and Teresa Hill.
