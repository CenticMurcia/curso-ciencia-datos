Set in a small New Mexico village, this is a classic 'noir' tale of two rival nightclub entertainers, an escaped black leopard, and a serial killer. By today's standards, the plot is predictable and you'll figure out who the killer is early on, but there is till much to enjoy-great black&white photography, neat camera angles, and at least one chilling scene...the blood of the young girl seeping under the door, while her mother and brother stand by helplessly. Worthy of note is the lack of visuals concerning the actual murders...rarely do we see the cat or the killer. Considered a classic in its time, this one stayed around the theatre circuit for over a decade.
