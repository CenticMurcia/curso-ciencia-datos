Black street dramas, like Clockers & Boyz In The Hood, are made to raise awareness about the atrocities that happen everyday to young black youths. Whiteboyz is about three white boys who want to lead that life so bad that they dress, act and talk like they see on the movies and in rap videos. The idea of white males pretending they're black could have been funny if they had tried a This Is Spinal Tap approach to the film. Instead they take every cliche out of black street dramas, but because they're white and because it's set in the ridiculous setting of Iowa (no offense to you Iowonians) they slap a comedy label on it.<br /><br />However, there is nothing funny about this movie. The group of white kids at like they think black kids act. When young black men finally enter the picture (in real life that is, not fantasies) they act nothing like that. Eugene Byrd plays Khalid (one of the only actors to leave this movie with some dignity) a young black man ready to start law school that is if he can stay out of the trouble the white boyz are looking for. The three want him to introduce them to Chicago drug dealers to set up a Iowa connection. The result of which is bloody.<br /><br />I was actually angered while watching this movie, not at society (like with Do The Right Thing) but with the filmmakers themselves. This material is not funny at all. It's like a person telling a joke and gets the entire thing wrong, then can't remember the punchline. This movie just drags on and on which is not good since it's only 88 minutes.<br /><br />This not only the worst excuse for a comedy I've ever seen, but one of the worst films I've ever seen. zero stars out of ****<br /><br />David W.
