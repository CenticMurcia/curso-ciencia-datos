Man, what a time to grow up! The 1980's were a fabulous time for, not only, music, and films, but television as well. There was no better television station in the 1980's than The USA Network! USA "Up All Night" was amazing! Since I was too young to really go out, and party, in the late 1980's and early 1990's, I would sit at home, or at a friends house and watch this show every weekend. I loved how atrocious the 'B' movies were, and the hilarious comments both Gilbert Godfried and Rhonda Shear used to make about the film.<br /><br />USA's late night television blocks were AMAZING on weekends. I can vividly remember getting excited, every Saturday, from about 1988-1993, to watch The USA Network from 8PM until, at least 3AM.<br /><br />As a teenager that loved horror films, what could've been better than USA's Saturday Nightmares block (8PM-11PM) and then, USA "Up All Night" which ran from 11PM-3AM. Blood and guts from 8-11 and T&A from 11PM-3AM, what could've been better for a 13 year old guy? LOL! Unfortunately, The USA Network, like many other television stations, has gotten stale, and play many syndicated television shows, which are boring as hell. I will never forget all of the great childhood memories, I received from The USA Network from 1987 until 1993.<br /><br />If there could only be a "USA Network Classic" channel created, that could run these old shows, in their original form, including retro USA bumpers. Shows like "Night Flight", "Up All Night", "Saturday Nightmares", and "Commander USA's Groovy Movies" that would kick some serious ass!
