I read pretty much comments here and most of them found the sixth installment of Harry Potter for "beautiful", "dark", "mature", "great adventure", etc.<br /><br />Well, people, I totally disagree. I am fan of the books, so it's not the Harry Potter universe - it's just the movie - which went terribly wrong.<br /><br />First let's see what we had in the book - two amazing and breath-taking battles - one around the Ron's house and the second at the end of Hogwarts. We have very dark atmosphere, some evil plans, a lot of Snape and Slughorn, a lot of Snape's story and most important - a lot of the book of the Half-Blood Prince. Let's don't forget the unforgettable funeral at the end of the book and the nice time spent in the book with that particular hero.<br /><br />What we saw in the movie was a total disaster. The characters were playing like some idiots at 50% of the time, because of the incredibly stupid script, which focused on the Ron's and Hermione's love story and their personal problems. I admit there is such a story in the book, but hey - it's not the core of the Half-Blood Prince. We receive almost noting from Snape, almost no Quidditch. The first battle is around 1 minute and shows just NOTHING! The second battle is more interesting, because it's just MISSING.<br /><br />All scenes shown in the film are half-made, the whole script is half- made, the music which used to be heart-melting is awful, the whole action has been cut, all the important parts of the story are missing (the evil plans, Ministry of Magic involvement and the new Minister, the Aurors and much much much more). The only thing you get is the story about the horcruxes. In fact - the film uses 1/3 of the book - that 1/3 that every other director and writer would cut from the script. On the theater's exits most of the people was still wondering what was the Half-Blood Prince, why is that name, what is the story, and all that kind of stuff. The phrase "What just happened?" was almost everywhere.<br /><br />In this film happens nothing. I believe they left some for the first part of the Deadly Hallows, but then again this sixth movie was completely unnecessary and pointless.<br /><br />If this director and this writer are involved in the last two movies, no one of the true fans will watch that crap. Be sure of that.
