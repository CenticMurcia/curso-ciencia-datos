This was such a great little movie. Peter O'Tool was perfect in what was to become one of his last great roles. I wonder why more people haven't seen this movie. I wonder why O'Tool doesn't get more interesting parts these days. This year O'Tool was just fine in "Troy" however, that wasn't a very special film. "My Favorite Year" was though. It wonderfully recreated 1954 and was filled with many touching and funny moments. For some reason this movie reminds me of some of th period Woody Allen movies from this time such as Radio Days, Purlple Rose of Ciro, ect. I just wish Woody would make another movie w/ the great O'Tool visa vie- "What's new Pussycat", but I sappose that's a pipe dream. Maybe Woody and or O'Tool read this and get an idea. God knows they both need to boost their movie hype....come on guys get this guy into a good movie before it's too late.
