When I first viewed this TV concert in 1972 I thought it the best TV concert ever. Nothing in the intervening 28 years has done anything to change my mind. Liza and director-choreographer Bob Fosse are at the peak of their respective careers and it shows in this luminous performance. I still hope for its return to video in some format.
