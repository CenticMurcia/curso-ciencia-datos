"The Insider" is a masterpiece.I only saw it because Al Pacino was in it;the theme really wasn't very interesting for me(I though that was the usual "political-correct" film against tobacco),but then came the big (big!) surprise;I found myself seeing an incredible good film.It has wonderful performances by(of course)Al Pacino ,Russel Crow,Christopher Plummer and Diane Venora.It's one of that strange cases when the theme of the film isn't very interesting , but the film is so well made that you enjoy it like if it would have the most interesting theme possible.Michael Mann shows that is one of the best directors;making an absolutely absorbing film ,starting with a non much interesting theme ;it has nearly hypnotic moments (the most of them when Al Pacino and Russel Crow are having a phone conversation).It's so absorbing that the 2 hours and a half of it seems like lees than 1 hour.I can't say what's the best thing the film has,why?;because it's all;the performances, the dialogues,the locations (with incredible shadows and lights in everyone),the direction,etc.So, if you want to see one of the best films (if not the best )of 1999,see this masterpiece.
