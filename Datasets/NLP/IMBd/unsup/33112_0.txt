When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was excited. Some of my all time favourite Aussie comedians in one film together, with an intriguing premise of a mature aged boy band. Unfortunately nothing is really built from this premise. <br /><br />BoyTown comes out as a convoluted mess that can't decide on a style, with jokes and a 'story' that is predicable and the worst ending in film history. BoyTown jumps between being a normal film, a behind the music documentary, and a fly on the wall documentary which ends up only confusing the audience. The documentary parts either do nothing but tell us information that we already have and the fly on the wall documentary only serves to set up the joke for the films ending which is just slapped on leaving many things unresolved and was a poor excuse to think up a proper ending.<br /><br />There really isn't much character development at all. Any evidence of a proper story is left for the last 20 minutes of the film and is so obvious that the audience knows exactly what is going to happen in the first ten minutes. The only laughable thing about this film is that the ffc funded such an unsatisfying stupid film whilst films like 'Kenny' have to struggle to find finance themselves. No wonder the Australian Film Industry gets such a bad rap with films like BoyTown.
