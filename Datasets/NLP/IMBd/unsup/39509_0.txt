This movie is just really pathetic. It has a weak story and gets exceedingly cheesy at times. Even the most average of Disney films is many times better than this mess. It's hard to imagine that the same man who did the wonderful Secret of Nimh also did this piece of trash. While the Secret of Nimh was exceptionally animated and had vibrant colors, this had poor animation and very weak colors. The villain was also one of the weakest I've ever seen. The attempts at humor are pathetic and an insult to the audience's intelligence. This is possibly Bluth at his worst, although it's a toss up between this and A Troll in Central Park.
