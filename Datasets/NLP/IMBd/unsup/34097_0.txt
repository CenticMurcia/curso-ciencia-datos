I could not believe i wasted 1.30 minutes for this wacky movie!!!the director of this movie tries his best to make a good statement about the contemporary sensitive issue in Korean society- plastic surgery however,what i see in the movie is an unconvincing script, illogical character development...I think we all have noticed about the famous die-at-the-end trend in Korean movie. This movie follows blindly to that trend and makes the main character die in the most unreasonable, stupid way that i have never seen in my life. The main character just die because the film need him to die at the end in order to continue the stupid script,if he's still alive, audience will not cry and the movie will not have the strong impact on audience. I believe that was what the director of this movie thought! Believe me, i have seen many bad Korean movies and i still accept it if it can help me chase my boredom for a while,but this movie is just nonsensical, it makes me wonder how can a director can make a movie this bad! Does he know what make sense and what does not?! For those who are curious about this movie, please FIND ANOTHER MOVIE TO WATCH, DON'T TOUCH THIS CRAP!!!<br /><br />By the way, I could not believe in my eyes when u guys rate this movie 7.5 stars. Oh gosh...what's so wrong with people!!!
