Yet another strong Season 3 entry.<br /><br />The reason why this episode worked so well was because of the solid writing. The dialog stayed sharp and amusing. <br /><br />But, it also worked as a scare episode. it wasn't really creepy, but some scenes did work as a nice, gory episode. My favorite being the scene diver. Which was also a pretty humorous scene that scene included the two weedheads from 'War Of Coprophages'. <br /><br />My favorite scene of the entire episode was definitely after Mulder ans Scully sank and got stuck up on a rock. That particular scene is what makes this episode so memorable. Some excellent interaction between those two. the funniest bit was when they got rescued and they realized how close they were to the shore. Hilarious. <br /><br />I liked the alligator twist, and that there WAS a Big Blue there as well. it could have gone either way and I would've been happy. but they took both ways. <br /><br />This episode deserves FOUR stars. Poor Queequeg though.
