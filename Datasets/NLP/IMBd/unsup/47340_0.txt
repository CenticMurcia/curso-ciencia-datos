This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. First of all if it was supposed to be a tribute to Tod Browning's Freaks then I would feel like I had been slapped in the face. The acting was terrible! The story line is completely lame. I was excited when I heard the movie had been banned in 43 countries; this prompted me to rent the film. I was looking for some kind of spark in the film... the only shocking moment in the film was the single torture scene which to my notion is the only real acting in the film. I will say the last scene in the movie is the most brutal I have ever viewed and say I am still wondering if that whole scene was performed on an actual human being. No offense to anyone involved in the film, just not my cup of tea.<br /><br />I give it a 0 for acting scale 3 for story line 10 for gross out factor. <br /><br />If you like pointless suspense, poor acting, and one gory scene you will love this film.
