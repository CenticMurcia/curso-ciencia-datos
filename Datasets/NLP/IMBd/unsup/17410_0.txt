This movie is meant to relax the tensions built up in the dutch society between the 'natives' and the immigrants, in this case Marrocans.<br /><br />The story revolves around a Marrocan family which tries to start over their lives in the Nethelands with all cultural differences and prejudices depicted with a comical note to it. This film was well received for both audiences, dutch and immigrants.<br /><br />The intro movie was hilarious, but the more the movie advanced, so did the seriousness of the story. I liked this one, but I still miss the artisticness that some of the French or Japanese movies have. It seems that every movie to come out of Holland must have a comic tone to it to make it more acceptable for the masses.
