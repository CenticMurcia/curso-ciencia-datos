I can't tell if this movie was meant to be a comedy or not, but it sure turned out that way. Thsi movie is utterly hilarious. Take every cliche about kung-fu movies and multiply it by ten. Gallons of fake blood, evil Japanese stereotype, the "soul brother" black guy, it's all there, plus things I've NEVER seen in a kung-fu movie. Tree-fu, SAPLING-FU, and spitting water instead of blood, for instance. It's only because everything is SO bad in this movie that makes it so entertaining. I especially LOVE the Boss-ninja's black mask with the crooked eye- holes.<br /><br />It's a toss-up between The Story of Ricky and this one as my all time favorite (unintentionally) funny kung-fu movie, but this one I think takes the prize.
