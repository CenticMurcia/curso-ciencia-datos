This movie was Fantastic with Michael Madsen and Dennis hopper. The story is great,Excellent Action,Great Sex, I without a Doubt Loved this movie Because I love Michael Madsen He is the greatest Actor Ever! Especially In Reservoir Dogs Which I loved! It was Sad to see his character Die. Ed Anders Directing is Superb with Michael Roberts and Charles Durning. I loved the sex scene seeing her wonderful tits and ass. The shootouts were Fantastic with blood and Gore I love violence more than anything If you see this one buy it immediately Whatever the price mine cost $14.95 trust me its worth every penny of your money if you loved this one then you will love Jason goes to Hell which I loved it was fantastic
