Staying right with the third installation's method of haphazardly taping together some goofy, inconsequential plot out of a few recent horror flicks (this time Saw, Grudge, and Village get the honors) to produce yet another stagnant parody that produces yet another few hilarious moments. The funniest moments come from unexpected twists..when a certain movie is hilariously and unexpectedly ridiculed or when the current antics of one certain galaxy translating, love crazed megastar are exploited, but as usual these end up being the exception to the stale, repetitive humor. Unfortunately, those with a thirst for the underperformed slapstick genre have little else to do but sift through the few gems found here in the meantime that these types of comedies simply do not get made with the same respect that they used to be.
