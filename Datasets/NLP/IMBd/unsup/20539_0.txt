Created by Glen A.Larson and Lou Shaw Quincy is the all about the daily life of the Coroners office in Los Angeles.<br /><br />It revolves around the Coroner Dr.R.Quincy(Jack Klugman)and how each week he does an autopsy which will lead him somehow to take on a particular hot topic at the time.His list of one man wars include alcoholism,mugging,punks,Vietnam vets,gangs,medical insurance as well as diseases and murders.<br /><br />Quincys aided in his work by his loyal assistant and friend Sam Fujiyama(Robert Ito),his long suffering,fair and hardworking boss Dr.Robert Astin(John S.Ragin),tough Police Lt.Frank Monaghan,his partner Sgt Brill(Joseph Roman)and owner of the groups favorite restaurant Danny's,Danny Tovo(Val Bisoglio).<br /><br />I've been watching this as it's rerun here on ITV3 and am really getting into it.It's CSI before CSI and in my opinion better because it's a very human series not all about hi tech equipment and explosions.Plus every episode is about something important like cancer treatment,abuse,alcoholism etc and tackles the subjects head on.The autopsy scenes are good as well because you don't see the bodies you just see the top half of Quincy and Sam and get Quincys description of what's happening.I think that's great because what you imagine can be ten times worse than what your shown in graphic detail.<br /><br />Jack Klugmans excellent as the coroner with an axe to grind and there's fine support from John S.Ragin and Robert Ito.It always makes me laugh though when instead of just doing autopsies he'll investigate and solve the case the detectives never solve it and I think in one episode Monaghan says Quincy should get a Police pension for all the detective work he does.A slice of classic TV with memorable stories and characters Quincy is well worth a watch.
