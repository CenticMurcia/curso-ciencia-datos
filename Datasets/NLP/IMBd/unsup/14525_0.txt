I'm so excited to see this movie on IMDb! I loved this movie when it came out. I was the same age as the girl, and this movie fed my girlish fantasies. **swoon** It was a great movie! I haven't seen it in years. I wish they would put it on TV again. Maybe if I saw it now with grown up eyes, I would see it differently, but I doubt it. That movie is a piece of my youth and one of my special memories. I loved that song - You Take My Breath Away. Every once in a while, I find myself singing it - even now. Isn't that the funniest! I remember riding my bike to the record store to buy an eight track tape of Rex Smith's album as soon as it came out. (I wonder if I could get that again...) I had his posters from all the teen magazines all over my walls. I'm glad to know that he is doing well. He was so cute! I also watched him on Solid Gold and Pirates of Penzance. What I wouldn't have given to be able to switch places with Linda Ronstadt!
