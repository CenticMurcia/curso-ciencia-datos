What a waste of perfectly good celluloid. There are times when I thought this was a comedy. The dwarf's scenes are really campy. I wish he had had a little more to do. Visually, it's a whole lot of silly images going nowhere. The girl is pretty in a sort of maternal way. The natives are attractive and dance well. Voodoo people are very hard on chickens, always have been. Other than finding out what is going on, we aren't very privy to what is going on. Once the young woman arrives, we know that if there is going to be a sacrifice, she's going to be it. She is disappointing in that she comes on so strong at the beginning and then lets go of her whole temperance thing. We have the buffoonish police captain whom no one takes seriously. Anyway, there are some cool snakes, a few dances, some drums. Instead of this, watch some of those old Lugosi movies and their ilk. They really created the zombie which we have grown to love.
