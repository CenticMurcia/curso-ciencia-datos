The Mighty Peking Man (1977) stars Danny "The Man" Lee as an anthropologist who's searching for the mythical "Peking Man". Funded by a wealthy investor, Lee and his associates travel to Northern India to find the behemoth. Along the way he encounters a jungle girl (Evelyne Kraft who's so friggin' hot that she broke my babe-o-meter) who just happens to have the Peking Man as her guardian and companion. The original Hong Kong version of this film has a very sad and depressing overtone to it (unlike the badly dubbed "international" version). The original version plays out like an updated Mighty Joe Young. I liked this movie very much. Danny Lee is my hero!<br /><br />Another entry in the Shaw Brothers attempt to go international. The movie is not as bad as people make it out to be. Don't believe the hype people. A cheesy movie with loads of fun!<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Evelyne Kraft is hot!
