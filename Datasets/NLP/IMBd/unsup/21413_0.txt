Not that I dislike those other high school movie, but this one is so realistic. Angus is overweight and he fines ways to deal with it. He doesn't try to lose the weight to make everyone like him. Charlie Talbert does a great job, in the only thing that I've seen him in. The acting really is great and as a huge James Van Der Beek fan you get to see one of his earlier films. George C. Scott and Kathy Bates are also at their best. I give it an 8/10!
