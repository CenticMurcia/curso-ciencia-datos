Sorry, but am I the only one that really really hates this show? It's trash I did not like the voices and I think the girl's voice was the worst voice I'd ever find and this is the worst series I would ever search for. I really think the movie was much better, it was very delightful and amazingly magical but this one was the worst rip off of a movie. I would find something better than this disgusting demon spirited slob negative 999 and a million more I'll buy, once I see another one of this, I'ma get up and watch good movies like Cloudy with a chance of meatballs yuck! Newbies, please don't bother because Ariel's friends' magical spirits and her all of the characters are altered and changed because this is way too emo for me, look for something better.
