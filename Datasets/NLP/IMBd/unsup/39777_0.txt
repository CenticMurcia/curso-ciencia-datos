This must be the worst piece of garbage I have seen for a very long time. Putting it in the context of a Stephen king production it becomes even worse as he usually writes qualitative books which have generated movies worth paying time to watch, for instance the Green Mile. As I havn't read the book I don't know if I should blame king or the director. However; I strongly advise you to avoid this movie.<br /><br />Reasons to my opinion ?<br /><br />- The whole idea with alies invading tends to be rather overused and out of fashion. - Of course the director could not do much about that but one can expect him to make the movie engaging and frightening. - It is filled with cliches and nothing new in content.<br /><br />
