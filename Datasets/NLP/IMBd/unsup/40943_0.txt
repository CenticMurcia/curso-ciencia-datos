Absolutely terrible. The filmmakers did an awful job of recreating any of the suspense or emotion of the ALCS. The 7-game series between the Yanks and Sawx was one of the best ever for fans of either team. Both teams played their hearts out and the fans showed more love for their respective teams than I've ever seen. But, watching this film, you'd never know it. It had all the enthusiasm of June game between two last place teams.<br /><br />The "fans" they chose to chronicle showed no emotion either. It seemed to me that the filmmakers filmed the movie after the series ended and just used poor actors posing as fans. Their teams just lost a heartbreaking game on a series-ending homer and no tears, no anger, no nothing. They just sit there emotionless...probably because it happened a month earlier and the "fans" couldn't recreate the raw feelings they had that October night.<br /><br />Regardless, only Red Sox fans looking to rehash a lost season or a Yankees fan looking to laugh at how pathetic Red Sox nation really is should waste their time with this waste of film.
