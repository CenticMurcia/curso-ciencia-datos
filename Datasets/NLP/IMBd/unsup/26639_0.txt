Eric Stoltz plays Rocky Dennis, a teen afflicted with a horribly disfiguring disease. He lives with his mom, Rusty (Cher), a sometime junkie who pals around with a gang of bikers.<br /><br />Between coping with his mom's antics, dealing with the prejudice he encounters and the debilitating migraines he suffers from, Rocky still manages to win over his teachers and classmates, becoming an inspiration to them.<br /><br />While the story initially seems to be about Rocky, it's also about Rusty. She wants everyone to see her as the tough biker chick who can handle anyone and anything that comes her way, including Rocky's disease and the strangers who stare. This is her mask. She's really scared to death for Rocky and turns to the alcohol and drugs to help her cope.<br /><br />A great film based on a true story, Mask will convince you that sometimes the most unlikely people become heroes.
