This film portrays the famous Parisian cemetery of PÃ¨re Lachaise through the stories of a dozen of its visitors. Thought there is no actual plot to the movie as a whole, the stories of the visitors provide a moving background to some of the graves.<br /><br />The film focuses on some famous graves (Chopin, Proust, Maria Callas amongst others) as well as paying attention to some "ordinary" graves. In all cases, a portrait of someone connected to that grave is given, ranging from the Japanese girl who loves the music of Chopin so much she moved to Paris to study the piano, to the woman who at 54 found the love of her life, only to lose it again when her husband died unexpectedly.<br /><br />The stories are supported by footage of the private life of the visitors, and also by beautiful views of the cemetery and the graves.<br /><br />Remember this is a documentary, so there's no plot, no acting, let alone explosions and effects. What you get is a couple of beautiful filmed, moving portraits of people who mourn a loved one. In the end, the film is about love more than anything else.
