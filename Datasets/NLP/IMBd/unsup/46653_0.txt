This film is just so... weird. Ever since accidentally buying "Ninja Terminator", I've become somewhat of a fan of Godfrey Ho, because his movies are just so mind blowingly terrible and disjointed they cause hilarity, albeit unintentionally.<br /><br />According to a short little recap at the start of this film, Gold Ninja Warrior is either the sequel or prequel to "Ninja Terminator" (or maybe a retelling of the same story or anything, it's kinda hard to tell). However, the tale of the titular statue is completely lost in the tale of a sex slave, drug dealing, gun trading ring of gangsters being taken down by a ninja.<br /><br />Unfortunately, unlike Ninja Terminator, the fight scenes in this film are just terrible. Not only that, but I'm fairly sure that there is actually more time dedicated on screen to watching helpless women being beaten up and raped than there is ninjas fighting. I might be wrong on that, but this film has the only graphic sex scene which I actually felt *wrong* after seeing.<br /><br />Speaking of the rape scene (and you'll know it immediately), it doesn't even make sense. So a fat business man can rape a ninja? The woman had previously killed about 50 bajillion armed gangsters single handedly, and now she has a small length of rope around her wrists (her legs are fine), she can't fight off an overweight, middle aged, unarmed business man? No. Doesn't make sense.<br /><br />As the one line summary above suggests, I believe that this film is actually a look into the minds of the creators of this film more than anything else. There is an unnecessarily large amount of time dedicated to seeing nude women being hit, which considering the summary on the back of my DVD box says "...the Red Ninjas intend to steal the statue and send their best Ninja heroine to draw out the Golden Ninjas leader, Max." seems just wrong. Also, none of that blurb actually happens. The only time the statue appears is in the recap of events in "Ninja Terminator" right at the start.<br /><br />This film just plain sucks, even for a Godfrey Ho film (and he is involved, albeit uncredited, and I'm not 100% convinced that Joseph Lai isn't another pseudonym of him anyway). The fight scenes are just plain boring. The only guy in the film who looks like he has any training only appears for about 2 minutes and then gets lamely knocked over by the lead character. The plot makes no sense and randomly jumps about. The editing is terrible (people will jump off a wall dressed as a ninja and land dressed regularly, then 4 seconds later be a ninja again, and so on).<br /><br />Go buy Ninja Terminator instead. That is an amusingly bad film with surprisingly good fight scenes (even if Jaguar One is a complete and utter dick for no reason), and doesn't feel you leaving dirty like this film does.
