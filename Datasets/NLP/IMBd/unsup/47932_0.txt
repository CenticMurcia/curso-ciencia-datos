Bad effects, bad storyline, boring... i almost fell asleep. don't go to the cinema wait till its on TV and than go and do something else. Yes i get the idea, it looks like Greenpeace is the main sponsor of this movie. The effects could be better, the storyline could be better. It is a waste of natures resources.I hope that they will not burn this on DVD. what else to say, the movie is slow.. starts slow en ends slow. it is predictable. i would say it is in the same genre as i legend. that was also a bad movie. nae .. seeing it in the cinema is a waist of time.better buy some flowers for your loved one. What else to say over this movie. sorry but 10 lines is way to much.
