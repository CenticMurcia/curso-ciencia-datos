The marriage of a bickering couple in a fantasy-version of Las Vegas comes to a boil when the wife decides to leave (she wants a little excitement, but hubby is a homebody); both he and she link up with other partners, but will married-love win out? Frederic Forrest and Teri Garr star in this lavishly-designed, studio-shot concoction from director Francis Ford Coppola, who seemingly put all his heart into the unreality of the film's look and forgot to shape the characters (and involve the audience). There's nobody here worth giving a damn about, not Forrest nor Garr, nor their new paramours, Latin smoothie Raul Julia or pixieish showgirl Nastassia Kinski (who has the film's best scene walking a tightrope, which may have been stolen from "King of Hearts"). The country music by Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle hopes to work as a narrative theme, when actually a stronger screenplay might have sufficed. * from ****
