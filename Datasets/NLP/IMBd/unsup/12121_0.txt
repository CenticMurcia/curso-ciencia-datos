this film moved me in ways people cant imagine Matt Le blanc gives his best appearance to date (with exception to friends series 2 episode 11). i feel it is my duty to inform other IMDb'Er's of the shere perfection of this picture. my favourite part has to be where the girls have to eat seaweed for their fight for survival. because of this i can now thoroughly enjoy seaweed from the Chinese, along with my fond memories. this film is certainly more than a 'one watch film' (not the official quote) in reply to the previous comment. i myself have watched it numerous times and have always been reduced to tears, impressed by the outstanding direction and above most this film has taught me how to...survive.
