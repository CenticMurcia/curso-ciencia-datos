<br /><br />This film was hilarious Chad Donella did a great job as Sam, a guy surrounded by beautiful woman and trying to win their hearts. I wouldn't call this film the best I have ever seen but it's a film for anyone that wants to have a laugh and to not take the film seriously. Go rent a 100 Women today.
