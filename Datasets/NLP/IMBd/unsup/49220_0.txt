The movie was nothing but interpersonal conflict. The role played by Vince Vaughn was a shallow, waste of time and the role played by Jennifer Aniston started to reciprocate in kind... it was nothing but nasty conflict... my wife and I couldn't watch the whole thing it was so snide and petty... we put in Elizabethtown instead and LOVED that... don't bother with "The Breakup"... not worth the rental fee... or time. Also, you might like "The Great Raid"... we loved that also... We are big fans of "The Princess Bride" and "Galaxy Quest" etc and didn't care for the constant conflict of "The Breakup". We though "The Breakup" was going to be a comedy... it was a tragic pile of interpersonal failure...
