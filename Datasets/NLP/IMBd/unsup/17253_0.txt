A bit of a preview to The Sixth Sense, the theme treats childhood conflicts with a respectful interest. Not only does the director get virtuoso performances from his juvenile leads, but his pacing, lighting, visuals, humorous one-liners is simply overwhelming in a neophyte. Rewatch the scene where Joseph Cross and his Grandfather are walking outside and the kid eventually cries on Grandfather's chest. Long, complicated scene with changes in emotion, relationships, timing etc...and done in a single cut. Amazing. I appreciate the Oriental Philosophy touch (as in Eastern). While I heard that M. is an Episcopalian, he retains at his core some mysticism which is evident in both movies. Once Cole Seer understands his "gift" he stops being a psychotic outcast and starts a new direction in his life. Once Joshua wakes up and accepts his surroundings, he gets his sign and his answers...what is this, Zen/Hindu/Catholic??
