The original Man Eater by Joe D'Amato is somewhat of a cult classic. And by now, everyone should know that cult classics HAVE to be remade! Luckily, Andreas Schnaas decided to give the George Eastman flick some very special treatment.<br /><br />Do not under any circumstances watch Anthropophagous 2000 alone.<br /><br />Independent film-making can result in incredibly entertaining movies. There just has to be a certain dedication and respect towards the original source and the audience.<br /><br />Andreas Schnaas doesn't know diddly-squat about that...<br /><br />The camera work is quite good, I have to admit, but that's about it. There are plenty of negative aspects though.<br /><br />The acting is... Just horrible. Absolutely horrible. I love amateur splatter films, but an able director always manages to get marginally talented people for the butchering. If not, he'll get camp, over the top teens that are only there for our amusement.<br /><br />Andreas Schnaas does not want to amuse you...<br /><br />The sound is excusable. It's the original soundtrack, filmed on location, so don't expect to hear a word the cast says. Not that it matters, but some dubbing would have been appropriate.<br /><br />Last but not least, the gore. It's a bloody mess, that's for sure, but herein lies Schnaas talent. If your film is as unbelievably trashy as this, you have to make up for that. The easiest way to do that is either by getting the girls naked or disposing of them in the most graphic way possible. Naked girls: Not really. Blood and guts: Definitely. Decapitations, disembowelments, tearing off faces and... THAT climax kill. You know, the one with the pregnant woman. <br /><br />Anthropophagous 2000 is low budget, low quality and low everything. If you're planning on renting a trashy Friday night flick, then go for something else. Maybe a Troma film. Terror Firmer or The Toxic Avenger. Or stay in Germany and get an old Olaf Ittenbach film. Heck, you've all heard of Braindead!<br /><br />BUT, if you're planning on getting wasted with some mates... Ladies and gentlemen:<br /><br />ANTHROPOPHAGOUS 2000!<br /><br />When watched alone: 0/10<br /><br />When watched under the influence with company: 10/10
