This is a film that use the form of the American Western in order to tell the impossible love story between Dum, The Black Tiger (Chatchai Ngamsan) and Rumpoey (Stella Malucchi) and do it quite well. Director, Wisit Sartsanatieg show that he has much knowledge about the Western and use it to the advantage of the film and the story. He shows the ability to tell a story confidently and has no problems in going back and forward in time while he is unfolding the love story of the 2 main characters.He also has an technical ability not forgetting any detail showed previously in the film.<br /><br />The acting is good and though seem sometime artificially serve the film to the point. An added bonus is the design of the set which is deliberately camp and look artificially.<br /><br />All in all a very enjoyable experience. Go and see it.
