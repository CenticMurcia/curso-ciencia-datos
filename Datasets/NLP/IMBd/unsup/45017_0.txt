Typical bollywood love story. Girl meets guy, meet the parents, there's trouble, a bad patch, the struggle, the heroism and then a happy ending, oh and not to forget the dancing and singing.<br /><br />The nudity side of things was simple and did'n'y need to be in the film. there are certain situations where you can understand why it is needed but in this case they could have done the standard skin tight sari's and clothes and still got away with it.<br /><br />Nudity in films is not a big issue these days...well, in Hollywood, but bollywood, film makers need to be abit careful on their target audience. the younger generation would have an open mind and will be more susceptible to this but the older and the majority of the target audience for bollwood films would not be.<br /><br />I personally don't mind the nudity. :)
