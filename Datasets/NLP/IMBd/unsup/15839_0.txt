...the question is how much will it interest the casual viewer or regular fan of horror movies.<br /><br />As a low budget filmmaker myself, this movie is obviously skewed to my interests--so I identified with a lot of the filmmakers interviewed.<br /><br />The film goes back and forth between filmmakers like Mark Borchardt, known for his "American Movie" and others I hadn't heard of like Ron Atkins. Many of them come off as bitter, but they all seem to have a genuine love of horror.<br /><br />So if you've got an interest in horror and, and what drives people to create them, you may wanna check this movie out. It may bore the more casual horror fan, but all in all it's a well-crafted documentary.<br /><br />(The question I want answered is how did that Ron Atkins guy get a girlfriend who's so freakin' cute, and way out of his league? )
