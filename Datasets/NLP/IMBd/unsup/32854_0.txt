This movie does a good job of showing the viewer how a psychologically disturbed personality can interpret neutral stimuli in a paranoid fashion. The use of the scripted newscasts were reminiscent of the news coverage post 9-11.<br /><br />It was a movie that was well-acted and well directed to show how one misconception can lead to another - and how a bad situation can turn into a nightmare with just a few missteps. There were also some surprisingly humorous moments as the neighbor who is held hostage comments on the situation at hand to a man who is obviously losing his grip on reality.<br /><br />It is ashame that the movie disappoints in the end by insinuating that the neighbor was indeed a terrorist. This drags what was a well-crafted story down to a cheap potshot of a film that stereotypes all non Caucasians as terrorists. This implication taints the picture and helps to fuel the paranoid delusions of pathetic individuals such as the one portrayed in the main character.
