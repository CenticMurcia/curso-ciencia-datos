<br /><br />This movie is filmed in ambient light with hand held cameras. It's got some pretty women in it, but you can hardly tell because it's lit so badly and the cameras jerk around so much. There's a little nudity but only in the context of degradation and violence, no sex.<br /><br />If you were looking for a sex comedy with dinosaurs, rent _Dinosaur Island_ (Fred Olen Ray and Jim Wynorski, '94) instead.
