There are probably spoilers below, but who really cares. Luckily, I did not pay to see this film. I have enjoyed Terry Zwigoff's work in the past, especially Crumb, and Ghost World was even slightly acceptable for entertainment value. But I should have known a movie called "Art School Confidental" would be a piece of crap straight off the bat. I expected the typical clich√©s to run rampant in the film and they were. But I hate to tell you that there are people in this world who are serious about their art, and aren't just some sort of after-school special stereotype of what someone who is creative should be. <br /><br />The plot was all over the place. I couldn't understand what the "hero" aka Holden Caulfield was even being arrested for. Was he ripping off the man whom he killed with his stupid cigarette, or was he bring framed as the strangler? And I hate to break it to the average movie viewer, but art school models certainly are not attractive. If the director and cast were trying to push the protagonist as some sort of unrecognized genius, they should have attempted to make the art work he produced slightly respectable and impressive.<br /><br />What was with throwing the token gay fashion student in the film? Was that supposed to be funny? Because everyone in the theater was laughing at him, and not for the right reasons either. There seems to be a slightly racist, homophobic undertone to both Ghost World and Art School Confidential. <br /><br />This was a self-indulgent masturbatory piece of gar-bage film. AND THE ENDING WAS AWFUL. everyone walking out of the theater kept saying how bad the ending was. <br /><br />I actually would go as far to say that it was the worst ending in film history.<br /><br />I recommend Pecker over this movie, and that was John Waters at his worst.<br /><br />Sorry if this review seems vile, but I hate wasting the precious moments in my life on such putrid feces of celluloid. Please do not do the same, even if you are an art student looking for a laugh, even if the price is free, go elsewhere and do something productive with your life.
