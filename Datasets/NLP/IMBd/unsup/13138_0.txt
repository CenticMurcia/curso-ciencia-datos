I've seen all 14 previous episodes of the Richard Sharpe series. I'm a very devoted fan and was incredibly surprised to learn that new episode would be aired on BBC America August, 2006. The last time the episodes aired was way back in 1997. Hooray for Sean Bean's devotion to this TV program. He first portrayed Richard Sharpe in 1992, unknown in Hollywood, and only a star in England. Now he's an international Hollywood blockbuster star since LOTR, but still agreed to return to TV for Sharpe, took a huge pay cut to do TV because he loves the part of Sharpe.<br /><br />The production values, sets, costumes are outstanding. The biggest budget production in the entire 14 episode series. Toby Stephens is deliciously evil as the villain, Lucy Brown gives a touching, luminous performance. Padma Lakshi cannot act her way out of a paper bag and the other Indian actress who played the princess should have been cast in the courtesan role. I loved it, although there were a few flaws.<br /><br />The battle scenes are much more complex and with an enormous cast of extras compared to the previous 14 episodes. It is an international cast of very fine supporting actors. However, the actor who portrays Sgt. Bickerstaff is very "hammy" and over the top. However, the few flaws I mentioned don't hamper a very fine production, which is a classic!
