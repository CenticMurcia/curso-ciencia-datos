Every so often, aside from the laborious drudgery that the Hollywood's, Bollywood's and now Nollywood's callously discard at we noble consumers like the spent box of Kentucky Drive Thru  there comes something magnificent. Something that simultaneously shakes you like a Tsunami and melts your plasma into a toffee apple. Something that heats up your café olé without you even going into the kitchen.<br /><br />I am referring to "OUT ON A LIMB". Obviously. Not since Fellini's 8 1/2, have I had the privilege of imbibing myself in such artistry  losing myself in a maze of charismatic characters; prescient prose; dramatic drama and alluring actors. The complexity of the chef, reminds me of Greenaway's stolid 'RICHARD" in his 1989 masterpiece. Though perhaps merged with Nigella Lawson to add a bit of masculinity. I literally drooled all over my Fish McMuffins during the dinner scenes. Absolute brilliance. <br /><br />Lo, oh lo! Those compassionless scorekeepers - "Film Critics" will have their duplicitous mendacity REVEALED should they not score this film as I do: 9/10. This film should be called "OUT OF THIS WORLD".
