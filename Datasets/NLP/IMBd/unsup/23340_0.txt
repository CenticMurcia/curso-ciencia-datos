If you like Mary-Kate and Ashley's previous movies than I'm sure you'll enjoy this one as well. I gave it a 10/10 because it is what it is and shouldn't be judged for anything more.<br /><br />The Olsen's produce family friendly movies which are enjoyable for what they are. I'm 22 and love their movies because they are fun and innocent. They don't run around in the film in cleavage/midriff bearing shirts or ultra-mini skirts, acting like complete bimbos in order for guys to think they're sexy, like most teenage actors do. In most movies of theirs, one plays a very upstanding, conservative person who dreams of academic achievement and the other is more wild and likes to enjoy life to its fullest.<br /><br />Why bother seeing it if you hate these kinds of movies? It makes no sense at all why most people who have voted or commented here at imdb even saw it in the first place (most I find didn't go at all).<br /><br />Think about it... if all you read are sports magazines, why would you pick up a Harlequinn romance?<br /><br />
