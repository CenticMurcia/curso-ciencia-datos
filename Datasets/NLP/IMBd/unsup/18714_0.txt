With movies like this, I wonder how no one thought to stop the<br /><br />thing long before shooting wraps. Movies like Yor force me to<br /><br />argue for a referee who can bring a halt to shooting a troubled<br /><br />movie, much in the same way a referee saves a boxer in danger. <br /><br />When would the ref have brought an end to things? Reb Brown's<br /><br />first appearance might have ended it, or maybe the first papier- mache dinosaur would have brought the ref's arms up. Either<br /><br />way, we would have been saved from 100 minutes or so of this<br /><br />drag.<br /><br />
