While I applaud the film makers for their effort and terrific use of the camera and very little funds, I can't say that I enjoyed this film a great deal. I feel bad saying anything negative about what is clearly such a labor of love, but the story didn't move me or involve me very much. Yes, it's a scrappy tale boldly told, but the tale itself was weak. All the other elements were fine, but if I'm not engaged by the story then I stop caring, and eventually lose interest, which is what happened when I saw this at the festival.<br /><br />The acting is all fine, particularly the lead man and the voice on the phone (you'll know what I mean when you see it, it really is a lead role even though you never meet him) but there are so many wholes in the story that it never came together for me.<br /><br />I look forward to these film makers next film, and hope they have a bigger budget, but mostly I urge them to find a better script.
