A few of the characters had some depth and some of them I was really interested to see where they wound up, but I regret to say that most of them irritated the h out of me. Martha Plimpton, Garofalo (one of my faves) and Kate Hudson were the only saving graces to this film, that I feel, could have been a lot better. However, as much as I like Kate Hudson her character was even a bit much. These characters display no hint of self worth or self respect in there personas, except for Plimpton's and Garofalo's characters seemed to have traces. And they all seemed to run around the town like a bunch of hyper-active, shallow and glitzy teenagers all obsessed with sex. The costumes were fun and it had it's moments but overall, just a mediocre, high-strung film set in the early 80's.
