I walked in to the third act of a three-act play. Unfortunately, I have not seen Candyman 1 and 2, so I have to judge this on it's own merits.<br /><br />Tony Todd makes a good villain. I was interested in seeing him after watching him with a group discussing horror movies the other day. I like Candyman and will certainly look for the other two.<br /><br />This was my first time seeing Donna D'Errico, and it was painless. She didn't have a great role, as she spent most of the time screaming and running, but she did OK. Apparently you have to watch Playboy videos to see all her assets, but they were impressive jiggling in beater tees here. At least mommy wasn't so repressed.<br /><br />Worth watching, but probably better as the end of a trilogy instead of the beginning. Have to get the other two parts.
