Katie Tippel is very similar to Turkish Delight. This film has tons of nudity in it. This is one of Paul Verhoeven's early Dutch movies. Rutger Hauer stars in this movie. This movie is also shocking like most Verhoeven movies. This movie was cut to avoid an X rating. I saw the unrated version from Netflix. I have never seen this movie cut. All of Paul Verhoeven's movies have nudity in it. Jan De Bont was the cinematographer for this as with other Paul Verhoeven's films such as Turkish Delight, The 4th Man, Flesh + Blood, and Basic Instinct. I have only seen this movie once. I wish I can own it. I also wish I did not throw away Basic Instinct. This is a very well done Dutch film.
