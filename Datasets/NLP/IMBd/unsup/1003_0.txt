Not as bad as "Bone Sickness"<br /><br />well ...yeah it is.<br /><br />This movie is bad.<br /><br />Very bad!!!<br /><br />The director did'nt even want his name on it but put it on it since the crew asked him to. That should be all you need to know.<br /><br />I love horror ...just so you know. I love a lot of really bad horror, but this is not the good kind of bad in any way. Don't spend any money on this flick. By "any money" I mean "ANY" ! A penny would be too much. You have been warned!
