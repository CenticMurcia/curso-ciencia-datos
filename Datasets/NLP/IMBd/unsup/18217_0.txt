"The Formula" is a mess of a movie. It's a mystery/thriller in which the mystery is almost impossible to follow and the thrills are few and far between. The plot becomes confusing almost from the start and never turns itself around. Ones only reason to watch this movie would be to see two of our greatest actors, Marlon Brando and George C.Scott, performing together. Sadly even that falls short as they only have two scenes together, albeit these are the two best scenes in the movie. Brando's speech about the oil companies is terrific. Too bad the rest of the film didn't live up to that scene.<br /><br />I can remember that just prior to the opening of the film at Christmas of 1980 it became public knowledge that the studio (with the backing of writer Steve Shagan) took the film away from director John Avildsen. Shagan wanted many changes made so Avildsen sent a long memo to the studio outlining Shagan's apparent wrong decisions with the editing. The studio seemed to agree - somewhat. Some of Avildsen's suggestions were restored while others weren't. Thankfully the Brando speech that I mentioned above was not cut per Shagan's request. Avildsen believed that because Brando basically improvised the scene Shagan was not happy with it.<br /><br />Come to think of it I think I would have rather seen a movie based on the internal battles of the studio/writer and the director then this mess. Whomever is to blame, and it's probably 50-50, "The Formula" is a major disappointment considering all the talent involved.
