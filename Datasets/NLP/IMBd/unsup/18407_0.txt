If you are looking for a patch of blue in a new gay cinema gone bad, do not watch this film. It is an equal-opportunity mess. Bad writing. Bad cinematography. Bad acting. Bad everything. It is notable for its total lack of any sympathetic characters. Remarkable. The most aggravating thing about the movie is its bumbling stupidity in dealing with very serious issues which effect millions, such as AIDS, homophobia, sexism, corrupt politics. The second most aggravating thing about the movie is Karen Allen's blue suit, which she wears in every scene. And it's a really ugly suit! It is one of the very few movies I have watched to its conclusion despite my deepest desire to stop the pain of watching it. I can't really say what that is about. Perhaps it was like watching a train wreck. Believe me, this film did indeed earn my vote of 1.
