This movie is the epitome of paradox. Whether or not it is a scary movie does not even bother me. I am so fed-up by it I am not even going to spend much effort in writing this review. So here are the people who deserves to be Re- Cycled.<br /><br />First: editor. The entire movie is a series of snapshots fading in and out of the screen. There is no continuous or coherent scene. Most of the time, you get flashes of a shadow or a hand. The shots are angled, out of focus, and pointless. If the movie was trying to be abstract, it failed miserably. I can't see a darn thing! I am refraining myself from using words that are not permitted here.<br /><br />Second: the directors. To tell the truth, other than The Eye (the first movie), the rest of their works are mediocre, even borderline lousy. This movie pushes it over that borderline. One of the signs of weak direction is the inability to know when a scene should stop, and it is so evident here.<br /><br />Third: sound director. Did they run out of budget? Give me a break.<br /><br />Fourth: actor. I never like Lee's acting but I thought she was decent in The Eye. In this movie, I got sick looking at her, and most of the time, it is her that you see. She is the focus of every single shot, and she was able to show only one expression. Fear/anger/confusion; I can't decide which it was. Oh, and the dialog. Were they on a dictation contest? Does anyone in the cast and crew knows the meaning to the word 'acting'? At least at one point I feel for the little girl, but the best thing is, it wasn't the point where I was supposed to feel for her.<br /><br />Fifth: writer. I can appreciate and even respect the idea presented in the movie. Yes, abandoning things are bad and we should recycle. So what's the point of the movie? Exactly, there is none. It teaches you neither to abandon, nor to recycle. Well, they do tell you the horrid of aborting a child, but I think the moral value is lost when you can't even make it to that point of the movie without losing your patience, and your mind. Oh and I think everyone who has watched at least one movie would have figured it out by then. I think they wanted to make the movie only because they thought the idea was nifty, but never really did any actual work on writing or reading the script. The movie spent the first 30 minute developing something that only affects 5 minutes at the end of the movie, and that was the gist of the one and a half hour movie. Please! And people dropping from the sky? Come on, help me out here.<br /><br />Sixth: writer. Yes, he/she/they deserves to be buried twice. The entire story is a paradox. 'Why is everything here so horrible?' Lee said, squatting on a rock with a sweet child amidst a beautiful river with a small waterfall and lush greenery's. 'This is the place that I belong', Ting-Yu (the child) said when her mother was holding her in her arms, crying, wishing they could live together happily ever after. Need an explanation? The place is for abandoned things, and she has a mother that wants her, so she is not abandoned anymore and hence she no longer belongs there.'Anything you threw away can be found here' the child said, and then everything got sucked away by the wonder known as Re-Cycled. So what's the point again? They are thrown away, gather in this place, only to be thrown away again? Someone stop me please.<br /><br />The lowest rating a movie can get here is 1. I gave this movie 2. The extra point was for the visual effect. The environment was nicely built, especially the toy graveyard. I think they made the movie BECAUSE of that. I would have given another point for creativity, but I took it back because the movie looked like a cross between The Langourliers and Silent Hill.<br /><br />Why do I sound so angry you ask? Simple. I spent my money, my time, and my effort to watch a movie. I watch any movie with an open mind, and I try to justify the movie for what it is. I have enjoyed many movies, but when I watch a movie such as this, I get angry. I strongly suggest that they do not make another movie again. Excuse me while I go watch Dorm again.
