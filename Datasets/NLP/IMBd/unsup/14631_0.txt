Aamir is brilliant. Kajol looks stunning. The storyline wants you to suspend your disbelief an hour too long. Pretty much sums up the movie. This 3 hour saga left me confounded at the kind of stories and sentiments dished out by bollywood. Sadly, the songs cant save the movie either. The only good number is within the first hour and not when I needed it the most. A leitmotif runs throughout the movie - good, but overused and got to my nerves. And watch out for the scene with a desi version of the MI3 score.<br /><br />The movie starts out on a fun note and has the quintessential love at first "sight" scenes. And there is some skepticism about the hero's devotion and commitment - not in the girl's mind but in her friends'. Some of the scenes are particularly entertaining and most of them have a repartees in shayris. All that remains now is for the girl and boy to get married and remain happily ever after. But, no. Life, as they say, is full of surprises.
