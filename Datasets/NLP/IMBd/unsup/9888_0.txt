from the comments I saw here, I thought I was about to see one of those rare, forgotten comedic gems, the cast definitely offered hope. However, this was disappointing, there were a couple of good one-liners but this was more a drama than a comedy and a drama that seemed to drag and drag.<br /><br />Apart from Fox and Douglas, everyone else was one-dimensional and seemed to be saying the same stuff over and over again. There was real scope here for a wittier script, instead it all got rather tedious, 30 minutes could easily have been lopped off the running time.<br /><br />At least it was good to see actors like Douglas, Fox and Hartmann in their prime, its sad to see what has happened to that trio now.
