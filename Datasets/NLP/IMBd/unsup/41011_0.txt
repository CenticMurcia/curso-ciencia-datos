This film is a leftist polemic in which the American forces involved in the 1989 Panama incursion are all liars and murderers and the leftists who are interviewed are all victims and heroes. That said, the film is well made and interesting, that is no doubt why it won the Academy Award for documentary films. Nevertheless, it is entirely unconvincing. The only person I saw interviewed in the film's entire 1 hour and 45 minute length who was credible was Pete Williams, now a network newsman, who was then the Defense Department's press spokesman. The bias of this film is demonstrated by its maker's position that the American press was itself biased because it focused on the tragedy caused by the deaths of Americans who died in the incursion. It's thesis that American soldiers willy-nilly murdered innocent civilians is supported only by biased interviews and urban legend. Despite the skill of its maker, this film is not recommended to anyone with an interest in knowing the facts.
