This film ranks amongst those that are so bad, they're almost amusing. Almost.<br /><br />Vinnie Jones turns in the worst performance as pirate, Bob Harvey. He was so amazingly bad (eclipsed only by the obviously artificial wig, that looks like it was last worn by a member of Motley Crue) that we couldn't contain our laughter while he was on screen.<br /><br />My favourite scene was where Patrick Stewart (Nemo) confronts the castaways just as there is an earthquake. I'm guessing that this whole scene was shot in a studio somewhere (on completely solid ground) and stock footage of an island with a big rumbling mountain was stuck on later. Anyway, as Stewart delivers his lines, the pro that he is, he stumbles and shakes as the eruptions and tremors go on all around. Then we cut back to the rest of the cast all standing still with cow-like expressions. Either they were wondering whether Stewart had lost his marbles or they were filmed in a completely different studio way before Nemo's lines went into the can. It's hilarious though...<br /><br />...doesn't save the film in the slightest, mind.
