Jean Claude Van-Damme has made a few good action movies and more that are not so good. This is not only one of his worst but one of the most horrifying movies I've ever seen. Together with Kickboxer this is Van-Damme at his most brainless and the director, Albert Pyun who can never make it right (Adrenalin, Nemesis 1, 2, 3 and so on) made one of the most low grade movies ever. Some movies may be bad and still have good scenes in them and sometimes one of these scenes may acctually make the whole movie better but here thoose scenes are abscent. There is no acting, there is no action, there is no good scenes and I could even question if this is acctually qualifies as a movie. Enough with the critic. One word: Worthless.
