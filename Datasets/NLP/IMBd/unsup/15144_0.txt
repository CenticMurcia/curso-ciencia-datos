This documentary is pure hero worship on director Taylor Hackford's behalf, so don't expect them to remotely touch upon Chuck Berry's personal demons, his various run-ins with the police, and sleazy practices. As a portrait of the man, it isn't extremely successful. However, the film is such a vibrant and full of life profile, that hardly matters. In fact, while touching upon Berry's low points may have made it more interesting, it would've detracted from the entertainment value. And fortunately, the documentary fully illustrates Berry's influence over all rock 'n' roll and his importance as a songwriter. If anything, it'll make the casual fan appreciate him even more.<br /><br />The concert footage itself is a tad uneven. I couldn't care less about most of the guest performers brought out to share the stage, particularly the always anemic Eric Clapton and the pointless spot for Julian (son of John) Lennon. Luckily, when Berry himself performs, all that hardly matters. Sure, this isn't his prime and his voice isn't as strong as usual, but hes full of energy and charisma. Between the interviews and his stage performances, the man comes across as being surprisingly intelligent, if a tad egotistical. For anyone who believes in the life affirming powers of rock 'n' roll, than this documentary is a must. (8/10)
