I am a HUGE fan of 'Knight Chills.' I actually own a copy of it. Katherine Hicks is a mad genius and I *hope* to see more work from her in the near future! The actor that really pulls this movie and makes it utterly BRILLIANT is the child playing 'Jack Jr.' who is without a doubt the funniest actor in the history of film. His close rival (Jack is a hard one to beat folks) is 'Laura Nixon' who had to be re-dubbed all throughout the movie causing unparalleled laughs out of me and any friend I can trick into watching this wonderfully bad movie. I'm not 100% sure how to describe this flick. When it's teetering on absolute monotony suddenly Jack Jr. or Laura Nixon will appear and make it once again HYSTERICALLY funny.<br /><br />I'm eagerly awaiting "Figure in the Forest" in hopes of seeing little Jackson Kennedy shine again.
