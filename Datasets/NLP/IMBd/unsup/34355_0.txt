This movie is a crock of garbage, folks. It's movies like this that give true horror films a bad name. Nothing is good about this movie except the highly attractive and extremely beautiful Jennifer Love Hewitt. Other than her, you wish this movie would take a long walk off of a short pier. Nothing except JLH could save this sorry excuse of a movie, and it's also a waste of your time and a waste of film to make the movie with. Get this for a FREE rental only. DO NOT buy it. I guarantee that you will be sorry
