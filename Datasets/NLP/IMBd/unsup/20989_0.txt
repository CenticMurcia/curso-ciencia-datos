David L. Cunningham (Beyond Paradise) directs "To End All Wars" with such talent and assurance, I could swear he was a veteran behind the camera. The film is virtually filled with superb performers, most notably, Robert Carlyle and Kiefer Sutherland. The story is based upon the true story of Ernest Gordon (available since 1962 as "Miracle on the River Kwai", "Through the Valley of the Kwai", and "To End All Wars" among other titles) and is adapted by Brian Godawa.<br /><br />At many points, the film can be extremely difficult to watch, showing many types of torture. Some people might classify this as a "Christian" film, but being the current state of that particular film industry, it would be an insult. In a recent interview, Douglas Gresham (the stepson of C.S. Lewis) said "We do not need more people making Christian films. We need more Christians making good films". And this film succeeds in that. Cunningham and Godawa make a *good* film.<br /><br />I consider it no exaggeration to call this one of the top 10 war films ever made.<br /><br />8.7 out of 10
