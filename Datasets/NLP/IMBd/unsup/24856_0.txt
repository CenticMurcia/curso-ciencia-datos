I watched this movie back in 1992 when I was 14 on midnight but I can still remember the scenes and plot vividly. This is I must say, a haunting film, as it excellently portrays the courage of a young lady who has to face her whole neighborhood upon the death of her young love, Billy Joe McAllister, who jumps into the Mississippi river and meets death. A lot of speculations are spreading across the southern town, but little do they know that Billy Joe is secretly being raped by a man. Absolutely memorable. If only Malaysian Censorship Board would allow more scenes to be displayed I would have a clearer view of the film. But it truly is excellent...
