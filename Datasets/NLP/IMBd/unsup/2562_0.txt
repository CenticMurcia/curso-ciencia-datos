when i bought this some time ago (had to order from the UK), i wasn't sure what to expect. slasher or what. i was pleasantly surprised with the result.<br /><br />it has some genuinely creepy and disturbing moments from the start, and the whole time you're kept on your feet as to what the hell is going on. i can't explain it. i was thinking "oh sh*t!" the entire movie. it's quiet, it's intense, and surprises even the most seasoned horror fan, though i wouldn't categorize this as such.<br /><br />Paddy's character is both welcoming and menacing at the same time, a perfect acting job, he should have received some recognition for this. instead American audiences know almost nothing of this film. <br /><br />I have become such a fan of Paddy Considine and will watch whatever he comes out with from now on, he simply makes brilliant choices as to what to associate himself with. there's a lot of passion on his part. that alone makes for a worthwhile viewing experience.
