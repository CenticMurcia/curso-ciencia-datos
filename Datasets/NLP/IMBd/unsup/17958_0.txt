Abandon Ship is my #1 choice of any movie to divide any group of people into argument; a story of true history and unprecedented command decision by a captain, in this case the captain of a lifeboat loaded up with far too many people and isolated 2000 miles from land.<br /><br />The decisions made by the captain were harsh but not cruel, always with the intended purpose of effectively saving lives, but going against commonly accepted morality.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to write a longer review of this picture. Many films claim to be mesmerizing; few are. This one fits the description. No matter what your viewpoint, it'll engross you to the core. Seek this one out ASAP.
