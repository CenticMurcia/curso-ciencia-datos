I saw this movie when I was 9. I've always loved to dance, this movie made me want to do just that. In the scene when Wrenn is teaching Willard to dance, great dancing song. And of course at the end- like one of the best dancing songs of the 80's period. The movie just had great acting, a good storyline, and wonderful dancing and lots of energy! One of Kevin Bacon's best performances as an actor, thats good cuz he was young in this movie. It was just one of my favorite movies of all time. Even now when I watch it on TV, almost everyday I always get up and dance. Its such a fun movie. And its about loving something and being determined to get it. A real classic.
