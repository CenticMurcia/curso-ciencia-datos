I was just happy to see Dourif in the role of good guy for once. The story itself was dark and seedy, almost. The mad painter....the strippers....yeah, kind of a turn off if you want a half decent story-line. But, the paintings were very nice and there was a definite dark intensity to the painting, to the painter and even Dourif, himself. It proves that he can pull off a lead role, and it is too bad that even after this movie's release fourteen years ago, he is still just moving through movies as part of a film's additional cast. He deserves so much more as an actor. People apparently do not see his talent the way most of his fans do. Vive la Brad!!!
