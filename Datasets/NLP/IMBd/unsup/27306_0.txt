This is one of the few movies I have ever walked out of the theater from. I was sitting there thinking, why am I wasting this hour? There is absolutely no characterization to speak of, so you won't feel anything for any character enough to bother even seeing what happens. It simply can't matter. Thus I still have no idea how it ends, and I walked out of it over 10 years ago...
