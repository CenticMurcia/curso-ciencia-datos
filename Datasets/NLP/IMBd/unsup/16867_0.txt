Just about my favorite black and white movie. And a fine mystery at that. Cotton, Wells, Valli and the rest of the cast all fit their roles. Hyde-White as Crabbin injects that bit of surprise into the movie. Valli gives you that hopeless feeling that many people felt after the war. I cant think of anyone else that could have done the roles better. The chase scenes are legend. You just cant find movies like this anymore.
