First and foremost, this movie is based on one of the most successful video game franchises in history. The games are wonderfully created and each one gets better than the last. I was excited when I heard this movie was coming out, because I am a fan of the games. I was unable to see it in the theater, so I had to rent it. It was a little upsetting to see Freddie Prinze Jr and Matthew Lillard as Maverick and Maniac. I do not feel that these two were able to capture the true spirit of these characters completely, although Lillard is close. I would have preferred Mark Hamill and Tom Wilson in this movie to stay true to the games, who knows the movie may have been more successful. At any rate, if anyone sees this movie and has NOT played the games, please don't be harsh. The movie was surprisingly close to the game in most areas. Granted the technology was greater in the game, but you can do more with that format. All in all this was a good movie with a very strong story, albeit subpar acting at times, but good nonetheless. My challenge to anyone who has seen and badmouthed this movie is to compare this movie to every other movie-based-on-a-videogame. I'm certain that this one will be in the top ten of anybody's list.
