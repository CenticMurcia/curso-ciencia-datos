I have read the comments of the academic from 2004. Now is the age of Obama and it looks like "The Man" missed the mark. It seems that everyone in the media and democrat party is trying to save this president and in turn; disrespect the constitution of this country. James Earl Jones is, and always has been, a terrific actor. In this movie he is backed up by some of the best of the supporting actor universe. As you can see from the previous comment, this is more than about just a movie. The question should be asked does the race of the President require that no criticism be cast on his (or her)actions,that no honest and fair debate be held, or that all policies be acquiesced to just because of race. This movie is optimistic in that a good, qualified man found himself in the seat of power by accident.He was worthy of that power and had to fight the good fight. He did not travel the globe apologizing for his country or displaying the trappings of power for the sake of self aggrandizement. James Earl Jones was an American, raised as American with American values. I wish reality could be the same.
