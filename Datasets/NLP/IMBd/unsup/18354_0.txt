Just saw this yesterday and it was my favorite kind of indie film-low budget and charming! Crispin Glover was terrific in it, nice to see his range in a 'normal', everyday-guy role and he he really pulled it off! Tatum O'Neal was impressive, despite her addiction problems, she still has the talent. She and Glover made a great screen pairing, they really had great chemistry and worked well together. Jane Spencer really assembled a great group of talented actors, there wasn't one bad performance among them. Too bad a lot of them haven't been heard from since this 12 year-old film. There were some really creative filming, camera decisions made and I can see why this was nominated for a Sundance Grand Jury prize. The only complaint I have is that the film was also low-budget when it came to sound quality, and a lot of the dialogue was hard to decipher. I give this film a 7/10.
