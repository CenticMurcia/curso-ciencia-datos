The Living Dead Girl stars the beautiful Francoise Blanchard as Catherine Valmont who comes back from the dead for one of two reasons. Either a chemical spill or an unfulfilled blood pact she made as a child. It's open for interpretation. Catherine begins killing as soon as she comes from her coffin. She then goes to her childhood home, a rather large mansion, and this is where most of the film takes place.<br /><br />There is a nice amount of gore in this as Catherine eats as couple of people and kills several more. She also becomes more herself and less a mindless killing machine as she drinks the blood of her victims. There is conflict when she begins to fight her homicidal urges as her lifelong friend, Helene (Marina Pierro), wants her to return to normal no matter how many people would need to die. The result of this conflict is a lot of blood splatter. There are also several shots of full frontal nudity on display throughout which should keep the fans of sleaze happy.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the music doesn't do this film justice but the atmosphere stays thick regardless.<br /><br />One of my favorite movies. Recommended to fans of gore and sleaze and a must for fans of Jean Rollin.
