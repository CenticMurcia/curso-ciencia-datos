What? I think not. I thought this show was pretty damn good. And it had more than three episodes. The actual number was closer to thirteen. While the Matrix connection was an unfortunate coincidence, the setting was very intriguing and I loved both D.B. Sweeney and Terry O'Quinn. It's the show that could'a, would'a, should'a been great. Even now'a'days for some reason I still imitate Sweeney's little mutter of "Santiago!" You gotta hate that Santiago guy. It's been a long time since I saw the show, but I'm just a sucker for the kind of universe the Harsh Realm was. It was like Lord of the Flies, but instead of children everybody was Special Forces! How cool is that?<br /><br />The world of Harsh Realm would make a sweet massively multi-player online game, anybody else agree?
