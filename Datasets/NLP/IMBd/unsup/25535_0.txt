Whoever claimed "The Two Mrs Carrolls" was Bogie at his worst in terms of movie making is nuts; Bogie's worst film is either "Swing Your Lady" or "The Return of Doctor X." Them films were horrid and I can barely sit through them.. I found "Carrolls" quite interesting and somewhat freaky...<br /><br />I do admit, as far as explaining Bogie's character (Geofrey Carroll) with being mentally ill, the story is vague there... Their really is no reason or explanation as to why he tires of his wife / wives and decides to kill them off one by one after painting a morbid portrait of them....<br /><br />Anyway, regardless of what critics think of this film effort from 1947, I think Bogie, Stanwyck, Alexis Smith and Nigel Bruce made a good cast and crew... Even the young Ann Carter was good as Bogie's daughter 'Beatrice' in the movie....<br /><br />I have noticed that the excellent network TCM rarely ever shows this picture...... I myself had to wait for over a year to finally record and obtain it for my collection here recently.... I rate the film a 7 out of a possible 10 points...... I never hand out 10s, either..... 9 is usually my top digit number given..... Cheerio....<br /><br />MR.BILL Raleigh
