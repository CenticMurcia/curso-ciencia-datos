These are our fellow mammals....and they are highly social creatures.....it is easy to see their rules of engagement....maybe we should reflect and adapt?? For my part, this is a wonderful reflection on how nature exists as well as an interestingly creative documentary with a "soap opera" type of story progression. I wish they would show an episode with how the series is filmed as well as a summary on the demise/ascension of the various meerkats. I really miss Shakepseare and want to know more about what happened to him. He was a hero meerkat, indeed. A wonderfully touching story with all of the stark realities of life. Worth the while.
