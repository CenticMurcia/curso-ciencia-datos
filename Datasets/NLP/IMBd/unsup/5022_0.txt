A muddled plot, directed in an extremely middling manner by Norman Lee, yet distinguished by the vibrant Lilli Palmer in the lead role. Mr Lunge's somewhat erratic hero seems as far at sea as the rest of us, but Leslie Banks has himself a grand old time as the villain. He receives some wonderful assistance too from his assistants, particularly Cathleen Nesbitt as a spooky maid of all work and Robert Montgomery as a vampire-visaged servant.<br /><br />There are some occasions when Messrs Norman Lee, Ernest Palmer and Charles Gilbert manage to overcome an obviously limited budget to produce a few genuine thrills and atmospheric effects. All the same, they manage to work up very little suspense or even a passing interest in the plot. Pedestrian direction is the chief hindrance, but soporifically unfunny comic relief from Gina Malo, Richard Bird and even Mr Lunge himself doesn't help either. In short, this movie amounts to second-rate Edgar Wallace. If you're neither a Palmer or a Banks fan, give it a miss!
