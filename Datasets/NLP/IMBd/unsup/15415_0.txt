This movie is hard to score because it excels at one thing while failing miserably at another. It's about the end of Earth, (something like that) and the following chaos that follows. I'm sure that some point was lost in it's translation, but the movie does not seem to have a goal or distinct message, except for survival, which may be the message. The two lead characters are VERY weak and seem to have no chemistry at all. They don't even seem like they could, or would fall in love. And any other characters you meet are not explored to any extent, and I don't know why not because in parts this movie seems to DRAG-ON for decades! It gets really slow, but if it added something to the story I would not mind but it's slow for SLOWNESS sake, as if to fill up the 1 1/2 with mindless banter. Well that's the bad, and now the good, the effects are the best catastrophe-movie effects I have ever seen BAR-NONE! They completely beat any inane American Movie of the genre, and probably for 10% of what Hollywood over-spends for effects. Everything looked pretty real, the Horizon was always ash-covered and the cities really looked bombed out, and the meteors towards the end looked REALLY good, blasting through buildings like they were mere paper. Actually, the effects are the only reason to watch the movie but it does impart a feeling of dispare and survival, but the story needed more work.
