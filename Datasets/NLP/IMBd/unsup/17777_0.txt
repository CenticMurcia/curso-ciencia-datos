Back in the 70s I really loved this show but that mainly had to do with there not being a lot of sci/fi shows on TV at the time plus I was only 6 years old and didn't know any better. However, re-watching it, I was quite disappointed. The sets and costumes and even the special effects were actually rather good but not more impressive than UFO four or five years earlier. Main main problems with Space 1999 is the weak story lines and the casting. The stories to me are positively weird, a lot of them being fairly esoteric and ending in a rather anti-climactic way. Maybe I should try watching under the influence of stimulants but some of the stories resemble more a bad acid trip than a TV show. I think you could have discussion about the meaning of some episodes as though you were discussing a Bunuel film. The casting is not very convincing either. Barry Morse looks like an OAP walking around in his payamas and Barbara Bain as love interest is beyond words. So give me UFO any time but Space 1999 really is strange.
