even in the beginning i was seriously wondering, did they even WATCH the scenes they edited? surely there had to be a better take..... the bloopers at the end weren't funny either.. the movie was more hilarious than those little "woopsies" of the actors (who, by the way, were absolutely horrendous). there were MANY scenes where the film crew's shadows showed up. and in the scene after the 2 girls have their first encounter with farmer brown and knock him out by gently tapping his shoulder with a shovel, they wander BACK into the farm house to... well, i don't really know why... to investigate, i guess... they end up in a bathroom where they find news clippings and blah blah blah. at the end of the scene, they are startled by nothing and in the corner of the screen you see a man's hand holding up a lantern to light the set. by the end of the movie, i was really hoping he would just kill them all. i stayed watching just to see if he would. but apparently a small girl's punch to the face can easily knock him down. oooo! what a scary villain! AND!!! that butcher guy.. his beard was TOTALLY fake! it looked like they super glued cotton to his face! my high school drama department does a better job at make up and gore than this movie.
