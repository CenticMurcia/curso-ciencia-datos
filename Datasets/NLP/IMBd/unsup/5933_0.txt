My mother used to talk this movie up, all the time. At the time I couldn't have bothered. Childish nonsense, I thought. I wasn't into family films at all. And for the most part, I am still not. It was after my mother died recently, I saw it on HBO. I decided to watch. I was pleasantly surprised. The film is wonderful. It kindles that bit of our inner child that we all possess.<br /><br />The film is charming and, really does well at telling a family story of tragedy and loss. With the hope of spring and, thing's that grow.<br /><br />There's a scene where Mary is dreaming where she is a young toddler and is crying for her mother. I was deeply moved.<br /><br />I now understand why my mother loved this film so much.
