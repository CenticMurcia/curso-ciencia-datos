I can't believe that people can call this film "brilliant" with a straight face. "Daring" someone said? It boggles the mind.<br /><br />I cannot think of a single redeeming feature for this film. The characters were unbelievable, the story insipid, the resolution trite and predicatable...amazing. It actually was so bad, I finally registered on imdb to leave comments. I couldn't keep quiet.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of other comments from people that this movie was trying to make a statement. I've read comments that the movie was a brilliant dark comedy. I've heard people say it was a satire of the teen comedy genre...do you see a pattern? Neither do I. That's because this movie doesn't know WHAT it is trying to be! There are a few half hearted attempts at humor (which were far from funny) There were a few "touching moments" (which never worked in the slightest, since the characters were so one dimentional)<br /><br />A perfect example is the love story between Carolyn and Pumpkin. First, she is digusted by him, then he SAYS HER NAME. The next scene, she is in love with him. Boom. Like that. Yeah, I can see that.<br /><br />I'm so frustrated with this movie. Maybe that's what the director wanted. Maybe he wanted a reaction. I suppose, if that's the case, he's gotten what he wanted out of me. I just wish my disgust wasn't what he had been aiming for...
