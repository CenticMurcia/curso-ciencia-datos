This film has got to be one of the worst sequels ever produced. The plot line was poor, confusing and the ending was really unclear. <br /><br />Characters who were in it just disappeared without any fuss. <br /><br />No where near as good as number one. <br /><br />This sequel goes down in flop history with:<br /><br />Grease 2 & Dirty Dancing 2 <br /><br />Classics having their names ruined with producers who make one film to many!<br /><br />I just wondering if any of the people who have written reviews have actually seen the film??<br /><br />Total waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it at all!!!
