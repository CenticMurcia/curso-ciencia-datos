This Bill Murray vehicle contains a lot of his personal style of off-beat humor which is why perhaps I found it somewhat off-beat. Fortunately, this innovative, different effort at comedy came off as fresh, honest, and disarming as many of the actors were able to try on different characters with good effect. Owen Wilson had probably the most out of style role while Willem Dafoe had a delicious screwball character opportunity. There was a lot going on in this movie including a film with a film, a carefree attitude, along with a harsh, deadening one that seemed to be somewhat jarring for this movie. On the whole, this movie seemed more of an experience, including the somewhat obnoxious antics of Bill Murray whose slightly toned down style preserved then sanity of this movie for me. Seven out of Ten Stars.
