The Ritz Bros. were ending their contract with this studio, and this film was the last in the contract. Most reviewers say this is their WORST film but, having seen most of their films, I TOTALLY disagree.<br /><br />It is their BEST film!<br /><br />Why? First of all, the Ritz Bros. were under the (false!) impression that they are singers & dancers. This film mercifully contains NONE of that!<br /><br />A creepy old house, with a killer known as "The Gorilla" running loose, attempting to murder Lionel Atwill at the stroke of midnite.<br /><br />Bela Lugosi lends some creepy (& comic!) moments, and Patsy Kelly is HILARIOUS!<br /><br />Even tho the plot doesn't make too much sense, this is an extremely enjoyable "Old House" comedy.<br /><br />Norm
