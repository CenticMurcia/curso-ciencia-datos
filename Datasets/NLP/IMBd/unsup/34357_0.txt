This is the worst scary movie I have ever seen! The first one was good, but what the hell happened when they made this one. I mean, come on! How scary is it when a man runs around (or should I say, WALKS around) and kills characters that only have 2 lines, or less. And the end is really sad. not boo hoo sad, just sad! Julie shot the man like 7 times and he still has enough energy to not die, follow her to her house, crawl under a chair (like he would fit), and then pull her under it! I'm sorry But this movie sucks! I Know What I Did Last Summer when I watched this movie... I slept!
