This little gem may be the best news out of Israel in years. There are no politics and no ax to grind. Eytan Fox has simply given us a powerful, bittersweet love story between two soldiers in a remote outpost. It could be anywhere, in any army, at any time. It just happens to be now, and in Israel.<br /><br />With great mastery, Mr. Fox put together a stunning ensemble of characters that are diverse, real, funny, and human. Outstanding are Ohad Knoller as Yossi, commander of the unit, and Yehuda Levi as his lover. Opposites attract: Yossi is a career man who has stepped out of character to love Jagger, is terrified of discovery, and reluctant to declare his love; Jagger, so nick-named because of his seductive rock star looks (Mick was sexy, but never this sweet and seraphically beautiful), is a free spirit who is beginning to demand that they live in the open. The two fight over this just before a disastrous foray into dangerous territory. Their parting will break your heart with its profound sense of lost possibilities and opportunities. One yearns for a happier ending for these two sincere, sensual, loving men.
