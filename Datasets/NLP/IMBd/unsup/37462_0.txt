The Trip starts as eight college friends begin a trip from Los Angeles to Arizona for reasons which aren't important, up front in the sports car it's Carl (Larry Bagby) & his girlfriend Devan (Courtney Cole) along with Garry (Michael Chamberlain) & his stash of ecstasy that they plan on selling, then in the off roader it's Devan's sister Cess (Heather Shrake) along with Dana (Elizabeth Keller) & Darius (David Slocum) while in the piece of crap run down car it's Sylvia & Veronica (Cristal Gerrick). The three cars travel across the long winding roads & encounter a dirty blue truck which Carl gets involved in a road rage incident with which turns out to be a bad idea since the driver of the truck then decides to go after the friends & kill them one-by-one...<br /><br />Written, produced & directed by Mark Cross this is another rubbishy zero budget independent horror themed piece of nonsense that really is no fun to watch at all. The script takes itself extremely seriously & is a complete total & utter bore from start to finish, virtually nothing happens that could even begin to pass as entertaining & to me by the last 20 odd minutes The Trip felt like it was nothing much more than scenes of cars driving along edited together between a few dull than dull conversation's amongst some very annoying teenage character's. There is a bit of a story here & it all ends with an absolutely horrible sentimental message which you feel is close to the director's heart in the way it comes across. The story itself is thin, it makes little sense, there's no real explanation to anything that's going on, there are more than a few holes in it & the twists are extremely obvious & predictable in a 'I worked out that was going to happen 20 minutes ago' sort of way. Then there's the fact The Trip is incredibly boring & slow, there are huge chunks of this film where virtually nothing happens & it nearly put me to sleep on several occasions.<br /><br />Director Cross can't write a good horror film but he has some technical competence & The Trip is reasonably well made, I'd have said it was well made if not for the fact the colours are very muted & during the night scenes you can barely see anything. The Trip isn't scary in the slightest, it has zero tension or atmosphere & it hasn't a single drop of blood in the film as people are run over in very unspectacular ways.<br /><br />The budget was obviously low on The Trip, the so-called action scenes between the various cars lack any excitement or pace & they can't even afford to show anyone actually run over as it's mostly hint's & suggestions. The acting is generally on the wrong side of average.<br /><br />The Trip seems to be quite an obscure film & to be honest you should be thankful that it is & hope that it stays that way. Zero scares, zero gore, zero excitement, zero sense & zero entertainment.
