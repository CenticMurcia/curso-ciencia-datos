Aside from JFK, the English civil war is my favourite period of history. So it was going to be a set of very bad reviews to keep me away.<br /><br />Yes there are inaccuracies, Scott is a terrible actor and they overdo the modernist slant. However I really enjoyed this, Roth and Everett are always watchable.
