For the Limited Edition DVD-R. This film was leagues more interesting that I expected it to be--my girlfriend REALLY wanted to see it, though.<br /><br />Lay back, sort of sleepy, watch the film. Some early on-screen direction annoyed me but it didn't last far into the film.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with the book, but this film is a helluva lot of fun and it brings about some great self-questioning about the perception of consensus reality.<br /><br />The creativity expressed in the various worlds was quite amusing. And it's mostly a family film but there's some language kids might repeat the next day at school (and get in trouble) and there's some very strange violence :)<br /><br />Well worth a shot, though.
