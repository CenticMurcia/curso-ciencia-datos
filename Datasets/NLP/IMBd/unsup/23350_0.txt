I was lucky enough to catch this one during a visit to Manhattan earlier this year. I sort of forgot about it but seeing it listed on the IMDb jogged my memory. This is in the spirit of those 1970s films with a wronged woman out for bloody revenge. In general you can tell that this is a low budget production all around but there is a genuine spark with the director/star and most of the acting. Since I don't have it on tape or DVD to check the character's names, I'm sure if I remember who was who. But the lead villain was kind of weak, there could have been a better casting choice there. He came across too soft to be real and like he was reading the script as he was going along and overall not very believable. It would of improved the overall quality if they had someone better in that role. The lead actress, Tiffany Sinclare is strong and gives a very interesting performance. When she is on the screen you are drawn like a magnet to watch. The Turkish guy who plays one of the bad guy's henchmen is also very good and you can tell he should have a good career ahead of him. The scenes with the police are also not too strong and could have been better done. There is a lot of violence, violence towards women especially, so steer clear if that bothers you. But there's a good tight story with a touch of the ghostly supernatural. This would make for a good Halloween night film showing.
