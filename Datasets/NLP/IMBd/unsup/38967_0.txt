I had actauly written a negative review of this one on imdb only a few days ago. By sheer coincidence I saw this movie again about 24 hours after I wrote the review(purely coincidental)<br /><br />I had seen this when it first came out and then seen part of it again and did not like it AT ALL. My main problem was that it seemed contrived, I mean actually the movie kind of made me bewildered, I didn't understand the humer in it.<br /><br />Well, I saw it again, the person I saw it with told me it was based on a true story, this was confirmed by imdb user comments. Knowing that, it changes my views on the movie. I honestly had no idea an incredible event like this ACTUALLY happened and knowing that can view the film differently and understand why so many loved it.<br /><br />I love you to death will never be my favoroite movie but knowing what I do now I can say it's an interesting one(I just wish I'd known the true facts when I saw this years ago).<br /><br />
