Seth Green took hold of the screen in every scene he was in. Some of his character's lines could have NEVER been pulled off by any one else. Another thing that set this movie off for me was not only Green's character's line but the delivery. He did not just give a line, he punched them to the viewer. His vibrancy and energy flowed magically. <br /><br />I have to say I was happily surprised by this movie. I original rented a) Because it looked to be scary, and I love scary/thriller movies; b)Seth Green.<br /><br />Plus to watch Seth Green try to kiss another man just made my day! Seth really made this movie for me.<br /><br />If you have not seen it do!
