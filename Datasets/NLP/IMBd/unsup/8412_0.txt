ST:DS9:01 - "Emissary" (Stardate: 46379.1) - this is part 1 of the 2-part pilot episode of "Deep Space Nine", the 3rd new series in the world of Star Trek. We begin with in Stardate 43997 during the first Borg attack on Earth in the TNG episode "The Best Of Both Worlds", where we see the soon-to-be Commander Sisko (played by Avery Brooks) as an officer on one of the Federation ships trying to attack the Borg cube (under the command of the newly assimilated Picard - now known as the Borg Locutus). In the process the Saratoga is destroyed, along with his wife (however his son Jake does survive).<br /><br />Now, forward 3 years to the present - Sisko is offered the command of the remote station Deep Space Nine, which is situated on the edge of Federation space, a station that only until recently belonged to the Cardassians. The station also orbits planet Bajor, a planet that has just gained independence from the aforementioned Cardassians. The Bajorans, as a Federation protectorate, allows the Federation to control the station, though they have their officers there (including the hot-tempered Major Kira Nerys). Also along for the ride are Dr. Bashir, the shape-shifting Constable Odo, the sneaky Ferengi Quark (who owns a bar on the station), the Trill Jadzia Dax (who knows Sisko from a previous body the Trill inhabited), and the newly promoted Chief O'Brien (from the TNG Enterprise) and his family.<br /><br />While Sikso and crew must bring the station up to speck, they start investigating an anomaly - one that will have far repercussions for this sector of the galaxy. At the same time, Sisko must deal with his own nemesis, that of Picard (whom he associates with the death of his wife) who comes to the station. Sisko must also decide whether to stay as Commander of Deep Space Nine.<br /><br />A worthy introduction to a new (and darker) Star Trek world.
