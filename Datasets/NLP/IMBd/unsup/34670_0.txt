Comments from other reviewers lead me to believe that this movie has some resonance for mid-life challenged males. Who am I to argue with that? But for everyone else, this is just pathetic and embarrassing nonsense. A very low budget film that (obviously) went direct to video and never went near a theatre. My husband rented it because the box said something about a "menage a trois" and he thought it would have some sex scenes. Well, it does, but they are so boring and tame that they would be laughed off a daytime soap opera. Sheryl Lee is very attractive in a down-to-earth way, but William Petersen (CSI) and Gary Cole (One Hour Photo) are tired and out of shape and have this hang dog look to them that suggests the whole enterprise is just plain embarrassing...which it is.<br /><br />I find nothing sympathetic in the plight of fabulously successful and wealthy white upper class men who abandon their wives and children, take their life savings and go to the Phillipines to blow $200,000 on A.) debauchery and B.) building some kind of God-awful bamboo structure that is supposed to be a motel or bed&breakfast or something. The plot and dialogue are so lame and unbelievable it is hard to imagine the actors finding this project palatable so I have to figure they wanted the free trip to the Phillipines. Trust me, this one won't be appearing on anybody's career resume.<br /><br />Despite the potentially gorgeous surroundings, the cinematography is very poor and of a TV movie quality. It was apparently filmed on location in the Phillipines, but you'd hardly know it, it could have been filmed in Hawaii or even Florida. The use of Leonard Cohen songs throughout is done poorly...the songs don't have any relevance to the actions going on and seem to be just plunked into place.<br /><br />Terrance Stamp has a small, lame part as a Buddhist monk who is inexplicably allowed to have sex and drink alcohol. There are so many low points in this movie, I would be cruel to list them all, but the worst is when all the main characters are swimming nude, and they stand up in shallow water to greet the monk...we are forced to view their saggy, pudgy naked behinds and trust me, it's not a pretty moment.<br /><br />A film utterly devoid of sympathetic emotion, and out of touch with any reality I'm aware of (but then I am not a bored, rich white male). The use of titillation (a three way!) to try and sell this bloated tripe is just out and out pathetic. This is a huge waste of time to sit through, even if it pops up on cable, so I suggest you avoid it. You have better things to do with your time.
