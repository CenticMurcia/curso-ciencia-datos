Though the Ritz brothers are no Three Stooges, I'll be damned if they didn't make this one fun movie. Here they play 3 inept detectives hired to solve the Gorilla murders. The plot is pretty basic fare for these "old dark house" style mysteries, but it was done better than most in the way that it didn't make it's culprit too obvious. Most of the cast is hilarious, not just the Ritz Brothers. Patsy Kelly, who plays the maid, is great fun in that "spunky 30's woman" kind of way. Bela Lugosi is also great as the ever suspicious butler. It does have some downfalls, mostly the non-comedic cast who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. All in all, this is a goofball mystery that comes recommended by me.<br /><br />7.5/10
