Don't get me wrong, I liked the initial Legend of the Overfiend, but man, Munnihausen, Jr. sure is cool. I don't quite know where this story fits into the first's, though I have read that some people prefer to view it as an alternate storyline. The animation is good and not much has been cut out of the original edit (if you are watching the cut version). My only complaint would be the lack of screen time that this film allots to Amano, who is clearly the best character. If you're having a hard time finding this film to rent, you shouldn't look for it in Blockbuster or Hollywood video. Although Hollywood video used to rent the edited versions of the film, I guess they stopped when they realized that kids could rent them (in all honesty the covers do no justice to the graphic content).
