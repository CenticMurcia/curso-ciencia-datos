the movie was bad, couldn't understand half the words, movie was too long and contained random inappropriate scenes in an attempt to recapture the viewers attention.<br /><br />there was fast cars, high class but, there were never really used , only 2 shooting scenes, and 1 car scene.This movie was a waste of money and time, i will like to see how much profit is made!<br /><br />also, if you do decided to go to this movie, it would be wise to take a book with you ,as you will get bored. <br /><br />The characters as well, need to speak more clearly.<br /><br />.
