This one has quite an interesting cast -- Giancarlo Giannini of Lina Wertmueller fame plus loads of seventies dolls -- and nice decors, but it doesn't help. The script is bland, predictable and wouldn't have been accepted for any substandard TV show; the pacing is lame, and even the killings are boring -- a capital sin in a so-called "giallo", and another proof that director Paolo Cavara wasn't quite on a par with, let's say, Sergio "Torso" Martino. However, the opening scene is cool, clever and supersexy, including Ennio Morricone's perhaps most lascivious score: three minutes of style and foot fetishism that are unsurpassed in "giallo" history. After that, get ready for a huge disappointment.
