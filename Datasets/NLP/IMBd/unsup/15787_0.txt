i agree with all you've spoken of here and i will see this movie based on that. society has a long way to go, but with people crusading constantly we will make it there one day. i'm a straight man but believe that everyone has the right to be who they feel they are and not brainwashed by religion and the bible which can be interpreted to mean anything.i'm a believer of Jesus-being a man(preacher)back 2000 years or so,why not,but having beliefs based on a book that as far as we know has been doctored over the years over and over by the church to suit whatever needs they have,seems silly.anyway i have discussions about this daily at work.keep up the good work as you have been for all this time.take care
