The all star cast delivers all star performances in this first rate drama. I won't alliterate the story line, anymore than I have in the Summary, but this work was very compelling, demonstrating a realism seldom found in these types of works. Do not be surprised to find yourself emotionally invested in these characters and their plight.<br /><br />While I do not watch it often as the subject matter is quite serious, I do consider it one of my favorites of this genre. The story is great, sadly so, but great. And as I said before, the performances are about the best to be found.<br /><br />It rates an 8.8/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
