The Puppet Master series is comprised of really awful movies featuring really cool puppets. The puppets, who sometimes are shown moving in stop-motion animation (very cool), are neat little killers each with their own little gimmick. The series' best entry was part three ("Toulon's Revenge"), but the following two installments were undeniably terrible, so it should've come as no surprise that I hated this, the most recent film and sixth part of the series.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this is directed by the same guy who directed part three (the best) and was edited by J.R. Bookwalter (I've never seen it, but apparently his film "The Dead Next Door" is pretty good) it is really, really boring. The characters are uninspired, the sets are run of the mill, and the killings are non-existent (despite one okay moment when Tunneler drilled a guy in the crotch. I guess the only good part of the movie was inspired by America's Funniest Home Videos).<br /><br />Worst of all, the puppets hardly ever make an appearance, and when they do they are obviously being held up by just-out-of-the-frame stage hands. There's hardly ANY stop-motion animation. I was also disappointed that Torch, one of the cooler puppets, was not in the film, even though he appeared in the credit sequence (which was a montage of footage from the previous movies).<br /><br />In short: Don't see this movie. It stinks!
