I just saw this movie on SciFi and I am lucky to have shambled across it. First of all, it has real people from Alabama portraying people from Alabama, so there are no horrible saccharin southern accents. Secondly, it ties together aliens, the government and the undead which any conspiracy theorist will tell you is a no-BRAINer. Third, and this is all you need to know, it is filled to bursting with zombie goodness! And who doesn't like zombies? I think its great that this movie is playing on late night TV. It is far superior to the made for TV crap starring whatever latest dork just crawled off the back page of Soap Opera Digest that usually haunts the SciFi channel. And yes, the "Coke is superior to Pepsi" monologue is the stuff that fun budget movies are made of. Only the characters in this movie aren't just spouting smug self conscious dialogue; they're getting off zombie head shots while they deliver the laughs. This is what Troma would like to be, and what Kevin Smith doesn't have the balls to be. I give it two thumbs up...a zombies butt!
