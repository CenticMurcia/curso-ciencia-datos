It turned out to be a mess.<br /><br />"Death By Dialogue" is your typical low budget direct to video crap that is produced after someone's fame. The movie's tag line shown in the cover is "Staring Ken Sagoes, the survivor from "A Nightmare On Elm Street Part III". Sagoes character, Roland Kincaid became an instant favorite on the Elm Stree series and it's very lame to cast him only because of that and worse, make publicity on him.<br /><br />Anyways, "Death By Dialogue" is a joke. There's involuntary humor, cheesy (I mean CHEESY) f/x and boring situations that could desperate the most patient Horror fan. This isn't a must see even to criticize or laugh about. Please, stay away from this trash and don't get fooled by the cover art or the premise, which is as dumb as you can get.<br /><br />Ugh.
