This movie is really poor in script, bringing an ancient-over-used formula. Maybe the scene or the actors could save it, but, in fact, it reduced all the crew to a poor B-movie. I'm very sad, because this movie took my money, my time and got me in trouble with my family. I feel like a real dumb. I really like Natalie Portman's work, but in this movie she laugh like an idiot and act like a starter. I really don't get why she submit herself at a movie like that. Dustin is, as always an excellent actor, but c'mon, he didn't need a tittle like this one. The only exception of the crew was the boy, Zach Mills, he really put some color in the picture. My little daughter, 5 years, begun to kick the chair in front of us with 15 minutes from the start and my older, 9 years, got sickness in the middle. Don't watch it... Waste of time, money and others.
