It just didn't work.<br /><br />Alien nun? WTF? Alien taxi driver? And he tries to kill his passenger for what reason? They live in Mexico? Where where they the rest of the time? So why are they suddenly just killing people when Ben Cross and the Blonde chick come into town? Wasn't good...wasn't scary, wasn't science fiction...just wasn't workable.<br /><br />The writers could have come up with something more creative for the paycheck...and the locations could have been chosen better too.<br /><br />Basically, it all could have been better.<br /><br />Yeah...as far as sequels go...it should be written by the same people - especially if the script was big enough to have a sequel.
