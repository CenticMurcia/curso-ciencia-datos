Just when you thought this film series couldn't make LESS sense, here comes "The Prodigal Planet" to show us how very wrong we are.<br /><br />The great awfulness starts in the beginning, where preacher man from the last movie has SOMEHOW gone back in time and is now not on the guillotine where he ended movie #3 but is walking down a passageway to the guillotine. A blonde woman saves him as she's dressed up in a fake military outfit with a fake mark. So....they bust out of the base (preacher man doesn't really find it odd that she was able to smuggle herself onto a military base presided over by a GLOBAL force but....anywho). No mention is ever really made of the preacher man's dead friends from the last film...he kinda just forgets them and moves on to our next bunch of misfits.<br /><br />Other than blonde woman, preacher man starts a road trip with some women and her bratty teenage daughter who they run into in a nuclear disaster zone brimming with zombie mutants. Apparently our main characters are immune to radiation as they just walk around in the contaminated air. One of the zombies ISN'T evil and he's a teenage boy so he hooks up with the girl. By 'hooks up' I mean they hold hands or something, this being a Christian movie, so we never figure out if his parts still work. <br /><br />Lots of driving and stuff happens as they're going to some caves where all the Christians live now waiting for Jesus. Oh, evil hippie man whose wife got killed by a giant bee last movie is hunting them too. It's kind of like "Wild at Heart" without the sex. La dee da....zombie boy takes a bullet for the girl or something (I'm still pretty sure she doesn't even give him a kiss as thanks or anything), it turns out blondie actually DOES have the mark and she was just pretending to be a Chrisitan pretending to have the mark (?). Not that we have to worry about her for very long cause Jesus takes her out with a train collision. Anyway, preacher man and the mom and her daughter get to the Christ caves and evil hippie dies during an earthquake.<br /><br />Amen
