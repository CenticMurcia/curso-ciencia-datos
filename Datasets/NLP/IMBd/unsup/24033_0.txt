Re-lace my tennis shoes, count the number of cracks on my bedroom wall, and rearrange the fuzz in my navel. These are just a few of the things I would have liked to do instead of watch this movie. I wasn't tired or stressed, I had just finished off a pot of Green Mountain coffee and I still managed to doze off for a minute or two during the movie. The plot was ok but the best way to describe this movie is just plain boring. There is barely any action (unless you call seeing Stalone's aged and vein-ridden muscles action) and when there was a car chase or fight scene, it was just ... boring. There were a few twists to the story but these were barely enough to keep me watching until the end. If you have a choice between shaving every hair on your body with a rusty razor while standing on a beach ball or watching this movie, I would go with the rusty razor.
