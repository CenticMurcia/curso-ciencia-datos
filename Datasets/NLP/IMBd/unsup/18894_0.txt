Quite a surprise, topical clever and compulsive viewing. This film did run true to life in many ways, the characters are easy to identify with. The housewife sexually unsatisfied by her husband who apparently arrives home from a very stressful job of work and immediately falls asleep. The impression being that this is a regular occurrence. I was a bit puzzled though by the facial damage on a person who had'nt been to the match. Much of this film required intelligent imagination as it did'nt waste its time filling in what they thought was unnecessary detail. I'm sure many of those involved in terrorist incidents in London over the past 30 odd years will identify with one character or another.<br /><br />It's a pity it has'nt gained the popularity it deserves now being released to TV only a year after production. Some very good acting by the 2 lead parts.
