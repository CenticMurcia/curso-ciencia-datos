how can the apparently gifted director and screenwriter who gave us the brilliant teen cult movie Ghost World, produce this load of crap?!<br /><br />it is like they have no touch at all with the two factors they are dealing with: art, and being young. The whole thing is one big clich√©. For example when they make the students compliment the childish paintings of cars and tanks. It is unwatchable!!! <br /><br />When you make movies about something, you have to be true and humble towards the subject; that is if your intention is the celebrate with a slice of criticism. If you want teen movie, watch Superbad. If you want art, watch Basquiat or Pollack..<br /><br />couldn't bare to watch more than half of it<br /><br />RIDICULOUS MOVIE! don't watch it..
