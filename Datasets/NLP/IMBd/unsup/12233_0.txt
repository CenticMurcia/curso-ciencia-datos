I was deeply moved by this thoughtful and sensitive documentary about the life of a young girl in Bangkok. We have become a disposable society and in this story, we manage to dispose of people as well. It made me feel helpless and frustrated especially watching the portrayal of the European low life with his stupid grin. Most other documentaries about the sex trade in Thailand is sensationalized and glamourized. Not this one, it draws us in and shows us what really goes on behind the smile. I was hoping for a happy ending, for some goodness to come through, for some hope. I recommend this documentary to every one, it could even be shown in high schools. Maybe it will shame some people into not going to Bangkok to indulge in the sex trade and exploitations of these poor people.
