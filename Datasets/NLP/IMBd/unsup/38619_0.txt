This show is absolutely one of the worst things anyone has ever spent money to make. Tim and Eric are NOT funny, the sketches have NO subtlety, and the jokes seem to be aimed at a 3-7 year old audience. These people think their humor is "fresh and inventive" and "comic genius". What is genius about two guys getting as naked as cable will allow, and throwing up all over each other? They try and play off the angle that they appear incompetent, intentionally acting poorly and screwing up line delivery. The only thing funny about a terrible show is that someone actually thinks it was good. When you do it on purpose, we all know its a gag, and their is nothing left but a lame show that retards would easily identify as stupid. Totally awful, do yourself a favor and never watch this crap.<br /><br />And if Adult Swim keeps going down this road, I'd stop watching that cheap garbage and wait for the next "smart" network to pick up the good shows. Its bound to happen, adult swim had to come from somewhere.
