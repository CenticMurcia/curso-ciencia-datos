Analyze This is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. Being a huge fan of the crime genre, i thought it spoofed the those type of films perfectly by not going so far as to mock them. It also shows Robert De Niro's by far funniest performance, as well as Billy Crystal. These two have excellent chemistry and a great supporting role by Chazz Palminteri gives the whole movie an authentic and believable feel. The best part and one of the most hilarious scenes in cinema has to be when Crystal must pose as a mobster and gives a speech at a meeting with all the five families present. And also De Niro' first visit to Crystal's has me rolling on the floor in laughter.<br /><br />Analyze This, while underrated by a lot of folks, is one of the best comedies you'll ever see. 9/10
