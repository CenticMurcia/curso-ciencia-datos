beautiful but comics. It is useless, here you have paraocchi and unilateral ways of thinking. Some films from comics are rewarded while others are attacked, this film is like any other. this kind of movie derived from comic books do not convince many people. to me like, after all most recent film hollwood are based on comic books to produce them means that enjoy. Bel film cmq. Voting 5.7 indicates that on this site of horror films are seen evil. I ask minds indipenenti not to build the judgments of others and to reward and films but without being too strict. I would try to make a judgement more univoo since this site were underestimated masterpieces by Di caprio Titanic and Charlton Heston.
