I just wanted to be a nice guy and find something that I could send to PH to help her out during her incarceration. Well, this one isn't it. It is just so bad on so many levels that it was painful to watch.<br /><br />Aimee Graham hooks up with a loser - It's Joey from Friends! Well, it is Matt LeBlanc before he became the lovable Joey. He is kind of of Fonzi character driving fast in stolen cars while he tokes constantly. He kill someone and guess who goes to jail - Donna (Graham).<br /><br />This is where it really gets bad. She is in jail for what appears to be months before we get a girl on girl hookup (with Teresa DiSpina) and a shower scene. What's up with that? We get food fights in the mess hall and dancing with a mop, but we have to wait until the movie is almost over before a shower scene? At least there wasn't some Pat Ast Matron, but we sure could have used Sybil Danning as the Warden.
