I saw it the day it opened. The print was dirty, scratched, noisy and had numerous dropouts in the audio. Every scene change was preceded by either a dropout or a burst of static. I honestly believe that we got a pre-release work print rather than a finished product. The audio problems were so distracting that the movie lost most of its impact. Lawrence of Arabia it isn't.
