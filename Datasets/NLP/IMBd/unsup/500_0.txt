I was a great fan of The Blues Brothers. When I was a kid, I used to get my dad to rent it every single week (in the days before you could buy it). I'd watch the car chases over and over again, and to this day can recite whole reams of dialogue. BB 2000, I thought, can't be as good, but it must be worth seeing.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />I have tried, but I regret to say that I can find no redeeming features for this movie whatsoever. Not one. The dialogue which once was cool and sharp is stilted, forced, wholly unrecognisable as everyday English. The addition of the little kid and the black "forgotten" brother was pointless pandering to political correctness and family appeal. The car chases were overblown without being entertaining, and the plot was sadly not even laughable. I only kept watching after the first five minutes in the hope of one solitary laugh to give me something positive to write about. No chance. Even the usually excellent John Goodman was well below par, and this is to say nothing of the washed up Ackroyd.<br /><br />Terribly photographed, crippled by being utterly devoid of plot, jokes, charisma and with even the music shoehorned in with no thought to aesthetics or taste, I can honestly say that BB2K ranks alongside root canal work as the least pleasant way one could ever spend time. This film took me two long hours closer to my death. I suggest you do not let it do the same to you.
