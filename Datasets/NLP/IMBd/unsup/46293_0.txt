The movie was an absolute crap imitation of the book. so be warned if you have read the book do not go through the pain of watching this absolute horrific and badly made movie.<br /><br />The producers changed the whole plot and facts including: 1 the egg that Eragon finds looks more like a pill than an egg and when he touches it, it gives him a fat spiral on his hand instead of the shining palm. 2Eragon and Brom go on a journey to track the Razac but in the movie they go straight to the Varden. 3 Eragon doesn't meet Solebum. 4 Angelina doesn't read the correct prophecy. 5 Brom gets killed by Durza instead of the Razac. 6 Katrina doesn't even get shown. 7the dwarfs are not short and whatever happened to Orik. 8 Eragon just happens to know the ancient language. 9 Eragon rescues Arya and she is healthy and doesn't have pointed ears!! 10 the twins don't appear. 11 Durza doesn't give Eragon a scar. 12 Eragon doesn't bless Elva. 13 Farthen Dur is not even shown as it is described in book and there is not star rose that Saphira breaks. 14 Murtagh and Eragon don't spar together. 15 Saphira has feathers on her wings(she a dragon not a bird!!) 16 Eragon doesn't go on flight with Saphira were he gets scars on his knees. 17 Durza conjures up a strange creature instead of just fighting Eragon with a sword.<br /><br />I could keep going forever but i don't have space so i'll just say this; they should make the movie again!!!
