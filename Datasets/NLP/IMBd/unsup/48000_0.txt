Though obviously Michael isn't totally sane, but this, in my opinion, is hugely caused by his (lack of) childhood and the abuse by his father, it isn't said that he is a pedophile. I for certain do not think that he is one. I think that since he missed his youth, he's trying to catch up with that now, and if you see it from that point, have you never had a slumberparty with a friend when you were young? Or climbed a tree for that matter?<br /><br />Martin asked questions in this documentary that were (for the majority) only intended to get Michael to look guilty and bad instead of giving a honest view of Jackson. Also he took the answers, twisted them around, and turned them into the answers he wanted to hear...<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good documentary if you are sane and intelligent enough not to follow Bashir, but just to actually listen to what Michael has to say. For the majority of the people in the world, well, they'll probably go with Martin's profile of MJ, so therefor I've given it a 4<br /><br />
