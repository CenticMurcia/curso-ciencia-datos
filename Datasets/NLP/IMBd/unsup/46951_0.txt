I watched this movie because I thought I'd get some of the Asian-style action movies that I like, or maybe an interesting story based on the what-if situation described in the tag-line. However, the acting is terrible and the movie moves so slowly at times that I found myself fast forwarding and skipping parts of several scenes just to get it over with.. I found watching this movie a waste of time, unless maybe if you are a Corean or Japanese interested in history. Even though the movie picks up a pace at the ending, the overall lousy acting by ALL actors doesn't help the semi-interesting what-if story make an interesting movie. Sorry..
