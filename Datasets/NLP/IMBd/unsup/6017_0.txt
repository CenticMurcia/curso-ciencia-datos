I am currently watching this movie on TCM. I have always loved the Cary Grant/Irene Dunne version called "My Favorite Wife" as well as the Doris Day/James Garner version "Move Over Darling". In the man remarries versions both husbands waited the appropriate amount of time and only just declared their first wives dead and remarried the same day. So they just started their honeymoons and the first wives stopped it before the honeymoon night. In this case the wife remarries - not only after six months but also to her "dead" husband's business partner! Melvyn Douglass and Fred McMurray are great as the husbands in question and it was funny when Bill (McMurray) realizes that his best friend Henry (Douglass) has been sleeping with his wife! It was not actually spoken that he realized it but when Henry talked about having children the realization came to him. It is a wonderful movie, but I do find that Vickie (Jean Arthur), although wonderfully funny, was in reality quite a vixen and quite selfish in this version. Also, for those who do not know, there was a fourth version of this in production called "Something's Gotta Give" with Marilyn Monroe and Dean Martin. This was before "Move Over Darling". Monroe died before the movie was completed and it was canned. I really would like the producers to "dust it off" and maybe complete it. But maybe not enough was done to make it viable.
