Genre: CGI QUITE babyish TV series about robots. Very cute and sweet.<br /><br />My thoughts: A family favourite TV series, I love this above every other TV series (even David Attenborogh ones) for its cuteness, its cleverness, its humour, its music and its weird but lovely CGI! The fact that all the furniture, the flowers and other things are alive and have faces, it makes this show all the more entertaining and weird. The rest of my family love this too, especially my mum, I think it's her favourite children's TV series! :O I think people who didn't like this are missing something and just focus a little too much on the not-so-good points of things. This should also be shown on more channels, such as Cbeebies, it's WAY too unknown!! :Z<br /><br />I like watching episodes really often, especially like the ones with Billy, Pappy and Polly (who are side characters who don't appear in ALL the episodes). They are very cute and very clever! :-) <br /><br />Recommended to: People who like friendly but strange looking CGI, people who like robots and babyish but funny and cute programs. Enjoy! :-) <br /><br />What happens: In each episode, in some way, Olie, a robot, has an adventure, either on his own, with his little sister Zoe, with his dog Spot, with his friend Billy, or in some other wayÂ…
