Before both Ron Howard and Tom Hanks became known for making gooey message movies, they teamed up on this very likable comedy.<br /><br />Hanks plays a man searching for love and finds it in the form of Daryl Hannah. Unfortunately, his dream woman has the habit of growing a tail and gills whenever she gets wet, though in Hanks's world, this isn't necessarily a deal breaker. Eugene Levy is a scientist who wants to capture the mermaid for his own fame, and John Candy is Hanks's loud-mouth brother.<br /><br />Full of memorable scenes, like Hannah scarfing down a lobster, shell and all, at a posh restaurant. Hanks's reply to the disapproving looks of the diners sitting near them: "She's really hungry." <br /><br />Grade: B+
