This is one freaky, well thought movie. I did not expect Ringu 2 to be so good, but I was pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend it. What a sequel!! Ringu 2 is a very Erie movie. I could not stop watching it. It takes right off where Ringu 1 ended. Many scenes of the movie were just terrifying. The one scene in the insane ward where she looks at the TV and it changes and freaks out the whole ward was classic. I liked the American version of Ring 1 better than the Japanese Ringu 1, but I doubt that the American version of the Ring 2 will be as good as the Japanese Ringu 2. The Ringu movies are the best thing to happen to horror movies in a long time. Keep up the good work Hideo Nakata...I can't wait to see the third movie.
