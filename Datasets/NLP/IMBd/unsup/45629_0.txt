Boy have we got a vacation for you! Westworld could be summed up as a very, very, very, VERY BAD movie if it weren't for our Hollywood King, Yul Bryner. Scenes previous to the climax, when the robots went out of control, were very unsatisfying. Though the effects were great for that time, even considerably decent looking back from the 21st century, the body of the movie seemed to be two grown men acting like kids in a toy store. When things went haywire, Yul Bryner became quite the bone-chilling character. I admit, I was at the edge of my seat during the pursuit, and very pleased (and relieved) when Richard Benjamin's character, which to me had the appearance of an attention-deficient 10-year-old with a mustache, showed that he indeed owned intellect. Overall, I gave this movie a 3 out of 10, salvaged by the effects and Yul Bryner's intimidating performance.
