- In the final Hercules made-for-television movie, Hercules is called upon to save a village from a Minotaur. But things are not as simple as they seem. The Minotaur has a secret that Hercules must overcome if he is to save himself and the village.<br /><br />- This is easily the weakest of the five movies that preceded the television series. Half of the running time is filled with flashbacks from the four previous movies. It gets old real quick. The actual battle with the Minotaur is a disappointment as well. The costume worn by the actor playing the Minotaur makes it all but impossible for him to move with any grace during the fight scenes. The relationship between Hercules and Iolaus, which would become one of the highlights of the television series, seems very unnatural. Almost all of the dialogue is designed to set up the next flashback.<br /><br />- Too bad, because this one has a lot of potential. The plot concerning the Minotaur's secret is one of the best in the five movies. Although the way it is handled makes it very obvious for anyone to guess.
