When I saw this movie, I was so involved with the drama and the suffering of Cecilia, that I felt outraged at the end of the movie. My feelings were so hard against Mr Allen that I decided at that moment not to see another movie by him anymore.<br /><br />He is a wonderful director, perhaps a genius, and I'm sure that the rest of his movies, which I have not seen, are works of art. It's only that this one affected me so much.<br /><br />
