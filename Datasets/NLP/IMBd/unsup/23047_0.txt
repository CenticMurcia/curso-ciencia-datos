This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. It is slow, to be sure, but the whole feel of it and the ambiance created are beautiful. It is such a heartfelt story and the cast is excellent. Neil Patrick Harris still comes off very young, but his work as Will is multi faceted. Debbie Reynolds is, as always, a joy to watch, and her restrained performance helps anchor the story. I usually can figure out plot twists from the get-go, but the final revelation of who Lillian is was a complete surprise--heart wrenching and uplifting all at once. If you want an intimate, heartfelt holiday movie don't miss THE Christmas WISH.
