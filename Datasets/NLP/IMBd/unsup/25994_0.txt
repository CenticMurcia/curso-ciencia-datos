I've seen a lot of campy horror films. Heck, I'm a fan. They're funny. But this... it was awful. And not in that good way, but in that very bad way. I couldn't even laugh at it. It was absolutely painful to watch. So you may be wondering why... well for starters there are a bunch of ridiculous make-up effects. These effects aren't bad at all, they're good. Just pointless. When people change into warewolves it makes you think, "what the hell is going on?" instead of "man that's creepy". Then there's the horrendous dialog and acting. It sounds like they're reading a phone book when they should be sounding scared and anxious. The plot is also bad, like it's a re-make of the original howling only oversimplified and dumbed down to an annoying degree.<br /><br />I recommend you not watch this... but if you want to, try and see how far you can get before you throw the remote at the TV.
