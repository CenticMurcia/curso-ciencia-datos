I had the displeasure of attending the NCSU premiere of this two hour ego-stroke of a film. Brandon Tweed has zero artistic ability, and fails miserably as a director and a writer. Rather than attempt something unique, Tweed instead opts to rip off numerous cinematic devices (most notably, from Requiem for a Dream) and attempts to string together four poorly-written stories into the longest two hours in movie history.<br /><br />As noted earlier, Tweed attempts to make use of every "neat" shot in Requiem for a Dream, and misses the mark completely, his reasoning being that such shots will add "depth" and "meaning" to the picture, when instead they come off as merely baffling. Take for example, the first scene in the movie: a young man eats a bowl of cereal, and his actions are shot in the same manner as the cocaine/heroin usage scenes in Requiem for a Dream; i.e., as a series of quick, disconnected shots. This adds absolutely nothing to the movie. After all, this is merely a young man eating a bowl of cereal (this scene also goes on for far too long, I should add).<br /><br />There were also numerous technical flaws with the film. The audio levels varied wildly (in one scene where a telephone is ringing, the sound effect is almost deafening, yet the music was almost inaudible throughout the movie). The audio also sounded heavily quantized. In addition, there are numerous scenes where interlacing artifacts are clearly visible, and so on. Tweed maintains that all of this was "intentional", as if such amateur technical errors in some way contribute to his "masterpiece".<br /><br />Movies like Matchbook Morning reaffirm my belief that the sale of camcorders to college students should be banned. Avoid at all costs.
