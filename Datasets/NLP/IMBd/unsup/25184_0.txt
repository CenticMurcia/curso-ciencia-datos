To wrap your head around Jason Goes to Hell, would be like trying to wrap your head around Paris Hilton actually releasing a CD. It doesn't make sense to you and it probably never will. If it came down to it, go with Jason Goes to Hell, because Paris Hilton, sucks, big time. But back to Jason. Jason Goes to Hell basically is the directors attempt to try and make Jason more than just a brute, slashing, zombie.<br /><br />However in the end it just goes even more so. Adding fuel to the fire for people who hate the Friday series. And with this installment, who can blame them? The premise itself is very ridiculous, Jason is blown into a million pieces, then comes back through the bodies of others. Wow, great plot right? Well maybe if you like trying to think about what the hell is going on.<br /><br />You start with a coroner, he eats Jason's heart. That makes sense... moving on. Jason goes around killing teens and adults again. And then eventually (For the last few minutes of the film.) Becomes himself again. Add in the mix of a Bounty Hunter who has a grudge (For an unexplained reason.) A family dagger which can somehow kill Jason, and Freddy Kreuger. And you have yourself a movie filled with more plot holes than teens murdered. This film does make up for it with more 'inventive' kills, but not even that can make this film great. It's OK for Friday Fans, if not, then steer clear.
