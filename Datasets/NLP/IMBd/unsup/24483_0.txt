I for one own the movie on DVD. You can get it off of Amazon.com. But if you want the TV Version (Only one episode) then you can get it on VHS from amazon.com ....<br /><br />The story starts out with a cop that gets beat up. He is shoved off of the pier and supposedly left for dead. There is a funeral and the movie leads you to believe that that is the end of him.<br /><br />HOWEVER. You see him wake up in a hospital with his face rearranged. The actor Fred Ward does a good job as he plays Remo Williams. He gets his butt whipped by a china man named Chiun. (Pronounced CHOON) The comedy starts when these two meet for the first time. And it stays funny throughout the movie.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for any movie library. Get it on DVD.
