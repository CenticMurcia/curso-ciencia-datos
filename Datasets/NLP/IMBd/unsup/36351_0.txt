If you haven't read the novella on which this piece of garbage was based, do yourself a favour - read it and don't bother wasting your time with this pile of manure movie. There have been so many changes to the original short story that it is almost unrecognisable. Yes, the most basic and essential elements of the story are still there, but only the bones. The meat of the story, that which gives it it's real punch, is more or less totally missing, but that is what gives the story its bite. In the original, the hero is a much older man and we can sympathise with his bad back, his dodgy knees, his blistered palms and the derision of his road-crew workmates as he searches for revenge for his murdered wife. In the original, Dolan is a real godfather-type gangster figure, sharp-suited and silver-haired, who thinks himself invincible and impregnable. To change these characters into younger, sleeker versions makes a mockery of the poignant heart of the story.<br /><br />Read the book. Don't watch this. It's rubbish.
