I still wonder WHY so many people say this is a good film. . . The acting is poor, the direction even worse, the story is nothing more than an Indian soap opera. . . The placement of the music is bizzare and akward, the cinematography is bland, the editing is nothing special. Overall, the movie just feels like it should've been made into a TV show or something, and NOT a full length motion picture. This is NOT one of the biggest surprise movies of '98, unless you count it as suprisingly bad. . . Do yourself a favor and skip Chris Eyre pitiful attempt at drama.<br /><br />-Josh
