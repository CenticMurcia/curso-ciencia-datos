Before i saw the movie i read some comments about it... stating it's condemned by several groups of people in Bosnia. I totally understand why, without spoiling anything, the overall message of the movie is shocking. Not only it gives a statement for the gay people in Bosnia, but also one for the whole population.<br /><br />This movie is not for a broader range of people. In fact.. you will need to respect the way it is told in order to like it. But if you do, then it's genius......<br /><br />And look for some nice metaphors which are a honor to Sergio Leone.<br /><br />This movie is available on DVD in Bosnia and other Balkan countries, so if you are in that region you know you can find it.
