I've just recently started watching the reruns of this show, and I have absolutely fallen in love with it. And honestly, that surprises me because I really haven't liked much of anything that was new on TV during the 2000s decade. But one night I was flipping through the channels and all I could find was Bernie Mac. I started watching, thinking it wouldn't be any good, but I couldn't have been more wrong. If you're looking for a good laugh and a show that hasn't forgot about family (but doesn't make the family message too exaggerated like many family shows), I'm telling you, this is the show for you. You watch a couple episodes, and I guarantee you'll be hooked. I know I am. And since I never saw it while it was new, all the reruns are new to me. I love having a "new" show on TV that I look forward to watching every night.
