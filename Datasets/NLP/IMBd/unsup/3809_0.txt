This movie sucks. I mean I found it in a bargain bin at a store and I expected a movie that was so cheesy and terrible it made you laugh. Instead what we get is a story about a group of teens who love computer games and spend 19 hours 'online' non stop. I stress online because when was the internet ever like what it is in this movie? Its so inaccurate. This movie has dated badly. Movies made in the late 80s/early 90s generally do, but they still remain some charm. Terminal entry does not. The only thing good about this movie is how bad the acting of the teenagers is and how the magnum PI wannabe guy is so Uber cool! Watch it at your peril. If you want unintentional humour watch 'Stone Cold' or 'Hard to Kill' (classics).
