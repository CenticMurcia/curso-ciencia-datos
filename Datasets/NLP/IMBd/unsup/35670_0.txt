I do have to agree with Don that this movie was bad but since I'm a firm believer of the second coming Christ and have been a born again Christian all my life you'd think I'd really love this movie guess what NOPE I DIDN"T IT FREAKING SUCKED COW BALLS!!! I was really hoping this movie was going to be about revelations and go with the story exactly with action none of these movies ever have action or major apocalyptic war scenes.<br /><br />Instead it was the producers and director's ideas that made this movie turn into another full piece of crap Movie. Just like the 7th sign with Demi Moore GOD OH GOD Why does Hollywood always have to change things for what they believe is the better way make a film about the end times WHY? In the long run no matter what! If you don't go by what the story exactly like the book it's going to be a flop or a piece of CRAP! P.S.: How about Peter Jackson directing a movie about Revelations man that would be amazing with his studios talent behind him with the story they could make a big awesome Action/Drama I know Action/Drama you say? It could be done heck anything can be done now a days the 2005 movie year was one of Hollywood worst years! I have to stop talking or I'll never hit the hay.
