The best thing about this move is the performance by Angelina Jolie ( I think I smell nomination). Way better then if Jennifer Aniston (the original choice, thanks to Brad) was chosen.<br /><br />However, this should of been a Sunday Movie of the Week. It's really no different then other movies that we all know the outcome of.<br /><br />I thought it was more of a low budget flick, with Jolie's paycheck probably the largest expense. Nothing being blown up, no armies of whoever, no traveling to all over the world. Basically in a few different sets. A lot of talking, some screaming.<br /><br />I really wouldn't recommend it. Wait for the DVD, and then you may still think about renting it.
