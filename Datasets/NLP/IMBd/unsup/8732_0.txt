Hi I too have seen the movie Buddies, I am looking for a copy of the movie for my mum and dad.<br /><br />They had a copy but is got misplaced in travel years ago.<br /><br />My parents went to the World Premiere on Wednesday, July 20th 1983, for Buddies.<br /><br />This was a great day for them as they loved it very much.<br /><br />In 1982 they also had an investment in the movie Buddies.<br /><br />My parents also have paper write ups about the movie.I wish that it could be played on TV again because it was such a great film. So if any one out there could help me get a copy of it again i would be very grateful please contact me please Janelle
