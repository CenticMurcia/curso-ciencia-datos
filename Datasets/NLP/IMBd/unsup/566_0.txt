I don't always like comedy and horror mixed but this one did make me laugh hard and I liked the story.It had some really good kills and some hysterical original humour.The whole revenge storyline is old but a good and effective one.It reminded me a lot of Nightmare on Elm street how a bunch of parents killed a guy and he comes back from the dead to exact revenge on the kids of the parents.Of course Nightmare on Elm street was more of a horror.I hated the first scene of drive-thru.I cannot stand it when white kids act and talk like they're black,especially the well educated ones.Watching the way they were acting and talking made me cringe. I anticipated all those whiggers dying brutally, and they did! It's sad how brainwashed a lot of youth are these days.It's time for a rock revival and to say goodbye to rap! I liked the soundtrack for this movie.The theme song sung by Leighton Meester was cool and I liked the other version playing during the end credits.If there was a soundtrack sold in stores I would buy it. This movie would have made a good theatrical summer movie. We need a new demonic serial killer to hit the big screen. Jason,Freddy,and the others have all been over used. Not that I want their evil legacy's to end(especially Chucky my favorite),but it's time for a new one and Archie had potential.With a bigger budget and more advertising it could have easily made it's theatrical debut.A bigger budget sequel would be nice.If there is plans to do one I would like to see the survivors all brought back to face the demonic horny clown again!
