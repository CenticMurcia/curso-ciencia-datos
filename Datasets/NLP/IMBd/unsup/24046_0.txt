When people talk of a film being dated, "The Wedding Night" is a perfect example of this.<br /><br />Anna Sten looks at you from the screen with those sad eyes. You know you're in for a tear-jerker. By the title, I thought I was in for a comedy. Comedy? That's a laugh in itself.<br /><br />Instead, the viewer is subjected to a tragic film on par with Anna Karenina. The only thing is that we only have to be subjected to an hour and twenty four minutes of this soap opera junk.<br /><br />There are two good performances here. Sten, since she so vulnerable and Sig Ruman, who portrays her strict by the book father. Yes, this is old fashioned about a girl spending a night with a man, a married man, but after all, the film was made in 1935.<br /><br />Gary Cooper plays an author in this film who is obviously suffering from writer's block. That all changes when he meets, by chance, a young Polish girl, Miss Sten, who inspires him to write a novel. The problem is that Cooper is married and that Sten is engaged to a blustering Ralph Bellamy.<br /><br />The tragedy at the end of this film will make you shed a tear for about a minute. Why? You'll be so glad that this film is over.
