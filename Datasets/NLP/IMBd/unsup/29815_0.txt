No, it's not a dramatic masterpiece, but it is a hard driving thrill ride and the most enjoyed movie I've seen at a theatre in months, maybe over a year. While the plot is a bit "out there", once the movie gets going it sucks you in and you mostly forget about that. Plus, the ending was great and the visuals were right up in your face which was great and really exciting to watch.<br /><br />It was not the type of movie I would usually go see but I went because it was adapted by P.T. Anderson (still think he was robbed) and because I always enjoy seeing J. Statham beat up on people-heh. I really had a blast throughout except for the rap music I had to endure on occasion (personal pet peeve). I gave it a 10 because of the enjoyment factor. Very, very well done.<br /><br />Now if I could just get the movie theatre to stop playing crappy pop music while I wait for the previews. :-/
