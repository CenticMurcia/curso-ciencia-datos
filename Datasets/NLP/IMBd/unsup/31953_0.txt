Way back in 1981 I saw this film at the cinema for the first time. It was an incredible experience, in the cinema the mixture of Wagner and powerful (if somewhat violent) images were almost overwhelming. This is not a film that translated so well to television. Much like "Saving Private Ryan" the power of the movie is lost on the small screen. None the less this was a firm favourite amongst young British lads for the next 10 years or so. The film is steeped in dark age pagan mysticism and offers an almost "other worldly" experience to the viewer. This movie was far more impressive then it's contemporary rival the rather silly (though still enjoyed) Conan the Barbarian. I believe that Excalibur remained easily the best sword and sorcery flick until the 2001 release of Lord of the Rings.
