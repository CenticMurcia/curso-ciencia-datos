This is fantastic for Abbott and Costello's first feature film. They are quite funny, and their interactions with the other cast members are great. This is the film that got me hooked on Abbott and Costello! It IS an unrealistic portrayal of the Army (and everything else, really!), but it's a comedy - not a documentary!<br /><br />The Andrews Sisters are lovely as always, especially in their first appearance in the film, when they sing "You're a Lucky Fellow Mr. Smith." This film also features Dean Collins and his dance team in one of the most famous Lindy scenes ever.
