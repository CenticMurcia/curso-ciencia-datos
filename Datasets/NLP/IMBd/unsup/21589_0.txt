I recently saw Lemmon in 'Tuesdays w/ Morrie' and found that film very rewarding. It really displays how talented Lemmon was as an actor, so I set myself a goal to view as many of his films as readily available thru my local libraries. Last night, I saw LUV and it won me over! Lemmon does border his performance on a Jerry Lewis-like character, but it does NOT detract from the story or the supporting performances. Ms. May is suitable in her role and cracked me up with her business-like charts reflecting the sexual intercourse frequencies of her two marriages (Falk and Lemmon). If you really want to fall-out laughing wait until the Niagara Falls scene in which Lemmon and May compete to test each other's LUV. HILARIOUS! Also, if you pay close attention you'll see a young Harrison Ford as a hippie-type who sucker punches Lemmon over a fender-bender. This film is watchable and makes observant commentary on suicide, marriage, extra-marital lust, and the nature of LUV ... just keep in mind the decade in which it filmed ... the '60s. It's a companion piece of sorts to Peter Sellars' 'I Love You Alice, B. Toklas.' Don't miss it!
