I saw this yesterday, and I thought it was great. I am a big fan of Lucas' art, and I think Indy 4 was the best movie of the year. I had been looking forward to seeing his first major picture, and it really was great. The use of 60s music is just awesome. After the first half hour I was mesmerized like I had been sucked into another world. We can really get to know all the characters like it was our own friends, and the story is certainly excellent getting all the pieces together in the end with a very touching ending. Look out for Harrison Ford and Richard Dreyfuss in early roles. There are also a lot of references to American Graffiti in Indy 4, by the way. I will not mention them here, but it is obvious that you can draw references to other projects by Lucas - even to the computer game Maniac Mansion which also portrays a lot of young people who are quite similar to the characters of American Graffiti.
