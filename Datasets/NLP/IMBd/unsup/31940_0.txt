I was seven when I first watched this movie and am still captivated by it as a 26 year-old. This may sound corny, but I really love the movie's theme song, "I Have the Power". "He-Man" and "She-Ra" were likely THE defining cartoons of the 1980s, yet I have heard of no plans to release the film on DVD. I taped the movie from the USA cable network in 1989, and - as one might imagine - the quality of the tape has deteriorated. It's still watchable, but not quite up to my standards. Oh how I wish I could find even a decent second-hand VHS copy, to replace my failing one! I tried watching the new He-Man series on the Cartoon Network, but it simply does not compare to the original.
