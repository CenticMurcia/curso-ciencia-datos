Was forced to watch this by a "friend" and can honestly say this is one of the most tedious boring films that I have ever seen.<br /><br />From the little of the film that remains with me it's about some old git in a study with some annoying woman having something to do with the plot as well of course the mummy itself.<br /><br />For most of the films too long running time most of the main characters are talking in the study with an unconscious old man.<br /><br />For some reason the film includes sex scenes that seem to come out of nowhere and have nothing to do with the story although they rarely do.<br /><br />Avoid this there is nothing redeeming in this film at all - it's boring.
