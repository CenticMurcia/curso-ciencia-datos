That play on words comes out of Megadeth's first album title. The display of top notch makeup, effects, music scores and set design (and not always top notch acting), doesn't get horror much respect in the film world at large. Horror is to cinema what so called "heavy metal" is to pop music. The weird, often by choice, relative at the family reunion who'd rather show you their tattoos or pet snake than photos of babies or a cute puppy. <br /><br />And the evolution of things that make us afraid over film's history definitely includes the creepy and grotesque. Filmmakers from the most talented to the least competent have tried their hand at horror, some making a nice living remaining in the genre for their whole careers. Wes Craven, Francis Coppola, Stanley Kubrick and now, Martin Scorsese, have all made heartwarming human interest stories and f____d in the head descents into movie madness.<br /><br />The great Tony Timpone, editor of "Fangoria", appears in this and is one of the foremost enthusiasts of the macabre. I've met him several times at Montreal's "Fantasia" festival over the last two years and he's a prince, one of the easiest to talk with celebrities you could ever meet from the film world. He emcees several of the Q+A sessions each summer, hosting "Pig Hunt" (in 2008) and "Dreaded" (in 2009) recently. If this normal looking gentleman is an ultimate horror guy, the clergyperson you see each week or the manager in a suit at your bank might be too. <br /><br />The limits some place on themselves when deciding just what it is about horror that they like and dislike are interesting. Hardcore slasher types don't need a strong plot or wonderful production quality to enjoy that primary emphasis on the bloodletting. Those who aren't primarily fans of the genre require something more, not resting on the laurels of convention to stay involved in any provocative material. And there will always be those who hate horror with a passion, never warming up to anything that smacks of some comic or sadistic cruelty.<br /><br />Horror evolves, however slowly. In an essay on so called "torture porn" in "Premiere" back in 2007, Eli Roth (director of "Cabin Fever" and "Hostel") remarked that seeing dead bodies floating down flooded streets in New Orleans during the endless news reports of Hurricane Katrina was much more horrific than anything one could find in a mere movie. And many, horror fans or not, would agree with that sobering assessment of where the true priorities of society's real horrors deserve to be placed.
