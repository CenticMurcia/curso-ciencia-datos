This film has to be the most underrated films ever made. It hosts some of the best performances to date of the likes of Ustinov, Lansbury and Mia Farrow and brilliant characterisations from Maggie Smith, Bette Davis and Jane Birkin. To be honest they all gave this film their best. The locations are magnificent, the costumes stunning and the intrigue is masterfully worked on. Simply the best "Christie" film of them all. I was a Bette Davis fan before the film and when I saw it upon release I was introduced to so many other performers that I have this film to thank for that. 10 out of 10 !!!
