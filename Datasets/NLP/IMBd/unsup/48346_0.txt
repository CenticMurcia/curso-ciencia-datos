A babysitting uncle tells his charges three horror stories--about a killer witch, Little Red Riding Hood and a werewolf, and a story about "Goldi Lox" and the three bears. However, a slack production and a director who seems confused as to handle the stories sink it. Tale one, a romantic horror fantasy with attractive leads and a lush score is a moderate success compared to the other tales. This movie is comprised of three stories, all of which totally suck. The silly script takes a darkly farcical view of 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears,' 'Little Red Riding Hood,' and some story about two witches looking to resurrect their dead sister. The soundtrack, the fashions, and the hairstyles, combined with a script that's obnoxious when it wants to be funny, and eye-rollingly stupid when it wants to be scary, sends "Deadtime Stories" to a watery grave in the latrine of '80s nostalgia. So poor, it went unreleased for quite some time.<br /><br />Rated R.
