Yes, this movie is actually retarded.<br /><br />The idea is good, I will give them credit for that. But the execution is just a boring movie with horrible editing.<br /><br />First of all, why do we have to watch a minute of 2 people taping up a house??? 10 seconds is fine, we get the point!!! There are more holes in this movie than in a brick of swiss cheese. The dumbest one is the whole "twist". Supposedly some sort of bomb is spreading an illness to anybody who can't seal their home. The symptoms are severe coughing, and at the end the female main character (who's name I don't care about) looks as pale as a ghost. So the twist is the girl who was outside almost the whole movie, who was coughing, turning white and throwing up, was able to be saved. While the guy who sealed his home, and showed absolutely no symptoms (This guy didn't even sneeze!!), was infected beyond saving. Um... What?! If the guy was so infected, why didn't he show even one sign of it? And why was his wife, who was coughing up a lung, able to be rescued and presumably cured. (I say presumably because you never really know if she was cured or not, you just see her getting medical attention and being told she can be saved) <br /><br />Then there's the hole that the main character taped up his entire house, and won't even let his wife in. But when she throws a cell phone through a window, he just leaves the ash that comes in his home and does nothing about it. This guy is paranoid as hell and willing to let his own wife die, but he somehow doesn't mind a pile of ash sitting in his kitchen? Then we have to believe that this small pile of ash mutates in 3 days, and becomes what they call "airborne".<br /><br />If the original "ash disease" wasn't airborne, then why was the whole city getting sick? Why was his wife coughing up blood if she wasn't exposed to the "airborne ash"? We have to buy this BS about the ashes magically becoming airborne. It was snowing ash like it was winter in LA, and all of that ash falling down didn't become airborne. But the little pile of ash inside the main character's house mutated for absolutely no reason. (Don't expect them to explain it, like everything else in this movie) <br /><br />Every character in the movie (other than the 2 main ones) jump in and out of the movie for no reason. This Mexican guy was working next door, but he somehow decides to move in with the main character. Why didn't he stay in the house he was working in? Then, all of a sudden he has to leave to be with his wife, who no one in his family has seen since the explosion. Then there's the little boy Timmy. He's in the movie at the start, and the main character sends him home. Then halfway through, he comes back, and still he has no purpose. Thankfully, the wife takes him to the hospital, and we don't have to see him anymore. Again, that little boy serves absolutely no purpose in the movie. Then there's the wife's friend. He suddenly shows up at their back door (after a "scary" flashlight scene), and the next thing you know, him and the guy's wife leave to go to the hospital. When the wife returns, she says her friend shot a bunch of people and then drove off. What the? What was the point of him being in the movie? <br /><br />Then there's the 2 main characters. The movie spends way too much time on pointless dialog between them. The wife is completely annoying. Apparently Mary McCormack (the actress who plays the wife) thinks screaming and being a nut is considered acting. Maybe that's why all she can get are low budget movies. The male main character was flat, boring and irrational. He tapes himself and a Mexican stranger inside his house, but lets his wife in and the Mexican guy out. Then when a bunch of ash gets thrown in (cell phone scene), he just leaves it there. He doesn't even seal off that part of his house. And no, he doesn't avoid that room.<br /><br />And we can't forget the fact that at the beginning of the movie, the male desperately tries to find his wife (who was downtown). But police sealed off all roads leading to the city core. Somehow his wife gets back home. This is never explained, because you can't explain it. If the male can't get into downtown, how can she get out? If the creator of this movie is retarded, then I forgive him. Otherwise there's no excuse for a bad script and plot. Sure this is a low budget movie. But these types of movies are supposed to make up for their lack of funds with stellar dialog & plot. This movie has nothing. No money, bad dialog, and a slow, boring, pointless plot.<br /><br />If you like dumb movies, this Right At Your Door is for YOU!!!
