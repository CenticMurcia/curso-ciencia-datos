A brilliant movie, with a standard but good and complex plot that changes all the time. (Even better than any of the Swedish Hamilton and also the Beck movies where the main actor Mikael Persbrandt plays a main support role.) The plot is built upon the assasination of Prime Minster Olof Palme. One pregnant error in the script concerns the Swedish political party EAP which is used as one of the scape goats. It never was a right-wing nazi party as shown in the movie. Still, the movie is one of the best thrillers I have seen in a bout one year. It is better than the best US movies, such as "Enemy of the State" due to the higher complexity and the high social realism which is more typical of European movies.
