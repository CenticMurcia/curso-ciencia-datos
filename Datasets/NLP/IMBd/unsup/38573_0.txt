Not the best movie I've ever seen but it's not the ABSOLUTE worst either. If some actual time had been put into developing the plot, working on the foreshadowing instead of dropping obvious things in places they obviously didn't belong in, if some of the ideas had been dropped to develop the better ones, than it could have been so much more. However, doesn't happen. The whole issue of the Governor is really just unnecessary. Sure he is the reason she had an abortion and there is an attempt at saying "she's the one because of it" but that could have been time better spent on the character of Mowatt himself. He's no Hannibal (although they try really hard don't they!) because as horrible as Hannibal Lechter is, you come to care about him a bit. She's no Clarice (again, very uncanny resemblances in the performances) and throwing in some psychic abilities, religious capabilities, doesn't change the fact that it is. I also found myself seeing a bit of Brutal Howell but again, not enough to matter. I didn't even care all that much when the guy dies in the beginning, even though they tell us we should. They don't show us. They don't show us anything except an eclectic mess of ideas and they tell you the important parts. I could see the writer developing his talent and over time doing something great but this one isn't it. That said, I didn't pay to watch it. I caught it late night on a movie channel and it's not so terrible that you wouldn't want to watch it if there wasn't anything else on but it would be a cold day before I'd pay any money to own it. It would insult the real movies in my case...
