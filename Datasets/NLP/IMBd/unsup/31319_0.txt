***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** OK, first of all, i didn't actually catch this during the mtv movie awards, i found it during a random downloading session. and all i have to say is, very well done, i was pleasantly surprised that somebody would actually do something like this. jack black is amazing as the elf with the pierced genitalia, an amazingly rude but not crude plot line. and im assuming SMG was supposed to be Arwen? well whoever she was supposed to be, she was good, comical at most points, and especially at the end when she ripped the ring from jack's privates. Sheer brilliance.<br /><br />
