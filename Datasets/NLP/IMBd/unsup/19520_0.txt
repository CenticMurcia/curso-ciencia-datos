Bryan Genesse and Billy Drago are the best things about this movie, and I like the fights. Olivier Gruner was the weak link in the film, terrible actor and terrible action star, but his supporting cast makes up for his lack of talent. If you like fighting and those bizarre Hong Kong kung fu movie training sequences, The Circuit delivers!
