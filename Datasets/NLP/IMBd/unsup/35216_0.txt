What can i say abut this cinematic masterpiece that hasn't been said before? The film is about a town of vegetarian Goblins who hate meat. So what threat are they to humans then? I hear you cry! Why, they turn you into a vegetable before they devour you.....obviously (dont you feel stupid for asking now?) I'd also like to clarify that Troll 2 has nothing whatsoever to do with 'Troll 1' or indeed a troll or collective trolls. It features some of the most memorable scenes ever to be shot on celluloid and that my friends is a fact! How clever they are to call the town that the family are moving to 'Nilbog' and then show a shot of a sign for the town in the cars side mirror, clearly showing the word 'Goblin' This film deserves an Oscar! Also many people are saying that this is the worst film ever made! What utter rubbish, i'd sit through this film a hundred times rather than watch 'Batman & Robin' again for even five minutes. So there! (its clearly the second worst film ever made!)
