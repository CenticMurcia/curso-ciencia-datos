I just don't know what to say about this movie. It was really bad. It was slow, subdue, uneventful, I literally feel asleep during it, it truly was a chore to watch. I eventually skipped to the "action" parts and this movie still came up empty handed. <br /><br />Seriously though, I couldn't help but think about how good of a anime movie this would have made. It had all the elements there of a decent action cartoon. Oh and some of the goofy blood squirting effects were pretty funny too. Just try to envision an R rated Power Rangers movie (which still sounds better than this movie) and see what you think of "CRAP", I mean "Kibakihchi".
