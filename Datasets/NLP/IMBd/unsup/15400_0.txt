Whirlygirl was premiered two nights ago at the New Haven Film Festival. The film was shot largely in New Haven, especially the New York scenes. The bulk of director Jim Wilson's film experience has come from producing 6 Kevin Costner films: Revenge, Dances With Wolves, The Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, The Postman, and Message in a Bottle. So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised to find wooden acting and poor writing in this film, even though Mr. Costner is nowhere to be found. Monet Mazur is certainly beautiful, but her performance is embarrassingly hammy; and the script is, in places, just terrible. But the guys aren't bad, and the scenes in the boys' school are fun. And Fran Kranz is always enjoyable to watch.
