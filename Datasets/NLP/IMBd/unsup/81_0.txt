This is one classic disaster movie from the late 1970's. Starring: Billy Crystal, Lorne Greene, Peter Graves and Misty Rowe. ''Death Flight'' begins with a scene of a silver, white, red and orange supersonic passenger jet which looks like a Concorde with four turbo-engines from a 747, two on each wing, flying through the sky. Next we see Capt. Jim Walsh played by Robert Reed making announcements to his cabin supervisors to not worry about going twice the speed of sound to his crew members.<br /><br />Next are the movies main titles at JFK airport in New York. The story of this movie revolves around 7 crew members, 250 contest winners turned passengers and a deadly flu virus. One hour after takeoff, the first flight of America's first S.S.T. is struck by, in this order: an on-board explosion due to faulty hydraulic lines, three crew members burning to death on-board, and last but not least, a virus being released. After many attempts to land at various worldwide airport's, the plane crashes and explodes in South Africa, leaving only most of the films main stars alive, and all of the extras dead naturally. One things for sure, if you can find this movie do not miss it. In total, so far, there are eight different versions of the movie on release, this includes foreign releases. <br /><br />For Irish TV, in the summers of 2004 and 2005, RTE ONE showed the ''Death Flight'' uncensored release at times between 12:15 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. Let's hope they show it again soon.
