We learn from 'Alien' that "in space no one can hear you scream." Well, I wish I could have been in space during this movie so I wouldn't have had to hear any of these characters bitch.<br /><br />The egomania of this director is so apparent in this movie that there is nothing under the surface no matter how far you want to attempt to scratch.<br /><br />Green is four shorts brought together with a mediocre beginning and an even more mediocre ending. Originally, the movie was a short but for some reason Mr. Hirsch decided he could add 75% more material to an already lame premise.<br /><br />If I was being forced to watch this movie again, I would be more than happy to take the alternative route of overdosing on anti-depressants and narcotics (no matter the color) chasing it down with a bottle of Jack.<br /><br />But, I'll stop before I go into a rant. You can certainly find enough of those in this movie.
