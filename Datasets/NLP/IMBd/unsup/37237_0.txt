It's odd. Every time I go to see a good movie, there is usually no more than fifteen other people in the theater where I go (ex. The Fountain, The Prestige). But it was absolutely packed for this horrible piece of garbage. Peole actually expected a good movie. Then again, I couldn't blame them. It is, however, about a mutated crocodile that kills hundreds of people. My main complaint about this movie is Orlando Jones' ridiculous, unfunny one-liners that happen about three times per scene. Even though some of the action sequences are kind of interesting,(with the civil war and all), and the special effects are okay, it just doesn't make up for the film's garish cheesiness (seriously, when the crocodile was chasing Orlando Jones through an open field, was it supposed to be serious?). You would probably be better off seeing The Hills Have Eyes remake if you're in the mood for some senseless violence. Primeval, however, just doesn't cut it.
