Dario Argento and George Romero team up, each telling a tale supposedly based on works of Edgar Poe. Romero's segment further solifies my notion that you can classify whatever George makes into two distinct parts: His Dead trilogy which is great and Everything else which turns out lacking. Blasphemy you say? Well bullocks to you, if you can prove me wrong please do so. Anyway, in this first segment that plays out like a longer boring version of 'Tales From the Crypt", Jessica Valdemar (Adrienne Barbeau, of "Swamp Thing" and "Escape From New York" fame, and NO I will NOT even mention "Maude" it was a horrid horrid show) wants to off her dying sugar daddy with the help of her hypnotizing Docter lover only to have the old coot come back. Even the almost good last few minutes of it can't save it. Luckily Dario Argento's segment while not without it's flaws (such as a story thats WAY strecthed out), can't help but seem better. In that one Harvey Keitel beats the sh*# out of an angry cat and the feline's owner. But it's a bit more then that.<br /><br />My Grade: C (the high Argento grade cancels out the low Romero grade) Blue Underground DVD extras: Disc 1: talent bios; Theatrical trailer; and a poster/stills gallery Disk 2: 'Two Master's Eyes' documentary; 'Savini's EFX'; "At home with Tom Savini"; and a five minute interview with Adrienne Barbeau<br /><br />DVD Easter Egg: On disk 2 press up until "Extras" is highlighted to get an interview with George Romero's wife about her bit part as the nurse in his segment
