This is one of those beautiful movies that never get the respect they deserve. Friends weren't exited about the movie some time ago, so I went to see it myself because I finally got to read some Asimov books. It was the first movie in years to actually get my eyes cloudy and all the other things a grown man "shouldn't feel". The movie is heartwarming because of all the beautiful scenes, the great detail in the progress of a robot trying to become a human being and the leaps in the timeline. Everything looks so good, the detail in Andrew, the futuristic backgrounds. Accompanied by the music of James Horner, this movie will be one to remember!
