First of all, I'd like to point out this film features B.S. Dogg, esquire, as a resurrected pimp out for revenge on his murderers (in case you're wondering, B.S. stands for Bigg Snoop). Now, this man actually misspells three-letter words like "big" and "dog". This man is responsible for the creation of words like "izzey", "shizzey" and "my nizzey". I KNOW the kind of quality attached to the name Bigg Snoop Dogg. I rented Bones this Halloween anticipating one of those "so bad it's good" deals. Unfortunately it wasn't so bad it was good. Fortunately - and against all odds - it actually WAS pretty entertaining. Director Ernest Dickerson brings on all your horror clichés, which I don't consider a bad thing, and even slams in some blaxploitation clichés. There were enough references to horror classics to show Dickerson loves the biz-nass he's in. The comic relief in the later half also reminds us (after some darker parts) that this film is not to be taken seriously at all. Snoop delivers as the ghetto "Frank from Hellraiser" or "Jason Voorhees" or "Freddy Krueger" or whatever the f**k. The kids are as believable as you can get with the lines given to them (Lawson and Isabelle look good though). Michael T. Weiss is better than expected as "Loopy-Lou" Lupovich, the crooked cop. Pam Grier is her usual good self as well. But all in all, this truly is Snoop's film. I wish they'd do a franchise on this. After all, the Freddy sequels weren't as successful as the original, but still they made 'em. To me, Jimmy Bones is up there with other boogeymen like Pinhead, Michael Myers and the Candyman.<br /><br />"The Gangsta of Love don't need no fried chicken!"
