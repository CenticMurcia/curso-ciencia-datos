One of those late late late show movies on cable that you watch when you cant sleep or have nothing better to do. Truly abysmal movie has<br /><br />a crazed vietnam vet and his girlfriend terrorizing the patrons of a small diner. What are Hal Linden and Lee Grant doing here?,they deserve so much better. Parts of this movie got so bad that I had to laugh especially at Marjoe Gortners hamming it up badly. Spoiler.. Yes folks the bad guy does get blown away at the end in a stupid duel.<br /><br />I think some have called this a cult classic,Id call it bottom feeder material.Every once in a while we all watch really bad movies and this is below bad.
