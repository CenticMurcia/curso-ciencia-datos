I literally almost fell asleep watching this film.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, is that a conniving wife thinks she is about to be scared to death by her husband and father in law. Inexplicably, Bela Lugosi and Mini-Me show up (okay, it wasn't Mini-Me, but a close relative of the annoying midget variety)and act creepy while everyone else is barely acting at all.<br /><br />There is this strange interspersing of scenes of the woman lying on a coroner's slab, adding absolutely nothing in the way of exposition.<br /><br />The plot, and I am spoiling nothing here, is that the woman turned over her ex-husband to the Nazis during the war, and now he is looking for revenge by apparently peering into windows wearing a blue mask. He is then caught by the bumbling cop and the inept reporter wearing a dress (yes, absolutely no reason is given WHY he was wearing a dress, since he had not been seen any time previously in the movie AND it was pretty obvious he was a man in a dress.)
