This is a very likable and well-made film for the entire family. And, although Errol Flynn gets top billing, Bobby Mauch as both the prince and the commoner gets the lion's share of the time on screen. The story is probably very familiar to most people. A poor boy in the 16th century turns out to be the spitting image of the young prince. However, the prince hates life in the palace and longs to escape and see and experience life. When the two accidentally meet, they decide to temporarily change places. Unfortunately, this results in many complications--the biggest of which is a conspiracy to use the fake prince as a dupe and do away with the real one! That's where heroic Errol Flynn comes into the film. The movie is a well made and well acted costumer--employing all that is best about Warner Brothers films of the era. Fun and entertaining throughout--it almost makes you believe this story is TRUE!
