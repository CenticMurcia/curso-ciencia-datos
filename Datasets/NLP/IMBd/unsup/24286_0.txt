"Robot Chicken" is basically a string of unrelated "skits," featuring children's action figures being manipulated into zany and irreverent situations. The concept, in theory, is hilarious. Anyone who has stolen their sister's Barbies and produced a girl-on-girl porno/suspense/horror flick will clamor to get a peek at this program; however, the end product just doesn't pay off.<br /><br />Have you ever heard someone tell a story that seems funny enough, but you just can't get into it all the way? The person just keeps on talking, snickering at himself from time to time, and after a while, you just start to think, "it's funny, but who really cares?" "Robot Chicken," much like the film "Team America," is a prime example of novelty comedy; but again, much like "Team America," "Robot Chicken's" novelty wears off quickly, and sooner or later, you realize that if it weren't a bunch of action figures, it would be utterly unwatchable.
