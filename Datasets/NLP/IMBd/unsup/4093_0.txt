A popular trend can be a great subject for a movie. Trouble is, not all trends are timeless. One trend that I believe will never go out of style is the cult film. Thanks to this little part of cinema history films that didn't do so well the year they were released finally found an audience, even if what happens in the movie is very different than what we see in the present. 'Roller Boogie' is one of these movies. It was somewhat of a hit at the time because roller disco was a big thing in the late 1970s, but this film came at the end of the decade and was a critical failure. Over the next few decades it would develop a small cult following and after seeing it for myself I can see why.<br /><br />Pros: The cast is game. A fun disco soundtrack. Great job on the costume designs, bright and colorful. Fast-paced. Some excellent skating scenes. Made with a real sense of fun. Some of the dopey humor is amusing. Nice beach scenery. An exciting chase scene. Director Lester injects much energy and style into this.<br /><br />Cons: Terribly dated. Clich√© and predictable.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Won't win any awards for best screenplay or acting, but so what? This is pure unpretentious fun! A real feel good movie and must for cult film buffs.<br /><br />My rating: 4.5/5
