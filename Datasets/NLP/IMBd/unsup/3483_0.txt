Not a bad film overal, but the feeling I got from it was dark and gloomy. It's fun of dank underground holes and the like and you only see the sun at the end. I found it rather depressing, even with the good ending.<br /><br />Not bad, though. I'm not saying it's the top film of the year, but it's not a flop either.
