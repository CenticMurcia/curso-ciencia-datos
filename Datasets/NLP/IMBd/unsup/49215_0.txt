Brooke (Anniston) is quite tired of making the relationship with Gary (Vaughn) work as Gary sees no need to change his ways. So they break up.<br /><br />I can see why Anniston and Vaughn are no longer together in real life. After this flat-liner no one would want to be associated with it. These are two good actors(Vaughn is good when he doesn't try to be comedic), but nothing they do saves this movie. There is no chemistry between them and it shows on the big screen. You don't care if they break up, and get back together. You just want this to be over. You are waiting for something funny to appear to make things a little less tight. Never happened. I blame the script, maybe Vaughn but never Anniston, who is turning out to be a really good actress. Yes, she was the best thing in here. But this is supposed to be a comedy and I want to say it's light drama, but cannot. It is almost heavy drama. Something no one expected. This could have been something akin to the War of The Roses, but falls far short of that classic.<br /><br />Why blame the script? Because I have seen Rachael (Anniston) get mad at Ross (from the Friends TV show) and break up with him and the results were funny, funny, funny, and that didn't happen here. Another reason to blame the script is that Vaughn helped write it. Maybe he should have asked Jennifer to help out with that. Ya think? I just don't picture Vaughn as someone comedic (no, I didn't find him funny in The Wedding Crashers either) and believe he is best suited for crime drama where he will excel, but that's just me.<br /><br />The rest of the cast were fine. Ann-Margaret had a small part in here too. But, there was that irritating family dinner where some family members sang acappella and that was extremely irritating and annoying. That was a harbinger of things to come. Again, look to the script.
