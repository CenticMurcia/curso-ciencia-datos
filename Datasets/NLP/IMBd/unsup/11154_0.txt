I had a chance to see a screening of the movie in Atlanta. It was a very powerful piece. Although it definitely has a religious theme, it is rooted in secular life. . The film does not sugarcoat the issues that the characters go through, but it depicts the issues in a tasteful,non-vulgar way that really hits home. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. There were even some counselors on hand to help people deal with the personal impact of the film. Kimberly Elise was outstanding. She is definitely a star on the rise... . I think has the potential be the modern-age version of The Passion of The Christ.
