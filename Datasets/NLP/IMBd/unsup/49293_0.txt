In 1941 Hal Roach had an idea to make short films - he called them "streamliners" - between 40 and 50 minutes, to be shown with lenghty main attractions. Quite a few were made, mostly comedies, but also two musicals - the Technicolored "Fiesta" with fiery Armida and this film that boasted of Frances Langford, one of the top popular singers of the day. Supporting her were Johnny Downs, who had been singing and dancing in programmers for years and had started out as one of the "Our Gang". Harry Langdon supplied the laughs as Hap Holden - it was hard to believe he once rivalled Charlie Chaplin in popularity.<br /><br />The film starts off with an amazing "drag" act by the boys of Quinceton College - "I'm a Chap With a Chip on His Shoulder". Meanwhile Mar Brynn School for Girls is having enrollment problems - they can't even get boys to go to their proms, the girls are so dowdy!!! The principal's (Esther Dale) niece, Virginia (Frances Langford) has an idea - if they could entice twelve unusual (beautiful) girls to their college, the college would not have to close. Bob (Johnny Downs) decides to try his drag act at Mar Brynn ( I'm not sure why???) He is one of the twelve chosen and the film develops into a "Some Like It Hot" storyline, with Bob looking and acting like Jack Lemmon. The girls even sing "Up At the Crack of Dawn" on the train.<br /><br />After a few bedtime shenanigans, Frances Langford sings "Out of the Silence" in her beautiful melodious voice. When one of the girls gets the measles, the school is quarantined and the musical revue (staged to show off the talents of the 12 girls) must be staged in the greenhouse. Frances sings "The Farmer's Daughter" and Bob, out of his disguise now, saves the show and gets the girl.<br /><br />It is not as good as "Fiesta" but anything with Frances Langford is worth a look.
