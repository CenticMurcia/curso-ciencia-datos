I saw this on t.v. and it was the funniest!!!! I bought it on DVD and I was laughhing so hard when he talks bout his baby mama and not stressin ur kids off. You can relate fo sho!!! He talks bout sex, Hollywood, parenthood, and relationships. He's from Cincinnati where it was filmed. His advice is hilarious!!!!! The best part of "Katt williams Live" is how there's a documentary to it and u really get to see a lot of whats going on. Katt really knows how to kill dem jokes. His humor is like house party style. Itz wayyy better than "Pimp chronicles" so I don't know what some peeps are talking about there. You gotta see "KATT WILLIAMS LIVE"!!
