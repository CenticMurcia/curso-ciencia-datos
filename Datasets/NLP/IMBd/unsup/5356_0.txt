First I read the book "The Mysterious Island" when I was very little and it gave me wonderful time of dreams and adventures. I was so excited during reading it. Last year I finally found the book and bought it and until now I've read it many times and I think it's one the greatest books ever written. <br /><br />I started watching this movie with some hope to see the journey and life of my heroes from the book, but I couldn't even stand to watch half an hour of it, because it has nothing to do with the book and it's made so so bad. The actors, the play...are awful! Lots of the scenes and special effects makes me wonder how is it possible this movie to be made in 2005 when they're so ridiculous and cheap.<br /><br />To all of you who respect the author and the book - you can leave this movie behind and believe me you're doing good.
