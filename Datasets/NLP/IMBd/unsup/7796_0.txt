Enjoyed viewing this 1945 film and was surprised to see Jimmy Lydon,(Paul Cartwright), star of all the "Henry Aldrich Films of 1943", who gave an outstanding role as a young man who experienced dreams that could help his mother from getting involved with a man called Brett Curtis(Warren William),"Fear", who wanted so desperately to marry his mother and enjoy the great riches she possessed. Regis Toomey, (Dr. Martin Vincent),was the only person Paul Cartwright could turn to with all his troubling dreams and did his very best to find out the real mystery to his nightmares. Paul Cartwright was placed in a mental institution and notice there was two-way mirrors in his room and tried to hang his clothing over the mirrors to prevent his being spied on. If you like a good 1940's mystery from the past, you will enjoy viewing this great Classic Film!
