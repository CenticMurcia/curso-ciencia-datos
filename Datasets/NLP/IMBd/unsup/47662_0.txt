Sorry guys, not feelin' this one. Story: Freak in the woods will come and kill you if you say his name too loud. Pretty f**king retarded concept if you ask me, but hey, not all horror movies have to have a TITANIC plot, right? Even so, MADMAN is dull and derivative and has nothing new to bring to the "slasher-in-the-woods" genre. The film plods along dully, the kill scenes are fast and relatively un-bloody and the few requisite sets of tits that you do see (as is required by these types of films...) are from a couple of scrappy sea-donkeys. Avoid this one unless there is NOTHING else in the horror section at your local video store. Check out "THE BURNING","MANIAC", hell, even "FRIDAY THE 13TH" just to name a very few superior slasher/psycho films. A VERY generous 3/10 for the head-in-the-hood decapitation
