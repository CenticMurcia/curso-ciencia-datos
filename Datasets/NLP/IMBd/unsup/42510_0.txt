One could be forgiven for thinking this is a TVM . It features two actors , Robert Vaughn and Darren McGavin , who are better known for their TV roles , and HANGAR 18, s production values resemble those seen in TVMs . Surprising to believe that this film received a much hyped cinema release .<br /><br />Production values aside HANGAR 18 is a rather dreary film script wise . The urban myth that the US government is hiding evidence that planet Earth has been visited by alien life forms and that the government will stop at nothing to silence anyone uncovering the facts isn`t too well developed . THE X-FILES would later cover the same territory and do it a whole lot better
