I've seen this movie once, and only once! its a far cry from Bonanza, story line reminds me of a bad late 60s Elvis movie only worse! far worse! I noticed that the town looks oddly like the Gunsmoke set! and there's absolutely no background music, thats in a movie, it was so annoying, I don't recognize anybody here except Michael Landon in this very very very bad movie, its a wonder they didn't run Michael Landon out of town for this slop, Michael Landon is a very good actor, but he definitely could have done better, don't get me wrong, I think this movie should have been made, just not like this, makes me wonder if Sam Katzman directed this flick! sign slapstck2000
