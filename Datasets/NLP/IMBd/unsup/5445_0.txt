After psychiatrists fail to offer any real solution for what is causing Gail's problems (one even recommends calling the priests), the family is forced to turn to the church and an exorcism is quickly ordered. With few priest having any real experience in dealing with the possessed, the church turns to Father Thomas  a priest who we meet early in the film when an exorcism goes very bad leaving him blind. Shouting every prayer known to man, Father Thomas and two other priests confront the demons inside Gail and a major battle between good and evil takes up the rest of the film.<br /><br />Although the movie's plot has been done before (lets face it, nothing is ever going to live up to The Exorcist), Scott's own love for the horror genre makes this movie just fun. He has mastered what it takes to make a good horror film on a tight budget and shows his own knowledge of horror in this movie.<br /><br />The movie has touches of The Entity (such as when Gail is being visited at night); Stigmata (when Gail forms a cross and starts bleeding from her hands and feet); White Noise (when Gail sees ghostly images in the television) and naturally The Exorcist. Scott also has the movie go "low tech" with practically no computer generated effects (like what was used in King of the Lost World) or actors running around in creature suits (like Beast of Bray Road or Frankenstein Reborn). Instead, the film has quick edits of things jumping out at you, something quickly walking by the camera, and some great facial expressions from Roby  when that girl screams it is down right creepy.
