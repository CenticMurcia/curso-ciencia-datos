This show was once one of the greatest Nicktoons ever made. I remember coming home from school and watching Spongebob. It was genuinely funny and creative, and left me laughing every time. Sadly, that's not the case with the mountain of absolute TRASH that is the newer episodes.<br /><br />Spongebob has been downgraded and turned into a mindless whining, idiotic perfectionist.His voice is now a lot more high-pitched. The plots, animation and dialogue show no effort whatsoever. (I think all the original cast might have left the show) A prime example of how Nickelodeon has sealed its own grave, ruining their greatest shows just so they can make a quick buck. If you're going to judge this show, judge it by older seasons 1 through 3,not the current episodes, because that greatness can't be compared to what Spongebob is now.
