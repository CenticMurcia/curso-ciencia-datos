There are amateur films, And films that look amateur.<br /><br />This looked amateur. Discontinuities cluttered the film. And any repeated actions in the film were achieved by playing back old footage. I actually thought I had a bad download. The first probably three minutes of the film is repeated frame for frame a little more than half way through.<br /><br />Then latter in the ending sequence they keep repeating the exact footage not in flash back but because the director was simply too lazy shoot different actions in different ways. I was thoroughly impressed by how bad this was.
