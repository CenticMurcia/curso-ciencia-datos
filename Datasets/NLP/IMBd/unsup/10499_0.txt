I know I am not the audience for this mess, but even my toddler was bored by it. The story takes so long being slow and simple, it literally bored me into a stupor. The songs are instantly forgettable, the TV cast looks ill at ease, and the whole thing is shot on a soundstage with a budget that might cover my lunch this afternoon. I give this a 3, and hope your child is not turned off from Elmo by this.
