...or maybe not. Pirates have always been a shaky element in films, until 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. But back in 1939, not even the roller-coaster ride was in anybody's mind, and film portraying pirates might have looked ridiculous even then.<br /><br />What is surprising about the fact that this film is outdated is that it's a film by Hitchcock, whose films never quite seem to out date, apart from his silents. Yet, it's the pirates that are to blame. Even a master like Hitchcock feels must have felt awkward in making this film, and as a result, nothing works. It becomes a dark comedy thriller with drama and romance, none of these genres ever quite mixing in. Charles Laughton is not the one to blame, he's possibly the best thing in the film. However, Maureen O'Hara definitely has no idea of what she's doing, she doesn't even know what accent she's doing! Still, the viewer must remember not to count this as a true Hitchcock film. Though the elements are there, particularly the 'runaway' element, it's very weak. Again, it is Hitchcock's fault, but it's mostly the fact that this is a film with Pirates in them, and they rarely make for believable actors...
