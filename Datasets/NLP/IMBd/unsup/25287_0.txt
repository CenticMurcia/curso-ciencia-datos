Well, one would have thought that a movie made by Dani√®le Thompson (who has written a lot of great screenplays in the past, like "La Grande Vadrouille" "Le Corniau" "The Mad Adventures Of Rabbi Jacob" "The Brain") and played by two of the greatest french actors, Jean Reno and Juliette Binoche, and whose music was composed by one of the greatest movie-music compositor of France, Eric Serra (RXRA), should be a good movie. Instead of that you assist, when watching the movie, to the burial of the careers of Jean Reno and Juliette Binoche. Maybe the English version of the film is ok but the original version (in french) has no taste, no colors, no shape... it is a sad movie, because you see the end of great actors and you see how somebody who could act very well now seems to be reading a text in front of the camera without entering neither the story nor the character. I hope Mr.Reno, Mrs. Binoche, Mrs. Thompson and Mr. Serra are going to continue like before and forget this movie (if you can call it a movie...). I prefer to watch my aunt's vacation diaporamas as to watch this movie. And so is the meaning of the people living in my city, says a statistic on this movie... no wonder that American Movies (even without a story) can earn more money!!!! Let's hope they will get over this and start from a new start soon.
