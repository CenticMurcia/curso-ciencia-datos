I had thought "Frogs" would be one of those campy movies that is enjoyable in its badness... But no. I won't say it's the worst movie I've ever seen (that "honor" goes to "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"), but it's in the top 10 bad movies of all time. Or is that the "bottom 10?" The premise of nature rebelling against humanity's ecological indifference is a good start, but most of the characters are uninteresting, and idiots to boot. The dialogue is painfully bad, and the acting is worse than anything in a Roger Corman movie. At least in Corman's movies, you can tell the actors are having fun. In this fiasco, however, I get the feeling that the actors were blackmailed into doing this film, judging by the pained, or sometimes completely numb, expressions on their faces while they get themselves into moronic situations or deliver stilted, unrealistic lines.<br /><br />I forced myself to sit through about 2/3 of this movie, hoping it would get better (or at least funny). Ultimately, however, I had to shut the damn thing off; I mean, I could feel brain cells committing suicide while I watched this travesty. I had to stop it before I wound up as intelligent as the characters in the movie.<br /><br />I rated it "1" because there's no "0" or negative numbers available.
