In this faithful remake of the 1968 original "Night of the Living Dead" is satisfyingly enough to overcome sereval flaws moments of this remake. The remake is directed by George A. Romero long time friend:Tom Savini (Who is best known for his Make-Up effects work). The remake is penned by George A. Romero (Bruiser, The Dark Half), who re-wrote his original screenplay from the 1968 film. Which Romero wrote with John A. Russo back in 1968. The remake has a few new ideals with a different third act.<br /><br />The remake has basically the same story about Barbara (Patrica Tallman) and her wise-cracking brother-Johnny (Bill Moseley) went to the graveyard to visit their Mother's grave. When Barbara is attacked by a strange man. Her brother tries to save her but he ended getting killed. She runs away to a nearby farmhouse and she finds herself with a sensitive but tough African American man (Tony Todd). Thinking that they are safe in that farmhouse but once it turns night. Barbara and Ben, their world turns upside down, because these strange people are trying to get in the house.<br /><br />Then later... Barbara and Ben finds out that they are not alone in the house. When they find themselves with five other people (Tom Towles, McKee Anderson, William Bulter, Katie Finnerman and Heather Mazur). Thinking that they might have more hope but one of the survivors in the house finds out that these strange people are actually the living dead coming back to life and attacking (and eating) the living.<br /><br />This film is a scene for scene remake of the Disturbing Original until near the end. Only difference, the remake is color with a tougher heroine and more potent violence. But the film in the film, it has almost none of the impact from the 1968 movie. This is familiar territory for Romero and Savini. Producers of the original 1968 film-Russell Streiner and John A. Russo are also producing this remake. Originally, this was not the film that Romero and Savini intended to be. In fact 30 to 40 % of George A. Romero's Screenplay wasn't filmed, because of Budgetary Reasons. Most people hated this remake, when it first came out (even i hated it). But over the years, the remake got better, thanks to sharp performances by Todd, Tallman and Towles.<br /><br />The music score by Paul McCollough is a mixed bag. Sometimes the score works and sometimes it doesn't. But it does have a good music score at the end credits. Savini does let his actors overact at sereval tense moments, which almost makes the film funny unintentionally. This is certainly a flawed remake but better than expected. <br /><br />The remake of "Dawn of the Dead" is more successful than the "Night of the Living Dead" remake. DVD Quality of "Night of the Living Dead" remake is very good with an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan & Scan). The Dolby 2.0 Surround is good and clear sounding. The DVD has an commentary track by Savini (Which the Commentary has some dead air, Savini should have someone with him in the Commentary like Romero). The DVD has an amusing 25 minute feautrette and the original trailer. This is not the best horror remake but Romero and Savini come very close. If they filmed the entire screenplay from Romero, maybe it would have ease the flaws of this film. It is worth a look. Romero also Executive Produced the film. Followed by the remake of "Dawn of the Dead". (*** Â½/*****).
