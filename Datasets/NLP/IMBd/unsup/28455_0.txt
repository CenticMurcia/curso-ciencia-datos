That is some damn terrible writing and dialogue. Don't get me wrong, the film looked great and I could even tolerate the mediocre acting. Hell, they even had a bit of fun following some of the Zombie Rules with a couple of the character's story arcs...BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE...take your time and write a decent story and believable dialogue. How plausible is it that one of the male characters would have extensive knowledge of the title character's history and that he would then, conveniently, release this information as needed? And why would one female character ask (FOURTEEN TIMES), "Why won't you tell me what's wrong with you?" to this same over informed male character after he has been bitten by a zombie, meanwhile, he is screaming in pain!!<br /><br />And STOPPING MAKING BOSS ZOMBIES...I blame video games.
