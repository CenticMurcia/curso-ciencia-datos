This is by far the best production i have ever seen. The acting is incredible as are the vocals and even if the characters namely John English talk to the audience, it's still funny. The audience laughs. Why should it be bad. No matter what i hear about this. I absolutely adore this play. <br /><br />I especcially think that the finale was a work of art. A ten minute rap of of the production is great. But i would have to congratulate The Major General for his excellent take on the Major general song. The song just makes me want to memorise the entire lyrics. All in all this was a fantastic play. My thanks to the people who put this together.
