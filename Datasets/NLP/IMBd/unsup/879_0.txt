I picked up this movie some years ago and watched it twice, just to get all of the gags. At 1130PM I called my friends over to watch, and again laughed and laughed. The ads are a great part of the show, but the characters are (almost) representative of the ad biz. Having dealt with ad folks in my career, I often thought many of them either belonged in a "home" or had just been released from one. How I wish we could see some of that "truth in advertising" these days, especially in the political campaigns. It is by far one of my favourite movies, one that I replay at least once yearly. Agree with others it was Moore's funniest and finest performance.
