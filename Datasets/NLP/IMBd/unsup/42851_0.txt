Badly written, slow sci-fi animation story. Characters are cardboard which perhaps fits the puppet like animation. Miserable pacing of the story.<br /><br />Action sequences are not edited well and are difficult to follow. Background animation is miserable and often out of focus. Obviously this is a low budget attempt.<br /><br />The dialogue is ludicrous. They all seem to talk like Yoda from Star Wars? Why?<br /><br />There are good ideas here; just poorly executed.<br /><br />Don't waste your time. Not even worth a rental.
