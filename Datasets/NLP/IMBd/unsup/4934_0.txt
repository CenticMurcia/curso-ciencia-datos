I can only agree with the praise from other reviewers.<br /><br />As movie reviewers Siskel and Ebert used to say, you come to care about these people.<br /><br />The situations are absorbing, full of suspense and moral dilemmas, and the actresses are uniformly excellent. In subsequent years, whenever I've seen one of them again in another context (Ann Bell, Rosemary Martin, Jean Anderson, and Elizabeth Chambers have shown up in other British dramas that have played in the States), it's been like meeting an old friend.<br /><br />I discovered this series when it played on A&E (back when A&E was actually "artistic" and "entertaining"), but unfortunately, I never saw the first half of the first season. I was sorry when the series ended and even more sorry that it was never repeated.<br /><br />I wish that someone would rebroadcast it or that the DVDs would be made available in the States.
