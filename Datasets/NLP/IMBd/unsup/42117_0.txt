God, what a waste of time! I haven't read the book but knew of ULG's stature. Actually I picked this up at the local library. This being a co-production of Alliance-Atlantic and PBS, and AAC being a Canadian company is the only reason I can see why a library might have this.<br /><br />First off, the acting is terrible!! Both Lisa Bonet and Lukas Haas are totally lame. No wonder this thing falls flat on its face with those two as the leads. I wonder if he's related to Philip, the director? Could that have something to do with it??<br /><br />The only interesting bit of casting in this dog was David Straithairn as Manny, and Sheila McCarthy as Penny, Dr. Haber's secretary. (She's probably best known as Polly in I've Heard the Mermaids Singing.)<br /><br />The sets and costumes are not bad, but the only reason to watch this would be as a laugh-fest, i.e. "this thing is so bad it's hilarious!!"
