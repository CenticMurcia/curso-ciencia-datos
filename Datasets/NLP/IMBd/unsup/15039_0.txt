Before "Knight Rider" or "Speed Buggy",there was Herbie. This spunky Volkswagon can win a race whenever he can! Hardly anyone can control this machinery, he tends to think on its own. Here you have a racer named Jim Douglas(Dean Jones), a racer who lives for the thrill. Known for wrecking cars, he gets a chance to go on the racing field once again. He and his partner Tennessee Steimetz(Buddy Hackett) get the car and the fun begins. Both he and Herbie get the glory, but the owner of foreign cars has other plans. He wanted to get Herbie out of action, permanently! Carole Bennett(Michele Lee)decides to join forces with Jim and Tennessee, and make sure that Peter Thorndyke(David Tomlinson) don't get all the glory. There was a lot of humor in the race when the bear took the saboteur's place when trying to keep Herbie from winning. And who needed a chauffeur when you have Herbie doing the driving. A great movie, family friendly, and true gem that can make you sparkle. For all you grease-monkeys, here's a movie for you! Also it was my nickname. HAHAHA!!! 5 STARS!
