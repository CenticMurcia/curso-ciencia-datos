There is one compelling reason to see "The Apostle," and that reason is Robert Duvall.<br /><br />Duvall directed himself in this story about an evangelist who embarks on a self-assigned mission to save souls when his own life goes wrong. Duvall gives a scorching, blistering performance in the title role, sinking deeply into his character until you feel like Duvall the actor no longer even exists. He also proves himself to be a competent director, even though that hasn't been a calling he's pursued subsequently.<br /><br />It's just criminal that Jack Nicholson beat Duvall for the 1997 Best Actor Award with a performance like the one he gives in "As Good as It Gets." <br /><br />Grade: A
