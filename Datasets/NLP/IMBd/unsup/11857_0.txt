Wow! Having never taken a shop class, I am happy that I never considered it. Actually, I cannot remember anyone from High School who did take shop -- except for Sheephead in the back of the bus, but he dropped out. You would think that if you were making a filmstrip about why you should take a string of classes that offers ridicule, that you would make your spokesman some what attractive and less dweeby (I used the word spokesman, because everyone knows that girls should not take shop classes, that's why schools offer home economics). The guy with glasses is not only slightly repulsive, but definitely learned the fine art of acting from shop teacher Bow Tie.<br /><br />Given that the Mystery Science version was funny, this short is so out- moded that it is a hoot nonetheless.
