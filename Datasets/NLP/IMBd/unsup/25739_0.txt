Although there are plot points that you could drive a truck through, this is a well thought out script and the acting is uniformly great. Patrick Warburton really gets to show us his acting chops as the cement headed misogynistic Max Bright and Marie Matiko as Mrs. Bright is the perfect counterpoint to his bluster. Special kudos to Eric Roberts as the long faithful friend. There is Warburton's impressive full frontal nudity that arrives on the scene even before the opening credits roll, but even this robust titillation quickly fades once the story is under-weigh. <br /><br />On the whole I am completely baffled why this little gem of a film has languished in the Never Never Land of "Can't Find a Distributor". For those that care to search it out, it is available on DVD in Australia in the PAL format. It's a legit pressing, but looks like a work print was used for the transfer. It was filmed on video and transfered to film which doesn't help either.<br /><br />Check it out.
