The movie itself was pretty dull, and most the acting was a little cheesy. I did think that the girl who played the lead character, Molly, was great! She gave this movie the only real depth it carried. I hope she will continue to pursue her career, and that others will see what an incredible talent she really is. As for the plot, you could drive a semi through the wholes in this movie. It was so completely unbelievable that it was hard to watch. None of the characters were written with any depth and only a truly talented actor could bring any believability to it. I think that the majority of people in this film should give up hope of ever doing anything besides cheesy C rated movies or maybe porn. Everyone except the lead actress whom I mentioned before.
