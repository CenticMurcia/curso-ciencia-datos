I am a little bias to anything in the classic era of film and by classic era I mean anything from 1930 to 1948. But this movie is a real treasure. Not only do you have the irreplaceable team of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in Four's a Crowd, there is a bonus of Rosalind Russell.<br /><br />Mr. Flynn plays a different role than we usually see him in. He is still ever so charming but this time he has traded his sword for a desk. Miss De Havilland refreshes us with a comedic role. Anyone who says this limits her acting ability is completely wrong. Comedy requires a certain amount of skill and she nails her role. Roz Russell fulfills in her character everything her followers like to see her as, a witty newspaper woman. Of course she is capable of playing other parts well but she plays these woman the best. Walter Connolly plays the high-strung,stubborn patriarch like always. In the End the all get married to each other (there's another guy) but you'll have to watch it to see whom to who.
