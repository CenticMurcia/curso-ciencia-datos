Dark from the very beginning, and set in a dirty, dingy, depressing part of London, the film is quite unnerving and doesn't let up. Music, sound track and special effects are low key and very effective. The low budget suits the style and milieu.<br /><br />We saw this film in the United Arab Emirates - the Jinn are spirits mentioned in the Qur'an - for people here, they really do exist, and are not to be messed with. Clear moral - don't mess with ouija boards!<br /><br />Well done - by the way, to the people who complain about less than perfect camera work and the occasional boom mike visible - I don't care if the basic idea is good. This film is good and deserves to be watched and appreciated.<br /><br />My horror connoisseur wife loved it - that's saying something.<br /><br />
