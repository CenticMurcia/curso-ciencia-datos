The movie is really a very very well made one with the parallels between two plots. It brings out the question-"is subjecting a foreigner to inhuman torture and trauma and humiliation right in one country and wrong in another country?" For protecting one's country and people against terrorism, if the police can do anything to the foriegners, then any other country has the same rights.<br /><br />I saw the movie on HBO and it was quite an eye opener on what can happen to a foriegner in some other country. The movie might have been an exaggeration, but then similar things have been reported in past.<br /><br />The best parts of the movie were the 3-4 clips in between of various us presidents talking about freedom and democracy provided by their nation to their own citizens and also to the world.
