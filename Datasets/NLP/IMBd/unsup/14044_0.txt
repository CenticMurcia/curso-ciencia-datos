This is a classic gangster film which is surprisingly hard hitting for its age, it amazing to think that this film is nearly eighty years old and that prohibition was still in force when it was made.<br /><br />James Cagney did a great job portraying Tom Powers as he rises from being a petty criminal to being a mid-level mobster. Even though the character has few if any redeeming features Cagney manages to make us care about what is happening to him. Along with childhood friend he takes a job for local gangster "Putty Nose" things go wrong on their first job however when the police turn up and kill another of the gang. One cop chases after Tom and Matt down an alley and they kill him demonstrating how far they have come from their early days.<br /><br />As their first boss has fled they start working for Paddy Ryan who has seen the money making opportunities that the prohibition of alcohol have brought. Soon the boys are forcing the speakeasies to sell their beer and only their beer. Initially things go well for them, they have plenty of money, beautiful girl friends and smart clothes but when the mob's hard man Nails Nathan is killed in a freak riding accident a rival gang see it as an opportunity to take over. They are instructed to lay low for a while but Tom can't do that leading to tragic consequences.<br /><br />The violence is never graphic although it can still be fairly hard hitting such as when Tommy goes into the stable of the horse which had killed Nails and two shots ring out and the films most famous scene where he pushes half a grapefruit into his girl friend's face. The acting is all pretty good, especially from Cagney in the role that would make him a star.<br /><br />This film deserves its classic status and should be seen by anybody who likes classic film in general or gangster films in general.
