While in the Punta Abreojos in Mexico with his girlfriend Maya (Annica Bejhed) and two other couples, Tyler (Brendan Fleming) invites his brother Colin (Kaiwi Lyman-Mersereau) to join him in the paradisiacal beach for surfers. Colin travels from Los Angeles to the spot in his old car with his girlfriend Ashley (Michelle Borth), her slut friend Rose (Joleigh Pulsonetti) and his friends Javier (Jon Ada) and the goof Lucky (Alex Feldman). When they arrive in the beach, they do not find Tyler and her group, only their motorcycles, surfboards and finally their campsite and truck. While seeking out their friends, the group realizes that there is something wrong with the cursed beach.<br /><br />"Trespassers" is a plain low budget movie with a shallow and non-well developed story and characters. There are awfully silly lines, and I believe that the winner is when Lucky asks what "km" is and Colin (I guess) replies that it is a shorter mile. The camera and lighting are terribly poor and the best scene in the movie is when Rose removes her bra and shows her wonderful breasts. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Intrusos" ("Intruders")
