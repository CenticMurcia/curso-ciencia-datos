Why can't Carter live his own life instead of being barked at by his sister in-law about not being home to hold his brother's hand over the past years? That was an early annoyance on his hectic quest to find his brother's killer. Also: why can't a grown-up women (his niece) who chose to take drugs and have sex with a man and another woman settle for what she had done? Actually, she took that decision better than Carter; cause Carter, being a professional thug, and not being open minded on the matters that women are fickle, had to take the action she participated in as a rape; which he then took action against the man he considered a rapist. He took action against his colleagues from Las Vegas who had trailed him to Seattle because of his own intervention with adultery. (It's okay for Carter to involve himself in bad decisions but anyone else). Eventually he gets to the man who killed his brother, and has a vigorous fist fight to his hearts content. (Which was not too bad of a scene. Better than a shootout). Unfortunately, Hollywood being as it is nowadays, cast a geek as the billionaire who is indirectly involved with the brother's murder; but other than that particular miscast the other characters were in form. Not really too bad as a remake. My personal choice though would have been to have Mickey Rourke as Carter.
