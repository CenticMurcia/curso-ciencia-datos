First of all, don't you be fooled by my summary:I really am a WWII FPS shooter nerd, as I've played them all. Knowing this, it's easy for me to compare this title with other games like MOH, Hour of Victory and the rest of the COD titles. COD 3 does finally what no other game does: not include D-Day, which has been done over and over again. Instead it focuses on the events occurring in end June/begin July 1944. The graphics and shading are excellent: the mud on the boots, the smoke on a destroyed panzer, nice movies. Everybody, like here on IMDb, shares the same opinion: the accents are too much ( Scottish accents are a Sean Connery overdose) and the levels are way too short. It took me less than 6 hours to finish the game on 'normal' difficulty. COD 3 tries to give the player an 'open field' game where you decide which path to take. But here again, it fails and you, as usual, just go from point A to B. Weapons and locations are good: although the sounds of the weapons is historically incorrect it gives the player a rush: yes, the M1 Garand still is a great rifle. In comparison with other games, it lacks behind titles like COD2 (which truly is an excellent game). It leaves the gamer wondering if this title was rushed out the developers office and it is a too pretentious game. With others words, it is too much stuff in a too short game.
