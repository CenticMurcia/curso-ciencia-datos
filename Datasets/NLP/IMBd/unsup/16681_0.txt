"Play It Again, Sam" is not an altogether successful film: it gets kind of monotonous midway through, and it has a few dead spots and mediocre jokes along the way. But I still like it very much. A warmly funny, enormously likable film, it contains some absolutely hilarious moments (watch for his first blind date and the scene where he follows - and overdoes - the advice that Bogart's ghost gave him to tell Diane Keaton how beautiful she is). Keaton is really lovely and adds an extra sparkle to the movie. Wacky and emotional at the same time, the film is recommended even to not-very-enthusiastic Allen fans.
