What an insult to all the previous National Lampoon Vacation movies! Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid and the others who helped make the National Lampoon Vacation movie series great over the past 20 years should be apologized to. This movie was absolute horrible! Judge Reinhold I felt was the wrong person to play the character Mitch Snyder. (I'm glad they had sense enough not to call him Clark Griswold as well!). The movie never really produced any genuine all-out laughs.<br /><br />If you're a big fan of the National Lampoon Vacation movies, you're gonna be disappointed with this one. All I will say is it's a good thing it was made-for-tv movie and was free!<br /><br />
