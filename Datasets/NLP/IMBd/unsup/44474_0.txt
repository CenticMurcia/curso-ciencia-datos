If this is what vaudeville was, it must have been rotting by the time this film came out! It was difficult not to give it a bomb, but for historical value and the actual quality of the film's print, it wasn't impossible to watch. Charles Winninger, usually wonderful in films, plays an inventor who creates the most inane burglar alarm in film history. It's obvious that he's going to get caught in it. Frances McCoy, as the secretary, is probably the most annoying character in early talkie history. She would drive El Brendel back to Sweden! The Three Stooges play the most insipid group of firemen ever on the screen, and it is rather insulting to the profession to even see this presented on screen. A six year old Billy Barty is probably the only one to come out good in this film; His cameo is actually a bit amusing, and probably rates the two laughs I discovered in it.
