This movie is an inferior remake of "His Girl Friday".I found it to be unfunny and laced with profanity.Where is Cary Grant when you need him? I like Jack Lemmon (see "The Apartment")but not in this movie.I also like Carol Burnett,but she misses the mark this time.The sex of the characters that Jack Lemmon and Susan Sarandon portray are flipped in this movie.I think the characters were funnier and ahead of their time in "His Girl Friday".
