Normally, I wouldn't even bother giving this a review, but having been pushed over the edge by all those Spongebob key chains, sweatpants, etc. they're selling, I feel compelled to. Spongebob Squarepants is undoubtedly one of the most overrated cartoons of the 90s and 00s, indeed probably _the_ most overrated. I would say the characters are really my biggest issue, given their absurdity.<br /><br />The titular sponge bares no resemblance to real sponges, essentially consisting of an artificial cleaning sponge with a face and legs (and those square pants) added. Of course, he has a pet, a snail that meows (no, that's not a typo). Other ludicrous characters include a crab who has sold out his own people and now makes a living running a crabby patty restaurant and a squirrel who, for some reason, has taken up residence under water.<br /><br />In short, this is yet another silly cartoon that has gotten way more positive press than it deserves and exists mainly to drive the production of more merchandise. Strictly a show for children and even that may be giving it too much credit.
