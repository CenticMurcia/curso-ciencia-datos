Just when you thought the nail couldn't be pushed any deeper into his coffin, Kennedy is back, and this time in a movie like Malibu's Most Wanted, or rather a movie where he is acting like a stupid white guy: Kickin It Old Skool! Right now I'm telling you just to rent Malibu's Most Wanted to get a clear picture of how this movie is: humorless with a stupid white protagonist. You don't even have to go out and spend a few bucks on a rental, just turn on your TV at this moment, and you will find a movie with the same formula.<br /><br />The only handful of at least entertaining films Kennedy have been in is "Dead Poets Society", for which he was uncredited, "Boogie Nights" which wasn't in the original film but deleted scenes, and Scream where his character was well balanced among the other high school kids in the film. His track record of Son of the Mask and Max Keeble's big movie, considered his biggest roles along with MMW weren't too great.<br /><br />The best part of the film was the secondary characters, who dished out some occasional amusing humor from time to time. But the humor didn't last long when it cut right back to a joke about stupid white Jaimie Kennedy, just to ruin the good mood! <br /><br />The story is oh-so familiar, with a rival young hip group of kids just waiting to duke it out with Kennedy and his band of misfits, except duke it with fists they shall not, but rather their old skool moves. (Notice how the title of the film is spelled adequately for our youth of today, missing all sorts of hard consonants that we shouldn't bother with putting in proper linguistics).<br /><br />Alas, there could have been hope. But don't waste your money on yet another film attempting to exploit the goofy white people, which has been done for years on end.<br /><br />Kennedy needs to stay in his coma, for the better.<br /><br />3
