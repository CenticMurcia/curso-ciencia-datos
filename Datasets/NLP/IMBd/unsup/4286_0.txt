Not-very-funny television show that introduces us to two brothers (Kieren "I Look Like Macaulay" Culkin and Will Friedle) whose lives are the prime focus of this show that only got a few episodes on NBC before it was booted.<br /><br />I looked forward to it and found myself disappointed. Last I heard, Kieran was doing a play in downtown London. Should be called "Go Figure."
