High-scored this movie not by today's standards, but by what a viewer in 1912 may have experienced. For what they saw on screen, the flickering light fairly new to their worldview, captured the spirit of Shakespeare's Richard in gory detail (well, semi-gory, but probably upped to gory by the imagination).<br /><br />The specific treat here lies in the man who introduces the film--both on screen without costume and, when the film played, traveled the country to both introduce it and speak to the audience between reels)--the 19th-Century stage actor Frederick Warde. A youthful 61 when he made the film, he hunchbackingly runs and plots and creates on-screen emotion via hand and facial expressions. Shakespeare may have beamed well-pleased at this chosen Richard, a fellow thespian who, according to an interview reproduced on the DVD, had to mouth the words to fully capture the role even though no sound would survive the flowing decades.<br /><br />The film contains an interested use of backlighting, as the ghosts of all his recent victims point accusingly, in unison and determination, at Richard just before he goes out to join them in the back-lit-hereafter. Great costumes in this film, for its time or any other, and who can say they don't come close to the originals of the depicted era.<br /><br />An interesting scholarship question remains. Although the only surviving print came into the hands of the American Film Institute (AFI) from a serious print collector, William Buffum (Buffum interviewed in the extras on the DVD), I'm wondering where he got it. May have missed the explanation, but it may have come in a trade with another collector. Film history owes a thanks to all involved.
