This movie was so unfunny it was painful to watch. Everything from the lame pop-culture references to the terrible forced accents was awful. This film practically gets on its knees and begs for laughs like none other I've seen, and this is compared to such classics like the police academy movies and any Adam Sandler movie. It's saddening to see a talented comedian like Dana Carvey stoop this low. Let any of your kids over the age of 5 watch this schlock and they'll probably slit your throat in your sleep. <br /><br />Everything about it screams slapped together, All of his disguises appeared in the trailers, "Pistachio Disguisey". The impressions sounded like something the guy who gets drunk off his ass does at a party. The (thankfully) 80 minutes running time. Don't see this movie, ever. Even at a "crappy movie night" because there just isn't any entertainment value whatsoever.
