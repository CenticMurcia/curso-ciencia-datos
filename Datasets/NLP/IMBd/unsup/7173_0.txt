I think I found the movie and if I am right this take place on Christmas a boy was bothered and chased by boys from his class in school and they chaseed this boy into an abandon building while he found a stray cat and he took car of the cat by feeding it and taking care of the cat and then 1 day the kids from his class happen to do something to him at the cat and somehow at the end of this movie this boy ended up having a cat at his home<br /><br />this movie i saw when I was a little boy in camp and I also saw it on hbo cinemax but I never knew the name and I been asking lots of people until now and I think this movie is the movie I been trying to look for years and I thought it came out in the 1970's since it is in color.
