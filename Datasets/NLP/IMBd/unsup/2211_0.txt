HtH is basically a comedy, accompanied by the overacting talents of the Stillers, Anne Meara, and Gilbert Gottfried. There's some nice plays on Christianity, the Devil as a mildly sympathetic (or at least likeable) figure, and Lowe and Swanson make a likeable enough couple. There's nothing really "horrific" here. Rather, Helegeland indulges in a lot of satirical writing. Look for how highways are paved in Hell, and Cerberus guarding the gates, for some more amusing scenes. Basically an underrated and underviewed movie that deserves more attention. Check it out if you can.
