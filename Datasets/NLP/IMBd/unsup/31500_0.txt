I loved the illustrations for each chapter of the flick, I was just annoyed it never listed who did them...<br /><br />This hokey country & mystery was really Jerry Reed's show, he had a Top 5 hit in the 70's "When You're Hot, You're Hot (When You're Not, You're Not)" that even became a popular catchphrase T-shirt, Tom Selleck either pre-Magnum or same time and hedging his bets played the studious and mostly quiet itinerant rancher.<br /><br />The plot had some pinholes but not really obvious as Jerry Reed wove his spell of brash down-home-isms and Tom Selleck playing the puller of butts from frying pans & fires.<br /><br />The pilot-debut pulled out a good set of stops to hit the ground running; invite Roy Acuff, Barbra Mandrell and Ray Stevens to do cameos as themselves.<br /><br />There were chase-scenes and there were sex, lies & Nashville but Selleck's character summed up Jerry Reed the best in two quotes from the film, "You'll either be rich or in jail," along with "J. D. Reed, I swear, you start with a toothpick and end up with a lumber yard." Selleck's character provided the know-how in not knowing how city slickers do their dirty deeds and helped in his slow, quiet manner to not only use his love of encyclopaedias to avoid arrest, but to tie up loose ends in an alleged murder.<br /><br />Claude "Movin' On/Sheriff Lobo" Akins also plays a mover and shaker in the Nashville music scene, I believe this picture was meant to have a sort of Lite commentary on the other Nashville, as in that film which Keith Carradine played in back in 1975 - but (A) considering it's supposed to be a comedy, this was hardly the time and place for that, and (B) there was not enough time to do such type of editorialising justice, so the amateur sleuthing won out, thank God!<br /><br />http://tinyurl.com/3464k
