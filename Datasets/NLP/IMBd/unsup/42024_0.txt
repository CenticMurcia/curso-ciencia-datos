I couldn't believe my professor assigned this movie for a class. Ugh.<br /><br />The production values are not too great, and the score is AWFUL!<br /><br />In general, it feels like a corny 80s sex fantasy drawn out for 90 minutes.<br /><br />But without a lot of sex.<br /><br />Some of the nature scenes are very pretty, and it's almost in the so-bad-it's-fun category.<br /><br />But not quite.<br /><br />Definitely not recommended, unless you're having a bad-obscure-80s movie film fest.<br /><br />And maybe not even then.<br /><br />
