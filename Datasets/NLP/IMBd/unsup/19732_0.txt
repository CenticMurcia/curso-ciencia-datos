This movie looked great from the trailers alone. It is a shame it was a direct to video release because the animation is awesome, and certainly looks like it is feature length quality. I was looking forward to seeing it, especially since this is the first time the "Fab Five" have been computer animated for a movie. Without giving too many details, the film has all your favorite Disney characters such as Mickey, Minnie, Pluto, Goofy, and his son Max, Donald and his nephews Huey, Duey, and Louie, and their Uncle Scrooge, and Daisy Duck. There are different stories involving the characters and the true meaning of Christmas. It is a wonderful movie to watch for the holidays, and it has a great story. I highly recommend it, if you are a Disney fan, or like to watch Christmas movies.
