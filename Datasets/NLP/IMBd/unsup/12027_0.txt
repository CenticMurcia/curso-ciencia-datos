I thought this production was very satisfying dramatically and nearly as satisfying musically. I did have some reservations about Joel Grey who I thought didn't quite have the style (some Broadway shtick crept in now and then, of course.) but he acted very well and on the whole did a "yeoman" job. Even though Elizabeth Bainbridge was a very dignified Dame Carruthers, her character was perhaps meant to be a bit more of a gorgon. But her approach worked in general. Sets and costumes were excellent.<br /><br />Apart from missing the ensemble "Strange Adventure" I thought the music was well served. The DVD was nothing special but the irritation quality of Doug Jr. was kept to a minimum except in one spot.<br /><br />8 out of 10.
