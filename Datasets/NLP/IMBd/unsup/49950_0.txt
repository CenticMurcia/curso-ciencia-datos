I was disappointed and disgusted with Peirs Morgans comments to the Celtic dancers. It was totally inappropriate on national television (prime time, no less) to suggest(?) that the family drop mom & dad from the act. It almost sounded like blackmail...they not only could win the competition this night, but very possibly win the million dollars but only if they got rid of mom and dad. Family values? Then to top it off, to encourage a stripper (with all the sexual innuendos) during a prime time television show in my opinion is not family entertainment. Could NBC be risking a "Janet Jackson" faux paus with this behavior? Brandi is right...a stripper has no place on prime time TV. In my opinion Peirs Morgan needs to receive an "X" (or the axe)!
