While nothing terribly original, "Adam & Evil" takes the classic elements of the woodland horror tale and crafts a fine picture, better than many of its similarly obscure peers. Well acted, actually funny where it's supposed to be funny, sexy and suspenseful with an ending that isn't telegraphed from the beginning (though admittedly not nearly on par with the shock endings of such films as "Jason Goes To Hell - The Final Friday" or the shocks all throughout "Jian Gui" (aka "The Eye"). One of the better of the unheralded films in horror's 'slasher' sub-genre; recommended to fans of "Tourist Trap", the "Friday The 13th" series, and similar greats.
