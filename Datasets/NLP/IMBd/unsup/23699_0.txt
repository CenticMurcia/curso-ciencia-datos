This film exemplified the acting talents of Amitabh Bacchan. As he's aged his roles have been more of a dramatic nature and I think that this role in particular shows his talent and skill as a cinematic artist. Kareena Kapoor was another highlight. She looked beautiful in her plain clothing and makeup, a nice change indeed. Amir Khan doesn't seem to be as emotionally engaging with the audience and the limited scenes with Jaya Bacchan is just disappointing. She lights up the scene when she is in the room, and there just isn't enough of her to make a completely believable character. The musical numbers seem gratuitous and out of place in this dramatic context and it would have worked better had they been removed completely. This is still a very good film exploring ethic conflict in India post-partition, but just does not have the strength and impact of Bombay (1995).
