This is one of the better Hong-Kong bullet fest to be released in a while.<br /><br />The movie sets are good, the action fast, the gritty cold violence reasonably to excellently done. All the actors are good with kudo's going to Andy Lau for stealing many of the scenes.<br /><br />The basic story is about a flamboyant over the top new assassin hoping to take over number 1 spot held by a disciplined introspective killer.<br /><br />There are a couple of important sub plots involving a women and of course the cop trying to chase them both down.<br /><br />This movie is all about set action pieces and how well they can be executed...that that is pretty darn well.<br /><br />A fun movie with a charismatic cast and lots of blood and bullets.
