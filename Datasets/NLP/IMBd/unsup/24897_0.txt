This film is not a bad movie, but for some reason on here its being attacked. I watched this as a child and thought it was brilliant and watched it when ever it was on. It's got villains, treasure hunt and what shocked some good drama. If you want to make your kids happy pop them down in front of this movie and I guarantee they will enjoy it. Great family film. This film is not the Goonies but the film is based on a similar thing. A 300 year old map, pirates a treasure map and a competition on who can find the treasure first. This film is not yet out on VHS or DVD so if you get a chance to watch in on TV then I recommend you tape it to watch at a later date. Great family fun to have in you're collection, but like I said its no Goonies but it's a good film in its own right.
