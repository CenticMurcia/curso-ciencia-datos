No flashing steel-armored knights and dazzling pageantry, this is a telling of the Arthur tale as he probably was - a British warlord struggling to maintain order and civilization after the withdrawal of the Roman legions in the fifth century. Arthur is mentored by Ambrosius Aurelianus, the "last of the Romans" in war and diplomacy, and together they fight against the barbarians pressing down on the remnants of Roman Britain.
