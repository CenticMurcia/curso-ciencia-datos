This movie is very much in the tradition of Kubrick. It's quiet, it's dramatic, sophisticated and beautifully shot. The ending is ambiguous; open to interpretation. Cameron Bright is convincingly haunted as the possible re-incarnation of Anna's (Nicole Kidman) deceased husband. Birth reveals the ways in which love and the removal of that love can traumatize us. I did not realize who the director of this film was until after I finished it. I was pleased to see that Mr. Glazer has also directed Sexy Beast which is another excellent film and one of my personal favorites of the past 10 years or so. I strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Sexy Beast or the work of Kubrick.
