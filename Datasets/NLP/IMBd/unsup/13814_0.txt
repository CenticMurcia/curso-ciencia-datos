Melvin and Howard is one of those rare movies that are overlooked. The 80's were dominated by director John Hughes. Maybe that's why more movie fans haven't heard of Melvin and Howard. The story of Howard Hughes contains enough material to make a hundred movies. What stands out here is the story and acting.<br /><br />The character of Melvin is the classic lovable loser type done to perfection. As I watched I was pulling for Melvin to make it. He was a dreamer. I loved every time the daughter bounced back and forth between parents she would yell BYE DAD or BYE MOM. <br /><br />I had no clue Mary Steenburgen was that hot naked in the 80's!!!! She's working in a nude go-go bar then quits. Before she leaves she pulls her clothes off walking out in the buff. Her backside looked magnificent. I recommend this touching heartfelt story.
