Putting this film on a DVD with "Monstar-a-Go-Go" was really a stroke of genius for this film's reputation, because MAGG is so awful that it makes this poorly-assembled collection of audio and images look GOOD.<br /><br />Seriously, I put this film on the TV at a party with the sound turned down, and on that level, it had some merit: flaky, trippy, visuals that lent some visual interest in the background. "What the H IS THIS???" asked more than one person. I was forced to go into an explanation, which left the people utterly befuddled and looking as if they had been struck about the head and shoulders with a lead bong.<br /><br />On that level, I can not recommend PBT4W, but I hope I have at least provided some kind of scenario in which it would not be a net deficit. Use this information as you will.
