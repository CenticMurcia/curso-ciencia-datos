Its not that I don't understand the film or the message it is trying to send, its just that its very badly done. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers an awful performance but not all the blame can be placed on her. The writing is far to witty at times to be spoken by people going about their day and the plots events that occur are totally unbelievable. There is one scene in which Heidi watches a film and then a few days later the romantic scene that occurred in the film happens to her in "real life." Often times I found myself laughing when the mood of the film was meant to be serious. It just isn't good, flat out. Also I thought the film played too much on gay and lesbian stereotypes.
