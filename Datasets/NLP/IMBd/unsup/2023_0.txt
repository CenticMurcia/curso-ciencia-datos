i've seen this film as its intended to be. in mandarin and english. as such the dubbing problem was not really an issue. you get to hear almost everyone in their own voice save for perhaps a few non-essentials. personally i felt the character of zhao was not fully developed, while certain scenes are totally unbelievable. the general plot is so typical of a hong kong movie, however there are a few surprises along the way.<br /><br />what should be commended are the camerawork, use of digital graphics and the director's interpretation of how the story should flow. its totally so un-hongkong, its refreshing.<br /><br />definately a must-watch for lovers of hong kong movies, especially those who felt the standard has fallen quite a bit due to piracy. if you can get your hands on it, watch the version with the original dialog with mandarin and english.
