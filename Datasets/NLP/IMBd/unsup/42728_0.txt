Sometimes I watch movies from the "Bottom 100" to laugh a little, but this "film", if it is actually allowed to call it this way, outclassed everything I have ever seen before. It is not funny like "plan 9" or "the claw" it is sad. <br /><br />It really hurts to see acting, that could be outclassed by every kindergarten theater group on this planet.<br /><br />The biggest problem of the movie is the "numbing-factor", your brain will be switched off by the movie and you will be stunned until the credits start.<br /><br />Even though the movie has a story, too stupid for any 1st-grader, it doesn't really follow these. The actors are just fooling around for 80 minutes. <br /><br />Trust me and do not watch this movie. If you did, demand refunds from the director. If you didn't pay to watch the movie, then sue him for solatium, for this is mental cruelty on tape.
