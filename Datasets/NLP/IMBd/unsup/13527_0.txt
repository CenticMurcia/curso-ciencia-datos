Siamese twin brother falls in love with hooker with a heart of gold? Okay, I was willing to go with it. Every part of my being was trying to warn me, but, I really wanted to like this film. And, to the credit of the Polish brothers (writer/director/stars of this opus), they pull it off...for about 20 minutes.<br /><br />The greatest problem with the indie film movement is, that everybody thinks they're making great art. I wonder if the Polish brothers were sitting in the editing room, thinking to themselves (like I was), "there's no earthly reason for these two people to fall in love! We haven't given either character the opportunity to get to know each other, much less fall in love! But, hey, we're making indie films here! We don't need rhyme or reason!"<br /><br />Mark and Michael Polish DO deliver halfway decent performances - though I'd rather have seen Michael in the lead. The other performances are marred by chintzy dialogue that was cliche 50 years ago.<br /><br />All in all, a complete waste of time.
