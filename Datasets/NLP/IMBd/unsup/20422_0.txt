I was expecting to be grossly disappointed by this sequel, after the first offering which blew me away ((being a Newcastle fan and all)) I was pleasantly surprised however at the ease at which the story flowed between Santiago's time at Newcastle, to his blossoming career at Real Madrid.<br /><br />A real heartbreaking moment was when he allowed the money and dizzy heights of his new found fame go to his head, and pushed away the lovely Roz.<br /><br />An upside however was Santiago finally finding his long lost mother and a stepbrother he never knew he had...<br /><br />All in all, a rollicking good watch for all concerned.
