This is a movie best viewed outside the US. It is about an Italian 17 year old who comes to live in the US after his mother is killed in a bank robbery. The script is poor and irrational. The best thing that you might gain from this movie is to see how some Italians view life in the US. It definitely IS NOT for entertainment for US viewers.
