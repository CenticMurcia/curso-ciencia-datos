I'll keep this brief and straight to the point, unlike the movie. The movie incorporated a commendable animation, which was near realistic. Of course there's a morale to the story, the folly of men, but how many movies and tales do we have to hear about our own bane. While you're condemning our actions you might as well enthrall the audience. I was mortified with the action scenes. I wasn't particularly fond of butchery.<br /><br />I was hoping for a more Underworld type movie, and what I got was an array of screaming fable creatures and a depressing story line.<br /><br />Not to be criticizing the directors, they seem intelligent but this is not the way to make millions.<br /><br />An audience prefers to leave a movie happy or in positive or intellectual verbal contemplation of the storyline. I didn't recall a murmur, silence in fact.<br /><br />I apologise for the hard work. Great actors but not such a great motion picture.
