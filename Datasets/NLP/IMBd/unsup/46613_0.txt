This movie was critically destroyed when it was released, but it is not that bad, it is just a harmless little romantic comedy. The worst thing about it is that its view of male-female relationships is so backward - especially in a movie set in modern-day San Francisco!. Chris O'Donnell is not a great actor, but he is good portraying this earnest, somewhat shallow man. And Renee Zellweger is fine, even though her cinematic persona has by now overstayed its welcome. I haven't seen Buster Keaton's original movie, but I don't doubt it was vastly superior to this, but this. Still, this new version might be a passable time-killer in a rainy Friday night.
