Contagion, a movie about the president, a scientist and an evil virus was not the best movie. The acting in this movie was just awful, from beginning to end. The script was predictable and unoriginal with over-used clich√©s and bad lines. The acting was not the only problem that this movie had. The movie did not flow very smoothly, there were constant scene changes and loud interruptions telling the viewer the timeline in which the movie is taking place. It was hard paying attention to storyline because the pace of the movie was so staggered and hard to follow. Not only was the story hard to follow, it also made no sense. It was never clear why the villains wanted to kill the president or who they really were. The Movie, overall, was just awful. It was the kind of movie you could rent if you wanted to see a bad movie with bad acting and terrible effects. I would say one phrase sums up the entire film: "I want my hour and a half back."
