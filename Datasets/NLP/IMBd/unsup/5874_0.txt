The Divine Woman, although short, is one of the most beautiful films in which I have seen Greta Garbo. The film is not as heavy as some of her other work, although there are some sad undertones. The fact that The Divine Woman is a silent film really makes the movie stand out from Miss Garbo's other movies, and because it is silent, the passion, sadness, happiness, and all other emotions of the characters shine through more than they normally would in a talking film. Since only a small portion (a few minutes) of this film are known to exist, there is added intrigue about the film, and even in its brevity, the film seems complete. This movie is one of the best of all time, especially since it is a very different type of film for Greta Garbo.
