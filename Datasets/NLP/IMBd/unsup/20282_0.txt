Its called The Ninja Squad...where's the ninja squad in this film? All we see are individual ninjas cruising round fighting each other, because they've got nothing else to do besides meditate and wave their swords around to the same individual sound effect. Then again I bought this film for a pound; so what do you expect? We see the protagonist, Billy, being trained as a young boy to become the world's greatest ninja. After several shots of generic ninja training Billy has become a grown man and an ultimate ninja! Then he starts complaining about how he can't get a job, as there's little work for ninjas in his hometown. Its an unwritten rule that ninja's financial issues aren't addressed in ninja films, but maybe director Godfrey Ho was trying to kick some realism into the formula. If he did, it fell flat on its face with the dubbed Australian and Texas accents against the faces of people clearly from an Asian background. But at least Billy is inconspicuous. His fellow ninjas parade round in what looks like cheap, camp, fancy dress, with a headband bearing the title'ninja', just to clarify. Its terrible. This is why I love this film and you have to watch it!!!
