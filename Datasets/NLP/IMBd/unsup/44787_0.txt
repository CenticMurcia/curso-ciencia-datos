This movie is sooooo sloooooowwww. It's got occassional good moments, as when Ichi explains how she wound up in her fight or Isaburo running towards the riflemen through the vegetation, but the pacing is glacial and the story is somewhat interesting but not nearly interesting enough to support over two hours of movie.
