Many stories of people facing various problems in Warsaw intersect with some very funny results. There are gangsters, wanna-be gangsters, stoners, an ambitious music student, prostitutes, and ex-girlfriends among others.<br /><br />The film, obviously inspired by "Pulp Fiction" was a big hit in Poland and now is a movie people there quote. The unofficial sequels fared pretty well too and overall it is good dose of entertainment. Many Polish films by directors like Wajda, Kieslowski, Bajon and others were always so serious. Either adaptations of literature (which is very centered on Poland and not very accessible to the movie going public outside of Poland - history scholars being the exception), or politically themed films that critique the often volatile situation that Poland has faced throughout its turbulent history.<br /><br />"Chlopaki Nie Placza" provides a total break from that and gives the viewer pure entertainment without it being as gritty and bloody as "Psy." No more painful reminding about how much damage World War II caused, no more fear of the Red Terror and Iron Curtain, just a funny -though improbable - look at contemporary society. --- 8/10<br /><br />Not Rated, but has strong profanity, some violence and drug use which would give it an R from the MPAA.
