Indeed, this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen- which is exactly why it kept my attention. I first saw it on a tour bus while studying in Ghana, West Africa. The driver showed it because, I think, he thought we all knew and loved it. It's intriguing, which pieces of our culture are picked up abroad. This movie, in particular, is over the top awful. It hits just about every cheesy gimmick that a low budget sci-fi-action-thriller can, and then more. <br /><br />Every time you think it can't get any worse, it does so- emphatically. With gusto and over-dramatic affectation, this movie has won its way into my heart as the most entertainingly worthless bit of film imaginable. I would recommend it for the sheer entertainment value. It's probably even better drunk. Seriously- watch this movie.
