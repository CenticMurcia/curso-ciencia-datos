This movie is an very entertaining M.A movie. The Cast of this movie was excellent with Hector Echavarria (The Falklandman) Michel Qissi (kickboxer 1,2, terminator woman) and Youssef Qissi (The Falklandman). The fights were good directed only I was a little disappointed of Michel Qissi. We didn't see his true Muay Thai Skills. For an american movie the fights were great. The bad thing about this movie was the acting. Echavarria is a great martial artist but a bad actor. Michel and Youssef Qissi were normal. The story was simple. The directing skills of Michel Qissi were very good and I hope he is going to make so more movies.<br /><br />8/10 (only the martial arts) 7/10 (the normal rating)
