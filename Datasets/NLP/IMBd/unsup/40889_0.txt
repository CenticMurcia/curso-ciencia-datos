it's a blatant rip-off of Hollywood cult hit flick Scream starring Drew Barrymore and Neve Campbell. Only here, you have over three hours of gut slashing blood spilling gore. The film introduces Kajol little sister Tanisha to Bollywood, but trust me she is nothing special. Her sister Kajol is Meryl Streep in comparison. Anyhow, since I've told you that this is a copy of Scream, you should already know the plot. Don't suspect anybody because I can assure you the director and writers have gone out of their way to really throw you off. You won't be able to guess who the killer is until they reveal the secret. Dino Morea co-stars as sexy Rocky who's secretly in love with Mehak (played by Tanisha)who is in love with Suraj (played by Karan Nath) who is brothers with Rajat (played by Gaurav Kapoor) who is in love with Gehna (played by Suvarna Jha) who is secretly sweet on Rocky. Yup! it's a teeny-bop-per-soap-opera mixed into a scary movie. People probably turned their noses up to this one at the Cineplexes, if the kissing scene and brutal almost rape scene are any indication. C-
