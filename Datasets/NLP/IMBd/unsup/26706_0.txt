This is the only Joe D'Amato film I have seen without it's trademark explicit sexual content,but this does not mean it is not as extreme as,let say,"Emanuelle in America".A group of tourists arrive on a Greek island,without knowing it is inhabited by a demented,cannibalistic killer.The movie contain some graphic and very disturbing murders,especially in the last minutes,when the maniac eats a fetus and then devours himself.Add a good dose of suspense,great make-up for George Eastman and ,surprisingly,a very sad story behind his character.So,if you want to see a truly horror classic I recommend "Anthropophagus",even for those with a weak stomach.
