Offhand, I can think of only two movies in film history that have been narrated by murder victims: Billy Wilder's "Sunset Blvd." (1950), one of the finest pictures of all time, and 1947's "Scared to Death," which turns out to be one of the worst. This latter effort also holds the distinction of being Bela Lugosi's only movie to have been filmed in color. Bela here plays a hypnotist/magician named Leonide, who comes with his dwarf companion Angelo Rossitto (who appeared with Bela in 1942's infinitely superior film "The Corpse Vanishes") to cousin George Zucco's house, where George's daughter-in-law is being driven insane by a mysterious masked personage. Nat Pendleton is on hand as a remarkably dim-witted cop, and the juvenile humor that he provides would have torpedoed this film itself, without any help from its other wretched elements. But those wretched elements are there in abundance: The plot here makes little sense, the script is by turns fatuous and yawn inducing, the background music is annoying, the "action" is confined to a few rooms, the characters are ridiculous types, and the entire film is tedious and uninvolving. Bela's grimacing presence doesn't even begin to salvage this one. Anyway, my beloved "Psychotronic Encyclopedia" calls this film "surreal"; the Maltin book deems it "dreadful"; I say that you might require psychedelics to get you through! It's only 65 minutes long, but trust me, they'll feel like the longest 65 minutes of your life! I must also add that this is the first DVD from Alpha Video that I've viewed that seems to have been taken from a respectable-looking print; too bad it was for this pathetic little stinker!
