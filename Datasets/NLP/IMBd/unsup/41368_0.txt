This film was doomed to fail from the start. I mean, c'mon, a film based on little sexualized urban "Barbies"?!?! Its just amazing what Hollywood would do to make a quick buck out of this derivative piece of uninspired pretentious "image conscious" POS. The main "characters" are just clones of those from yesteryear of film. Put simply, this film just plain sucks. IT SUCKS!!! John Voight, has, up to this point, belittled himself to the detriment of himself...literally. What actor would star in this? Is it for the money or to push up against these "beampoles"? The main idea of this film is image, just what perception of image as laid out in this film is anyone's judgement.<br /><br />Little kids or fans of these "Urban Barbies" may like this film for its "merit" but only from a kid's point of view. Adults, please take heed and do your best to try and wipe this film's existence from your mind. Like Morpheus said to Neo in the Matrix: Free your mind.
