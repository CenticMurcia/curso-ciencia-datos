I must agree with the previous comment: This movie is a girls-movie. Nothing wrong about that, but men (or just everybody) without taste for blooming colors and sticky romance should avoid this film. Truly this must be the low-point of the wonderful Cate Blanchets career.<br /><br />In my view, this film is perfect for the sunday 5pm slot. I would have liked to see the gender of the positive commentators below.
