This is not a good film to come across at three am on Cinemax. It looks like a soft porn film with a fantastic looking-star, opens with a tease of a sex scene, and then deteriorates into a soft porn story-line with VERY little pay-off. Hey, it's got some kinda famous porn stars in it, and the lead character is better looking than any of them, so you might get your hopes up: don't. But the biggest let down is that she ISN'T a porn star, so forget trying to find something more graphic with her in it. Then the guy from Fantastic Four and the Horatio Hornblower movies shows up and it's even more confusing. It kinda reminds me of some of the reality shows they have on HBO sometimes, but this is a made up script. It's also a slow, grinding ride, and not the good kind. This would work better as a real porn movie or if it were about a real porn star's life. (What about a true bio pic about Cheyanne for example?) It's sad fact that most porn stars don't look anything like the lead here, just a bad dye job and a boob job. Ugh, don't waste your time on this one...
