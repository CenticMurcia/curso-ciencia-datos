I watched "The Forbin project" ("Le cerveau d'acier" in french) as a kid ; I was about 8 in this time, so it was 20 years or so ago. I remember I was scared by this cold, logical and omnipotent machine. I kept a very impressed memory from this movie. <br /><br />Seeing it again recently by pure chance, I was more or less ready to be deluded, as often when you're rediscovering movies you liked as a child. To my greatest surprise, I was truly happy to measure that my remembering was right. This movie was way advanced for its time : all the "sci-fi" aspects that perhaps seemed silly to a 1970 audience have become true : web transmissions, webcams, artificial intelligence and so on. <br /><br />The scariest thing about the real main character of the movie, US-made supercomputer Colossus, later known as "World Control" after its fusion with its soviet counterpart, Guardian, is it acts the way you would act if you resigned all your human feelings, keeping your intelligence. <br /><br />Colossus will certainly lead mankind to a safer, logically ruled, world. But this world will be a hell, as well as a golden cage for an intelligent bird. <br /><br />God has created Mankind at His image, and Mankind created Colossus at its own, by its own laziness to solve its own problems. <br /><br />If you please, you can consider THX 1138 as a kind of sequel of this movie (it was released one year after this one). <br /><br />To conclude, a very pessimistic movie, in a "Planet of the apes/1970 era" tone and style. A special mention to Eric Braeden, who precisely played a POTA universe crucial character a little time later.
