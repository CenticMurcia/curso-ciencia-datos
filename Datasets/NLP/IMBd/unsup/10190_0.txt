There isn't much to say about this film, you MUST see it!<br /><br />If you, like me, loved El Laberinto del Fauno this is an awesome choice!<br /><br />It was chilly as hell and really good script! I must admit though I didn't get any chocks but I didn't get that either when I saw the Exorcist so don't be surprised if you get scared! The story told is generally about a mother losing her child and her fight to retrieve him. You come to see some extreme situations that she is going through (some of them almost suicidal or might drive one crazy) in the belief that her son is still alive and that there is a way of getting him back.<br /><br />Anyway I'm not going to spoil this masterpiece of Spanish horror so GO SEE IT!!! It must not be missed! It's B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!<br /><br />enjoy the magic of the orphanage...
