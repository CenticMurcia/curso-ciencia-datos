A LOT OF SPOILERS HERE, SO BEWARE <br /><br />There has been considerable fuss over this movie, and I'm not sure why. Rather than being 'shocking,' as some have called it, I found it pretty predictable, primarily because the characters are clichés that have been familiar figures in movies over the past 10 or 15 years.<br /><br />'Mujer, etc.' is a Peruvian film that is really a stylish soap opera. We have the conflicted husband Ignacio (Christiane Meier) who can't conceive; the unhappy, confused and childless wife Zoe (Barbara Mori); and the husband's brother, a scruffy, ever-cool, always foul-mouthed Gonzalo (Manolo Cardona), who also just happens to be a talented artist (why are these people never accountants or claims adjusters?). Gonzalo wants to sexually possess the wife rather than love her, more out of revenge and hatred for his brother.<br /><br />And then, to round up the usual clichéd suspects, we have the nonthreatening, flaming gay guy Boris (Bruno Bichir) who offers secret, breathless advice to Zoe while confessing, around deeply effeminate giggles, that he finds her husband 'very hot'. Zoe, for reasons that escape me, regularly and inexplicably seeks his counsel. This is some counsel: Boris says Zoe's husband must be gay because if he wasn't he would want to have sex with her every day (this is after 10 years of marriage). With advice like that I'd be looking for another nonthreatening, flaming gay guy.<br /><br />It could be my imagination, but contemporary movies are littered with situations like this: the 'third-party' omniscient gay man who is sought out for advice by confused heterosexual women or men.<br /><br />Director Ricardo de Montreuil tries to explain everything toward the end, and it becomes a pretty awkward 'wrapping up' ceremony. The husband confesses he 'likes men' (i.e. he's always been gay). The wife, who has slept with this guy for 10 whole years, appears to be shocked by his confession. Credibility anyone? <br /><br />The nonthreatening gay guy offers to adopt the wife's baby as his own (and how many times have we seen this scenario?). The wife is content with a child donated by sperm from the rotten brother, who has exacted his revenge on his brother and wants nothing more to do with the wife. The husband carries on, living a gay lifestyle while he continues to live, and sleep, with his wife in an agreement that includes a 'fully loving' relationship. Egads. As if.<br /><br />This director wants us to suspend a whole lot of disbelief in this film, and it just doesn't work, at least for me.
