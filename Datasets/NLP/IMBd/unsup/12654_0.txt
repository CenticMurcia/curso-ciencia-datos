I want the minutes of my life back! This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Firstly it was about an hour into the movie before anything happened and when it did it wasn't scary. I kept watching thinking anything this dull has to have an interesting ending, but it didn't! Oh and the creatures are what exactly? Moose ghosts?? So tell me if I have the story right........ Basically really old snow that contains the soul's of moose ghosts is melting due to global warming and when an oil company drills a hole it releases these evil moose ghosts to go around killing people and sending them crazy? My 4 year old could write a better story!
