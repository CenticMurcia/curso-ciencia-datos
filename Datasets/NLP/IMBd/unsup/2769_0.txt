Taken at the Flood had a bad end like Cards on the Table. When I saw After the Funeral I imagined Poirot's Movies were good again, but this last movie had changed the final.<br /><br />David Hunter used a bomb??? Did he kill her sister and Gordon Cloade on the book??? Did he pretend to be an old lady to make an alibi??? I don't think so. Please don't change the finals.<br /><br />I love Poirot's Movies and the books of Agatha Christie, so if the end of the book is very ingenious and good why change it?<br /><br />I believe that the next movies will be good. And where are Miss Lemon, Captain Hastings and Chief-Inspector Japp? I don't think they are old and retired.
