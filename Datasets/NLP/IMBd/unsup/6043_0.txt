I commenting Mega Man 2 after beating it a lot of years since I beat it the first time. Thanks to Console Emulation I am living again the experience of playing gems like this baby. I am surprised to see how amazingly addictive this games are still to this day. <br /><br />Mega Man 2 is not only a sequel made to cash-out the success of the first Mega Man is a step forward in many aspects. More user friendly than Mega 1, this game has a system of password-saving that lets the gamer save his progress without having to play the game in its entirety every time. Also Mega Man 2 is not as difficult as the first one because the worlds of Dr. Willy's creations are easy to learn and memorize. In all I believe some people may be frustrated because there are many things and processes to memorize (jump that, don't jump that; use that weapon with that enemy, learn the AI patron of that other one)and also some good reflexes are needed of course. But that's the entertaining side of this thing after all. <br /><br />Almost twenty years later Mega Man 2 with simple sprite-animation can give me more hours of enjoyment than many modern hits with incredibly astounding 3D Animation. But not always the better-looking game is the best game. I can't rate it with any other number than ten. Capcom scores another victory with this one (I lose the count of how many great games they have released throughout the years). Without a doubt my favorite from the Mega Man series for the NES system.
