In what is Adam Sandlers best work to date, the hopeless hockey failure Happy Gilmore must join the Professional Golfers Tour to help his Grandmother with her finances. <br /><br />As a golfer myself I can say that the antics pulled in this golf caper are are riot! I have seen the film probably over 50 times but each time I laugh as if it were my first time viewing it.<br /><br />From Carl Weathers and his wooden hand, to Happy teaming up with Bob Barker, this movie keep you laughing the whole way through. Even my 80 year old grandparent loved it!<br /><br />Perhaps the best review I can give for this movie comes from Happy himself-- "Talk about a hole in one!"
