This must be one of the most ridiculous movies ever made, but it actually works brilliantly! The Cannonball Run contains laughs aplenty, and is a wonderful over the top road race film. The storyline is highly unlikely and the acting not expertly carried out, but that's not the point! Upon first viewing I laughed out loud, and I still do, so many times I have watched it now! Released in 1981, The Cannonball Run has significantly dated and looks as if it was filmed in the 1960s, but because it's so lighthearted and fun, it doesn't matter. Burt Reynolds and Roger Moore are the main stars of the show, but everyone else takes part in just the same manner, and there's a whole host of TV and movie stars you can think of: Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Peter Fonda, Adrienne Barbeau, Farrah Fawcett (looking beautiful) and Jackie Chan to name a few! The Cannonball Run was Fawcett's first major successful film after leaving Charlie's Angels in 1977. Shame she had to wait four years...<br /><br />However, in a nutshell, The Cannonball Run is utterly over the top and looks significantly older than it is, but the sheer laughs and ridiculous moments you witness in everyone's objective to win this illegal road race across America is sure to be enjoyed!
