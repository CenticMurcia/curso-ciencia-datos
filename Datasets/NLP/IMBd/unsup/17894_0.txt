I've seen The Emperor's Candlesticks twice now and I'm still trying to figure it out. Why are the Russian secret police so intent on getting their Grand Duke killed is beyond me?<br /><br />Polish patriots kidnap a Romanov Grand Duke while he's on a holiday in Vienna. The Grand Duke is played by Robert Young and he's with Frank Morgan as his protector. That alone should tell you Romanov security stinks big time. Young's seduced and led to his kidnappers by the lovely Maureen O'Sullivan. <br /><br />She's got a good reason for doing it, her father's in a Czarist prison awaiting a death sentence. The idea is to swap Young for dad. But for some reason I absolutely can't fathom, the Poles are afraid their note explaining their demands to the Czar won't reach him.<br /><br />The Poles get William Powell to deliver the message and the Russians have their own agent Luise Rainer. The note is to be delivered in one of a pair of Louis XV candlesticks and Powell and Rainer run all over Europe, Vienna, Paris, London and finally St. Petersburg. Naturally of course the opposing spies are falling for each other.<br /><br />The same plot gambit was used by MGM in Operator 13 with Gary Cooper and Marion Davies in the American Civil War and also in The Firefly with Allan Jones and Jeanette MacDonald. Those were pretty good films, but MGM came up short with this one. The Emperor's Candlesticks wastes a pretty good cast in a very trite and incoherent story that Powell and Rainer can't save no matter how much they turn on the charm.
