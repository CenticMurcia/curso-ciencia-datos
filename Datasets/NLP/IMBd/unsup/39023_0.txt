First up: I'm going to give away what happens. This is so you don't have to watch one of the worse films of all time.<br /><br />The only decent scene is when the vampire, played by Victoria, has her head chopped off. I knew it was her long before they copped her head off. It is unintentionally funny. It's hilarious to watch her head bounce and roll down the steps. By the end of the movie, you are so happy that it's finally going to be over.<br /><br />The acting, direction, production values, clumsy plotting, and silly set design make this terrible all-around. I was angry that it's not even about werewolves, per se, but vampires. But the fact that it steals so shamelessly from Agatha Christe is what make me want to scream! I can not believe this is not in the worse 50 films ever. My old friend Paul loved it. That makes sense, as he's a total misanthrope.
