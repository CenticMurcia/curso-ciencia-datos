I saw this film on DOC TV on the Dish Network last night and could not take a break. I was furious that this was taking place while OJ was on trial and it was the stupid OJ trial we were being bombarded with day in and day out while genocide was taking place. Those that now rent the public airwaves should be jailed for not abiding by the laws they are to adhere to when they use the public airwaves.<br /><br />From beginning to the end I was glued to my seat. Dallaire is a hero in my book, and should be to all humanity-loving people. This is a must see documentary. However, it would've helped more if we had seen what was going on WHILE it was happening!
