Stephen King is overrated, period! What is so scary about his stories?Somebody please tell me.These stories (along with his other stories) are not scary. They are absurd and ridiculous, but certainly not scary. It's a joke he has obtained the reputation that he has. I would consider this material worthy for a comedy. The only good part in it was the cat. That little guy kicked butt. King sucks. Get a clue, people. He's a terrible story teller and he doesn't fulfill the purpose of the genre he writes for. Anthologies tend to suck anyways because they are always lacking in proper plot and character development. Bottom line, the movie is not very entertaining and not at all scary. If you'd like to see a ridiculous movie with harebrained ideas in it, by all means, this is the movie for you. Since the attention span for the general public is in the toilet, I would recommend it to people who wouldn't know a good movie if it hit them in the face, i.e. practically everyone.
