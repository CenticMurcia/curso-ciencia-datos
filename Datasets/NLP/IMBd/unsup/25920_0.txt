The show is set in a locally owned grocery store. The founder's son has inherited the store after the death of his father. The characters primarily consist of the owner/son and the quirky employees. A very formulaic premise. I don't normally think of TBS for original comedy. Thus, I was not expecting much. Boy, was I surprised. It was very funny.<br /><br />The generally unknown cast is appreciated as it is a nice contrast to the recycled comedy actors on the Big 4 networks. The first episode did a nice job of introducing the characters with humor and even had a little dramatic tension. If subsequent episodes are this smart, I am definitely hooked. 9 out of 10.
