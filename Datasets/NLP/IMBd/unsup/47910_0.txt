There is no way to put it, this is bad film-making. SIgned to a contract, the Beatles decided to get over the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, by making a movie themselves. In the end, Paul took over creative control and had no idea what he was doing.<br /><br />The simple plot is that Ringo takes his grieving aunt to a Bus Tour Company (famous in England in the post-war days)that offers a "magical" trip on their tour. Unfortunately, nothing magical happens... just a hodge-podge of bizarre skits and freak shows that really go nowhere. The bus is overlooked by 4 or 5 wizards who are supposed to make sure the magic happens. There are some interesting scenes, but the movie is lost amid a psychedelic buzz of incoherency and lack of any kind of true storyline. Good music gets lost amid individual sketches occurring in a old RAF base, a field, a strip-club, and nowhere in particular. The camera work looks like a junior high 8mm project. Intended symbols and deeper meanings are just pretentious BS. Nowadays, McCartney claims that they were trying to make something different and make it look so unprofessional- bullocks! They had pot, LSD, cash, and camera and out came this tripe. The only saving grace of the whole movie is that, it is the one and only time and place where one can see John Lennon belt out his classic "I Am the Walrus." Also, the instrumental "Flying" is a great song. ALong with some of their first promotional films for earlier songs, this is more a collection of MTV-videos than a movie. As a Beatle fan, it is in my collection and occasionally viewed for some of the songs, but not often because it is so hard to wallow through.
