Went to the local film festival earlier tonight, or at least the kick-off for the local film festival. The venue couldn't have been worse, but it did aid in the general essence of the movie, Hide and Creep. The show was at Sloss Furnace in a concrete pit normally used for rock concerts and had small folding chairs for seating with a plethora of smoking and drinking. So what I am getting at is, it was a fun and unique experience!<br /><br />Now, as a preface I want to tell you that I am a huge fan of the horror genre. I like it all, shock-horror (naked blood), gore-horror (dead alive), classic-horror (night of the living dead), sci-fi-horror (event horizon), suspense-horror (in the mouth of madness), standard-horror (hell raiser), modern-horror (ginger snaps) and many others that I could go on listing forever. I like these movies for many different reasons and that is a whole other topic altogether, perhaps in the forums...<br /><br />This movie starts out quite amusingly with Chuck (writer/director/producer/actor) in his movie rental shop in rural Alabama, chastising a person on the phone about ZOMBIE films. Brilliant beginning. After reluctantly killing a ZOMBIE and finding out that the sheriff AND deputy are unavailable he does what any other good southerner would do and drops the dispatched ZOMBIE at the cop-shop and explains to a girl at the restaurant across the street where his breakfast is to be the obvious difference between Coke and Pepsi (the impostor cola).<br /><br />That is all I will ruin for you. If you are a casual fan of ZOMBIE films and like the new trend of horror films not taking themselves too seriously, then I can offer no better movie in that style than this.<br /><br />Camp, fun, charm and style, this flick has it all. I have no idea about the national release of this film, but I recommend it to just about anyone with a sense of humor and looking for a horrific-ZOMBIEfied time!<br /><br />To answer questions, yeah, there is nudity, yeah they have to be shot in the head, yeah, there are a lot of inside jokes for Alabamaians that won't all be lost on everyone else, and yeah, Coke is better than Pepsi!
