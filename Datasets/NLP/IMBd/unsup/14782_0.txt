Kal ho naa ho is a great story combining laughter and tears to perfection. Some viewer comments strangely focus on SRK's far-from-realistic performance, totally missing the point of this film in my opinion.<br /><br />It goes way beyond technicalities such as realism, along the lines of a fairy tale dealing with a multi-dimensional range of emotions and relational situations at a deep symbolic level, somewhat reminiscent of the french new wave of the 60's at its best.<br /><br />Poetry should not be scrutinized for its lack of realism but rather taken in from a distance, its inner message interpreted at a more intellectual level, with candor and an open heart. A such, kal ho naa ho hits the mark much like a wonderful display of fireworks.
