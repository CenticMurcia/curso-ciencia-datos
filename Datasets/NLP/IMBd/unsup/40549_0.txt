Why did I waste ninety minutes of my life on this piece of crap? Badly acted, horrendously directed and utterly devoid of a coherent story (climaxed by the brain-dead lead squashing a rat), how the hell does this thing garner these sort of numbers in here? Anyone giving this thing a 10 must be a masochist, desperately in need of therapy. First love? For whom? Obviously not these two sexaholics (though none of their sex scenes could ignite a candle). Last rites? Who for...the rat? That's about the only thing actually dying in this film whose title itself is a blatant lie.<br /><br />My only consolation is that I found this for 2 bucks in a bargain bin, but I WANT MY NINETY MINUTES BACK! Curse each and every talentless hack who helped birth this hunk of garbage!!
