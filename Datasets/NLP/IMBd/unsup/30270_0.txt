This film does an extraordinary job of portraying an important part of American history with a modern flair. The score, albeit anachronistic, worked superbly with the film's content. Congratulations to HBO for producing such a wonderful timepiece. I'm anxiously awaiting the release of a soundtrack. <br /><br />Incidentally, I'm a heterosexual male...this is certainly not a "lesbian-only" film, as some have argued. Perhaps it'd be better labeled an "intellectuals-only" film. Appreciating a film like this requires not only the ability to appreciate and respect history, but also the ability to recognize the importance of sharing history with our children. Sometimes it takes a group of committed activists (i.e., "fringe elements") to affect change -- sometimes the majority is wrong in suppressing the rights of others. This movie's message is entirely appropriate in today's context...
