Don't expect dandies donning top hats in this gritty working man's drama. This one grabs you early with good outdoor photography and develops nicely with solid characters and drama. The heavy handedness of the plot is typical, but what makes the movie is its frank, realistic dialogue. If you've seen many of these old movies, you know how stylized and fakey the acting usually is. Also, early 30's camera-work is often stiff and stagy. This film really impresses with its excellent acting and highly innovative photography. The scene with the blind man feeling his way around the rail yard in a rainstorm is especially well done. What a great surprise!
