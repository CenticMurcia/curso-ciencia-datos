I am no gung ho patriot but this film is the pits. Are we supposed to enjoy a film where the anti-hero betrays his kindly commanding officer, sleeps with his wife, sleeps with a teenager, deals heroin on the side, consorts with Turkish gangsters, sells stolen weapons to said gangsters yet comes up the good guy? Lot's of movies had soldiers and sailors bucking the system, living it up and playing small time rackets ala McHale's Navy but when the chips came down you could count on them to come through. This clown you couldn't, yet we were supposed to root for him and jeer the hard nosed sergeant sent in to bust him? I realize that the military isn't all heroes and has a lot of wasted time, money and attracts a lot of real pigs and bullies too, but these men were located in a civilized country in the middle of Europe, not in some remote third world environs. So if being a total waste was the most they could accomplish on their off hours, then they are truly unworthy. This film is totally degenerate and stupid to boot, despite it's hip Euro appeal and it's A list actors. If you care anything about decency and a positive message about people in films, avoid it!
