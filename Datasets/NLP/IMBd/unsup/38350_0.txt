An insult to the Dutch, this film.<br /><br />Bad acting worries no-one, even though this movie is full of it.<br /><br />But look at the scenery. It doesn't even *half* look dutch. At any time. What is that contraption they bring into view repeatedly to act as different "Dutch windmills"??? Have the makers of this movie ever even seen a real one? I don't think so.<br /><br />Had the makers of this movie delved slightly deeper into the material that this movie pretends to be about, I'm quite sure they would have been able to make a real good movie....<br /><br />The story of the various treasures stolen by the nazi's is still actual, and it should not be told by people who do not know how a real Dutch windmill looks.<br /><br />Forgive me for not going into the "bad acting" part. I have never seen worse.
