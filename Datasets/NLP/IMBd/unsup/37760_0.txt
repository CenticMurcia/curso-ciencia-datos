Saw this was on by accident on cable and decided to watch it (having already seen the anime film of the same name, which I enjoyed).<br /><br />Mistake... BIG mistake.<br /><br />The violent content probably would preclude younger viewers from seeing it and yet they would possibly be the only ones able to appreciate the simplicity of the plot. The people in the film (I refrain from calling them actors) should watch out for termites their acting is so wooden.<br /><br />I didn't actually become ill so I gave it 2/10.
