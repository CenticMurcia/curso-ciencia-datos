I watched it when it hit video stores shelves and I regret for not watching it on the theaters.<br /><br />By far, it was the most complex and interesting sci-fi/action packed flick from 2002.<br /><br />I did have my doubts towards it because Tom Cruise starred on it. You know, by the time of it's release, he got really weird.<br /><br />But in my opinion, this is his best performance by far. But he's not alone, he's joined by the always powerful Max Von Sydow who delivers a fantastic performance. I don't get used to watch his as a villain.<br /><br />The complex plot was really interesting, filled with crime, spectacular f/x, mysterious characters, and extraordinary action sequences.<br /><br />Every single minute caught my attention and although I can't really remember most of the specific details or sub-plots; I can say without fear of being wrong that this is a spectacular sci-fi/action flick in all the sense of the word.
