I just saw this movie debut this evening on HBO. While I felt that all the actors were superb in their performance I also felt that there should be more of a story-line. I also thought too much time was spent on trivial dialogue between Thurman and Lewis about hairspray, what to drink , where to sit in the bar and what not, but maybe that was the intention of the director....<br /><br />I think the desperation that Thurman's character came across very well in her acting ... I did like the interaction between her and her mother and Gazarra but didn't quite buy the close relationship/best friend bond that was supposed to exist between Thurman and Lewis...<br /><br />Overall it was pretty good and I give it a 7.
