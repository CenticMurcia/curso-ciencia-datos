We all know the phrase "buying the cow" and this movie does a pretty good job of giving some different views on why one should commit or not. Ultimately, though, there are too many silly scenes and stereotypes that end up appearing stupid as opposed to humorous. The film does offer a few chuckles, but unfortunately too few to make the film worthwhile. Some scenes remind me of "There's Something About Mary", but there are just too few funny times. I think if the stereotypical situations went way out there, the funny scenes could really provide a good laugh.<br /><br />There are a couple unexpected twists, and that keeps it interesting. Also, it's great to see the World Trade Center in the NYC skyline.<br /><br />I saw this on a local cable channel, and am glad I didn't rent it. I wouldn't have felt that I'd gotten my money's worth. There are plenty of other good dating movies to see. This wouldn't be one of them.
