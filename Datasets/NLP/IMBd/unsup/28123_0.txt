It starta as an interesting movie, but then it turns into torture porn. <br /><br />You can stop watching after the first scene in the basement, I'm going to give you a quick summary: The main character doesn't say anything until it is too late. They and rape the girl. The old woman burns "F--k me" on the girl's skin, and burns her lady parts with a blow torch. The police arrives and the girl dies. The end.<br /><br />It is a well made movie, and the not-torture-porn parts are even enjoyable, but it could have been a lot better if it focused more on the psychological part of the torture rather than the cheap Hostel style crap it ends up with.<br /><br />And the whole "witness that doesn't report the crime" has been made over and over, so it is not even original.
