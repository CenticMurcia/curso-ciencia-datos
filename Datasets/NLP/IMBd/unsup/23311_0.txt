This film is not awful - it's "god, how awful". Everyone can see now that the Olsen twins can't act a little bit. Not even that but the plot is always predictable, too. Girls don't like each other, girls want to go to town, girls get into trouble, girls meet cute boys, girls get out of trouble, girls start to like each other again, girls stay with cute boys - crap like that was shown dozens of times before. Not necessarily in that order but who cares. So it's a complete waste of time and money - except you were invited. Then it's just a waste of time.<br /><br />So if you can avoid watching that film do so. For me the film is worth two out of ten, and just 'cause there are films which are even worse - which is hard to believe, 'cause this one sucks.<br /><br />By the way: Oxford = London? Man, whoever made this up, check your knowledge in geography.
