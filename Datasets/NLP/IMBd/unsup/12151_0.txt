Back in college, I saw this once and was enraptured by all the layered meaning and the deep metaphysical discussion this movie brought out. I dragged several people to see it, including my mom and my sister-in-law, because I just thought they HAD to see it. Then, years later, I rented it for my nephew to experience. We watched about a half hour of it, and when they got to the part where Andre is talking about the blue monster with flowers growing out of its toes, I asked him if he'd seen enough. He said yes, and I turned it off with a great sense of relief. My perspectives had sure changed in 20-some years, but what I had thought was an incredible mind-bender had turned into a pile of garbage. I couldn't imagine a discussion I'd want to be less a part of. Andre seemed like a smug jerk who'd been doing some serious hallucinogens and Wally came off a sad loser. Then we watched Waiting for Guffman, which kind of meandered on its own. But what do you know - at the end, ironically, there just happened to be the little section about the My Dinner With Andre action figures. Both of us just about died laughing. What were the chances of that happening?!
