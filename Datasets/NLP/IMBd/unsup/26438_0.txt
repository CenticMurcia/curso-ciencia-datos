Was lucky enough to view this at Sundance in Park City this past Monday morning in the Park City HS gym. Craig Lucas introduced the film and took questions after. The crowd was in awe of the acting, plot, the actual house where filmed etc. A wonderful film that hopefully will stun audiences. Patricia Clarkson, Peter Saarsgard and Campbell Scott were perfect in their roles. Was this purchased at Sundance? Is this subject matter going to make it on a national level with our present political situation so anti-gay? Mr. Lucas blasted our present president and our sorry political environment. He was thrilled with the film and the number of people in the audience at 9 in the morning. A treat of a film.
