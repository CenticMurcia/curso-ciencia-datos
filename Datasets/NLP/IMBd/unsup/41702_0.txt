*A few spoilers, perhaps.* The first two stories were all right. Especially, for being stories within stories (Lovecraft's trademark). Richard Lynch was brilliant, as the sea captain who goes temporarily insane with grief. And, David Warner was absolutely convincing as the true-love-starved immortal, ultimately betrayed by his over-possessive housekeeper. The third one, though? YECHH! The only thing truly Lovecraftian about it was the small touch of Negrophobia in it. *Sad but true; HPL was a closet racist. Just read "Call of Cthulu!"* I guess the nicest touch was the subtle homage to a similar anthology: the British b/w classic "Dead of Night." The wrap-around segment, and its conclusion, strongly reminded me of the former! I guess, in all fairness, that my final score for this movie boils down to: 2.7 stars.
