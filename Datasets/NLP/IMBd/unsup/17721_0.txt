I too enjoyed this entry into the world of neophyte doctor, Dr. Kildare.<br /><br />It's nice to see his parents once again, as in several of the earlier films, playing such important roles in his life. Both his parents are fine, but his mother is simply adorable.<br /><br />I was also surprised at Dr. Marsh's depiction. A "colored" man (the terminology of the time) who happens to be an amazing doctor and one who speaks standard English. I would imagine this scene was often cut in the South since it doesn't directly impact the main plot, but it was fascinating to see.<br /><br />A nice addition to the Dr. Kildare series.
