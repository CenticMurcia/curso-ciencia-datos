One or 2 good performances, but other than that this is total waste of time. Poorly directed with a totally predictable 'twist' ending that is thoroughly unsatisfying. In fact the only reason I am offering a review for this little mess is because of all the 'good' reviews. How people can be so taken in by this crap these days is beyond me. About the only thing interesting in this flick is when one of the young boys moons one of the others. The fact that none of the 'older' men looks a thing like his young counterpart doesn't help the confusion. It took me till almost the end of the movie to figure out which kid went with which adult, but then I cared so little about any of the characters that I didn't really bother to try. Oh, there is at least one other good thing about this. The fact that the murderer turns out to be a Catholic priest. At least that much is true. Now if they had only made him an alcoholic child molester as well, they would have gotten the character right.
