When I first saw this marvelous film in 1999 in Russia, I could not believe my own eyes - in fact, I had never seen a single Icelandic film before that, this was the first and what a great sensation! This is a highly elegant, smoothly done and excellent work. The idea is pretty simple, Gest, the main hero, comes to take revenge for his slain parents. The whole story takes place in 900's, so Iceland is still a heathen country, god Thor is frequently mentioned and his one-eyed figure is also often addressed to by several characters. What really marvels there is the superb combination of the actors' play, impeccable nature, and the spellbinding soundtrack. This terrible, never ending, incessant rain that falls throughout the film is just another character - it adds to the gloomy picture and the dark feeling of the main hero. His revenge is slow, but irreversible, he does what he thinks he has to. And he succeeds. The whole film leaves a great, lasting and powerful impression. Watch it, it is a must!
