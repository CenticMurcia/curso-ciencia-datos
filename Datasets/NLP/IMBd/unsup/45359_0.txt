Mirko Crocop is one hell of a fighter when it comes to K-1, Pride FC and now UFC. His famous "left high kick" has put many opponents to sleep. Now it wasn't an opponent he put to sleep, but it was me. This movie had some acting without some real emotions in it, it was like Crocop turned into a Robocop...altogether with the entire cast. Although Crocop is a credible fighter,(The man would kill all those so-called action heroes in real combat!) in this movie he never convinces. The fighting-scenes were just too easy. Still I hope he will get another shot starring in an action-movie. But please let a real martial-arts movie-director do the choreography to spice it up. I rate this movie 3 out of 10, just because there is little hope of Crocop being a real action hero.
