Being a B movie fan is not easy. There are varying grades of B movies. There are your B+ movies, that try real hard but end up falling short for various and sundry reasons. On the other end, however, there are those movies that not even worthy of B- status; movies that should exist for all eternity in the eternal Abyss prophesied in Revelation. The Corpse Grinders is one of these movies.<br /><br />This little dreg tells the story of the Lotus Cat Food company and their new ingredient for their expensive cat food (Think Donner party). The harvesting of this ingredient comes courtesy of an Aussie-like redneck and his less-than-stable wife (who likes to feed soup to her doll). Landau, the owner of the plant, employs everyone from an old man to a deaf/mute woman with a peg leg. You want motivation to be a good employee? Make sure you don't end up in the back room where the food is made!<br /><br />The doctor and his nurse who are the heroes aren't going to be confused with Fred, Thelma, Daphne, Shaggy & Scooby-Doo any day soon. (As an aside, the nurse changes clothes 3 times in going from the office to the cat food plant and then back to the office.) Plus, her doctor boyfriend drives my grandma's puke green Ford Maverick.<br /><br />To be sure, the scene of the woman stripping down to her bra & panties to pound a Budweiser is a hilarious one. And that one babe just *happened* to have been buried in her underwear? Plus, was it just me, or were all the feline killers Siamese?<br /><br />While watching this movie, my wife said, "Well, they must have thought this was going to be a good movie when they read the script." It is impossible to have a good movie from a premise that sucks out loud like this.<br /><br />Sterno says eat catnip instead.<br /><br />
