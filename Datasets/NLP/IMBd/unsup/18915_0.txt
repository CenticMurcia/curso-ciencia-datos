Based on it's budget, and having been a crew member and extra in the film, I'm giving "BMS" (the director) and "LYA" (the film) 9/10. It has a wholesome message, a name actor, beautiful actresses, and was shot with a limited budget. The special FX and uses of green screen show maturity from BMS's last film, Miss Castaway and the Island Girls. I had an enjoyable time working on the set with the crew and producers, and watched them solve last minute problems and deal with financier/producer tensions in order to get this finished. For your info, I started out as an extra, and was asked to work on the film as crew. I still have my autographed copy of the script! Actors Tim Peyton, Adri Curry, and Meadow Williams also did a good job and were pleasant to work with on set. This should be going to TV soon, if the right distributor picks it up.
