A true comedy if i've ever seen one is this picture. IT vill warm your hearth with warmth and joy. After seeing it 10 times it never gets bored, which is amazing to say the least.<br /><br />Jack lemmon the bitter old sour lemmon that he is, was offcourse perfectly cast as the nazi-loving teacher. <br /><br />The rest of the cast could easily been awarded with an award of some sorts. Maybe a golden trash can or something.<br /><br />In case you were wondering : watching this crap will make your eyes bleed. <br /><br />Have a nice day
