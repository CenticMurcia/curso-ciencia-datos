"The Fury" came out after Brian DePalma's classic, "Carrie." And like the previous film, it's about a girl with a mental ability, but she's far from alone.<br /><br />As the film opens, we find out that Peter Sandza (Kirk Douglas)has been double crossed by his best friend (And fellow government agent) Childress (John Cassavetes). It seems that Childress wants Peter's son Robin (Andrew Stevens), who has an amazing psychic ability. Childress wants Robin so bad that he stages a shootout while they're in Israel and attempts to kill Peter (His son thinks he's dead).<br /><br />Peter turns up in Chicago sometime later, searching for his son and staying a step ahead from the government agents that want him out of the way. He finds out that Gillian Bellaver (Amy Irving)may be able to help him find him. Gillian is freaked out about her ability: whenever she touches someone, it causes them to bleed. Seeking help from The Paragon Institute, she soon finds out 2 things: Robin was there before her and that she has a connection to him. What she doesn't know is that Childress has become interested in her abilities, and wants to replace Robin with her.<br /><br />Robin, meanwhile, has become increasingly unstable (Despite incredibly high dosages of medications that would kill a normal person, they have no effect on him at all)and increasingly dangerous (He's developed an ability to manipulate machines and doing the same to himself). He is so much of a threat that he causes a section of a ferris wheel to crash into a building because the guys were Middle Eastern (A trigger for what happened in Israel to his father).<br /><br />There are some plot holes that have nagged me (You would figure after the incident at the carnival that they would have had a clue to how increasingly dangerous he's become). The film gets bloody, but the ending in which Gillian causes the bad guy to explode (using her powers)is still effective (Keep in mind that this was 3 years BEFORE the exploding head scene in "Scanners"). Some of the content may be a bit "politically incorrect" in this post 9/11 society: Robin's actions at the carnival were triggered by what happened in Israel, even though these guys had nothing to do with what happened. So basically, Robin had committed a "hate crime," killing them because they were Middle Eastern men. <br /><br />Keep your eye out for Daryl Hannah, Laura Innes, James Belushi and Dennis Franz in small parts. And John Williams fans will like the score to the film.
