this is a very cleverly written movie by Neil Simon.it's directed by Arthur Hiller.it's a 'everything that can go wrong does' comedy.and it is funny.it's not dirty or filled with foul language,like many of our modern film use for laughs,or try to anyway.it stars jack Lemmon as a strait laced,high strung worry wart salesman,and Sandy Dennis as his down to earth calming influence wife.George Kellertman(Lemmon)and his wife(Gwen) are on a trip from small town life to the big city,(New York)where George has a very important interview that could put his career on the fast track.it should be aroutine trip.the only problem will be getting there.Neil Simon really has a gift for words.the dialogue i this is witty,intelligent and sharp.the words just seem to flow smoothly,whether it's subtle conversation or rapid fire interplay between George nd Gwen,or themselves and others.But Lemmon and Dennis deserve a lot of credit.they work perfectly off each other.bringing realism to the characters and sympathy.whoever cast these 2 together hopefully got a huge bonus for doing so.there are also some funny cameo appearances by some stars of the day.this is one terrific little movie.it's charming and warm and has heart.it may be low key,but it works.i vaguely remember watching the remake with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and being less than impressed.for me,the original"The Out of Towners" is a definite 8/10
