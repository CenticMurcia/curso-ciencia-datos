I never caught "Undeclared" in its short run on Fox, but recently purchased the DVD set based on the strength of "Freaks and Geeks", Judd Apatow's too-smart-for-TV TV series from 1999-2000. "Undeclared" (like "Freaks and Geeks") is cleverly written, funny, and full of characters you'll begin to care about almost immediately. <br /><br />Many of the series' funnier moments come from Ron (Seth Rogen), whose wit is a defense for his basic insecurity. If you thought he was funny as Cal in "The 40 Year Old Virgin", you'll love him here, too.<br /><br />There are some great cameo performances from Will Ferrell as a speed-addicted research paper writer, Fred Willard as a bored history professor, and Ted Nugent and Adam Sandler as themselves. The DVD has a lot of really funny unaired footage, including an entire episode that never made it to TV.<br /><br />My reaction to "Undeclared" was the same as when "Freaks and Geeks" went off the air - sad that I wouldn't see these characters anymore, but really glad that I'd seen the few episodes made.
