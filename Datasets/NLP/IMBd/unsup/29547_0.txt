I remember seeing Duke and Sammie in person hawking this film in front of the theater on Broadway in Manhattan in the summer of 1952. I was on vacation so I decided to see this film and the blatant ripoff of Dean and Jerry. It was hilariously bad. However today I find this film to be a collectors item. It is worth seeing just to see how they copied Martin & Lewis and because of the wonderful Bela Legosi. The film is a curiosity and rates with the likes of Plan 9 from Outer Space. I bought the DVD and watched it again. It was so bad that I really enjoyed it and laughed my head off. The DVD is available for cheap and is worth buying as a collectors item.
