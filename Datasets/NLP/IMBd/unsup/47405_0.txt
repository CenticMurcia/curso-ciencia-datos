Here we have a really funny film that has hit cult status among a bunch of us. This is a really badly made and shot on video "action" (quote unquote) film. This is acted like a porno without the porn. Thanks to Brentwood dvd this has become available in a dvd budget boxed set. In a nutshell. Sandy opens an aerobic studio called Highkicks. A politcally correct looking street gang (every race is accounted for), harass, and then rape Sandy. Sandy hires a new guy (Sam) to help out at her place and after the attack finds out he knows martial arts (umm i guess you can call it that). You should be able to pick up the rest of the film, he teaches her and then they go after the gang. Again this film is hilarious. The really crazy clothes, definitely the 80's hair styles (even though this was done in the 90's), and acting are at the bottom of the barrel and highly worth viewing. Some funny lines are when Sam mentions to Sandy he has to go to his brothers wedding in San Francisco and that it will take him a week to get there, keep in mind he is in San Diego. Another funny one is When Sam mentions he pulled into a port (he drives a boat) and was raped by the natives. it just doesn't get any better then this. If you want a really funny fun time, rent this with a bunch of people and just mock the entire film.
