'The Situation' is not only an Iraqi but a Middle-Eastern expression. In Israel as well when we want to describe the political complications or the effects of terror and war that always seem close if they are not present we talk about 'the situation'.<br /><br />'The Situation' is one of the first movies about the Iraq war and is not a bad one, but not a good one either. It combines the story of a reporter trying to find her way and tell the truth about Iraq with thriller elements and with a romantic story. The best parts are in rendering the hopeless situation the Iraqis live in, the permanent fear, violence and corruption that dominates their lives. The worst is however the one-sided view of the situation. While the focus is on the Iraqis and the usage of Arabic and the good acting makes this side of the story credible, it is the American who look almost all uni-dimensional, incompetent at best and unreasonably violent at worst, without any apparent motivation.<br /><br />I am sure more films about this tragic war will follow. Better films also.
