A group of teenagers attending a carnival are stalked by a mysterious, hidden in the shadows psycho who proceeds to stalk and kill them after they leave the carnival and party at an old run down farm house.<br /><br />The identity of the killer is very easy to figure out in this not very surprising slasher film that features an over the top finale that will produce unintentional chuckles instead of having you shiver in your seat. So poorly made it went unreleased for quite some time. Not to mention a rotten script and ending. I laughed in the last 5 minutes of this movie. So, Please. I hope this never comes out on DVD or VHS. Horrible.<br /><br />Rated R for Nudity, Profanity and Graphic Violence.
