Sasquatch spent most of the 90s toiling away in such horrendously lame'n'tame children's movie bilge as "Little Bigfoot," "Bigfoot: The Unforgettable Encounter," and "Big and Hairy," which makes this regional redneck horror/action hybrid a definite anomaly, but still nothing to get all excited about. In the misty backwoods of the Okaloosa Wilderness in Annistan, Alabama, a local Bigfoot creature murders the son of all-powerful rich jerk Milton St. John (an embarrassingly poor turn by bona-fide exploitation legend David F. Friedman). St. John bankrolls an expedition led by insipid nice guy Dr. David Stone (semi-sentient walking spam chunk Rick Montana in a stupendously lousy non-performance) to find the foul fiend. Unbeknownst to Stone, the other members of the team are a stereotypically gung-ho, trigger-happy bunch of hillbilly yahoos specifically hired by St. John to bag the beast. R.G. Arledge's lax, ham-fisted direction strikes out in every conceivable department, thereby sinking this leaden bomb to an unforgivably schlocky sub-level of rank amateurishness: the sluggish pacing, putrid acting, wafer-thin cardboard characters, ill-judged stabs at lowbrow humor, the huge letdown creature (it's some heavy-stepping zhlub in a rubber ghoul mask and black gorilla costume), weak off-screen killings, and dissatisfying sudden'n'senseless ending all leave a great deal to be desired. Those looking for a fun, worthwhile Bigfoot flick are strongly advised to search elsewhere.
