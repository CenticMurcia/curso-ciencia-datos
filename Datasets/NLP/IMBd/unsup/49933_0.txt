It's not too often that I really want to see a particular movie. But this was one of those exceptions. The trailers were pretty funny, and I figured if they were just a small segment of what the rest of the movie is like... it should be hilarious. Well, I think they used the funniest parts of the movie to put in those trailers. It seems like the movie is focused just as much on action and plot as it is humor (which I didn't really expect since the trailer portrayed it as mostly comedy). The only problem with that is the movie is so complicated and twisted that I lost interest in its story early on. The movie could have been redeemed if it had great action sequences. But it doesn't. The movie could have been redeemed if it were fall-on-the-floor funny. But it isn't.<br /><br />The story is the number one problem. There are too many twists and turns. In some movies that can add some suspense and mystery. But in this movie, it just fails. And I think it's because the movie tries to be too much. It tries too hard to be a great action film, a comedy, and a twisted mystery-esque flick (I'm not sure what you could call it). Had it placed all its energy in one or even two of those... I think it could have been much better.<br /><br />And to top it off... I don't think there is much comedic chemistry between Jones and Griffin. The trailers look promising in that area too, but again, the movie falls short.
