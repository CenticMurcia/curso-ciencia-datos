I am digging deep on finding a god-awful movie such as this one. Dave Eddy, congratulations man! You've made the worst movie ever. I bought this film without knowing what I was about to get myself into. It was on sale for 50 cents at Amazon.com with the shipping price of $2.98. The remarks column said "Discontinued by Manufacturer."<br /><br />I never got a kick out of watching a fight scene, (more like a "Let's Play Patty Cake" scene), where the white dragon and that retarded Kobra Khan are fighting with balloons. BALLOONS MAN! BALLOONS! Too many Looney Toons Gimmicks dumb this fight scene down to the point that even the mentally handicapped would start crying.<br /><br />So this is where the creators of the Napoleon Dynamite got their kick-ass 8 bit Nintendo soundtrack. The background music is so sloppy and poorly edited. It seemed way too retro to be late 90's flick and it looked like it was the 80's with those super cool mullets. <br /><br />I have never seen so much hardcore choreography as this. These supposed kids were supposed to be black belts when they look like they should be wearing yellow belts. So many roundhouse kicks to the face and so many reused sound effects. Flailing their arms and spinning back kicks in play fighting, it looked like they used the 4 inch rule so they don't hurt each other. Pure FAMILY "FUN"!<br /><br />The training montages were lazy at best with more Looney Toons gimmicks just make want to say F___ you to this movie!<br /><br />They've roundhouse kicked my ass with their super cool virtual reality gear. They sedated me with with their virtual fight scenes to the point of being lulled to sleep. Was that it? Everything was resolved by the Pocket weasels beating the evil Cubby Khan in a virtual reality fight? This movie is one giant "Butt-Whiff!" that I had the balls to watch from start to finish.<br /><br />If Hell had a BlockBuster or a Netflix, Pocket Ninjas would be the only choice movie!<br /><br />All I got to say is WOW. Dave Eddy, man you took one for the team!
