Kingpin is an excellent series, it is one of the best ones that I have seen in a long time. This is reality, this is what is happening in the drug world. The actors bring reality to their characters, every single actor plays his/her part very well. I was hoping it would become a regular on TV. Why is it that when there is a great series on TV, possibly a big movie screen version, someone decides to end it. I am 100% positive that a lot of viewers are going to be disappointed when this series ends on Tuesday.
