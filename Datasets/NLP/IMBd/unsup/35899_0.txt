This is one of the sillier alien films you'll see. There's obvious attempts to use symbolism in the way that worked for 2001, but they fall flat.<br /><br />The alien monolith? Hmmmm, I'm sure that's a coincidence ;)<br /><br />Badly acted and with a silly script, this is a B grader if ever I saw one. One for the late night TV film section I think.
