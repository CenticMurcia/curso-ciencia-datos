I watched out for this film to come to my local cinema and was unable to see it when it arrived so was even more excited about watching it on the DVD... but it failed on many levels to excite me, the characters failed to excite, there were far to many sub plots and the stuttering just got on my nerves! it took me 3 attempts to finally finish this movie and i was not excited at all, the film certainly deserve to eat pizza, nothing more than that.... I don't believe this film has any chance of winning any Oscars, and it def was not a highlight of the year for me, id advise anyone watching this movie, to be prepared for dragged out scenes, and at some points in the movie, unwatchable acting. Enjoy.... I scored the Movie 4/10, its only savour was some good directing scenes.
