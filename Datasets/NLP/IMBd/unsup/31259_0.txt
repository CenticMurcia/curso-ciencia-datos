Although I wasn't originally interested to see "?", I was convinced by my friends and the reviews hailing it as a comedic magnum opus that I should watch this film or films (I heard there are actually 2 versions of the film?), which supposedly challenges political correctness and taboo sensitivities, while exposing the dark underbelly of our society.<br /><br />Anyway, this film does do that for sure, and is a perfect blend of scripted story with the main characters (West & Art) unscripted encounters with innocent subjects, ala Borat, which are in many ways the funniest parts of this offensive movie. It is a great inner journey film, imagine "Rain Man" meets "Borat", "Jackass", "Life Aquatic" and something from Tarantino or Lynch, if one can envision that??? A fan of any of these may definitely be pleased, but unsuspecting viewers may watch this movie with their jaws wide open!
