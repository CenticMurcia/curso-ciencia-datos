Flirtacious Lily (the stunningly gorgeous Stefanie Von Pfetten) and aggressive Constance (the equally foxy Kim Poirier) aren't your standard run-of-the-mill tasty hot blonde college babes. They are actually dangerously alluring and enticing extraterrestrials who have come to Earth to mate with human males. Unfortunately, these delectable intergalactic honeys cause men to freeze from the inside out while having sex with them. Plus they sprout icky tentacles when aroused and don't have navels. It's up to aimless slacker freshman Luke (winningly played by Corey Sevier) to stop them before they turn every last libidinous party hearty dude on campus into giant frosty popsicles.<br /><br />Director/co-screenwriter Matthew Hastings has an absolute infectiously inane ball with the enjoyably ridiculous premise, skillfully blending raucous humor and off-center horror into a highly amusing and entertaining synthesis. Moreover, Hastings keeps the pace speeding along at a brisk tempo, elicits spirited acting from a fresh, attractive and appealing young cast, and stages the shock scenes with rousing go-for-it aplomb. Daniel Villeneuve's crisp, fluid cinematography, the catchy, thrashin' rock soundtrack, the nifty special effects, a smidgen of nudity, genuinely likable characters, the shivery'n'spooky score by Daryl Bennet and Jim Guttridge, the stirring conclusion, and a dandy surprise twist ending are all up to par. Elias Toufexis is an amiably goofy hoot as the sweet virginal Roger, Meghan Ory registers strongly as Luke's scrappy'n'spunky best gal pal Alex, former "Baywatch" TV show regular Nicole Eggert pops up as a feisty lady cop, and Richard Burgi jerks it up delightfully as a gruff homicide detective. Good, solid tongue-in-cheek Grade B sci-fi/horror fun.
