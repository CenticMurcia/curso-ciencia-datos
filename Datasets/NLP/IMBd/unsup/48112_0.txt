I was hoping the second movie of Death Note would be better than the first one. Unfortunately, this one gives not many difference than the previous movie. It's such a shame that a series as good as Death Note was made into such a bland movie.<br /><br />What this movie lacks are good director, good cinematography, and good casting. Kenichi Matsuyama is the only brilliant thing in Death Note: the Last name. As an avid fans of Death Note manga, I think this move could be made better.<br /><br />My suggestion is: if you're a hardcore Death Note fans and curious to see this live-action movie, it's okay to watch this. If you're not, you better stay out of this movie, it won't entertain you much.
