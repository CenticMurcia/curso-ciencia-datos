It is perfectly cast, very nicely photographed, very well acted and the direction is spot on. That said, it is to me better than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />If you didn't see that on the first viewing, try seeing it again. I thought it was decent fare on the first viewing until I caught the last 50 minutes or so a second time around on cable late one night. I was quite surprised at how completely I had misjudged it. I realized it was much better than it first seemed because, like a performance by a great dancer or skilled actors, it looks too easy to be really excellent, too natural.<br /><br />But I was wrong and seeing it all the way through one more time proved it to me. Try it again and see.<br /><br />Phil<br /><br />
