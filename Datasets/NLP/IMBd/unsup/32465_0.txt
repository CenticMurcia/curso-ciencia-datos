A couple weeks ago, I decided to go into Blockbuster video in search for a cheap movie to watch. I came along this movie and at first the cover was pretty cool and it had Gary Busey in it. What can go wrong. I was expecting Gary Busey to appear in the film for longer than one minute but that didn't happen. This is the worst movie I've ever seen and every copy should be burned. If I could give a zero for this movie I would but the lowest you can go is 1. Lifeforce is better than this piece of crap and Lifeforce is pretty bad too. Avoid it at all costs.
