I was working a film festival this past weekend and got to see this movie where it was playing at and I so loved it. Me and my friend loved it very much. We hope for it to get into theaters and on DVD. Jensen and everyone are great in it. Its funny and very real. LOVED IT!!!! I loved how every time we saw his character his shirt said something funny. There where also a lot of things in that movie I could relate too as well along with making me laugh. Sometimes with a movie its hard to be real serious and mix it with comedy with out ruining it, it was done very well. I thought each character in this movie was casted very well. Me and my friend loved it so much we watched it twice at the festival. I seriously hope this makes it to the theaters and especially...especially on DVD. If it goes on DVD me and my friend will be buying the day it comes out. If anyone reading this is going to a film festival and see this on the list, it is very much a MUST SEE!!!!!! Everyone is great in it and Jensen is so funny in it. If your a big Supernatural fan, you will love Jensen in it, it shows his comedy side as well:)
