Filmed for television as a cautionary tale about the impending global warming disaster, "The Fire Next Time" is a disaster unto itself. If anything, this two-part 1993 groaner is testament to how consistently unoriginal and glaringly inaccurate the environmentalist party line has remained over the past 15+ years.<br /><br />In "The Fire Next Time," the writers do their best to throw everything they have against the wall, hoping that something will stick. The movie employs disaster flick favorites ranging from drought and famine to social discord and disease in painting a picture of overall chaos in the America of 2017. As we've learned from Nostradamus, broad ambiguity is the key to a good false prophecy.<br /><br />Lest the aforementioned examples prove overly sensationalistic, a can't-miss disaster is brought in for support: the hurricane. There is no safer bet than hurricanes in the southeastern U.S., and if this American standard can now be ascribed to global warming, all the better.<br /><br />If only global warming could be linked to earthquakes and the impending "big one" in Los Angeles. Now that would be an "I told you so!" The left-wing fantasy is completed at the end of the film, when Americans are found scrambling for entry into Canada. In reality, 1993 was the year of the big push for universal healthcare in America, with the "Canadian model" being cited as the last, best hope for Americans. Canada was hip, Canada was the "in" thing, and it was only natural that Canada be given further hype as the salvation for climate-oppressed Americans 25 years into the future.<br /><br />Today, we find the global warming community in much the same situation as Health Canada: large, powerful, and staving off collapse as it becomes more and more apparent that their assumptions have constructed a false reality upon an untenable foundation.<br /><br />With just 15 years of hindsight, it is now stunningly clear that "The Fire Next Time" has gone up in smoke.
