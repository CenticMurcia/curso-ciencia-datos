Watching this film reminded me of an afternoon sitcom, the actor's did without a doubt, it just has "done on the cheap" written all over it.<br /><br />it claims to be about the person that the movies "Exorcist" is about, but I found nothing of the such to back up that claim at all, so thats the production company blagging away there.<br /><br />It's a shame really, as I'm a fan of the genre, but this has "Made for Teens" all over it.<br /><br />Shame really because it could have been good, especially when you remember that the original Exorcist wasn't released here in the UK for fourteen years!
