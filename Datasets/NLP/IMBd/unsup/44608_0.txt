Sometimes a movie is so bad it's enjoyable, and you can watch it again and again (like a lot of people feel about "Showgirls"). Other times, just once is enough to make you feel as if you've been beaten to a bloody pulp. "A*P*E" is more of the latter than the former. The curious will be lured in by the prospect of this movie, and they will suffer for it.<br /><br />This is a ripoff of the King Kong story, specifically an attempt to cash in on the 1976 remake. It's a giant ape run amok, this time in Korea. Some people might get a kick out of it, considering it's so poorly realized on every imaginable level. Rubber monster suits, unconvincing miniature sets, awful acting chops, ridiculous situations. Even as a spoof, which it seems to have been intended as, "A*P*E" fails on one important level: entertaining the viewer. Even in terms of bad movies, it is about as enjoyable as the teeth of a vicious dog sinking into your leg.
