OKay first off I had nothing to do with this movie nor did I personally know any of the actors or any of the cast or crew members for that matter.<br /><br />I have seen the worst of the worst zombie movies and movies in general. This is a very low budget movie with that in mind this movie was done very well.. Almost too well. My friends and I still quote lines from it and we still get together and watch it when we have our zombie movie get togethers. The acting was OK, the plot was OK and the effects were a little on the cheap side but for a low budget movie and entertainment it really does get much better than this movie.. Keep in mind that it is a low budget cheap cheezy zombie movie. but its funny and fun to watch.. I liked it and will defend it to anyone...<br /><br />If you wanna she some crap movies check out anything by asylum. Especially that Night of the Dead Leben Tod that is the worst movie ever made.. Chuck and Chance are Spielbergs compared to that crap.
