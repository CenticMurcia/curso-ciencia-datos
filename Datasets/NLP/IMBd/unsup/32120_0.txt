This was the first movie that I had watched from this genre, so I'm not knowledgeable enough to give a full, professional review as I am not a movie critic, producer, or director. I am a just a movie goer interested in enjoyable, quality films. Although the genre appears to be an interesting one, I was not impressed with the movie itself. There may be other more enjoyable movies out there in the same genre. Or for that matter, this movie could be one of the best in this genre, which may be an indication why these types of movies are not mentioned or talk about in the mainstream media.<br /><br />I can express with great certainty that the editing could have been better as often there are instances when the screen goes dark for several seconds in between scenes, leaving the audience wondering what's next. However, it isn't a bad idea to experience something different, and this movie is definitely different from what we hear or see in the mainstream media.
