"The Eighteenth Angel" is a passable horror film-I really wanted to like it.Of course it's horror,and being a fan,I want to like most horror films.Anyway "The Eighteenth Angel" is a well-made,albeit a bit predictable,horror movie that will keep you entertained from the beginning to the end.The acting is pretty good(Rachael Leigh Cook is definitely very talented and beautiful actress),and there are some gruesome scenes.Director William Bindley does know how to compose effective scenes,but "The Eighteenth Angel" becomes boring at times.Still I'd recommend this one to serious horror fans.7 out of 10.
