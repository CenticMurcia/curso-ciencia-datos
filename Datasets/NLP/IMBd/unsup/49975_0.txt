could have been great. interesting enough idea. amazing antagonist. some really great camera work/mood.<br /><br />however...it feels like a lock groove. similar scenes playing out time and time again similar camera tricks again and again it tried to be smart just as high tension did (both failed miserably) and is basically a slasher flick again could have been amazing, however...ended up being slow and a bit boring however the moments that deliver really deliver.<br /><br />unfortunately it just doesn't make it at the end of the day.... but it tried...and i want to see more of the 'killer' shame... proceed with caution, but know what you're getting into. it's soaked in mood so...that can be enjoyed at least.
