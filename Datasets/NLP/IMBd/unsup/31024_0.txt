I have enjoyed the Scary Movie parodies to varying extents, finding in each installment at least a few laugh out loud moments. Date Movie provided two maybe three light chuckles. That was it.<br /><br />The best they could come up with for a clever tag line in the poster art was "From 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie." Uh okay. Well, why'd you keep these two? It was honestly like they didn't even try. I could write a better parody than this and, since I'm not a good enough writer to be hired by a studio, I just have to assume that the writers are capable of better.<br /><br />There was nothing original. They were drawing such a creative blank that they spent a good five minutes having the camera watch a hand-puppet cat squirm around on a toilet seat. They interspersed fart sounds and quick shots of facial expressions from the stars. Oh yeah, that made it better.<br /><br />A good parody will take the existing content it is lampooning, and present it in a humorous way by providing ironic twists. Here they simply made sets, costumes and situations similar enough for you to recognize the source material and then either laid vulgarities or toilet humor on top of it. There's no thought in that. Just pitiful.<br /><br />Comedy of this nature almost always demands a straight man. In silly parodies, the straight man is often the least absurd of the various characters. In the Scary Movie series, star Anna Faris carried this role well. She's not up to a Leslie Nielsen standard yet, but she's getting better with each installment. Her delivery, her deadpan, her timing are all very nice. In Date Movie, Alyson Hannigan cannot do this at all. She used a total of two facial expressions to convey her character's reaction to each situation. It just became annoying.<br /><br />I think Hannigan has proved herself to be a charming actress, not without talent. So I'll assume that the problem here was the two writers. Hopefully they'll now go join the other four.
