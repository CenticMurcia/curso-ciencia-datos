It is not often that you find a grand movie with all the super stars plain unwatchable but K3G is one such movie. The reason is plain and simple: almost everything about this movie is fake. <br /><br />The movie talks about loving your parents but throughout it is impossible not to feel that all emotions have been manufactured. There is a complete lack of realism and people seem to cry at every available opportunity.<br /><br />The scene where all children at school (including British) sing the Indian national anthem is one of the worst scenes in a very long time. It was so cheap and you feel like asking what is going on?<br /><br />The movie is just all gloss. There is no substance or soul.
