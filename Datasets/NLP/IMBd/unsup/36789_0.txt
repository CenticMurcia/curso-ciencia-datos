This is one of those movies that pretend to be layered and have deeper significance than all that appears.But knowing the other works of this director and how he only treads in lukewarm, shallow waters... it is nothing different from his other works.<br /><br />His films have received a lot of good reception- only because they show new localities (Iran), in harmless, "safe" topics with not much substance or depth, and in dull, drab drawn out scenes. Perhaps it appeals to those who are bored to death of watching the regular commercial Hollywood films, those who can't stomach really strong films and those who wish to create non-existent depths in a very one dimensional film. Some comments mention cinematic genius in scenes, some looking for metaphysical meanings in the sound of a helicopter or the scenery--I guess you could look at it that way- or anything in that way. But please, there are no comparisons between cinematic greats like Tarkowsky, Bergman and others.<br /><br />Kiarostami was and is one who takes the safe path always... never provokes, never motivates and all "debates" sparking from his films are merely because few can believe that there is nothing more to it than what they see and hear. A weak director with no signs of improvement, in my opinion.<br /><br />And a film best described as a placebo... you think you get an effect, and perhaps that's good enough for the critics and the fans of this film. Wants to start a topic, gets up and falls flat on the face. My comments go against the ocean of praise here- but watch the film again, think over it- is there really substance there? and compare with other Iranian films. Much better fare in Iranian cinema is out there.
