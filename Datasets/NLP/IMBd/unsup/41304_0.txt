The upside to being a bad actor, in America, is that that the movie industry is structured as a business. And like any business there is a product they want to sell to you. In order to sell the product they need advertising, and this is where the star-system steps in. In order to sell a movie to the American target audience you need a "typical American looking" leading actor, which will be quoted like a commodity(this quote will determine the further use of him to endorse another product). And this explains why a not so good looking, next door looking guy like Tom Cruise, who can't act, gets the lead in movies. He is backed up in his performance by other, talented, not next-door material actors, but with strong personality(in this case Bronson Pinchot, Curtis Armstrong and Joe Pantoliano). The American movie business calls them "comic relief" characters, but in fact that means they are not destined to make it big in the business. Well, the only comic thing I find about all that is that luck (because the way you look is destiny) can put a bad actor on top of the pyramid. Only in America.
