This movie is special, not just for its quality, but for what it is not. It is not filled with 20-something actors pretending to be teenagers. It is not filled with the latest pop culture references. It does not threaten to break out with an MTV montage designed to push music product. Instead, it is a well-crafted, gentle movie with an overweight hero, kids who look like kids, and the kind of dialogue that might have been taken from real life. The plot itself is a fantasy. Who hasn't been the high school underdog and dreamed of having your moment? Then again, it is a lovable fantasy because it contains so many of our hopes and dreams. Hollywood used to do this kind of movie regularly, before each one had to become a roller-coaster ride for the $100 million payoff. Watching Angus is like going back to a gentler time, when a finely acted moment counted as much as a special effect. Watch this movie, recommend it to your friends, and watch it again.
