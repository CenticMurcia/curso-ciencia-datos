Errol Flynn may not have been one of the best actors of his time, but I think arguably he was the best action star/swashbuckler of his time and remains one of the best to this day. When Errol Flynn had a sward in his hand and the wit it took to play these roles with a straight face he was in his element. After getting to know his personality through his writings and of the observations of those that knew him best you get the feeling that Flynn was not really acting in this film, but simply portraying himself. As with all his best roles i.e. Robin hood, Captain Blood, The Sea Wolf etc. he remains the only actor to capture the flair and fun of a Swashbuckler. When Flynn played a dramatic part he seemed forced and uncomfortable. In his writings he states he always wants to play dramatic roles, but the Studios would not offer him the parts. I can understand the reservations of the studios because he simply did not make a great dramatic actor, but he did make a great action film.
