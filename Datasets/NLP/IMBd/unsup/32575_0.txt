On the surface, this is a lighthearted comedy. A Prod and a Catholic become best of mates, launch a franchise, some antics ensue, and in the end we can all laugh happily ever after. But look again and see what no one will mention...<br /><br />By the 1980's, the Provos were being funded by Libya(!) and the Loyalists by South Africa to prop up a civil war. This is not, and never was about the ideal of loyal Ulster, or the ideal of Nationalism...ordinary working class folks were the tools in this conflict, and to this day the perpetrators on both sides remain unsanctioned. 3500 dead, thousands maimed or imprisoned...no 'rug' will ever cover that up. <br /><br />Connolly, the Scot, sees through all this absurdity...apropos, he plays it like Brando in "Apocalypse Now" (swallowing the bug).
