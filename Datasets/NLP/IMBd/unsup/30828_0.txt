" Cafe Americain" is definitely one of the best sitcoms I have ever watched. Hilarious and witty ; sometimes using culture difference as "spice". Too bad it only lasted one season ; I can't understand why while other sitcoms which were in lesser caliber can survive longer. Probably it turned out that this type of comedy was not for everybody's liking (and it affected its rating)?<br /><br />Anyhows, Fabiana and his boyfriend scenes are so memorable for me. It never failed to amuse me watching his over-jealous boyfriend screaming "I"ll kill you, I'll kill you two times!" Valerie Bertinelli was awesome. This serial is really fun to watch. It is indeed an underrated comedy show, IMHO. For those who haven't watched ; this sitcom is highly recommended.
