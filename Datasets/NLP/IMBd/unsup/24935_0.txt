i saw this film at a private screening in London, and was quite overwhelmed at how well the film played out, with a very low or non existent budget, it just goes to show that a low budget. can make the creative mind work in a much more resourceful and not indulgent fashion, which can make the hole thing play even more real and without the flood of commercial propaganda this film is a true jewel in the crown of low budget British films.<br /><br />the film takes a good look at the length that some ego's will go to stay at the top of there game funny thought provoking and worth two hours of any ones life. hats of to the director, cast, crew and producers.
