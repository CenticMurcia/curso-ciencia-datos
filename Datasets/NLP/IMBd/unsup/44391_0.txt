This movie was terrible i looked forward to seeing it , a few beers at the ready for film night at home and even ready and willing to put up with subtitles . What a disappointment , I'm not a genius but i know a good movie when i see it and I'm afraid this was poor . What the hell happened i still don't know the bald heads were to many to tell who was who...i want my money back I've been cheated. The main character seemed to have some special power which involved looking inside people . and then going on to raise the dead , OK but then what happened to the rest of the crew this film did not make any kind of sense , and the end well who knows
