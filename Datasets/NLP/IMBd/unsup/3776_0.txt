This is a class exercise in making the ordinary and everyday seem extraordinary. The build up to the girl's disappearance is muted to say the least. The low-key nature of her not returning and the range of emotions from impatience to agitation to panic and then despair is performed with a realistic touch.<br /><br />The middle section of the film is the who-dunnit part where the boyfriend attempts to amass information. The director cleverly avoids flashbacks to the girl so that your memory of her appearance begins to fade. There are a number of such clever devices employed throughout the film.<br /><br />The French schoolteacher is superbly evil in his own secretive way, whilst all the while maintaining his respectable front to the local community. The ending is chilling and all too believable. I heard they remade it, but why bother to gild the lily Â– it was already a good movie. <br /><br />
