If you must watch this movie, do so with the sound off - and perhaps an assortment of music for background noise instead. The elephants are both supposed to be boys, yet the younger brother, TuTu, is obviously performed by a woman trying to sound like a child. The effect is exceptionally annoying. As if this were not bad enough, the dialogue is insufferable. The lines are both poorly written AND poorly delivered. The story is narrated by two cheetahs who at least attempt to sound African, but all other roles are done in various accents - none of them consistent or ethnic. The overall result is campy at best. If my two year old hadn't been interested, I would have turned it off. As it was, my ten year old, eleven year old, my spouse and myself had to leave the room before the movie was part over. Toddlers and preschoolers may enjoy it. Perhaps even kindergartners. Any one over age five should either steer clear, or listen to their ipod in lieu of the movie sound.
