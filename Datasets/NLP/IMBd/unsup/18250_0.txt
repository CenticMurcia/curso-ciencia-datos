This film certainly caused quite a stir when it was released in 1978. Today, "stir wise", it would result in a large yawn. This is the story of a young girl growing up in a brothel in Storyville, New Orleans when the brothels were very popular and just before they were all shut down. The stir was caused by the apparent nudity of the then 13-year old star, Brooke Shields. The film uses an adult body double for her nude scenes. There is a fair number of topless scenes involving the older women, especially Susan Sarandon, who plays Brooke's prostitute mother. It depicts the everyday life in the brothel, showing the prostitutes as just people trying to survive and make a living. There is music, alcohol, cocaine and, of course, sex. The story is OK, the acting OK, the cinematography also OK. Basically nothing in this film is more than OK. I think it's worth a rent, perhaps. I believe that numerous children did grow up in this fashion, being the children of prostitutes. The Storyville brothels were eventually shut down and that is depicted as well.
