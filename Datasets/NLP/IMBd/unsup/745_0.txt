***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Little more, really, than a '70s exploitation flick, Sweet Kill (a.k.a. The Arousers) has a few points of interest beyond its plenitude of bared breasts and buttocks. First of all, it marks the very early directing and screenwriting debut of Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential, 8 Mile). Beginning in the 1960s, many of them in Roger Corman's raffish moviemaking academy, a number of directors who would later achieve prominence made their bones in horror schlock and soft-core porn; Hanson would wait until the '80s to do his next film.<br /><br />Second, its star is Tab Hunter, who's the best thing in it. Plainly, he had more talent than his dispiriting filmography and his reputation as a 60s-beefcake golden boy (and worse) might lead one to believe. Here he's a high-school gym teacher (this doesn't lead to much, and his buttocks stay chastely sheathed) living in Venice, California. He has a big problem, though. Owing to some cloudily referenced incident in his boyhood (which seems to involve Oedipal incest), he can't get it up. His rage and humiliation lead him down a dark path. When a girl he's picked up turns aggressive after his failure, he kicks her away. As happens with such kicks, she conks her head and dies. He hides the body away in a pigeon hutch on his apartment rooftop. And from then on it seems he can function only with a fresh corpse. When attempts at normalcy prove futile (he pays a hooker to dress up, presumably as his mother, and lie immobile), he prowls the beaches with his butcher knife...<br /><br />And that's about it. The movie's cheapness is often evident in its sound levels, which veer erratically. The `thriller' angle isn't worked out, and the movie ends with a shot of Hunter Ã  la Norman Bates in Psycho (homages to Hitchcock abound). Its most noteworthy feature is the empathy it shows for the murderer, a victim of circumstances which he cannot surmount.<br /><br />
