I don't want to write a comment for this useless and completely overrated film, I really don't, but I feel it is my duty to warn people about it, so here we go.<br /><br />Let me start off with the good things:<br /><br />Okay, now that that's over, let me go to the bad things: <br /><br />The acting was bad from everyone in the whole entire film, the comedy was not funny in anyway, the script was dumb and unamusing, the movie itself is nowhere near touching, heartwarming, or useful whatsoever, and it was really annoying and utterly ridiculous through most of the film.<br /><br />Now, I warn you to stay as far away as possible from this movie if you haven't seen it, and don't even bother reading any other comments, because all you need to know is what I just told you.
