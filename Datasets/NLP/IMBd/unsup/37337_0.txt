Another movie where a relation of the star wrote the screenplay. No screen writing credentials equals poor movie. Rated as one of the worst movies of the 1980's for good reason. A poor attempt to profit from, and bear similarities to, Jeremiah Johnson fame. Heston ends up with an unwanted Indian girl 17 minutes into the movie. Like many of the "Indians" in this movie she was more like a Mexican than an Indian. Why can't we get one or two real Indians? In one scene Indians approach their camp. The Indian sounds like a Mexican trying to talk in broken English like an Indian. Minutes later Indians attack. Laughing and hilarity throughout the battle. Just another fun day in the mountains. One of the guys is standing and is hit in the chest by an arrow. His concern would be on the level of someone who stepped into a puddle of mud with freshly polished shoes. So Heston nonchalantly stands up beside him. I guess he wanted to be a good target for the Indians. Heston pulls it out of his chest like he's dusting dirt off the guy's sleeve. The next day the guy is running around with no problem. In another scene here is Heston stumbling through the woods. You're wondering where his walker is. He's attacked by half a dozen young Indian braves. Of course, the old codger bests them in hand to hand combat. A poor sight at best. He arrives back at the camp and Keith sees he was attacked. And they were joking about it. You'd think he just got back from the 7-Eleven and spilled an ICEE. Throughout this movie I was never sure if it was supposed to be a serious movie or a comedy. Either way it flopped.
