I really really wanted to like this movie, in theory, it has all the right elements for a strong comedy, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I went to see this movie today at a 12:30 p.m. showing. The audience was a good mix of older couples, young marrieds, teenage girls, a few stray singles, a family or two--a well-rounded audience, let's say. That well-rounded audience spent an hour and a half with Robin Williams, god of comedy, with not a single good laugh. There were a handful of mild chuckles over things like poop jokes and a man getting smacked in the face with a baseball, but that was all we could muster.<br /><br />Mandy Moore was luminous (but not given much to do, I wish she'd pick better roles, I really want to like her), her fianc√© utterly and instantly forgettable in every way, the rest of the very talented cast (The best man was delightful, his relationship with his wife hilarious, and he was given all of 4 minutes of screen time) hopelessly misused, and Robin Williams as unfunny as the man can possibly get. The "plot", so to speak, consisted of Robin Williams as a minister conspiring to make the future marriage of Mandy Moore and the other one strong by torturing them at every turn and doing such charming things as bugging their apartment to ensure they were not having forbidden premarital sex. It was creepy and disturbing and predictable and boring, and, the worst sin of all for a supposed comedy, not funny.
