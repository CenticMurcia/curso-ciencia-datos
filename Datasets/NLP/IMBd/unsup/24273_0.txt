I don't care how many times I've seen this movie. It's still one of the greatest, albeit oft-played, films Adam Sandler has ever been in.<br /><br />Unlike most Adam Sandler movies, he doesn't have to rely on his character being goofy. The rest of the cast does that well enough... that's part of the appeal of this movie.<br /><br />The main reason I can honestly say why people like this movie (especially me) is because it has humor and an element of romance as well... let's also not forget that this was set in 1985; that gives the cast an excuse to dress like a flashback.<br /><br />The best part about the movie is that it wasn't inconclusive, negative or too sexually driven.<br /><br />I totally recommend this movie.<br /><br />10/10
