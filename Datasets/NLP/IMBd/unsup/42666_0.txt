If Jacky Chan wanted to make a commercial, he should have, but not this movie full with promotion of the companies who sponsored him. Beside that the film is to long, with an unnecessary long ride in the truck, and a stupid ending in Italy. It is not exciting, it is not funny, and it never should have been made.
