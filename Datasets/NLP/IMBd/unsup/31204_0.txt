OK, this has to be one of the best films I have ever seen, I saw it about 5 years ago when I was eight and can still remember it so well! I have been absolutely dying to see it again! It was because of this film that I had to get rid of my rabbit because my rabbit lived in the shed and I was to scared to go there by myself! I was searching on the internet for it and then walked into the next room and saw the closing scene on the TV! Am absolutely gutted that I missed it and would be grateful if anyone could tell me when it was next on Sky.<br /><br />A few people have commented on the young girls acting, I thought her calmness added to the atmosphere and suspense of the film. As I saw it so long ago, I find it hard to remember it perfectly and OMG!!! I have just got a phone call off my friend telling me it is on!!! That is sooooo creepy! Anyway, an amazing film and I'll comment in a few days when I have fully watched it! Peace x
