After Tim Burton's "Ed Wood" resurfaced that dubious genius, some peninsular scandalmongers decided to find the local equivalent to Ed and declared Tanio Boccia (who directs here as Amerigo Anton), Italy's worst filmmaker ever. That's not to be taken without a grain of salt. More than anything else, Boccia/Anton was one of those directors who accepted everything, did not argue with producers, took his projects as just another job and never thought of identifying with them. The results are under everybody's eyes, but it has to be admitted that he would have never thought of a future, let alone international, survival of his modest output thanks to TV, videotapes or DVDs. In the case of "Il trionfo di Maciste", the boyish Kirk Morris (alias Adriano Bellini, a Venetian who also starred in Riccardo Freda's "Maciste all'inferno") is to be admired in the muscular chariots scene at the middle of the film, where he offers such a picture of sweat, fatigue and effort as to become a minor cult classic for voyeurs. Although I'm not a gay person, I can easily picture the enjoyment of this share of the audience before such a sequence. For the rest, a minor and quite slow output without the visual glamor of the best productions.
