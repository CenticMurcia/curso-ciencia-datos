My movie watching days go back to the 1940's. I rate movies by several factors: Entertainment value; Information; Acting; Story; Honesty; and total Impact.<br /><br />Ive kept a top ten list since the 60's. 'Gone With the Wind' has been on top of that list since I first saw it, in 1949.<br /><br />Black Robe took second place when I first saw it, 2 nights ago. This film provides an extremely good picture of the rigors and difficulties encountered in the early days, in The North. The pristine quality of the earth, and its majesty come through crystal clear in this film . I will remember Black Robe and its characters as long as I live. Its one of those stories that makes you not want to get up to go the bathroom.
