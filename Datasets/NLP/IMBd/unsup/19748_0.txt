A good friend of mine recommended this movie to me, since we are both in History at University I thought I would give it a shot. The beginning of the movie I was really interested, filled with action and a sense of revenge for the main character. However, it just started going downhill from there. I found that there were too many useless characters that brought little or no addition to the plot. Most of the film was filled with uninteresting dialog and plot twists. In all honesty, this movie should not have been over 2 hours long. I just found that there were too many scenes that needed to be shortened and get to the point. Overall, Gangs of New York seemed to drag on and on. While the cast was excellent and the acting was amazing the story was just awful. After the first hour of the film, I found myself not connecting with the characters, hence became extremely boring. Films which are pushing a 3 hour time span should keep the audience entertained with character development, action, and story. However Gangs of New York seemed to fail at all of these except boring the heck out of me. I would much rather watch Pearl Harbor than Gangs of New York.
