HOW. HOW?!?!?!? How can a movie be so BAD?!<br /><br />By the title alone, I wasn't expecting much out of it when I saw it in the shelve at the video club... But I figured, "it stars Gerard Depardieu, so it can't be all that bad." Big mistake. The only decent thing in the whole movie (for the full two and a half painful hours it lasts) was Depardieu's acting - and let me add, he plays a supporting role, so you don't see him much either. For the rest, you are left to stare, speechless, at a sequence of extremely dumb scenes, while you ask yourself what's the point in them. It's one of those movies where you know exactly what is going to happen next, with a lot of "secondary scenes" (by this I mean scenes that don't add up to the storyline, they're aim is to get you the most bored as possible), and did I forget to mention, it features some very, and I mean VERY lame actors. I was planning on going into more details, but I can't. My fingers won't let me. One final word: Don't even think about buying/renting/asking a friend/downloading/what ever, this movie. Unless you strive to finding out how bad can a movie be.
