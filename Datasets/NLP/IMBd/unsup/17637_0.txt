At first, I was interested in seeing this film since it was named after a series of prints by Hogarth. In them, a rich young man wastes his life and ultimately ends up in the "looney bin" (or so they called it in 18th century Britain). When I found out that Rex Harrison was the star, I knew I had to give it a watch--as I have often found he can make even routine material fascinating.<br /><br />The film itself is very much like the prints in that Harrison does play a rather useless rich jerk, though the ending was quite different. Despite all his breeding and money, he manages to squander away all his family's good will by always managing to screw up his rather easy life by drinking, lying, womanizing and using practically everyone around him. He's not all riotous living and selfishness, though, as at times he shows a spark of decency. But despite meaning to reform, he always seemed to find himself playing the rotter--that is until he ultimately joins the military and makes something of his wasted life.<br /><br />Excellent acting, an involving and interesting script and a nice way to make a wartime propaganda film that isn't obvious or ultra-jingoistic. This is a very lovely old British film worth your time.
