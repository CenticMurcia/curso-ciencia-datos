This is a film that should be seen. Judy Berlin is funny, sad, touching and thoughtful, moving you from laughter to tears and introspection. The cast is great, starting with Edie Falco of Sopranos fame, who is endearing and comical as the title character, a wannabe actress with dreams of success in Hollywood. Her optimism is offset by the glum David Gold, who has been there and done that in Tinsel Town without any luck. Plucky Judy won't be dissuaded however, and her blind optimism is one of the lasting treasures of this movie. Another reason to go out and see Judy Berlin is that it's the last feature role in the brilliant career of Madeline Kahn, who is fantastic as a housewife with a wandering soul. As Madeline wanders the streets of suburban Long Island during a prolonged solar eclipse wondering if there's ever been a Wednesday, you can't help but identify on some level with her. Judy Berlin also features great performances by Barbara Barrie (who I personally loved in Breaking Away) and Bob Dishy. I'd never really seen Dishy before, but his performance made me go look up what he's done because he was really great. Go see this movie! You'll get a glimpse of a director on the rise, Eric Mendelsohn.
