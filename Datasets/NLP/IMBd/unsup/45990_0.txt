When I was a kid, I had a VHS tape that included a commerical for the Goosebumps videos. Earlier, I had no idea about Goosebumps except that it's scary and a show based on horror kids novels. I can't believe how that commerical fooled me and made me think that this actually worth watching. When I searched for it before, I took a road trip across all of my country's video stores and still didn't find it. I was going crazy because of this show; unfortunately, I turned my winter break into a disaster because I didn't find this show. I hardly found some books and read them and was totally impressed. But now and after watching various episodes, I finally discovered how stupid a show Goosebumps is. Even the books, now and after growing up, I found them to be poorly written and totally lame. The episodes I at least liked from this show were The Haunted Mask and Cry Of Cat Part One and Two; Neither than the bad acting and non-talented actors, I found these episodes to be well written. Neither then these episodes I give the show a BIG ZERO. Also about the special effects, did they buy them from a cheap store or something, they were totally unconvincing. Generally, I have nothing to say about this show except: lame, lame, and LAME.
