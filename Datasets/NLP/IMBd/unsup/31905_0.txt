There's not a lot of East German sci-fi floating around but I got this as part of a box set from First Run Features, and I've not been disappointed with the quality of the films nor the content. This is a rather interesting (and amusing) tale of a spaceship that goes to a planet to investigate a call for help, only to find there's seemingly nothing wrong. The people that live on the surface of the planet are party-animal types, and give the impression that all is well, but they seem to be hiding something, like, the fact that they imprisoned the real inhabitants of the planet to do slave labor in the mines underground. Most interesting is "the boss", who is kind of a combination of David Bowie and Liberace, maybe, who wears interesting spangled outfits and has his hair dyed in strange colors for no apparent reason. Both campy and creepy. The cast also has Leon Niemczyk, one of the main characters from "Knife in the Water". Anyway, the supposed rescuers do discover the dirty secret of the planet and set about to make things right, but with dire results. This is quite entertaining in a strange way, and a very odd sci-fi offering but quite fun. If you get the chance and are of a mind to, check this out. 7 out of 10.
