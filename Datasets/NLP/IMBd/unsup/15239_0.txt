I cannot believe that they took this show off of the air and I can't believe I'm just now discovering it! It is literally one of the best series that I have ever seen and I really hope the Paul Feig and the other creators will decide to come up with a similar comedy series! All of the characters are very believable, as are the story lines. I really felt that I came to know the characters and I'm tremendously disappointed that I will not be able to find out what happens to them! I know it's a little late to say this (well, about seven years too late!), but I wish some network would realize how much this show is loved and demanded by fans and bring it back in some form (most likely with different people)! I just love this series and hope to see something like it soon!
