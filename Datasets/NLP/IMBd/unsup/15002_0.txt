Parodies are only funny if they can stand on their own somewhat. It does not take a good writer to simply take dialog almost word for word from one of the best movies of all time and put it into an office situation. And three year old can do this. But most don't because they know better.<br /><br />The funniest thing about this is that it was released as an Oscar engagement. As if this movie was going to get any Oscar recognition. But I guess it would make any sense to release it for a Razzie engagement
