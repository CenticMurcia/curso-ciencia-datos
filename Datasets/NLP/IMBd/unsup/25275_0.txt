In spite of playing fast and loose with fact, this is a beautifully acted and touching film. The Lon Chaney character gives Cagney an opportunity to show his range, and the depth of his talent. There is a core of truth in the script in that Chaney used make up brilliantly, but beyond the make up, he was a fine actor. He made the outcasts he played richly human people for whom the audience learned to care. That Cagney could convey, through his performance, the power of Chaney's art is a tribute to both.
