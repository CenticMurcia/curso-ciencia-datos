I have walked out of very few films in my lifetime. I would have gladly added this film to the list. However, my wife liked the scenery of the SF Bay Area, perhaps the film's sole redeeming value if you can get past the geographic implausibilities (which I couldn't.) A waste of time and Jason Biggs' talent.
