This film is nothing short of perfection: it has heart-pounding adventure, nerve-wracking suspense, gut-busting humor, exhilerating action, wonderful characters, an excellent plot, sheer unpredictability, romance that isn't nauseating or cheesy, and a brilliant script. It's great fun for the whole family, holds up well to multiple viewings, and is one of my favorite movies. 10/10
