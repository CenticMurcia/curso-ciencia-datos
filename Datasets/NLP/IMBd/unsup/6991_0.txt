Being a big fan of Jeunet's more recent films, I was happy to find this one on cable last week. I found myself chuckling through the whole thing; not just at the jokes, but at the painstaking way Jeunet and Caro plant plot, scenic, and sound details that later play important parts in the film. (They even took time for things like designing and filming one of the cleverest opening credit sequences I've seen.) Jeunet's films are a feast of color and sound, where almost every character is memorable in his/her own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, but why complain? The directors have created an entire world for us to enjoy, filled with quirky people (the suicide woman, the guys who make animal-noisemakers...for whom?), weird set design (there must be a plumbing fetishist on the crew), and painstakingly-created set pieces (the flood, the fight on the roof, the squeaky bed). Relax and let your eyes and ears be dazzled by this offbeat comic romance.
