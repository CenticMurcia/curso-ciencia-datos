The films of Jose Mojica Marins, aka Coffin Joe, aka Xe Do Caixao, (spelling?) seem to operate on a logic all their own, that is, the logic of Mr. Marins himself, and while I can't say much about truly understanding what's going on in most cases, they do make for a fascinating watch. I have seen "At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul" and "This Night I'll Possess Your Corpse", and those are more in the horror vein, but this is more a commentary on the degradation of Brazilian society due to drugs and loose morals, it seems. And Coffin Joe seems to be to blame, oh yeah, right. It is rather amusing to see the "drug addicts" which look like middle-aged folks here, and some scenes which may have been meant to be somewhat frightening are actually more amusing than anything, at least these days. 4 people are chosen as part of an experiment with LSD and the focus of these experiments is the man himself, Xe Do Caixao, and at this point the film changes gears, switches from black and white to groovy color, and lets Marins cackle and leer his way through these poor folks bad trip. All along there's a panel discussion going on between folks that blame society's downfall on what they feel are subversive comics and movies. OK, so not much has changed in the world since the 60's, eh? Anyway, if you're interested the 3 films I mention are available separately or as part of the "Coffin Joe Trilogy", all are quite interesting in their own way and well worth seeing if you enjoy things that are 'different', and believe me, you can't get much different than these. 8 out of 10 and check it out.
