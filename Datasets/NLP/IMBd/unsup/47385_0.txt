This film is utterly terrible on all fronts, and it is remarkable that it was made at all being as unfunny as it is.<br /><br />This is clearly an attempt to be a slapstick film in the mode of Airplane. There's a difference - Airplane was original and funny, and had talented actors in it.<br /><br />At least Tia Carrere was nice to look at as usual.
