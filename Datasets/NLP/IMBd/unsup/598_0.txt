Not much of young Oscar left in this but I guess that once Jess caught sight of that Ms Romay's swinging bottom and breasts, he was soon too mesmerised to worry overly about plot details. And one can sympathise, Lina Romay is naked throughout the film and seemingly perfectly happy to not only reveal all but to get down and very dirty in a surprisingly explicit Franco outing. Nudity is hardly unknown in the 'dirty old man's' films but were this not so different in feel to accepted hardcore, that is the label one might find appropriate. Elegantly shot in widescreen this is a colourful, erotic tale with surprising moments hinting at vampirism and despite the appalling dubbed dialogue very watch able and amazingly possibly one of Romay's best.
