Not the best short film out there...but definitely not the worst. It has a very amateur look and style to it, and the pacing is rather slow. At the end, you figure out what the concept of the film is, but by then, it's a little too late to feel invested in the characters and the plot. And while the choice of music at the end was pretty, it really didn't fit at all. So, take a look at this film from a learning standpoint. You could learn some "Do's" and some "Don'ts." DO continue writing, shooting, directing, editing, etc. DON'T get discouraged. Continue to learn and develop your craft. Write, rewrite, rewrite again, shoot, edit, re-edit, etc. Best of luck with everything in the future.
