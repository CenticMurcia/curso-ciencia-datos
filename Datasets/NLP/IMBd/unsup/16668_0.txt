If you love old movies, or great comedy, or Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in their early prime, then PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM will still deliver the goods 30+ years after its first release. While technically not a Woody Allen film (he wrote it, based on his own Broadway play, but it was directed by Herbert Ross), it bears the mark of the Woodster during his funny, soulful early period. and is right up there with such gems as TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN and BANANAS. For all its humor, it is a great tribute to film-making and very deeply felt. Working with Keaton clearly inspired him, both comically and dramatically, and this, their first film together, already shows the on screen chemistry that flourished throughout the 1970s. Add to this the great comic Bogart of Jerry Lacy, and an ending that will make every true film-goer laugh out loud, and you have a winner.
