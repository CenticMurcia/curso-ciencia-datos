I'm sorry but Rosie O'Donnell talking about her mother's death and Barbara Walters (who has never really acted) on the actors studio. I have suggestions as to who should be on the Actors Studio in the future. What about your former wife, Nina Foch? What about the following? Kim Novak (retired and very much alive in Oregon. I bet she can teach acting), Dame Elizabeth Taylor, Barbara Windsor, Susan Lucci, Erika Slezak (she has 6 daytime Emmys), Jeanne Cooper, Emma Thompson, Susan Flannery, Helen Wagner (she celebrates 50 years playing one role on AS the World Turns), don't forget your soap roots, John Lipton. You spent 10 years on daytime with some of the finest around. You could have some longtime actors and actresses on your show. I bet they have better stories and can teach about acting. I look forward to your Liza Minnelli interview which will be a deservedly 2 hours long. Don't forget the Redgraves as well, Lynn, Vanessa, and Corin? What about Broadway stars like Cherry Jones, Zoe Caldwell, Angela Lansbury, John Lithgow, Oprah Winfrey, etc. There are plenty of wonderful actors and actresses out there waiting to be interviewed for your show. Kim Novak is a good example of somebody. She is a golden girl from the golden days of Hollywood. She would be worth watching as well. Come on, Lipton, you can do better than Rosie and Babs.
