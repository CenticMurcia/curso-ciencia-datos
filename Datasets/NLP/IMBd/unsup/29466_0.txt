My god!!! What a horrible film. One expects a lot better stuff from Mr. Subhash Ghai. Claiming to be a showman is only good if you can back it up with good films. But lately, Mr. Ghai has disappointed to say the least.<br /><br />I fail to understand what the point of Isha Shravani's character is in the film. Okay so the girl can do a rope dance, that doesn't mean you put that in the story. Her character doesn't belong in the story. It seems like Mr. Ghai used the First Draft of his film. Doesn't he think he should read his script over to make sure it makes sense? It seems like he wrote it, then forgot about it and then saw this girl who could do a rope dance and figuredOh I should put her in the film, no one has ever seen a girl doing a rope dance. Mr. Ghai needs to re-read his scripts to make sure there are no loose ends, he seems like an amateur with this film. When I write a script I read it at least 50-60 times and keep changing things until it makes sense. That's what a good writer does. You can't be happy with the first thing you write that's just wrong.<br /><br />The story could have been so good without the Isha Shravani character. Her character totally screwed up the plot and the story. Mr. Ghai needs to stop making formula films, not every film needs to have a love triangle. Stories can be told without triangles. Mr. Ghai needs to take some pointers from the like of Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Mani Ratnam. Stop making the same story over and over and over again. What an idiot! If you're out of ideas, don't make films anymore; we don't need to be tortured like this.<br /><br />Mr. Ghai needs to go back to film school and learn the latest techniques of film-making and story telling. I feel sorry for anyone who's attending his film school. Doesn't he realize that the audience is getting smarter...People will no longer accept the crap they dished out 10-20 years ago. This film is actually worst than the worst films they made 10-20 years ago.<br /><br />Mr. Ghai did everything in the film from Direction to Writing to Producing to Editing. He seems to be very proud of that fact because its there in BIG letters in the film...perhaps he should concentrate on just one thing and leave the others to professionals. Okay...I don't want to talk about Mr. Ghai anymoreHe's leaving a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />All the performances are average and I'm being generous here. The only one that stands out is a cameo by Sushmita Sen. Isha Shravani need to climb back up the rope she came down from. She can't act and the only reason it seems she's in this movie is because she can dance on a rope. That's the dumbest thing ever!! <br /><br />On the whole, I have never said this about a film, but...I WANT MY MONEY BACK...Don't waste your time or money on this one. Unless you want to see a girl spinning on a rope at 20 different parts of the film, for no reason what so ever, there is no reason to watch it. This is the by far the worst Subhash Ghai film ever. One expects more from him. DON"T WATCH IT AT ANY COST. Even if it's the last film left on earth, it's better not to see it. I'm so disappointed. I used to be a fan of Subhash Ghai films...Can you believe that!!!
