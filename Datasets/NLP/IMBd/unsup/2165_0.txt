Tuned into this movie late one night as I occasionally like to watch 'B' movies (no pun intended!) just for fun. However I was wonderfully suprised at the quality of acting I found. This movie had all the suspense and drama of jaws, except with bees. And yes the bees were badly rendered, and looked very 2 dimensional, but GET OVER IT, else you'll miss the guts of the movie. Above par acting by most, especially the kids...........<br /><br />
