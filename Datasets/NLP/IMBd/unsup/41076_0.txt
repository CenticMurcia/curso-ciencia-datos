I cant believe there is so much positive feedback for this film... did I watch the same film as you guys? I am a HUGE fan of Peter Sellers and I think the guy is genius, but this is far from his finest hour - OK Sellers is brilliant in this film, and all the problems of this film are not his fault, I blame Blake Edwards. This was meant to be some sort of silent film farce homage, but it seemed to be 10x slower paced than your average farce. The whole thing with the drunken waiter got old VERY fast and was so overused and unfunny, it had me cringing rather than laughing. Even Sellers genius couldn't save the many dull moments in this film, which consists of dull people talking about nothing in particular, Sellers listening to them, making unfunny comments and generally having his talent wasted. There were only a few sequences that were genuinely funny, the lost shoe sequence, the birdy num num sequence and the waiting for the toilet sequence. In between that comedy gold are interminable scenes of pure boredom as I try desperately to find something to laugh at. I cant understand why so many people find this a hilarious and classic Sellers film! And I love Sellers, I found the Pink Panther movies funny and even find stuff like Frank Spencer and Mr Bean funny (Rowan Atkinson undoubtedly stole a few ideas from this film but executed them far better) so i cant understand why I simply don't get this film at all.
