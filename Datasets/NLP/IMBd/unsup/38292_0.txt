This movie is one of the worst excuses for a movie i have ever seen. i don´t understand how Quentin Tarantino, one of my favourite directors/producers can do such awful movies as the From Dusk Till Dawn movies. This one is even worse than the first. Unlike the first one, this one has Bad actors (Robert Patrick). DON´T WASTE YOUR TIME, YOU WILL ONLY BE DISAPPOINTED. Robert Patrick should really consider which roles he should play more... I liked him in T2, but in this movie, no, don´t think so. And Tarantino should do more movies like Reservoir dogs, Pulp fiction and Jackie brown. Shape up Quentin, i know you can do better than this. Bad special effects, Even worse acting, bad story, bad jokes. In other words.... BAD MOVIE.
