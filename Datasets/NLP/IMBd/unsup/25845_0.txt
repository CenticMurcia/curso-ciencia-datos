Probably the worst movie i've ever seen.If you want to know the true story of Papillon READ THE BOOK!!! <br /><br />Here are some reasons why this movie is so bad :<br /><br />1. The script twists the original book in a freaking manner. The 1st escape takes place before Papi reaches the detention island , he escapes from the prison with Maturette and CLOUSIOT not with Dega which is to scared to escape and does not help them in any manner, the escape scene is partial true , there was no party and no guard was so close to raise the alarm like in the movie. BUT in the movie before the escape him and Dega go in woodcutting camp that's not true , Papillon went in the woodcutting camp with Clousiot AFTER THEY GOT CAUGHT, after Papillon escapes with ANtonio ,the guy who speaks Spanish, from a Colombian prison. <br /><br />2. Apart of changing the initial chapter order they miss a lot of them to, the Conciergerie chapter is not even mentioned and it has a vital role in comprehending the idea of the book. MOST IMPORTANT PART THAT HAS BEEN CUT IS THE TRIAL AND THE DREAMS OF REVENGE THAT KEEP PAPILLON GOING THOSE ARE Extremely IMPORTANT and you realize that after reading the book .<br /><br />3. Hollywood style is doing marvels :)). Papillon had no butterfly tattooed on his chest he had a tiger tattooed on the chest and he tattoos the Indian chief with a tiger not a butterfly. <br /><br />Also DEGA is not an important character of the book he appears in the Conciergerie Chapter, the travel to Guyana and at Papillon's 1st solitary detention.<br /><br />CONCLUSION : They ruined a marvelous book doing a very bad movie.
