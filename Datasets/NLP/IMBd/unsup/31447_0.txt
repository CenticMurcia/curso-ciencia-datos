Not so much of a sequel to Sam Raimi's groundbreaking horror feast the Evil Dead, this is more of a reprise of the same film with more proper equipment, professional pacing and further developed gore. Sole survivor Ash (Bruce Campbell in the role of his life) returns to the cabin in the haunted woods and faces the same demonic forces he dealt with in the first film. The first half is kind of like a one-man horror comedy show that provided Campbell with his constantly growing cult-icon status. Ash chops up his possessed girlfriend, loses essential body parts and nearly goes completely insane up in that shed. The second half introduces new characters or - in other words Â– fresh new victims to dissect. Sam Raimi updates his initial Evil Dead idea with rushing camera movements, inspired gore and comic book-style action. The pacing is fast and the blood is omnipresent! According to most horror fans, this is the finest installment in Raimi's trilogy (completed in 1993 with 'Army of Darkness') but I still prefer the charming cheapness of the original. Nevertheless, this is one outstanding horror adventure. Campbell's acting skills have remarkably improved and Sam Raimi's directing also is a lot more solid. Great fun, warmly recommended to every horror fan and admirers of twisted black humor.
