Like many people on this site, I searched far and wide for several years to find a copy of JT.<br /><br />If you would like a copy, please email me. There is no charge, and by accepting this DVD from me, you must NEVER charge anyone for a copy of this DVD....just make a copy and pass it along to a family member or friend. Hopefully one day, there will be a pristine copy of this wonderful movie/Christmas special.<br /><br />My copy is about a 6 out of 10....still, very easily watchable. It's like watching TV back in 1969, or watching an old VHS.<br /><br />Take care, Larry
