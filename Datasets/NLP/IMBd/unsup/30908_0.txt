Ghosthouse (1988) is very good for a low budget horror, it's very creepy and has haunting music in places!!! It's about this bunch of young men and women who decide to explore this run down old house that has been boarded up for years.<br /><br />The house is still haunted by the young girl who used to live there and her spooky clown doll (the clown is great by the way).<br /><br />It's not long before bad things start to happen to the group as they begin to realise that evil lies within the house!!! Ghosthouse is a very good film, with lots of creepy moments and some gore, the music is great too.......... the same music is used in "Stage Fright" which is another creepy horror movie, both are well worth checking out. 8/10 for this one.
