I'm one of the people who doesn't compare the book to it's movie. So I'm not going to do that for City of Ember. However, it is very hard not to, when the plot of the movie is fragile and could fall apart if the string was pulled a little. <br /><br />A) The beginning was a dead giveaway. What is that about? Haven't you people heard of something called 'twist in the tale', even if it a lame one! B) The entire plot, loosely held. No supporting ground, just plain confusion. C) This book is not that long. It could totally pull off a one and half hour movie if it were done right. I guess its too late to think about that so lets think about the good stuff.<br /><br />A) I guess the two stars were decent. Treadaway and Ronan have talent for sure. But isn't Doon supposed to be a 12 year old boy? Having a 24 year old play a 12 year old is really pushing it. B) The visual effects and settings were good. I guess that held the thrill of the movie. C)Somehow the ending was pretty nice. It pretty much follows the book, unlike the scenes before it, but it has this mellow feeling to it that was not captured quite well in the book (no offense to the book fans)<br /><br />Overall, the movie is NOT ALL BAD. It is good, but has terrible flaws. I hope the sequel, if they ever make one, manages to outdraw its predecessor.
