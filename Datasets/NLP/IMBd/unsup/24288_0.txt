There are only a few shows that i absolutely hate. One is Mind Of Mencia. This show is another.<br /><br />The jokes (if you can call them that) are uncreative and could easily make people stupid. That isn't a joke. The only thing they seem to think is funny are crotch hitting jokes, terrible puns, and fart jokes. How is any of that funny?<br /><br />The only plot to this show is a newly cyborg chicken is forced to watch random and crudely written sketches.<br /><br />This show is so absolutely horrendous that i would rather play ET for the Atari or watch Manos: Hands of Fate than watch this show. At least their creators admit to not putting any time or effort into those. The 60 titles they came up with for this show seems like the only effort they put in. Even those potential titles sucked.<br /><br />It's astonishing that people love this show. It has almost the same amount of viewers as Family Guy. At least that show has a plot and is funny. With shows expertly written like Boondocks on Adult Swim there is no excuse as to why this show is so popular. Maybe if you're a casual TV watcher and don't know good writing or story lines, then you will love this show and think all of the pop culture references are funny. The only other excuse to liking this show is that you must be high or have lost a lot of brain cells from constant drug use.<br /><br />Coming from someone who has no life and watches over 6 hours of TV a night. The show is so bad that i leave the house to walk 2 miles both ways to the gas station at 1 am (my time). Do not waste your time. You could be doing something much more productive like cleaning or watching Ernest movies. His movies are Citizen Kane compared to this garbage. This is one of the worst and unfunny shows ever in the history of TV and is a good reason this site needs scores under zero. If you have any intelligence, do not waste your time on this crap.
