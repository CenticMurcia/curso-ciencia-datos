"Speedway Junky" is all about a disenfranchised young man who blows into Vegas where he encounters silly caricatures of the kind of street people we're used to seeing in movies about disaffected and rebellious youths. There's no speedway racing in this crappy film which flops on all levels as it staggers around sin city bumping into gay men on the make, girls on the prowl, druggies, thieves, etc. A better title for this flick would be "Way Junky".
