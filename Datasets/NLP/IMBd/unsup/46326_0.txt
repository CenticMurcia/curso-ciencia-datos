First of all, the title is kind of misleading: yes, there are blondes in this movie, but they use guns approximately 1% of the running time (at the most). Unless the title refers to their others "assets", in which case it makes more sense. Anyway, this spoof of "Basic Instinct" (with such side targets as "Indecent Proposal", "Body Of Evidence" and "9 & 1/2 Weeks") is certainly not lazy - there's a visual or verbal gag every 10 seconds or so - but, unfortunately, only a small portion of these gags score; the first 10 minutes are the best, the last 10 minutes, in particular, degenerate into sloppy idiocy. For most of the people involved, this was their first and last film; one that I would have liked to see in more is former Miss California (or so the Troma DVD cover claims) Elizabeth Key, who is not only beautiful (though the nudity is provided by the other leading lady, Gloria Lusiak), but a pretty funny comedienne as well. *1/2 out of 4.
