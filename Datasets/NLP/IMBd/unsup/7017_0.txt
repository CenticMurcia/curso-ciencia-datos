What a great film! When ever I watch this movie, I sit with a big grin on my face. This was one of the first movies I saw at the cinema as a kid. This film didn't win any Oscars, but if there had been a category for FUN it would have won hands down. I don't thing this film was ever meant to be taken too seriously. Like many of Doug McClures movies, "At The Earths Core" and "The land that time forgot", made with a hint of tongue in cheek. Made before the onset of cgi effects, this film has an innocent, non-cynical feel. It has Monsters, the lost city of atlantis, guns, fight scenes and more monsters, what more can you ask for in a low budget sci-fi. Films like this are often belittled by people who cannot see beyond their De Niro's and Oscar nominations. The quality of a film, at the end of the day, is about it's entertainment value, hence 10 out of 10.
