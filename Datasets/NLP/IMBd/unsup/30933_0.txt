For the life of me, I can't figure out what everyone is on about with this movie. "Knowing" is completely unoriginal, horribly predictable, and poorly acted.<br /><br />For starters, is it just me, or is this movie an awful lot like "Signs"? I couldn't stop thinking about "Signs" the whole time I was watching this stinker. I found myself wishing that I was watching "Signs" instead.<br /><br />******SPOILERS***** <br /><br />For example: Nick Cage's character is a widower who has lost his faith in life. He believes there is no "grand design" behind things that happen.  "Signs". He has a sister that, much like Joaquin Phoenix in "Signs", hangs around and tries to help out. Cage's wife was killed in a terrible accident  "Signs". Guess what, by the end of the movie Nick Cage has found his faith again. Just in time for the credits. Can you say "Signs" <br /><br />******END SPOILERS***** <br /><br />I could go on, but I don't want to spoil the movie too much. "Knowing" does a good enough job of spoiling itself. If you pay semi-close attention if you are awake  if you are even in that "not quite awake, not quite asleep state", but your eyes are mostly open you should have this movie figured out fairly quickly. If you are one of these people whose "jaw hit the floor" turn your cell phone off next time. Not only does it distract you, but it is annoying to others as well. To say this movie is clichéd, would be clichéd, but honestly, I had this one figured out within 20 minutes.<br /><br />Lasty, Nick Cage... Whenever I go to a movie that is starring Nick Cage, I try to temper my expectations. Since I see him as probably the most overrated actor of our time, it helps me to not be too disappointed. Cage really out did himself this time, however. Despite the fact that there is not ONE memorable moment delivered by anyone in this entire movie, Cage still manages to be out shone by everyone. In fact, in scenes were he is alone the props seem to have more life.<br /><br />The one good thing about this movie is the title. It is very appropriate. "Knowing" means knowing exactly what is going to happen at any given time in the movie. It also means knowing that Nick Cage is going to lay an egg and paying nine bucks to watch it happen anyway. And of course it means knowing that you aren't going to get your money back even before you ask.<br /><br />Save your money, this is one to miss in the theater. Some day when you are in the mood for a really wooden, lifeless, and uninspired performance, the kind only Cage can deliver, watch it on Netflix.<br /><br />*******OKAY TWO MORE SPOILERS ****** <br /><br />How is it that TWO MIT professors couldn't figure out that the numbers in between the other numbers were locations? Seriously, MIT? I thought those guys were smart?<br /><br />And for all those posting that this movie was religious/Christian propaganda. You are half right. It is certainly religious propaganda, but the religion in question in my opinion is Scientology. Christians don't believe that aliens will show up just before the end of the world to take some precious few to "start over". That's Scientology. There are a few references to Christianity, sure. However it appears to me that they were thrown in to lend credulity to the otherwise ridiculous plot. After all, it wouldn't do for there to be a L. Ron Hubbard paperback lying on the nightstand during the "climactic" mobile home scene. So throw the Holy Bible down there instead. Please don't blame the Christians for this bomb. We are talking about Hollywood after all, not the Vatican.
