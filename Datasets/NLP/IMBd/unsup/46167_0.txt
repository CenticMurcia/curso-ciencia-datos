I rented this movie the other night, and I'll be damned if I still don't have a clue as to what is going on throughout this movie. Without getting into any spoilers hopefully, all I can say is that when watching other movies similar to the way this story is told in which it seems to jump around with no clear direction, just didn't work for me. I kept waiting for all the pieces of the story to come to a conclusion, but when it finally does (kind of), the story I think should have ended. It doesn't and that just leads to more confusion. For a low budget film I do think that the quality of the movie itself was pretty good, although the sound at times was annoying. Sometimes the music was too loud and the dialogue was drowned out. And I don't want to even try and figure out what was going on with Henry's facial marks??? I can't recommend this movie. I feel like I wasted 1 hr and 30 minutes.
