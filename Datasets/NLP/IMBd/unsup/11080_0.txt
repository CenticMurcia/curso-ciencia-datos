This movie is, I think, extremely well-acted and produced. As for the comments about the extreme differences between the characters, have they not heard the old adage that "truth is stranger thatn fiction?"<br /><br />I love this movie, pure and simple. The comments I've read about the scene on the table in the diner turn me off. I think it's great and it's one of my favorites.
