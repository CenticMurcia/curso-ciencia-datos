I love everything about this movie, funny, touching (with the woman, her kids and the oranges) and everything else. But what I love most about this movie is Kamala Lopez. When she adjusts her dress and flips her gorgeous hair, I am left a helpless, drooling idiot. She is one of the most gorgeous women I have ever seen. It is my opinion that Latinas have the most beautiful bodies in the world. From Salma Hayek to Jennifer Lopez to Miss Nude Universe Mercedez, these Latina women are the reason why cavemen chiseled on walls (to borrow a quote from Greg Kinnear in As Good As It Gets). I love them, one and all! Anybody else out there love the Latinas? Let me hear ya say, yeah!!!
