You could do worse for Bad Movie Night.<br /><br />The great fun is catching all the swipes it takes at Emmerich and Devlin.<br /><br />First there's the huge saucer that sits atop a building; then there's the pseudo-Godzilla monster the aliens create (with a funny-looking jaw that reminds one of the Emmerich-Devlin Godzilla). But of course it hasn't a chance against the real thing.<br /><br />Tons o' fun.
