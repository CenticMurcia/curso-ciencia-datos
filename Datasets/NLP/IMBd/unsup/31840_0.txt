"Frühling auf dem Eis" is a must for everyone interested in the history of figure skating and ice-revues. The skaters open a dream world of colours and dance. Eva Pawlik, in the fifties Austria´s most popular figure skating queen, is shown in a large number of roles on the ice (as a doll as well as a ballerina) and also in the leading role in the movie´s frame story. It goes without saying that the skating style looks old-fashioned from the present point of view, but taking into account that the film is more than half a century old you can imagine that the style was very modern at that time, especially as compared with the Hollywood movies with Sonja Henie. So "Frühling auf dem Eis" with the ensemble of the legedary Vienna Ice Revue is from a certain point of view a historical cultural document. That is why it seems more valuable to me than other movies produced in 1950.
