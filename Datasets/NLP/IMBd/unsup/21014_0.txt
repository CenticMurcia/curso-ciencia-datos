I have given this movie a through examination, and I have determined that, due to the lack of Robin William's voice as the genie, this movie stinks. I like the fact that Iago changes, and he (MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!!! DO NT READ THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING!!!) ends up destroying Jafar himself.<br /><br />Iago saves Aladdin's life, and soon, Iago is caught up in the middle of a conspiracy plot by Jafar, who is freed by a thief. The thief, Abis Mal, is the chief of a group of thieves, and isn't very smart. He wastes two wishes right away, and Jafar goes back to Agrabah. He then forces Iago to set a trap for Aladdin. Luckily, Iago is able to stop Jafar, and well, you'll have to watch the movie to find out the rest.<br /><br />My Score: 3.5/10.
