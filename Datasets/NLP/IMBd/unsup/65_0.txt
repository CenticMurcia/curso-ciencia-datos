I was fortunate to be sent a copy of this movie after my plea. It was worth it as it was a far better movie than I had expected, it not being one of the most well known of silents. Everything about this movie was class and to top it all off, the soundtrack by Philip Carli was just perfect and the print was crystal clear. The direction by John Robertson was first class, again considering that he was not one of the more well known directors of the time and the photography was the usual high standard that we expect from William Daniels. The cast were all excellent, Lars Hanson was superb as the tormented title character Anson Campbell, he has been accused of over acting, but, Anson Campbell is a man who is losing his faith and heading for a mental breakdown to boot and Hanson portrays that with chilling clarity at times, though admittedly he was a little over wrought in some later sequences. Pauline Starke was absolutely amazing as Bess Morgan, she made you care so much about her and you truly believed in her character as a woman who has endured so much sadness and has hit rock bottom as a whore, but, is willing to seek redemption and change her life. Marceline Day was excellent as Mary Phillips, so much in love with Anson, but, still putting her faith ahead of her heart. This was a film that questioned the personal interpretation Christian charity in a manner that I found surprising for a film of that time All the cast was superb and the settings of a small New England harbour town was excellent, the shipwreck scene was very well done. All in all an excellent movie and if TCM show then I recommend it 100%. Special thanks to Paul, without whom I'd have never seen this treat. Hey TCM UK, when are you going to show more silent classics like you do on the other side of the pond?
