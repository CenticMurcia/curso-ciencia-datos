Robot Chicken is a stop-motion animated show, using action figures, made by Seth Green. Each episode consists of different skits. Some of them are only a few seconds while others can be five minutes.<br /><br />This show parodies many different things. From movies to video games to celebrities to T.V shows etc. if you can think on anything Robot Chicken will make a sketch about it. Some sketches are completely random that make no sense.<br /><br />I have to say that this is my favourite animated show. I rofl every episode. This show is not for the kids as it is very crude and sometimes violent. If you are a teenager or a young adult than this show is for you. Trust me it will not disappoint. 5/5.
