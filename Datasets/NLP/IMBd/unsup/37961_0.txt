I saw this movie two days ago,In hope to show an investor, examples of independent films thank god I had Napeleon Dynamite on hand,a true sample of what an ultra low budget should look like.I can be a forgiving viewer when it comes to independent films.I've watched my share of garbage-amateur-horrible-z-grade horror, but Leigh Slawner's: The Beast of Bray Road Flats must be the worst ever! If there ever was a movie, which deserved to be shelve this must be it.I was very well surprised by the extremely low quality of the movie,considering the fact that this movie cost more to make than Napeleon Dynamite.<br /><br />I was curious to hear the commentary of the filmmakers,to see what minds were involve in this project and all I can hear were fourth graders making fun of their home movie.<br /><br />I am wondering why this piece of garbage was ever made. The characters are so lame you have no motivation to cheer for anyone.To any one who suffers from insomnia, I recommend this film as a great sleeping aid and if you want to punish your kids for doing wrong, this would make a great tool for punishing them or make a criminal talk.<br /><br />Most bad movies have a certain good in them (usually comedy), but alas, this movie beats out anything else thrown at it. Instead of causing laughter, it caused pain.<br /><br />It seems as though the director duct-taped a broken mic to the top of his camera and hoped it would capture anything, all I can hear were cars during intimate moments, Because of this, One can barely understand the dialog. The camera guy was terrible because he doesn't know what a polarizer filter is for,and the lighting was bad at the bar scene that I had to increase the brightness on my TV.<br /><br />The only positive thing about this movie was the ending credits and when I tab open on my DVD player.
