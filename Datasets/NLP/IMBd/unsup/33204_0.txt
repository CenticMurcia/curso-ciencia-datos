What is my POS productions group? It stands for Piece Of Sh@t productions. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my whole life!! You can see the boom mike at times. The whole movie is supposed to be happening at night yet there are scenes where you can see daylight in the background. There are 2 scenes where you can see the shadow of the cameraman on a wall. Also, you never find out what happened to the first teen that was killed. At least show us his body or something! There are at least 4 scenes where the killer could have killed the last 2 girls left alive but he doesn't. He just walks away and disappears!! And the acting?? Can we say elementary school play? Oh I'm sorry, I don't want to insult the elementary schools! And the climactic scene is easily the worst of all time!! I wasted $4.86 to rent this at Blockbuster mainly because on the DVD box there is a quoted from IFQ magazine stating that it is "The most terrifying movie of the last decade". I WILL NEVER TRUST THOSE GUYS AGAIN!!
