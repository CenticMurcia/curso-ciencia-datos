This movie is definitely one of the best Australian movies in recent times. Kerry Armstrong's character of Justine will go down in Australian cinema history as one of the most memorable characters of all time, right up there with Babe, Picnic at Hanging Rock's Miranda, Mick Dundee, the drag queens from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and Darryl Kerrigan. It is fantastic to see a good Australian comedy for a change, and even if this is not a box office smash, it will become one of those Australian movies which Australians love.<br /><br />It is a perfect example of a great Aussie parody. It examines, in a humorous way, stage mothers at their worst. Everyone will love the antics of Justine and the other stage parents as they push their children to the limit.<br /><br />This is one of those must watch movies that everyone should see!!!!
