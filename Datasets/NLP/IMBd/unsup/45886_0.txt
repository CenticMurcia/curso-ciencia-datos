If you like religious comedy, then here is the movie for you. This couple is getting married after being together for six entire months. Wow. I was with my husband for 5 and a half years before we got married. I think that the couple in this movie should have just stayed apart or fart. There were some really lame fart jokes in this movie and the baby robots were super ugly. I wish everyone who wants to get married after six months should go through this guys program and then not get married. Maybe Frank can pencil you in after two years. I didn't get all the religious jokes either. I am not religious person and that poor child who was in training needed to get out of the church and go to the playground with children his own age. Who on earth practices carrying the bride across the threshold? There were so many things wrong with this movie. It made me want to hurl my lunch. Don't see this movie if you want to get married because it will ruin your marriage.
