... to quote the great Jack Nicholson. while it is true that in any conflict there are atrocities on both sides, not one of the negative commentators can refute any of the claims made in this series, they can only point out that it is one sided. well yes, that is the point, it is about the Christian crusades, if it was about the side of the muslims it would have been called "jihad" or something. it is very suitable that a python would handle this subject since much of it verges on farcical, if it weren't so utterly horrible. just the fact that when they finally get to to Jerusalem not only is it not occupied by the people that were supposedly oppressing it (the turks were already kicked out) that in fact everybody was getting along quite well. that's a python moment if there ever was one! i can hear the dialogue now<br /><br />Christian: "We have to come to rescue you from the infidel blasphemers!" <br /><br />jerusalem resident: "No thank you, we're doing just dandy actually, perhaps you would like to save the next city?"<br /><br />Christian: "But we have travelled for years through untold hardship and struggle to kick out the infidels! God has willed it!" <br /><br />jerusalem resident: "Look, it's not my fault we're not being oppressed, what do you want me to do, beat myself over the head?"<br /><br />and so on .... and of course they end up looting and pillaging the "holy city". and you know, i don't think the Arab world has forgotten this period as much as we have, and we are still paying for those dark and bloody times. i'm glad this series was made, we must face the truths of history, no matter how ugly they are or how much they shatter our fragile myths we have created to shield ourselves from the true horrors of our past.
