This movie sucked balls. I was totally hyped up to see it. Christopher Guest is usually reliable when it comes to hilarity. His characters are original and funny. Good thing I rented this piece-o-shat because I would've bought it had it been for sale. I don't understand why it was such a horrible movie. After watching it I felt dirty and used. There was one funny scene but I can't even think of it right now. I sure hope the next one is good, otherwise I'll never get hard for Parker Posey again.(just kidding. she is too hot.) DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Trust me, it's that bad. I would rather watch a Steven Segal movie than watch this steaming pile again.
