This movie stunned me when I first saw it, so I went and saw it again two days later. It's so beautiful, and it gives me so much to think and wonder about. I'm still thinking about it. I want to go and see it again. I may or may not do that. I realise that the reason I want to see it again is that it inspires a deep yearning in me for depth and beauty and purity and truth and love. Seeing it again will not satisfy this longing, but it will remind me that I have it. And that's good.
