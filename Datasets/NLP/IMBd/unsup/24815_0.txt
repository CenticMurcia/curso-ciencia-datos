This movie is a beautifully acted psychological thriller. The film describes some of the ways in which victims of pedophiles suffer. Another sad message is that victims of sexual abuse may be doomed to seek similar treatment over and over again for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />I've loved Joseph Gordon Levitt since he played "Tommy" on Third Rock From the Sun and he's grown into a powerful actor. I wasn't familiar with Brady Corbet's work but he is equally moving as the young man trying to remember the sexual trauma he experienced as an eight-year old boy.<br /><br />Elizabeth Shue and Elizabeth Long are both tragically perfect as the clueless mothers of these two boys.<br /><br />Obviously, this movie is truly an expression of love for the writers and directors - for everyone involved. This story and its message are so important, and a cautionary tale for parents everywhere.
