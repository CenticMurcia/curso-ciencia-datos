This was a very surreal movie that had everything for the avid film fan. The performances from Cuthbert and slater were top draw and the script was excellent culminating on my opinion with a below par end. I feel i would have given a 10 if there had been a little more thought in the last 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />The story revolves around Slater, he has a very mundane life and is treated like a piece of dirt by his work colleagues. He works in a cubicle and spends all day planning to literally shoot the office up until just as you think he will another colleague does. He then saves Cuthberts life and this is where the story really begins.<br /><br />There are various surreal moments, on several occasions Slater is talking to his fish and they have some witty responses. Cuthbert looks great as always but nice to see her in a movie where some acting is required, i would find it hard to criticise though as the film "the girl next door" is my favourite film of all time and Cuthbert can do no wrong. The Karaoke Scene is terrific and shows both the humour and serious message from this film.<br /><br />Slaters character was another complex part of the story, you at the beginning don't really have time for him. He then starts to improve his life and his character becomes more likable but, ultimately his character goes more and more into depression and looses his trust of everyone again and you start to dislike him again.<br /><br />On the whole this film will not set box office records alight but with all the rubbish rolling out of the studios recently this is a little gem that has snuck out. I would definitely recommend you see it at your earliest opportunity.
