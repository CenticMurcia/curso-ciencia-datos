If Samuel L. Jackson is going to insist on doing comedy he should stick to the dark kind like Pulp Fiction. As for Eugene Levy, he is not bad as the sidekick but he has done some vastly better comedies. If you want to watch a truly great comedy with Eugene Levy then skip this along with any of the American Pie sequels and rent, nay buy, the Christopher Guest (the genius behind This Is Spinal Tap) movies A Mighty Wind, Best in Show and Waiting For Guffman. In comparison, The Man falls embarrassingly short. A tired, run-of-the-mill script and plot that have been flogged to death by Hollywood. Stick to action, Samuel. Stick with Christopher, Eugene.
