When this film was about to start, I didn't know what to expect. I hadn't heard of it previously, so for all I knew, it could've been another straight to video nightmare, with unknown actors and a terrible script...<br /><br />Man was I wrong! At first, I thought it was a little weird. There was this fake-ass white boy going around using all his gangsta slang with a hilarious debut album "Malibo-tay" and he had all these wannabe friends as well. But what could've been a dire attempt to create a funny film turned into a darn funny film altogether! His dad, campaigning for governor of California, is very angry with "B-Rad" after he does some inexplicable thing. For one, at the start of his campaign speech, B-Rad runs up with some "ho's" and "homeboys" and starts rapping with all his "wack-ass" rhymes. Obviously his dad, a very well-to-do man with a mansion and huge credibility is not impressed. He doesn't know how to tell B-Rad this. So he lets him do the signs when he is talking. Another travesty. An inexplicable sign is pulled down referring to women, so his dad is reasonably happy when the idea comes up of two black actors posing as gangsters to kidnap his lil' rapper and show him what the hood is really like...<br /><br />At the the end of the day, you've got to wonder what sort of respectable adult would make this. Whatever he was trying to do, he succeeded. With some hilarious scenes involving a rap battle and a gunfight (hey, it was from Grand Theft auto III) this is a hit-and-hit comedy that is great fun. <br /><br />Overall: **** out of ***** (4 out of 5)
