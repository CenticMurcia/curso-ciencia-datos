The last part of the Blackadder series, this is almost my favourite, due to the brilliant performances of all the actors (especially Stephen Fry, Tim McInnerny and Hugh Laurie), the hilarious jokes and the plots of each episode (even the last one - which is rather dire). Like all the Blackadder parts, this series has a very good intro and credits, in this the intro is the best. The World War I theme works very well with the three companions. All in all, a very entertaining finish to the Blackadder series.<br /><br />This has a rather grim World War I theme, but luckily there are brilliant jokes and plots to brighten up each episode. Blackadder is cynical and grumpy as usual, Baldrick is his stupid self and George is still very stupid and positive in this terrible war. General Hogmanay is also rather stupid and keeps making sure they are on the right track and doing what he wants. Captain Darling always has something sensible to say but the General never lets him. He has very strong opinions but is not very strong himself.<br /><br />The cast:<br /><br />The cynical, intelligent Blackadder: Rowan Atkinson. The lovable, stupid, hopeful Baldrick: Tony Robinson. The stupid, jolly General Hogmanay: Stephen Fry. The weak but strong-minded Captain Darling in the background: Tim McInnerny.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who enjoyed the previous Blackadder parts, anyone who likes British humour and anyone who likes good grown-up humour. Enjoy! :-)
