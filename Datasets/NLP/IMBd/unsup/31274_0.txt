It is rare that a director so succinctly and unflinchingly manages to commit his ideas to the screen with such conviction. For that alone, Tom Kennedy and Alez Harz deserve much praise. It is a remarkable achievement. What makes "?" a distinctly unnerving viewing experience are those very ideas and perceptions of human existence. This film holds true for people of all ages and from all strata's of society. "?" opts for a deadpan humor, coaxing us to laugh at these pathetic people not out of affection or understanding, but rather simply as a response to life as they see it. On a first time viewing the sheer despondency of these characters seems to overwhelm the humor, but watching the film again, the humor seemed far more blatant. Obviously this is not a movie for everyone, since this bleak view on human life is clearly not shared by all. But still, this is a work which is undeniably a masterpiece of sorts.
