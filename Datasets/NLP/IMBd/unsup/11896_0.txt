Average road comedy that has average production quality and nothing original or new to offer as all presented here have been done better in other films of the same genre.Although still funny at times and big fans of the lead actors here will be entertained because they will see that they still have their talents in 1999.Goldie and Steve are certainly the main attractios here and they did a great performance.Very funny scenes at the last 20 minutes involving a drugged out Steve.Not a big fan of road comedies and the lead actors?Stay away then.....
