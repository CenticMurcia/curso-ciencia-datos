This documentary is about how white people are evil, and responsible for all black problems. Every word spoken in this film is complete and utter garbage.<br /><br />Throughout the film we learn how white people manipulated the poor, innocent blacks into creating the Bloods and Crips. We are taught how the evil white people forced the gangs to go to war with each other and sell drugs. Everything is white people's fault. Everything.<br /><br />This "documentary" is quite possibly the greatest work of fiction of all time. Only militant blacks, or guilty white people will derive anything but anger and disgust from this bravo sierra.
