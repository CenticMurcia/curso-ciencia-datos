All WWE has is wrestlers that are boring and ECW isn't even Extreme anymore. This is the best brand of all. The McMahons are losing talent that goes to TNA. Christian Cage and Rhino. That makes McMahon look bad and he should. WWE is starting to suck and this is all the way better. Rhino was right and I'm with him, I'm TNA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This seems to be leading us into the next line of wrestling. A.J. Styles seems to be the future of wrestling with his high flying and insane moves. This takes risks instead of WWE. TNA is the best wrestling I have ever seen. I like it the best and I'm not changing my answer.<br /><br />WWE is Worst Wrestling Ever
