Another weak and contrived Brit' crime drama with comedy aspirations as a group of characters sit in a white room and recall the incidents that led to them coming together starting with the sale of a dodgy motor...<br /><br />No performance on earth can save what is basically a poorly developed script.<br /><br />Distinctly unsatisfying.
