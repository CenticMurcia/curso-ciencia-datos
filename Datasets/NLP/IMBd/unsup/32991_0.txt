I first saw this movie when I was about 7 and I really quite enjoyed it! How wrong was I?! After reading the books last year and loving every single 1, I watched the movie again and was horrified! Why anyone would waste money making such tat is beyond me! The film differs so much from the book its quite unbelievable. Why they would waste time filming scenes which had absolutely no consequence at all to the plot and missing out important features such as the relationship between Cathy and Chris is pathetic! It is clear that whoever made this rubbish never went anywhere near the book let alone read it and should be ashamed. The ending... what on earth happened there? Corrine doesn't die until 'If there be Thornes' which is the third book in the series and even then she is allowed to redeem herself a little by saving Cathy. Also, in the book Cathy and Chris are meant to only be 12 and 14 but in the film they both look at least 25. I don't know about anyone else but I wasn't amazed by the beauty of these children at all, they were supposed to be striking! The acting was terrible and extremely overdone, this film is nothing but a complete mockery of an amazing piece of literature. Another thing, why on earth did Jonn Amos no about the children? Why was the mouse called Fred not Mickey? Why only 17 lashes on Corrines back, it was 33 wasn't it? Why cookies, not donuts? Why was Cory buried in the woods and not his remains not concealed within the house? The list of wrongs is endless, the only thing I can advise is don't waste your time watching this movie if you love the books, you will only be disappointed!
