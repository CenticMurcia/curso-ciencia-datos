I see that many viewers dislike this film, some intensely. I can understand that. But reading how this one is worse than the others? Not keen on that point. As far as I can tell, "The Amityville Curse" is no worse (or no better) than virtually any of the others in the series. This one is dull, inane, badly paced, sloppily rendered, (mostly) badly acted, silly, predictable and largely devoid of notable special effects. Except for the last descriptive, each of the above words can be applied to every one of the "Amityville" movies, and the special effects wasteland can be said for probably 3/4 of the others as well. So...the good points. ... <br /><br />Well, there is a decent feeling of creepiness somewhere towards the end of the film. Several others in the series lack even that. Otherwise, this is standard issue Amityville nonsense. Basically.
