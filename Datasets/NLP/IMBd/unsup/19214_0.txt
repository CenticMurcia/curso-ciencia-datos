A curiously flat fictional retelling of the rise and fall of Murder, Inc., with Bogart in the Tom Dewey role. Director Bretaigne Windust has done better work than this, and the star looks tired. He had been down the path too many times before, and his boredom was showing. A lot the movie consists of flashbacks, which are distracting. I wish it had been better written and tighter all around. There has yet to be a definitive movie on this topic. It has been tried many times. The supporting cast outshines the star in this one. Zero Mostel is very capable as the sweaty, nervous Big Babe Lazich, while Everett Sloan makes a dapper Mr. Big. The actor who wins top honors in my book is Ted De Corsia, whose strange combination of warmth and menace enables him to steal every scene he's in; and he steals the picture, too. One remembers him long after the movie is over.
