This is a great movie! It's full of good wholesome values that I am glad for my kids to see. For example, before giving Elmo magic clothes to wear to the ball, the Fairy Godperson tells Elmo that what matters is how a person behaves, who you are as a unique person, not what you wear. (Then he says, "But it's fun to dress up!" and poof, Elmo is wearing nice clothes.) The princess is kind and gracious. When Bert offers her his paper clip collection, she doesn't laugh, but instead she recognizes that it's one of his favorite possessions and she is honored that he would offer it to her. Oh my, and I LOVE that the genders are mostly switched around. It's a princess, not a prince; Cinderelmo is a boy not a girl; and the Fairy Godperson (in training) is a male -- and wonderful! This is a kids' movie not to miss!
