While not as good as some of his previous films, The World is still an excellent movie. Imagine a soap opera director (or a TV ad director) making Italian Neo-realism, and you'll get the right feel. Zhang Ke has a talent to make you feel relieved or even elated while showing reality at its most bleak. He is one of the best directors operating today, none of his films should be missed.<br /><br />The opening scene in which Tao Zhao asks for a band-aid, dressed in an over-the-top Indian costume, is powerful and touching (and in a way, summarizes the entire film). It is one of Zhang Ke's most memorable scenes (alongside the one in which Hong Wei Wang is cuffed to a street lamp by the policeman in Xiao Wu). <br /><br />There seem to be two versions of this film. In one we get to see the World Park's manager confiscating passports from the Russian female workers, and promoting a girl in exchange for sleeping with her, in the other version those scenes were cut (and so it's probably the official Chinese version).
