A total generational look at corporate American thirty-something men in the worst sense. Cruelty is the underlining theme, yet you are laughing through most of the movie at what, unfortunately, can and does happen in the business world. Back stabbing, sexism, betrayal and lies somehow make this a very entertaining movie. (are we sick?!) Most everyone survives at the end of a six week roller coaster ride in treachery.
