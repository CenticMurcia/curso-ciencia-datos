I was quite pleased not to have found this film, nor Grace/Annabel, to be as depressing and fatalistic as others on the IMDB would have one believe. Though Grace certainly appears to have fallen victim to those in the porn industry who only want to exploit her, and though she seems to have been effectively "castrated" by mainstream public perception of her, I don't think any of this makes her social/political observations less worthy of consideration. Sadly, Grace does not seem to able to publicly express her points very well (we are told by former teachers that she's a very good writer, however), and the filmmakers don't help matters much by painting her pretty much as totally alone in her beliefs (despite the fact these pro-sex "feminist" arguments have been around for at least 15 years).<br /><br />Finally, I find complaints that the film was not "fun" a bit beside the point. Frankly, it gives one cause to wonder if some of these people came to the film expecting to get aroused, and when they didn't, they chose to look no deeper.
