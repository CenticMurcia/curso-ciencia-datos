I always like playing a good adventure game, and this one is absolutely among the top three ones ever made according to me and a lot of others.. This game is really the top of the cream and will be for a long time because there hasn't been any game like this before..at least not as good.<br /><br />The sad thing though, is that it hasn't been really integrated and didn't have a chance to be. But if You ever liked ANY adventure game, play this.<br /><br />
