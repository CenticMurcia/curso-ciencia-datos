I saw this film in 1976 and was very disappointed.Of all of the most ribald yet, low- level comedic films of the 70's("The Groove tube"."Tunnel Vision" and "What do you say to a naked lady?")this film was by far, the most wretched.It was basically a series of stale,re-cycled jokes featuring ethnic stereotypes, frat-house styled sexual innuendo, and forgettable one liners.All of this topped off by poor direction and third-rate acting.The film finds itself cast adrift in a sea of bewilderment:Are they trying to display sequential "stand up" comedy or showcase a series of funny sketches, with satiric and sexual overtones? Unfortunately, the film achieves neither objective. If you appreciate the humor of Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, Woody Allen, or Groucho Marx, you'll detest this film. Steve D
