When I first saw the cover of this video, I had the sneaking suspicion that it might end up being one of those "so bad its good" movies that I absolutely love. Instead, it just ended up being bad. As far as a summary, take "Nightmare On Elm Street 3", add some even worse acting and production, add a killer that is one part Freddy Kruger, and one part Marcus Welby MD, and you've got this heaping pile of dung. In at least half the scenes in this movie, the lighting is so dark that its very difficult to even see what's going on. Fortunately for the viewer, by the halfway point you stop caring anyway, so perhaps this is a blessing in disguise. That was either a product of bad production, a very low budget, or possibly both. Also, there is this one cheesy song that is played a total of THREE times, including during the closing credits. And the song doesn't improve with multiple listens. Plot holes are everywhere in this film (too numerous to mention), and by the end you are just glad its over. Do yourself a favor, avoid this......!
