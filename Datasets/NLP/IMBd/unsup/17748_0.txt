With a quick glance at the plot, this would not be a film that would typically catch my attention. Normally, I would not be interested in a film that is summarized as a "complex... thriller about computers and cryptography, government and espionage." However, on this particularly boring afternoon, I decided to give it a watch. I was very surprised and quite glad that I had given it the time of day.<br /><br />First and foremost, the cast is wonderfully selected. They were all very real-- even the extras. There is unexpected humor all throughout the film, as well some romance. The score is perfect, and really helped make the movie. It is not all about computers and technology or whatever you would contribute to the description of the movie, but rather it's a pretty good thriller. I jumped quite a few times throughout, and toward the end I was on the edge of my seat and biting my nails. Not only all that, but the themes are somewhat ahead of their time. I could definitely see something like this happening in the future; or maybe it's happening already...<br /><br />Overall, great film and not one to be missed!
