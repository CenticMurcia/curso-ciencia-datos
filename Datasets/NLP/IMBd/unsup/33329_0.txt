This has to be the worst horror film ever, pathetic storyline, and the film looks like it's been cut by the uk censors. The film is 76 mins of rubbish, the thing in the cellar looks like it belongs in a 50's sci-fi film and is nothing like the cover for the film. An italian dubbed film with horrible acting and and cheesey script.<br /><br />The worst thing about it is now i own it!
