This is a 'Mothman Prophecies'-styled mystery. It lurches along, and doesn't work. What the movie never needs but can't be talked out of, is another scene in which the heroine loses her grip, or her perturbation escalates<br /><br />But Hollywood sure loves our cultural fictions. In AlphaKiller, a renegade cop does her own thing, barging in on hostage situations, ejecting herself past all restrictions, not because it's plausible for a minute, but because a strong character (trans: loose cannon) can waltz over the problems of a poorly constructed narrative, and overcome the barriers that society places on "getting things done" (This is familiar from hundreds of movies dating all the way back to Charles Bronson's Deathwish in the 70s). In reality, absolutely nothing terrifies Americans more than someone who doesn't behave exactly like the crowd. Perhaps audiences want to see someone go maverick because they deliriously imagine this conforms to their own lives. Or perhaps they know they're powerless and it's comforting to see someone (even a fictional character) acting autonomously. For me, it's extraordinarily tiresome. No one has this much autonomy because society would be in chaos.<br /><br />Other tiresome tropes borrowed for this movie are: b/w ghosts (from the Devil's Backbone), dramatic scenes in inexplicably dark rooms (X-Files), TV-scaled emoting and the dreaded, pointless ShakyCam.
