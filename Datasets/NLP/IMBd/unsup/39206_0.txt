My Take: Good-looking and well-cast, but utterly tedious. <br /><br />I haven't read the book yet, and this is the only version of the novel that I have seen. This adaptation has its moments, but apparently too few than one might expect. Burt Lancaster delivers a wonderful performance, and so does the rest of the cast, but the film lags a bit too long. The make-up job on Richard Basehart and the other creatures are excellent, but doesn't show much to save some rather unimpressive moments.<br /><br />I'm sure H.G. Wells wouldn't roll on his grave with this since it is wonderfully fashioned, but it definitely not a classic like the first one, "The Island of Lost Souls", has become, but definitely worth a look for some fine performances, exotic locations and fine creature make-up. Also for those most in need of nap. <br /><br />Rating: ** out of 5.
