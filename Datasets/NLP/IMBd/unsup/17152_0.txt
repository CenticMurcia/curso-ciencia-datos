We bought this "disney treasure" and took it to our lake house to watch with our children over summer vacation.<br /><br />We will always remember the summer we watched the Mystery of the Applegate Treasure. We looked forward, each evening, to the next episode. So much fun. It is the end of the summer and they are still singing the theme song. I know it will be a sweet memory for years come. I wish there were more shows like this to experience together as a family. We ALL enjoyed it!<br /><br />With so much "junk" out there, it was so refreshing to watch something that both our children and ourselves could really enjoy.
