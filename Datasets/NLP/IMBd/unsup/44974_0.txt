Well, it said a rating of 1 meant "awful" and that's a pretty good adjective, but I'm giving it a 2 out of pity. These are nice people who are clearly not above telling their friends to spam this board, since the only two negative posts got modded down to the bottom of the list. So I figure if I'm lucky, I can at least make it to third from the bottom.<br /><br />Tivo put three of these episodes on my box before I watched any of them. The first one was bad, so I unsubscribed, and then the other two just sat there for a month. Then I watched one and it was so not funny I wanted to watch the last one I had out of the same fascination that makes you slow down to see if there's any gore at the accident that has made you sit in traffic for an hour.<br /><br />I want my hour back. Move along, there is nothing to see here. How bad was it? Bad enough to motivate me to come figure out some way to retaliate. Bad enough to make me get my arse off my couch, come into my home office, find the damn show on IMDb, REGISTER with the website, and spew out this little love note.<br /><br />And the other people are actors too, in spite of what the show and the fake posts here are claiming. A real guy expecting to have dinner with a "mystery celebrity" would just come right out and say, "Umm, who are you?"
