This movie brought to full and vivid life the powers of addiction. My girlfriend does not understand how strong addictions can be. My addiction is only to cigarettes, Thank God, but I still understand Jack's addiction. I have sold personal items and even looked in dumpsters to feed my addiction to cigarettes. That probably sounds pretty pathetic to you, but unless you know the power of an addiction, it would sound pathetic.<br /><br />If the gore could be toned down some, I bet this film could be used in drug rehab clinics and in schools to show exactly what drugs and addictions can do to people. After all, who in their right mind would want to wind up like our friend Jack? It was a cheap, low budget gore fest with a message. How many films can do that?
