While "Millennium" is not quite as lousy as "Plan 9 From Outer Space," it's botch, underdeveloped and unfocused script is. A fascinating concept is jettisoned for a hackneyed, illogical, inconsistent love story. Perhaps the major mistake was to have so much of it take place in the future (though, I would genuinely miss the sensitive, ironic and witty performance of Robert Joy as Cheryl Ladd's personal robot), if it weren't. The handling of the contemporary story is much better, and I did appreciate the subtle humor in both settings.<br /><br />SPOILER Just explaining the story is in itself a spoiler. Ladd's the head a crack team of female time travelers who pose as flight attendants on doomed flights in the past in order to abduct the passengers before the crashes. The future is a bleak, dying place. The human race is sterile and disintegrating from a harsh, polluted environment. Time travel is a dangerous business, and not just for the travelers. Any unguarded act can result in time paradoxes, which are felt as severe tremors in the future. Too large a paradox, and the entire human race of the future will be destroyed. Naturally, potential disaster occurs, when a device used to stun passengers before their abduction is accidentally left on two separate flights, one in 1963, the other in 1989. What is mind numbingly illogical is why the travelers did not return BEFORE the devices fell "into the wrong hands" and retrieve them? Instead, Ladd returns to the past in a failed attempt to seduce FAA investigator Kris Kristofferson and prevent him from discovering the device. The final stupidity occurs when Robert Joy tells Ladd she will have Kristofferson's child, after she has made it clear she is sterile. What follows is a pompous "Criswell-like" voice over that "this is not the end...this is the end of the beginning." Ed Wood couldn't have expressed it better.<br /><br />Too bad, because there are several fine performances in "Millenium," including Joy, Kristofferson and several of the supporting players. Ladd does her best (which is pretty good), but is ultimately defeated by an underwritten, paradoxical characterization.<br /><br />Production values are alternately handsome and cheesy. I'm not sure anything would have saved the script, but four or five more rewrites certainly would have helped.<br /><br />I give "Millennium" a "4".
