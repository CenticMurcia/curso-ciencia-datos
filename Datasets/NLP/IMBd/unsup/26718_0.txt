I dug this movie. It looks great, it takes chances, and it surprises you every now and then. The DVD has an alternate ending that is really trippy, too. I found the lead actress, Angel Boris, to be very appealing, beautiful in a racy, modern way. The actor who plays EZ was also excellent. He has a great drawl in his speaking voice, kind of a combination of Willie Nelson, Billy Bob Thorton and Wilford Brimley. There's a song in the soundtrack that he wrote and sings as well--talented guy. I also enjoyed the ski and snowboarding photography, and would have liked to see even more of it. I admire projects like this that don't fall into lockstep with every other predictable romance flicks.
