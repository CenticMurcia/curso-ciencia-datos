Well I've read the other comments, even checked out Roger Ebert, trying to find the reason for all the praise some people give it, but I can't get it. A story of people fighting with each other, murdering each other, commiting adultery, and worst of all mistreating the dogs that are essential for their survival, among the incessant crunching of snow under boots. This has to be considered a home movie and it leaves a lousy opinion of the Inuit people, which I know can't be this bad. Ebert says it involves somes legend, what that is I don't know.
