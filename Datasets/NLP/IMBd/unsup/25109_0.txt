I have rarely seen a movie where certain scenes run chills down my spine.<br /><br />One scene in particular is the one where Lillian, and Lewis, first encounter the Native Americans. They were so dynamically beautiful, as well an intimidating in their native costumes, and paint, and their horses were painted, and decorated to the hilt. This scene didn't only send chills up my spine, but much to the credit of Tab Murphy, it brought tears to my eyes, as also did other scenes in the movie.<br /><br />Yellow Wolf, who was played by Steve Reevis, was I think aware of the changing world beyond his own, and up until now the only way he could prevent the outside world from infiltrating his own was to do away with its representatives, Which meant of course killing them. Modern technology was advancing, and it was inevitable that they would be discovered in time, unless someone they could trust from the outside world could help them. As the story ended, I hoped that Lillian, and Lewis, would be the trusted folks from that outside world who would be able to help keep their existence hidden.<br /><br />A beautiful story with a beautiful cast. See it if you can. you won't be disappointed.
