Stunt C*cks is just one of the funniest things I have ever seen, so funny I cried with laughter and tightened every muscle in the lower regions of my body so as NOT to wet myself. Shot in "documentary" style, this film details the lives of Bill and Earl, two college friends who utilize their "gifts" to their advantage as Stunt C*cks... or Adult stunt doubles. Cameo appearances by Lou Diamond Phillips (who obviously appreciates a good laugh) and porn-star Ron Jeremy make this short even more surreal. This is definitely the kind of film you would show to all your friends the minute they walked in the door. Even those right of right would have to snicker at the "innocent and pure" matter of fact approach to the art of shooting a load. Damn funny!
