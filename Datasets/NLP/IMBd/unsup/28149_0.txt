This movie disturbed me to my very core. The acting is superb. The plot is very engrossing. Everything about this movie screams unbelievably well done and the makers of it should be extremely proud. This is the first Horror / Thriller were I actually felt for the characters. This is certainly the best film in its genera. This is also the reason why I wouldn't recommend watching it to most people... Watching this gives you a feeling as if you just accidentally killed your pet (worse actually)... It is far more horrifying then anything I have ever seen and the script makes it come to life which makes it even more terrifying....<br /><br />If you are looking for a horror movie and don't have heart problem then watching it should be a priority just expect to feel horrible afterwards...<br /><br />I can't believe this managed to get R rated in USA... I guess it is true that there are no censors for movies anymore...
