Why? Why did they make this movie! It's so predictable and bad that I switched of the TV after the first 15 minutes. But then I decided to finish watching and it was a disappointment! While the first movie was in my opinion great and I still watch it sometimes, the second one is a disaster! Thank God it was aired on TV and I hadn't bought a DVD (but I wanted). It would have been a complete waste of money! I didn't like the second Paige and I compared her with the amazing Julia Stiles. The thing about the "Book" was copied from "Princess Diaries", the main characters didn't have a chemistry, Paige's rival was sooooo bad!!!!! And the King and the Queen didn't resemble monarchs!!!! How could that possibly be!
