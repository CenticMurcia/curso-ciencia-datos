Its funny that movies coming out of Hollywood don't take the time to get familiar with standard military practices before making a movie taking place within the miliary. The same problem occured in that John Travolta movie last year. If a person is shot with a .45 or a .40 or even a 9 mm pistol with the barrel of the pistol touching the person's forehead, there will be more than just a hole in the victim's head. These are little things I know but each of these little things makes for an takes away from the story. The biography given at the end of the movie gives the pretense that this was a true story. I don't think I ever heard anything like this taking place. If it did, I am fairly certain that US relations with Mideastern countries involved would not be as relatively peaceful as they are. I can't say I enjoyed it. It was very slow and didn't have the tense moments of A Few Good Men. It also didn't have any humor to speak of. Something that SLJ and TLJ do fairly well. This movie could have needed some humorous times. I can't recommend it and I am a fan of both SLJ and TLJ.
