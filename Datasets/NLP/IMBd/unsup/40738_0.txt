I don't enjoy bad movies that make sad attempts at ripping off the popular genre of the time. Low Ball WISHES it was a Tarantino film ( a good Tarantino film not a bad one) but it's just a bad film filled with clich√©s, bad sound, bad acting, bad writing and BAD direction. I almost had a stroke during the scene where the Penthouse Pet (seriously) is tied to leather straps while a dominatrix whips her.<br /><br />It's shocking when junk like this gets made- there have to be one hundred worthy scripts out there that are better then this. I know that nobody sets out to make a bad film but one would think that at some point SOMEBODY would tell the "director" or the producer that they are making a disaster. When one thinks of good first films - Swingers for instance, you just have to realize that there is no excuse for this sort of embarrassment.<br /><br />Skip this.
