I gave this movie a two which is the exact age you would have to be to enjoy it. I am a huge fan of japanimation and animated features in general but this film(if that is what you call it)is just a lame attempt at selling merchandise to young kids. I went along with my seven year old thinking maybe there would be something in it I could enjoy. The animation itself was good, which is why I gave it a two, but after a few minutes the lack of substance made my wish it would end.
