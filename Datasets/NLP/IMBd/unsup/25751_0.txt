I had only recently become aware of this DVD as it was being advertised as containing missing footage from Game of Death. What an understatement watching this footage is just an incredible experience. That coupled with the documentary portion of this DVD truely gives us a better insight IMO into what Bruce was about, and the way he was trying to show us all.
