Different, incoherent Spanish film about a Caribbean mummy aboard a cruise ship killing people that remind him of those that killed him thousands of years earlier. At least I think that is what the main plot thread was? It is difficult to tell with the poor, hatchet-job editing, the cheap feel the film has, the dull, sophomoric direction, and the acting talent of washed-out understudies. The film opens with the mummy character when he was young and vibrant - we see him with his love, get in a fight over a girl, and then watch his girl beheaded in front of him and then he is "paralyzed" and prepared for mummification. The opening scene really is done so poorly that you really aren't sure of many of the character motivations. Many flashback scenes would be used throughout the film using that ever-so-clever red tinting(Ho...hmmmm). The budget is low in this one: the heads decapitated look like mannequin heads with animal blood caked around the necks. One scene where a dancer(she is the best part of the film in all of her buxom grandeur!)is wrestling with the mummy - we don't know why he wants to kill her - has the two fighting in front of a mirror and then shows the cameraman in the mirror shooting the scene. Many more examples of such amateurism can be found throughout. What did I like? The film is watchable and funny for its ineptitude. The mummy in the sarcophagus actually looks creepy at times. And did I mention that dancer? The end is an even bigger letdown than the film(as if that were even possible?). It is so ridiculous. As for the performers? Nothing too good. The guy playing the self-proclaimed "fat, old" cop waiting to retire is probably the best just for comic relief. The rest sub-par. Except for, did I mention already, the dancer?
