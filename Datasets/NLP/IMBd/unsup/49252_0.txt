I was so disappointed in this film. I am a fan of the three leads. I thought Carla Gugino carried the film. Aside from that Jimmy's relationship with Ruth was touching. The context of the film was so depressing and angry. I ask why not give some hope for Jimmy and why end it without any closure for Jimmy. I am still spiraling downward with Jimmy. Frank Whaley is so talented that I could not believe this came from him. I hope next time he writes and directs he goes in a different direction. Frank has the talent to be a leading man and we already know he is a very credible character actor. Good luck to him and he can't go wrong working with Hawke or Gugino again.
