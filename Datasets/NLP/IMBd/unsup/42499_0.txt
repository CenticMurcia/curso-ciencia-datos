Alright, three people have actually left positive reviews for this movie, and you can rest assured it was probably the director, the producer, and his wife. I suppose it's up to me to set the record straight. This movie is a piece of garbage. (You might suspect this from the fact that only 80 people have bothered rating it in the last 10 years) <br /><br />I'm not sure if this movie was the final nail in the long overdue coffin of Molly Ringwald, or just one of the many stepping stones in that direction. The main character, played by that guy who played the android in Aliens, has acting talent, but he's been set adrift in a sea of poor writing and poor supporting cast. No man is an island, and one actor can't pull off a whole movie by himself. <br /><br />The premise, as I remember it, is that Molly Ringwald's character has run away to the desert with her (REALLY painfully acted) loser boyfriend, who has 'accidentally' shot a drug dealer. Our ex-android friend is the hired killer sent to even up for the bad guys, and there's also a lot of time wasted on another character who is Molly Ringwald's (ex?) husband, who she doesn't want much to do with initially, and who can blame her, since this guy's an even worse actor than she is! <br /><br />There's relatively little action and no tension here, for a movie (kind of, maybe) about a hired killer. Most of the time is spent on listless acting, poorly delivered dialog and scenes meant to show how quirky and bizarre the personality of the hired killer is. And the killer is quirky, but so what? So is the drunk bum on the street mumbling to himself, and I didn't have to pay 5 bucks to watch.
