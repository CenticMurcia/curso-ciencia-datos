I love this movie!!! The depth of love and devotion John Harmon has and also the courage Eugene Braburn uses in defying society for love has makes me wonder what happened to the theory of romance. The theme of society verses love is an old one but always fascinating because it is a true choice. I like the many twists and turns of the story. Also every character has a part in this movie, whether it be for example purposes (the wedding of deception) or to tie in some further plot to the story. I am not usually a romantic movie watcher but I loved this one and I will always love this movie...I admire Dickens more than I thought I ever would....I would recommend those who love a good romantic story to watch this movie...
