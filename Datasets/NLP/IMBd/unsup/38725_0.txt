I literally signed up at this site just to knock this lame duck out of the water. I'm almost positive the person who wrote the review "Queer Duck Rules" had some hand in the production of this film, because this was just junk. I checked it out because I saw that it was written by a former Simpsons writer, and had Conan as a guest voice...how could that not be funny? But this film just completely lacked the flow of a proper comedy. There were a couple of decent jokes in the mess though, but I didn't actually laugh at any of them. I just kind of acknowledged that they were jokes in a "well, that's not bad" type of way. Nothing worth spending money on.<br /><br />In addition, the film kept on using sound effects after each joke...like a drummer in a nightclub. I guess to ensure that the audience understood which lines were jokes, and just about everyone came off looking bad. On top of all of this, the musical numbers were drawn out and tedious, which made them feel like nothing more than filler.<br /><br />This cartoon runs at about seventy-two minutes. I turned it off at about fifty minutes, and I actually felt ashamed that I wasted fifty minutes on it. That should tell you all you need to know right there.
