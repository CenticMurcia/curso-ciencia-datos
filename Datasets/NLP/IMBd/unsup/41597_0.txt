This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst movie of all time, and I've seen at least 30 of the bottom 100 here on IMDb. Manos has NOTHING on this movie. It's sadly unfunny. A craptacular knock-off off Bill & Ted (a master-piece in comedy, in comparison), which honestly is mostly funny because it was made quite some time ago and was sort of creative. This movie however is just extremely sad. THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT THIS MOVIE WHATSOEVER! I really tried finding it funny how bad it was, but alas, there was nothing funny to be found. Just give two ACTUAL 15-year-olds an expensive video camera, a crew, and dress them up in "funny costumes", and let them run around and act like douche-bags, and you've got this movie in a nut-shell, except more honest seeing as how they would actually be 15 years of age, instead of being a 30-something sorry excuse of an actor/comedian/whateverthe&"¤¤theyweretryingtobe.<br /><br />I'm sorry, this isn't debatable, this movie has absolutely nothing going for it. It is the pinnacle of awful. Avoid at all costs, or buy it and burn it.<br /><br />I'm sorry for writing this as a comment, I originally meant to post it in the forums but felt I needed to warn as many as possible about this film.
