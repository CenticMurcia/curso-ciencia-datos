The four points come from good cinematography, sound-production, and special effects.<br /><br />Nomore points from me... this was boring, predictable, used only clich√©s... hair, phone, somebody running out of focus...<br /><br />For serious horror-addicts nothing to be seen here. But I've seen worse...<br /><br />I didn't get scared at all... I like black metal, horrorcore, ... and other disturbing sh*t.<br /><br />OOOooohhooohhhohohohhohhh.... Oooohhohoh...<br /><br />Man the phone part just sux =D
