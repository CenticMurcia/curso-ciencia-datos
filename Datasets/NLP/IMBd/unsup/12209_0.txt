This really is quality film making - you can tell that both the crew and cast have put there all into this film - it's superb. It deals with a subject matter that many steer clear of, but this is done in a sensitive, realistic manner which makes you want to watch more and more of Sam's life. Shame Sean Penn didn't win any nominations, he really deserved them. One of the best films you'll see but remember your box of tissues...yes even the men!
