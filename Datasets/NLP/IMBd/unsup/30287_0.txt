Since a very young age, I have been an avid fan of Sonic games. From the Megadrive, up to the Playstation 2 games, I have played a wide range of the games. However, I have seen a dramatic decline in these games, as can be seen with some of the recent games. 2001, in my opinion, is the last time a great sonic game has been seen in the form of Sonic Adventure 2.<br /><br />This game, along with it's older brother, made up a significant part of my childhood, due to it's impressive graphical display, talented voice acting and innovative story. The characters were original, the replay value was high and the stages, while keeping a sense of the old game's traditions, were imaginative, especially the "City Escape" level. However, the aspect that gave me the most amusement had to be the Chao Gardens. I cannot understand why, but the idea, in my opinion, was genius, and was the part that I have missed most about this game. And that is what sets this apart from most other games, and is it's most memorable quality: when the Dreamcast, which I had this game on, "died" and my console fell into disrepair, I found something I have found with only one other game since: I began to mourn for the loss of the game, and began to miss it terribly. I can only hope that the game will be re-released on a more recent console.<br /><br />I'm finding it hard to find anything bad to say about this game, so I'll leave that to anyone who didn't like this game. All I shall say is this: Sonic Adventure 2. You are, and shall remain to be missed
