Apart from being full of colors and sweet melody, the cinematic opera falls short of achieving that true great flavour that one has come to savour out of the classic Javanese Dance dramas and Ramayana in particular. The dance style is Javanese, the singing and music too is Javanese, but at heart its a poor copy of western operatic genre. The body too is lacking and ultimately it seems to empty and devalue the otherwise fantastically rich Javanese tradition of its soul. I think in the long run, it comes down to the script which as it turns out is badly written and is in need of improvement. You cannot pull the opera simply by saying that it is a tribute to those who died at the hands of injustice. The script has to carry the intent otherwise in-spite of its colour, song and music it will fail. Embellishments don't take you far when it comes to poetic drama if the raga happens to be not in sync with the rasa.<br /><br />Sorry for such a harsh review. Maybe I was expecting too much out of it.
