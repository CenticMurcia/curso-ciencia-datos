Once again a supposedly pedigree-rich, topical comedy is anything but funny. This waste-of-time garbage is brought to us by director Edwards, but if "direction" is what he got handsomely paid to do on this dreck than the movie industry needs a new word for "direction." I'm not surprised he ALSO wrote this snoozer and gets his won separate "Story by" credit. What story? What script? This whole BOMB is nothing more than Sellers sheepishly sleep-walking through ninety-eight minutes in an unbelievably awful and offensive performance that is an unnecessary insult to the Indian ethnicity/nation/race.<br /><br />Would it have been so hard for Edwards, Sellers and/or the co-writer(s) to research the Indian culture a little bit and write some humor into the apparent cultural differences existing between the unexpected party guest and the Hollywood denizens? That would have been inspired and very funny, but the only LAME attempt made at borderline cultural humor is when the Sellers character tells the party's host daughter that painting an elephant with slogans like "Go Naked" is "embarrassing." The tinsel-town party guests BARELY interact w/ the Sellers character and Edwards passed up on another opportunity in this humorless film to poke fun at the movie industry as a whole and the Sellers' character unique duck-out-of-water predicament vis-a-vis the industry-types at the party. This movie is the kind of awful, unmemorable dreck Jerry Lewis was putting out that same decade. What is the Longet character in this movie for? The Gavin McLeod (whom I've spoke w/ at length and is very personable) is another sadly wasted character whose sole humor is derived from the fact he wears a loose toupee. This passed for funny in 1968? I don't get it! I was able to fast forward this movie halfway through right up to the end and there was nothing missed.
