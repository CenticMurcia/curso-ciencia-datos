From time to time I find a film that really stands out from the run of the mill standards that are dished up by producers and directors who lack the courage to move away from the usual formulae. This film is exceptionally good; the first few minutes had me hooked with the gritty realism of the places, people and scenarios presented. I genuinely cared about the outcome for the two main characters and I felt ashamed of my fellow humans at the more uncomfortable scenes. There's no doubt that some people will find the film just a little too harsh - this is a side of life that most of us are happy to pretend doesn't exist - but those who watch the film will be rewarded with great acting and direction.<br /><br />After seeing the film I was impressed enough to come to IMDb to learn more about it and I've been surprised to learn that it was made by newcomers on a tight budget. It has a very professional finish to it.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing.
