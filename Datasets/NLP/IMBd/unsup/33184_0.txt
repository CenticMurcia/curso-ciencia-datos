If you're interested in seeing this movie, don't. The only thing it does well is bore you half to death. There is no plot and no acting. I could forgive such grievances for a lot of slasher films, but you have to at least attempt to make it up some other way. This movie could have at least salvaged itself as a mediocre slasher if there was some gore and nudity. Unfortunately, there was neither. The vast majority of this movie is spent watching these silly kinds wander around and say dumb stuff to each other, with only one even remotely gory incident (and I use the term 'gore' lightly). There were also plenty of chances for both of the actresses to show their boobs on screen, but somehow they managed to pass it up. Boring, boring, and even more boring. And I'm not even going to get into the ridiculous plot holes or how incredibly lame the killer is, or how anticlimactic and contrived the climax is...
