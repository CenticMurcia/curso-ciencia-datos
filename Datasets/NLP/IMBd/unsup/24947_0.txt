BloodRayne isn't original nor is the most epic game you'll find in the market, however I like the execution of it and it's a fun ride from start to finish. You play Rayne( voiced perfectly by Laura Baily), a vampire on revenge for her family and a secret agent for the government during the World War II era.<br /><br />The game is full of superb game play and of course comes complete with a bullet time option that occurs temporarily.<br /><br />The one liners are funny and the design and scope of the game is dark and moody and gory. Should please those who love the Gothic/action genre.
