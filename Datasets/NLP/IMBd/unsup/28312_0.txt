I watch a lot of horror movies and this is one of the few movies I've seen in the past year or two that actually scared me multiple times. And I was into it and entertained the whole way though. Yes is is VERY low budget but that does not equal bad. Considering it was shot in I believe ten days in the director's friend's and mother's house they did an amazing job! I would love to see what this writer/director as well as his co-editor and cinematographer could do with some millions of dollars. I hope someone gives it to them. Jillian Byrnes has a lot of potential as well. I await the next project and plan to check out the many plugs included in the commentary.
