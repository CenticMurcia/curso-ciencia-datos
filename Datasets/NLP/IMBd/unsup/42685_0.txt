I had high hopes for this, as I thought the original was very innovative. Here, we get more of "kind of" the same, but not always. First, I thought the premise from the first movie was that in order to save yourself, you had to make a copy of the videotape. <br /><br />***POSSIBLE SPOILER***<br /><br />I'll have to go back & review that part, because that wasn't necessarily what was implied in this film.<br /><br />There were some very good scenes, especially the one involving deer (although I have to say, at one point I was reminded of the deer scene in "Without a Paddle", where a deer suddenly seems like he's growling at the actors!). Still, many things just didn't add up.<br /><br />***SPOILER***<br /><br />When Aidan leaves the hospital, that's the last we see of any hospital involvement. They have a sick child missing & a dead doctor, & no one comes to the house looking for him or his mother?! It's like they introduced the hospital scenes solely to have Rachel accused of child abuse, & then they just drop the point.<br /><br />Also, the whole premise of the first movie was that it was watching the videotape that caused death. Yet, other people die without having seen the movie. If Samara was that powerful, why did she wait so long to come after Rachel & Aiden? I thought Sissy Spacek was great (but then, she usually is), almost unrecognizable in fact. All in all, first half of the movie was very good, lots of tension; it just didn't seem to be able to sustain the plot or the horror. I give it a 4.
