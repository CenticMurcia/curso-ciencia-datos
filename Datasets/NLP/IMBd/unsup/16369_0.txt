How this movie could have been left out of the top 100 flicks of all time I will never know. I remember Keaton as a grumpy old man in the cinema of the 50's and 60's. It was only later when in college film school that I recogized his true genius. The General was one of the first silent movies that I was ever able to sit though long enough to fully appreciate the medium. It had everything, drama, comedy, action, romance. It was also pretty much true to the real event also. My favorite part is when Keaton has rescued the train and his girlfriend and they are escaping the federal troops in full pursuit. His girlfriend having run out of wood to stoke the engine hands him a twig. Keaton looks at the twig and thinks about hitting the girlfriend but instead hugs and kisses her. The other thing that I love about the movie is that there is not one second of wasted film, every scene has definite purpose and it holds your attention every minute. This is Keaton's masterpiece always.
