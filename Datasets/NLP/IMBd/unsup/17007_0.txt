a madman has stolen two nuclear warheads and threatens to detonate them over a populated area if his demand for money is not met.that's the gist of the story.it stars John Travolta,Christian Slater,Samantha Mathis and Delroy Lindo,to name a few.it's a pulse pounding thriller from John Woo(mission Impossible 2).there's obviously a lot of action,and suspense,and the movie goes right down to the wire.John Travolta is good,as is Christian Slater,but i really liked Samantha Mathis,who i feel is and underrated actress.the action scenes are are exhilarating,though admittedly over the top.but for thrills,you can't beat it.for me,Broken Arrow is an 8/10
