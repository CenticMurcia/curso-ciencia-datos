Entertaining and intelligent story behind this Latino legend.<br /><br />Great film-making also! I definitely recommend this film.<br /><br />It stayed clear of silly stereotypes.<br /><br />The story was interesting.<br /><br />The directing and acting was great.<br /><br />Looks like a big budget film, even though it wasn't a Hollywood film.<br /><br />It jumps into interesting cultural issues.<br /><br />And the director and writers isn't afraid to bringing up societal taboos. A must see.<br /><br />I grew up with the legend.<br /><br />It scared me then.<br /><br />This movie also scares me.
