This surreal descent into madness begins with a cameraman desperately longing to discover an unseen fear that had apparently caused a man's public suicide. A hike down into Tokyo's subterranean maze of tunnels leads him to a chained up girl, concealed in a small crevice in some kind of fantasy world. He brings her home and begins to study her animal-like behavior while his life takes a bizarre turn for the worst. He begins receiving mysterious phone calls concerning the girl and develops a perverted pleasure when he realizes that she will only consume blood. I have to say, this movie left me rather baffled and disappointed. I guess, the fact that the main character is insane might be enough of an excuse to push the bizarre factor to the extreme, but when a movie makes as very little sense as this one did, I cannot recommend it. What a mess!
