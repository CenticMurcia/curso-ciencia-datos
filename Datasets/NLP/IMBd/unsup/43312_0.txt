really, a comment by nnnn45089191 is exactly what this movie is, <br /><br />Right-wing propaganda of the 50's Author: nnnn45089191 from Norway<br /><br />Most of the views here are from western countries, where people had tunnel vision of what china was about in the 1950s. propaganda is a universal tool used by Germans, Japanese, Americans, Chinese, English, in fact all government in that chapter of earth's history.<br /><br />the movie didn't even try to depict the real environment in china, having westerners dressed in feudalism period Chinese costumes and speak cantonese (mandarine is the official Chinese language and cantonese is only spoken in one Chinese province - canton) is just hilarious. And it also shows how desperate the film producers are trying to convey the story, no matter how unprofessional the movie looks.<br /><br />and when the "Chinese navy" fired, the battleship officers were speaking cantonese too... and Chinese army had absolutely no such fire power in the 1950s. <br /><br />if you don't get the hang of this, try imagining this way, 1. American's war against the native indians, 2.a bunch of white Americans dressed like indians, speaking a minority Indian language poorly 3.indian army's fighter jet rains death<br /><br />really, the film makers have no idea what china really is and they clearly showed no intention of even trying to convey the true image... the whole story was a make up.<br /><br />u really need to ask, what is it that they want to achieve by making such a film.<br /><br />i think they just want to evilize the Chinese communist government (they may be or not be, now their people are manufacturing for the world), like what GW Bush did to the old iraq regime whom was once supported by the USA government itself.
