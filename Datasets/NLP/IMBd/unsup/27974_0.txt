We held the screening of this film as an event to honour these amazing kids that are around now. The film did an excellent job of introducing the concept into a wider audience than the regular spiritually minded people who would probably have known about this stuff. Some of the scenery was stunning and the story line spoke to every father, mother, daughter,son who has been part of a family system wrecked by emotional unavailability of the members. The influence which Grace had in helping heal these rifts was very real. I am a father of 6 children who also abandoned my older children due to obsessive work and alcohol addiction before I eventually 'woke up'. Then my wife and I were blessed with one of these Indigo's (our little son David) and a 'Crystal' (our daughter Rachel). I now realise that their energies were partly responsible for bringing my wife and I to awakening and now the whole family has healed. After the movie our 25 year old son, who has recently left the Army, gave me a giant hug for the first time in his adult life and said, 'Dad, I didn't know what all this stuff was about that you got into when you changed your life around until this movie and event has shown me and I am very proud of you'. That real life situation shows the power of this movie for those who are ready to receive its blessings. Well done to all the team at The Beloved Community for putting it all together!.
