Robot Chicken puts an adult twist on all the shows I loved as a kid, like GI Joe, Thundercats, Transformers, and Star Wars, but also makes fun of newer shows like That 70's Show (with the voices of the actors from the actual show), Kill Bill, and reality shows like The Real World.<br /><br />Each episode is very short, lasting less than fifteen minutes. They include many scenes, some as short as two seconds and some that last for a few minutes. Because this is stop animation, you can pause the DVD and watch each frame to see how it changes, and in some scenes the creators throw in something that you can't see when it's played at normal speed.<br /><br />If you're too in love with your childhood, don't watch this show as this is not for children or people who wish they were still children. The show includes dark and sexual humor, alcohol and drug use, and a lot of animated violence.<br /><br />Things I would like to see the creators do is have a battle between Vultron and Power Rangers and have the Adams Family fight it out with the Munsters.
