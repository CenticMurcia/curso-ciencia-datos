Tom is spending the day at the seaside with his girlfriend and is trying hard to impress her, as usual. But Jerry has stowed away inside the picnic basket and does everything he can to torment him while scoffing the food for himself. You might find this cartoon very, very similar to the more popular Muscle Beach Tom from the 1950s. But this one came first.<br /><br />There are some very funny painful tricks played on Tom, but they do get a little tiresome after a while. But most of them work. Highlights include Tom drinking some very sandy tea and chewing his own broken teeth. How this is physically possible I don't know. But it's funny.
