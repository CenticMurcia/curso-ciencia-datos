THE PLOT: A divorced mother of two (Hawn), who coaches a high school girl's track team, decides she wants to live out her dreams by coaching football instead. Unfortunately the only football job she can find is with a losing boys team in a tough inner city high school.<br /><br />THE NEGATIVE: This is a very uninspired, by the numbers 'feel good' sports movie. There actually seems to be more drama here than comedy and what little comedy you get really isn't very funny. Having a woman coach a boy's football team would be enough of a challenge, but forcing her to do it in a tough inner city school seems extreme and unnecessary. The player's are all one dimensional and uninteresting. Even Hawn's character is dull although Hawn herself is still fun to watch. The climactic game sequence is so predictable and full of clich√©s that it becomes almost excruciating. The film is also plagued by having that very annoying 80's music sound.<br /><br />THE POSITIVE: It is fun to watch Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson in their film debuts. It is also fun to see Nipsey Russell although they don't give him enough to do. He looks like he was only 38 even though, at the time, he was actually 68! Incredibly large actor Thad Thacker is also fun and the only interesting player on the whole team. His acting is nothing exceptional, but his 'con-man' routine is still amusing. Actor James Keach, who plays the stereotypical 'jerky' ex-husband, ends up giving a surprisingly sturdy performance.<br /><br />OVERALL: This film is extremely dull and predictable and is hardly good for even a few cheap laughs. Why some people think this is so funny is beyond me because everything that is done here has been done better somewhere else.<br /><br />THE RATING: 3 out of 10.
