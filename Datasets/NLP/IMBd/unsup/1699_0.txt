I'd have to say that this is easily my favorite movie of all time. it's a terrific parody of the inner workings of Hollywood, and it's backed up my absolutely amazing animation and special effects by Mr. Jittlov, who also does a wonderful job as the main character (himself), and the police dog. The producer does a good job acting as the producer (as he should!).<br /><br />Summary: See it! you'll like it! i promise.
