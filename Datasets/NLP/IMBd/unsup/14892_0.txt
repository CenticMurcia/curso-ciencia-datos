A message movie, intended to bring home to those lucky enough to have seen it exactly the things that have made so many squirm while watching it. To those who object to the romance tied around it, how else could you get something of such expanse made? Hollywood has used romance as the drawing card to fill the seats for message movies for almost 100 years now..."Hearts of the World" comes to mind. Hopefully in 85 years this will be viewed as a triumph like that movie is! I saw in one review someone take exception to "having a child only to leave it behind". As a Vietnam era veteran, I object, as I am sure do all those men and women before and since who have left a child to serve; for someone "called" to do relief work, if anything it's a bigger gesture, as they don't have someone telling them they have to go!
