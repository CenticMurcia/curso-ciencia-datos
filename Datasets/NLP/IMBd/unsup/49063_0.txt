Can't believe no one used that summery line yet. I'm hilarious. Anyway onto the skimpy plot. A teen and her friends have a 'bitchin' slumber party. When their boyfriends stop by it's fun fun fun. Well until a killer with a drill bit shows up to menace them. Not the best slasher film I've seen by a long shot, but it does have a certain appeal to undiscriminating b-grade horror fans, myself included. Just not enough to raise it above a slightly below average slasher film.It IS however better then the first film in the franchise.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Maria Ford reveals boobs, Lulu Wilson bares her chest and ass (Sadly this is the only movie she's been in) <br /><br />My Grade: C+
