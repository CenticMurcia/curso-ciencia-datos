Well let me start off by saying they should have called this movie "Blue Balls". I found this tape while cleaning out my garage(must have been my dad's or something, I respect him much less now knowing he would watch some weak garbage like this). The summary on the back sounded hilarious, so I decided to give it a go. The tape was in pretty poor shape and it took over an hour just to get it to work. Boy was I in for a big letdown. I have seen some bad soft-core in my time, but this is the most god-forsaken bunch of crap I've ever seen. I felt corrupted by the soul-crushing message behind the movie, yet I wasn't even able to get my rocks off. It would take a remarkable imagination to be able to shoot one out to this movie. Time after time, the clothes come off, the girls are making out, you see a little fur-burger here, a little whisker-biscuit there(just frontal, no open clam), and just when it looks like the chicks are going to get down to some serious munching, it just cuts to some worthless clip of them cuddling after they had "made love", whatever the hell that is. Funny the chicks name is Alaine Cunny and yet there really isn't any of that. I just wanted to see some good ol' chowing of the muff, but this movie provides nothing, but some blue balls. Even a convict wouldn't enjoy this. This is more like torture. We should just play this movie over and over again for the prisoners at Gitmo if we want to torture them. SO if you want to see some chicks chompin' down on the neden, this ain't the movie. Even if your back is against the wall, don't waste your load on this one, just wait for a wet dream.
