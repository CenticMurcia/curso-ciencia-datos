At first I didn't know what to expect from this film. I began watching it with the mistaken conclusion that it was nothing more than a drama. So, naturally, I was surprised when it began to show trappings of a fantasy. But it won me over, mainly with it wonderful "Come over by the fire and hear a story" feeling.<br /><br />It's almost a miracle that the film succeeds as well as it does. If the film had been Americanised, it would have been a disaster. The fact that all (or nearly all) of the cast is Irish greatly lends to a feeling of authenticity. Most of the actors have hardly had any experience on film, either.<br /><br />On the technical side is the expert direction of John Sayles, and the great Haskell Wexler handling the cinematography. Simply a very good film, and nearly without flaws.<br /><br />8.8 out of 10
