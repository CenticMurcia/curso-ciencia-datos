When I went to see this movie I was under the impression it was a John Waters film. It is not , but could have been one of his movies. Best scene ever an attractive girl singing a song and throwing up after almost every line..lol. When I went to look about info on the actors on this film I noticed it was almost all first time actors...AMAZING with this brilliant, brilliant cast. GREAT SONGS, and I even cried when the fat black gril sang a song to express to her angry dad that she is fat and that is who she is. Brilliant 10/10
