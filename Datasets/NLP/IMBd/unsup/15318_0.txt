Wow! i just caught this movie on a TV channel. This is absolutely an unmeant masterpiece! The story is as useless as it should be in a decent horror film. In the late 70's Mr Bones does not want to be a dealer, gets killed and goes get revenge 20 years later (for reasons still unknown to men). Ironically the house he is killed in is sold to the kids of one the guys that kills him. He regenerates from having a dog kill people and eat crap and then goes to get revenge on his killers. so far so good, it sounds as a crap horror movie should be.<br /><br />But having Mr Snoop Dogg playing a pimp in the 70's (in flashback scenes) and a murdering pimp in the 90's is so ridiculously cool it hurts. Even though the whole movie doesn't make ANY sense at any point, it's just cool to see Mr Dogg in a pimp outfit. Also the pun of having two token white kids getting killed in the first minute, the cheesy red colour of the blood, the totally unfitting comic relief of 2 talking heads and all skanky girls in the movie being played by white chicks makes this an absolutely excellent movie! I admit, i have a taste for bad movies. Horrible sci-fi and 80's action movies are a must-see in my opinion, it's cheap laughs! this movie is fitting for that so amazingly i'm getting the DVD tomorrow and organizing a 'movie nite' next week to show this (together with 'Alien Sex Party') to some friends. Hilarity guaranteed! So, get a case of beer, some illegal, mind altering substances and a few good buddies that can appreciate bad movies and have a blast with this Snoop Dogg gem! Oh, and the probably totally unmeant Fatboy Slim homage was the cherry on the cake. A DJ kid wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat (as does Mr Slim in the 'Rockafeller Skank' video) asks another DJ 'can you do a solo performance, i need some time off right about now, funk soul brother'. Comedy gold, right there.
