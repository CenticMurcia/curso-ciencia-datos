This probably looked really good on paper. An agoraphobic girl finds out that she's living in a haunted house. I guess that's one way of solving the age-old question for haunted house movies, "Why don't they just leave?" The problem is that the protagonist is completely unengaging. I don't know any agoraphobics. Well, I guess I wouldn't, would I? But it does make it pretty difficult to relate to your main character when she's kinda crazy to begin with. That, on top of the poor video quality and the fact that it quickly turns into a run of the mill haunted house story make it a misfire. It just goes to show you, and interesting tagline doesn't necessarily make an interesting movie.
