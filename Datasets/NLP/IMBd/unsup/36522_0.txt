This was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, and even now I am amazed that I watched it the whole way through. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. From the start to the end, it was one big clich√©, extremely predictable with not one surprise in the entire film. From the over the top ridiculous boyfriend of Dawn and the wedding in the pie shop, the wife of the doctor being in the delivery room. I even found the scene where the husband finds the money and wants her to tell him it's for a present for him to be offensive to the many women who live with abusive husbands, as it made him more of a joke than the cruel character that an abusive husband is.<br /><br />And the main character lacked any depth. <br /><br />And the obvious flaws, like the doctor saying he was going to do an epidural when she was obviously way past the time when one is possible. The delivery had no sense of realism.<br /><br />This movie was just plain lousy.
