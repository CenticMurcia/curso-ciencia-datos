When you look back on the eighties break dancing and graffiti movies there are a handful of movies that should be a required viewing. If you want to see a bad break dancing movie, then check out Breakin. <br /><br />What makes this movie so bad is the fact that is just really missed the mark of capturing the essence of breaking. It was more of an attempt to crossover to a larger audience outside of the urban community. It may have succeeded reaching a larger audience but it really does not connect with the hardcore breaking audience.<br /><br />If you are looking for good 80's Hip Hop movies check out Beat Street, Wild Style, Krush Groove, Berry Gordy's Last dragon and please leave this on the shelf.<br /><br />Without being politically correct this movie is really gay. the gayest part has to be John Claude Van Damme in the opening scene wearing some tight black spandex.
