The fact that this movie was remade, that is. There are only two simple facts for this: either this movie is one bad remake or the first one just sucked to start with. I won't know until I see the original will I, but, presuming the story is pretty much the same I have trouble getting why the later was so infamous. There were no real surprises, everything was obviously clear from the start. The only thing this movie has going for itself is Stallone's cool beard, some nice chicks(Rhona Mitra is breathtaking) and some cool music. The rest is a puzzle of mostly boring action, bad story pace and one liners Stallone's character has to use twice just to show how dumb and uninventive he is. Oh, also a really bad performance by Alan Cumming and some scenes which include Stallone's love interest that have no sense and point to them or the movie at all. 4/10
