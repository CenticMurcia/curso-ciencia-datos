I expect more from Full Moon, one of the better direct-to-video companies. The toys LOOK like they have a hand in them controlling their movements and actions, and you can clearly see the cord attached to the delivery boy when he is "thrown" back by the goofy-looking bear-toy-monster. Not very good at all.
