The problem with this movie wasn't in the story. This was, I felt, a very touching story about a man who chooses to stay with his wife even after a miscarriage (when the whole reason for the marriage was the pregnancy). A sappy testament to the power of love, the director (John Laing) had a perfect story for the Lifetime channel, especially since it was based on a true story. The acting was good enough, and being shot in New Zealand, the scenery was beautiful. The film failed, I believe, on the fact that the way in which the story was told would have made a great TV show, perhaps done over two weeks, or, if all at once, with some commercials to break it up. It was, unfortunately, a feature length film, and I think there needs to be a difference, and in this there was none. Rating: 18/40
