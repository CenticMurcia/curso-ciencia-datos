This show was always a favorite. And now I'm collecting the DVDs. I would much rather watch reruns of this show on the DVDs than most of the garbage that is on the tube now! The realism in the show during the rescues really made you feel like you were there, and the combination of drama and comedy was handled really well. It is so interesting to watch the show as it developed over the years. This show was definitely the basis for the better dramas that came later, and I am sure it convinced many people to become paramedics. If I have one complaint about the show, it would be the lack money spent on many of the special effects, but that is understandable considering the budgets for TV shows at the time.
