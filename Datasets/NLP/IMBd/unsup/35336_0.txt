I'm in my teenage rebellion, and I think all the civilization suck, let add some biblical sheet, some cheap cultural references, mix it with BEAUTIFUL animation, the same robot-sheet with human love, some kinda sensitive stuff and a title that will kick ass.<br /><br />Metropolis (2001). Fritz Lang is just base jumping in the cemetery...<br /><br />The thing I hated the most - apart of the lame of this - so called - movie - is the music. It's just SO FAKE !!! It's obvious that the guy who decided to put light jazz music was thinking that THIS will be the **special** thing of the movie, that THIS will make this movie cult, special, gosh I'm just so angry I've lost two hours of my life...<br /><br />See it if you like cheap-o pseudo philosophy, or else, go buy a book.
