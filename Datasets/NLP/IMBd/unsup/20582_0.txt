This movie is totally pathetic! Don't waste your time. The werewolf costume looks like a cheap team mascot and the actors (if you can call them that)are less talented than any that you would find in a high school play.It seems that for most of the movie the actors are just sitting in the woods smoking weed and talking about the sex that they have had or that they are going to get. The actors appear to be more afraid and spooked by one another than by the werewolf mascot and there is a great deal of unnecessary screaming. I spent the entire movie rooting for the werewolf to kill them all. this movie truly deserves one of the top spots on the "Worst films ever made" list. It appears to have been filmed with a home video camera. This flick is nothing but pure punishment. TIRED to the core!!!
