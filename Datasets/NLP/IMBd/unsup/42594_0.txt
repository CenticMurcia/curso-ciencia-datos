Starts OK. But... Then all goes downhill. Reminds me too much of the Swedish TV series (3 parts) 'Dödspolare'. I do not want to spoil the plot, far from! But if you like films where bad turns to worse only to end at...<br /><br />The movie hits rock bottom, and starts to dig.<br /><br />The only positive I can post is; Jack performs excellently! As always!<br /><br />If you like this kind of movie, you must see 'Dödspolare'!
