Blue Car is an interesting movie for our times. I left the movie with much to think about. Initially, I thought better for it. However, in the end I could not get over the fact that the lead character does illegal acts voluntarily and without any regrets later. Somehow the audience is expected to forget such bad choices and feel empathy or sympathy. The movie does portray a world that is now so very complicated in the raising of children, but the writer needs to move beyond mere events and situations. Young people growing up in even the worst conditions have made heroic efforts that are more deserving to have their stories told.
