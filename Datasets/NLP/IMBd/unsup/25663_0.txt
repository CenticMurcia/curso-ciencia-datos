This is my favorite movie of all time! My husband is patient with me, and allows me to use much of the duologue from the movie as repartee.All the performances are first rate and the writing is sharp and biting. Many American conventions are held up to the light in this movie. Family values, teenage sex, mid-life crises, employment, immigration,neighbors, being stalked by large animals, its all there. The absolute best piece of prop comedy of any movie, even Buster Keaton's, is when Beldar chews the condom and then blows it up. And the great non-reaction from Sinbad makes it even funnier.Michael McKean is one of the all time versatile actors(check him out as the pool boy in Earth Girls Are Easy) and he gives a classic performance here.
