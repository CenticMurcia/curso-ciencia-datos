I like the film, not because it is on love or it is funny, but because it tell a story of mutual dependence of the characters. Alice love all others in her family, though the feeling to everyone is different, but they are all deep and long lasting. the feelings are not thunder like, but like a spring rain. they just need each other, so Wilbur stop trying to kill himself and learn to take care of Alice and her daughter. but I don't know why it is described as a comedy, for it contains very few funny scenes, to some one, it is moving. so if it takes another genre, it would have different audience and they will have quite different opinion to the film.
