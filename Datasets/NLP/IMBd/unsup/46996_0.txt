I saw this film while in Europe, and was extremely unimpressed. The characters are wooden, the acting painfully amateur, and the story uninteresting. The plot involves a group of spoiled, aimless British twenty-somethings that do nothing but hang out and play in a 'garage band' thanks to the wealth of an orphaned megalomaniac friend. We soon find the lack of a father figure drives the ambition of this wealthy peer to ruin all of his friend's lives in an attempt to make them a marketable musical enterprise. He drives one friend to become an improbable drug dealer/addict, and emotionally torments several girlfriends. Dominated by this troubled youth, the other friends flail and fret their way through to success or failure. The sappy, stupid soap-opera script is not saved by the actors, who give performances better suited to television dramas like Eastenders. It is rare you run across a film where you could care less what happens to the characters or what will happen next on screen. Best save you time for other pursuits than watching GMT.
