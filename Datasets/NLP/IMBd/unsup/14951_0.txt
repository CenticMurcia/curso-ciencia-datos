STUPID! I think when they rank the worst 100, it should be done relative to the film's budget. If so, Air Force One should qualify. The story is completely asinine. The characters all behave recklessly and ridiculously. Only the redoubtable Jurgen Prochnow manages to come out of this mess with his dignity intact. <br /><br />Harrison Ford is the least Presidential-acting US President ever to appear on film -- and that includes the likes of Polly Bergen, John Ritter, and Donald Pleasance. Gary Oldham is every cold-war caricature mixed together, then run amok, all wrapped up in a preposterous accent, overblown mannerisms, and a maniacal laugh. Xander Berkeley's stunt was almost as impossible as his wooden performance. Paul Guilifoyle is the most disloyal and ignorant Chief-of-Staff ever depicted. Wendy Crewson is doing a nothing job, and does less with it. <br /><br />The pacing is so painstakingly slow, it was hard to believe this was an action movie. The special effects were labored and cumbersome, and the score was a near-perfect parody of action movie scores.<br /><br />I had to write all this because IMDB no longer accepts four-line reviews. If they did, I simply would have written: STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID, etc.
