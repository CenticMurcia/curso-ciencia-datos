I must admit I am a fan of Shelley Long. I believe she's a truly talented comedy actress. However, not even her greatest endeavours could help save this truly awful movie. Don't get me wrong, it has some strong points, but these are generally swamped by poor acting, poor script and poor direction. Long's incessant clumsiness was both unfunny and irrelevant. The script seemed to be a minefield of cliches and dull one-liners. The direction as a result appears dramatically effected by this, but surely could have improved some of the scenes. The plot also hovers between scientific miracle and occult fantasy, when perhaps one approach would have sufficed. Long's trickery of her friend near the end, although cleverly "acted", was lame and contrived. I'm so disappointed to write this. Please, please, please (to the producers) don't ever make a movie like this again. And finally....how much money did it lose?
