This was one of my favorite films at the Santa Fe Film Festival. Director Connell presents us with a broad cast of dreamers and misfits. His sympathetic look at these ambitious and under-appreciated performers is moving and genuine.<br /><br />As a person who has been knocking at Hollywood's doors for years I found myself a little frustrated by the film -- are my dreams folly? -- but ultimately the message of the film has nothing to do with the sometimes ridiculous ambitions of its struggling protagonists but more with the importance of pursuing a dream, come what may. <br /><br />I was encouraged once to find out what I was crazy about and pursue it like a madman. Strictly Background shows us a group of die-hards who are doing just that - and their determination is inspiring. <br /><br />The movie will also change the way you watch movies. After watching the film it takes a long time to watch a movie without noticing the background -- is that a good thing? Sure, there are no parts that do not contribute to the whole.
