I found this movie to be up there in my top 5 worst movies I've seen. Whereas Hercules in New York (one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's first films) can pass it off as being an amusing look at Arnold's struggle to grasp the English language and succeed in being funny, the Muse is trying to be funny and failing badly.<br /><br />It's Hollywood clap-trap at its worst. Sharon Stone is uninspiring in attempts to form some kind of character as one of the main protagonists in the movie. Jeff Bridges is disappointing as well. Albert Brooks is a pain to watch, almost cringe-worthy, his character seems to be a personification of himself which isn't a good thing.<br /><br />This film seems like it was written by someone who obviously had writers block until they suddenly thought they'd write a film about writers block. Confusing? Well maybe I could have worded that better but it's a film about nothing much in particular, it goes nowhere and the jokes are very weak.<br /><br />I found myself waiting for the film to end and when it ended I was half in the mind to return the film to the video rental store and demand my money back!<br /><br />Well you have my thoughts on this now.
