"I Capture the Castle" is a coming-of-age flick (circa 1930) about a 17 year old English girl whose family takes up residence in a castle. A delightfully lyrical tale, the film spends time with the eccentric father suffering from terminal writer's block, the step-mother who likes to romp in the altogether, a sister who marries Cassandra's love, a handyman/boy who loves Cassandra, and sundry other characters. Humorous and plaintive, whimsical and surly, but always romantic, "...Castle" is a chick flick which scored well with males and critics as well. Worth a look for anyone into English period films about the awakenings in a young woman and unrequited love. (B+)
