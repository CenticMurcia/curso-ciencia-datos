This is the worst movie I've ever seen! I ve been reading these reviewers who are cediting this movie and none of them seem to be judging the movie itself. They're all giving their own assessment on how they feel about the incident. <br /><br />This film has got nothing to do with a battle of any kind. It is a short story about two al qaeda cooperatives who plant a road side bomb, blow up one American jeep and kill one American! The Americans then take it upon themselves to kill four innocent by-standers who are in the wrong place at the wrong time while the two cooperatives responsible easily get away between two houses, shooting behind their backs as they run. The Marines then go on a rampage, killing the occupants of three houses; women and children, all unarmed of course. And thats it! There is no exchange of gunfire, there is no military strategy. It therefore cannot be considered to be a "Battle" and the title, no more than a marketing ploy.<br /><br />The acting is bad, the directing is worse. The filmic conventions of this type of genre are completely ignored; using Blare Whitch stlye photography and relying on video diaries in a vain attempt to acquaint the audience with the characters. If anything this makes the film more unrealistic.<br /><br />If you expect something on the lines "Black Hawk Down" then look the other way. There's not enough content in this story to produce something of the same calibre even if the director and writer knew what they were doing and this wasn't a low budget production (which it clearly is).
