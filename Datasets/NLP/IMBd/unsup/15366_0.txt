Kingpin has some of the worst writing of this genre. The dialogue is insipid. How the critics compared this miniseries to the Sopranos or even Shakespeare is unbelievable. For a superior show watch The Shield. I hope they do not pick up this series and reward utter dreck. Obviously studio hacks are giving this show the great reviews.
