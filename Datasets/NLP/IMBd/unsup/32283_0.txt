OK, I can't say it's the masterpiece, but surely one of the OK movies that were released in the post-Yugoslavian era. the plot: syphilis appears in the small Yugoslavian army unit on the border with Albania and a soldier-doctor is forced to visit lieutenant's wife to send her his regards, but he falls in love with her... but the main problem in this film is bad adaptation from novel of Ante Tomic to scenario... so we see a lot of lack of motivation and when the comedy is turned into tragedy we can't understand why. it had potential to be a very very good movie, but still it's very good directed. i liked using the symbols of the sea and the lake. main actor is excellent. and the end. the bloody end of one country... that is shown in a very poetic and peaceful way. the way that we'd like it happened in reality.
