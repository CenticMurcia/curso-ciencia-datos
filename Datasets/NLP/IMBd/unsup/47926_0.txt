My GOD ... I find Ethel Merman as likeable as the next person, and her semi-grating voice much more endearing than annoying. And the woman could even act. But this bit of Irving Berlin fluff was SO pointless and silly that it might have been conceived by a five-year-old!<br /><br />Apart from a few (a very few) witty lines and Marilyn Monroe's "buh-die-YAM-a-sewious-actwess" scenes, and of course a Berlin score that is, at worst, musically interesting, I found myself rolling my eyes at random leaps in time and logic, underwhelming characterization and some of the worst editing I've ever seen in feature film. This eye-rolling occurred, by the way, when I wasn't closely examining my much-more-interesting cuticles.<br /><br />If you get off on observing American cinema wallow in the very waste and self-aggrandizement that gave rise to the modern horror film, pick this one up. If George Romero saw "Show Business" in his youth, I'm sure he also imagined that only four zombies chasing Ethel and her brains could nudge the dreck back toward reality.
