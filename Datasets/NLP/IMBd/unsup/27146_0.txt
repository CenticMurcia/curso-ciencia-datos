An absolute waste of time for everyone involved(or should that be implicated), disgracefully boring, terrible in terms of plot, with characters being introduced, not even given a name, and not going anywhere, chubby cops doing Kung Fu, hilarious dialog ("I'm a private dick") and the worst sin of all, uninspiring fights.<br /><br />The worst of it is, Eric Lee can actually be quite amusing, see his supporting roles in the first two 'Ring of Fire' movies, but here he proves that a leading man he is not, Gerald Okamura, one of these guys who seems to be a henchman in every martial arts film ever, is wasted as the titular villain with bad makeup.<br /><br />The story concerns some nonsense about a warrior fighting the master demon, being killed, but not before he cuts off the demon's hand and takes it to a temple where it is stowed away, until the box containing it is displayed at a museum, only to be stolen by Art Camacho(one of the worst directors in the history of history) and all hell breaks loose, with the warrior(possibly reincarnated, it never really says) recruiting the aforementioned chubby cop and 'Private Dick' to help him save the Earth, or space or something, the plot, if you want to call it that, isn't exactly good, or even competent.<br /><br />A boring, poorly made pile of pish that nobody in their right mind wants to watch.
