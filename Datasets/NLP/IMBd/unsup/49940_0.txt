Double Take is a film that makes you wonder how a pretty good premise like "Across the Bridge" (1957) can be turned into such a convoluted piece of... (anyway a very bad movie).<br /><br />There really is no way to descibe or spoil the movie because the plot is such a mess. For example here is a plot summary--> there is a good guy (Orlando Jones) and a bad guy (Eddie Griffin) who has a dog that hates the good guy, but then the good guy is framed (by apparently the bad guys using what is called a "Double Take", but was he really framed by the good guys imitating the bad guys? So, then the bad guy (Griffin) changes places with the good guy (Jones). Only to have (Jones become a bad guy in another country where the now good-bad-guy (Griffin) killed a really bad guy and stole his dog for evidence (only no wait, he didn't really kill him either (probably another double take, i dont remember who really killed him, I think it was a bad guy).<br /><br />So then wait, Jones apparently had a child with someone so that they could pull a " double take" on the real bad guys, only Griffin is still bad and the U.S. cops are bad, but the undercover cops are good, but the undercover mofia as undercover cops are bad, and eventually the head moffia boss guy is also good, but only until he is bad again.<br /><br />And then.....<br /><br />Well, if you made it this far and really want to know, watch the movie.<br /><br />It has a few nice points (mainly around a beginning that references The Godfather (look for oranges, which signify death). The bit about "Slitz malt liquor is good too).<br /><br />But that is about it, a few good quotes does not a good movie make and Double Take gives you the fealing of, "Heah, maybe I can throw a good idea (or a zillion) at you". One of them has got to stick.<br /><br />The problem is that with so many ideas and concepts and bads and goods, and mechanical pen gismos used to call in the national guard, Double Take ain't kepn it Real. It sure isn't representing the original 1957 movie idea.<br /><br />Viewed in theatres (35mm) Rated:1
