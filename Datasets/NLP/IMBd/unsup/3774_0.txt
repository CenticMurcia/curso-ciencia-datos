This is the original Norwegian version of a film remade in America, by the same director, no less, about a boyfriend who becomes obsessed after his girlfriend vanishes right from under his nose at a gas station.<br /><br />Because I wanted to see the original after seeing the trailer for the American version and hearing the original had a far better ending, I bought the Criterion DVD of this and watched it.<br /><br />The ending probably would've shocked me more if I hadn't seen the trailer for the American version, which gave the closing plot twist away.<br /><br />I've never been more angry at my own culture in my life. If you want to see this, don't even bother watching the trailer for the other movie, which starred Jeff Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland.<br /><br />This surprise ending would've chilled me to the bone ... if I'd not already seen Kiefer Sutherland live through it in the trailer.
