This is yet another entry in the DVD called "The Animation Show, Volume 3" that features a too-mean edge, an unfunny and unpleasant short film with an extremely heavy-handed agenda.<br /><br />Five practical lessons for self-defense are explained by a narrator after we see mild-mannered "George" brutally attacked in an alley. George is an innocent, almost naive man who rarely makes it to the city, we learn, so was unaware that is such a dangerous play. How to help a nice man like George? Teach him how to protect himself! The five practical lessons are "Diplomacy," "Make A Plan," "God Is On Your Side," "Technology" and "Preemptive Self Defense." <br /><br />Unfortunately, a fair portion of this animated short are left wing cheap shots by an obvious atheist who tells us - and graphically shows it - that "wrong + wrong + wrong + wrong + God = right." He also makes fun of people who think that God will always protect them if they are good people, intentionally misquotes Scripture, saying "Well, something like that" regarding a verse, totally twisting it, and gives us a few other of these kind remarks.<br /><br />It's also sad to see how mean-spirited some of these "creative" filmmakers are, but the real agenda of this film - the bottom line - came in the last minute - it's another George Bush-bashing cartoon, as "George" is pictured as a cowboy with an itchy trigger finger now, just killing everyone in sight and enjoying it. The implication is more than obvious. Wow! Michael Moore and other left-wing extremists would love this little film!
