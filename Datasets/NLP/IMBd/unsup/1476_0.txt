Thought at first this film was going to be a slow boring film about a sister and her brother having problems. However, this film took me by surprise and I could hardly believe what Leelee Sobieski (Ruby Baker), "Max",'02 had to go through in her godfather's Glass House, who was 16 years of age and had to share a bedroom with her younger brother. Bruce Dern,(Begleiter),"Madison",'01, played a foxy old man who offered Ruby Baker a helping hand and got himself into a big mess he never dreamed would happen to him in the House of Glass. The story has many twists and turns and does keep you on the edge of your seats, watching fancy cars going crazy on narrow mountain roads with plenty of sharp turns. Ruby even gets hit on by her godfather and even tries to avoid injections with a needle. Sit back and enjoy this very entertaining film with a great new Hot Star Leelee Sobieski.
