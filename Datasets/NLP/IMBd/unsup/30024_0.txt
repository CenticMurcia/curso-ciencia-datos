I discovered this movie via my affexion for Jerry Goldsmith's innovative (for the period) score... highly recommended for its quintessential marriage of images and sounds...<br /><br />The talent on view here, and the obvious affexion its cast and crew have for this film (evident in every frame) make this a must see.
