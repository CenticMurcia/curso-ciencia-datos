i am watching this silly movie as i write this and AHHH, its terrible! i couldn't sleep and so i got up and turned on the boob tube.As i flipped on the TV, Brian Kerwins image caught my eyes(if it weren't for him and i just happen to be quite attracted to blond mustachioed white males) i probably wouldn't be watching this crap. So i decided to get on MDB to look up his profile/bio. in doing so i found out that this silly LIFTIME made-for-trailer-trash-movie is based on real events!!! TEE-HEE!!! but anyway, my true gay nature compelled me to watch it through its entirety. Sobb!! but in looking up the archives based on other viewers comments and questions, it appears to me that the Twiggs were real monsters in having tried to win custody over this poor child. Two families in realty were ruined and the child in question ended up totally F'ed up in her young adulthood! thanks a lot selfish inconsiderate adults.
