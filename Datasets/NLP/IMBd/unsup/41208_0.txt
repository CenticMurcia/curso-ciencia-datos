This is seriously a contender for worse film of the century award! There really isn't much I can say about this film. I saw it ages ago, and it was an awful mess of a film! It's low-budget and it's directed by Michael Winner who also wrote this garbage! It's vulgar, vile and the characters are completely uninteresting, especially the main female character, who finds her purpose and goes around killing male scumbags. It seems every male she encounters is a potential rapist. I have no idea as to what Winner was trying to say in this movie, but it all seemed so unnecessary, and the lead actress was insipid. All I remember is waiting for this garbage to end. Avoid 'Dirty Weekend' like the plague!<br /><br />No score...0 out *****!
