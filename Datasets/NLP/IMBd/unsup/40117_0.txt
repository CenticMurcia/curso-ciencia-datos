This review does not contain a spoiler. Nothing could spoil this movie or make it any less enjoyable.<br /><br />This is the worst movie in the history of cinema. I have never seen anything this bad before. Usually I think people just haven't given a movie a real chance when they give it 1star out of 10, but this movie do not deserve anything but the worst possible rating.<br /><br />This shows a total lack of respect for Doug Bradley and Lance Henriksen and anything associated with Clive Barker and Hellraiser. This could not have been more humiliating to these people if they had been forced to unspeakable sex acts in teletubby costumes.<br /><br />This movie is beyond a review. Everything about it is bad. Show me any five seconds of this movie and I can write a whole review telling you how those five seconds suck in every possible way.
