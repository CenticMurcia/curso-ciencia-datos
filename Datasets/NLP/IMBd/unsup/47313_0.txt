I had vague memories of seeing this when it came out in 1992. I hated the first one but I had some hope that maybe the sequel would be better. I remember hating it worse than the first one! Seeing it again last night (Why? Damned if I know) all those feelings came rushing back.<br /><br />The plot is basically a retread of the first--a spooky cemetary in the Maine woods has the power to bring the dead back to life. Naturally the dead come back as killers.<br /><br />The first one was a cruel, stupid horror film. This one manages to be even crueller and much, much stupider. The script is horrible--full of unlikable characters and has an extremely mean-spirited tone to it. The movie opens with a young boy seeing his mother electrocuted to death and then cuts to a dog being put to sleep by lethal injection! That's just the opening--all through the movie there are vivid scenes of child and animal abuse shoved in your face. It makes you feel dirty and disgusted. Also there's a truly sick (and unnecessary) rape scene and pointless female nudity. And there's some really sick, graphic gore.<br /><br />The direction is lackluster and (with one exception) all the actors are terrible--Anthony Edwards appears to be sleepwalking and Edward Furlong is just pathetic in the lead role.<br /><br />The only thing that makes this film bearable is Clancy Brown's hilarious performance as a resurrected sheriff. But that's not enough to sit through this crap.<br /><br />Cruel, sick, badly acted, badly directed, stupid script--to be avoided at all costs. This definetely does belong in IMDB's bottom 100.
