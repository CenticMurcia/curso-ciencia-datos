As a former submarine sailor, this was the most pathetic submarine movie I've ever watched. A friend bought it for me as a birthday gift and I felt obligated to watch it. Apparently, it was too difficult to round up ANYBODY who had ever served aboard a submarine to correct a few of the several hundred mistakes. Had they asked someone like me, this may have turned out to be a fair movie.<br /><br />Dudikoff's character was suppose to be a Navy SEAL... He sure didn't fight like a SEAL, especially when that woman was kicking his a**!<br /><br />Furthermore, the ocean is pretty deep once you move away from the continental shelf. Submarines are not able to cruise around along the bottom of the ocean. They try to stay away from rocks and stuff that might damage the hull if you were to accidentally run into it.<br /><br />Also, with the intense firefight near the end of the movie, I thought it was amazing that not even a single bullet ricocheted.<br /><br />Finally, SSN submarines do not have vertical launch tubes, SSBN submarines are the ones with vertical launch tubes.<br /><br />I appreciate my friend giving my this gift, but I'll never get these 90 minutes back!
