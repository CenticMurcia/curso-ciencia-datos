Of course there are movies so bad they're fun to watch; this just ain't one of 'em- by any stretch of the imagination. Coming or going. While I did like the costume the title character sported (not that far removed from Rick Baker's duds in SCHLOCK), that's about IT as far as admiration goes. Looking over the posted comments here regarding this one, I can't help but feel that Television has wrecked havoc with the taste buds of most viewers- because MIGHTY PEKING MAN, more than anything else, reminds me of an episode of a really bad television show (take your pick, from day first to this- and they're still being cranked out with mind-numbing regularity); nothing more, nothing less. If you can honestly walk away from something like this having been in any way "entertained," consider watching paint dry.
