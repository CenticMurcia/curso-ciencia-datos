"Enduring Love" is an above average Brit flick all about Joe (Craig) who finds himself in wrestling with potential guilt over a hot air balloon accident. And, If that weren't enough, he finds that tragic incident also beset him with a peculiar sort of obsessive stalker which eats away at his peace of mind and infects his relationship with his girlfriend, Clair (Morton), until he finds himself slipping over the brink of destruction. A very well managed film with a good cast and production value and a plodding and plaintive story, this film builds slowly to a crescendo between two horrific incidents. "Enduring Love" should be an engrossing watch for realists into of psychodramas. (B+)
