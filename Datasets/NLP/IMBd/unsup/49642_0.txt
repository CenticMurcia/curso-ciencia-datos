terrible. probably one of the worst movies i've ever seen. we figured that they got william hurt to act in this turkey by either paying him buckets full of money, or he wanted to go to the jungle and figured this would be a free trip, or he's part of the cult. because it must have been a cult that financed this movie. i don't know the cult of the healing power of the blue butterfly, or the jungle, or the big hole in the ground that they fall into. we watched this movie imagining if the guys from south park had written it and cartman was the little kid faking his lines so he could get a free trip to the amazon. there's one scene where they're swimming by the waterfall that's almost like nambla. jeez, have i written enough lines yet?
