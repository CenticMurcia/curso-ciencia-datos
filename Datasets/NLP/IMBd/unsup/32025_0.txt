I found this film to be an excellent story told in a different setting. Boy finds love, love cant be returned by lover, boy dies before lover is able to admit his love....yes - we've all seen the story before but, it seems to have a fresh angle told in the army setting. Of interest is the way that the love story remains a mystery to all the other characters in the story and, how after the sad events of the movie, the characters remain in silence about the true nature of our protagonists relationship. This is a true love story - makes me proud to be gay and able to tell me lover each day. The soundtrack is nice and supports the primary direction of the movie, cementing some of the themes and ideas of the movie. Oh, both leads are very handsome and are excellent representations of gay Israelis's. Enjoy!
