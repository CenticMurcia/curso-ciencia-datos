this movie is a waste of time. the script has gaps the scenes are not continues, the special effects are childish and in some scenes you can see that there is a stunt man instead of the actor, a lot of childish shooting and nothing else.....even at the closing scene where the bomb explodes in the sea the effect of making the sea is ridiculous...... This movie should get negative votes.....what a pity... There is nothing good to write except maybe for the eyes of the co-star female actor....Even though at the beginning shows promising the rest is for the garbage... I also wonder why for the 2/3 of the movie G. Seagal wears the same dirty clothes? thumps down and straight to the garbage can.....
