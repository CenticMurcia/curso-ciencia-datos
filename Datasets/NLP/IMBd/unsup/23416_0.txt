One of the most enjoyable films I have watched this year. Strong acting and direction with constant suspense almost to the very end. Juliet Binoche is outstanding , and Ray Winstone plays a strong support role as a sympathetic detective. Not every one rates Jude Law , but he is well cast in this , and I could not help think that there might be something semi autobiographical in the role that he plays. The views of London are good and there is plenty to think about in this movie as well , overcrowding , poverty , lack of opportunity for the young , personal relationships in the busy lives that we lead. to sum up , a movie that we all should go and see , relevant to our modern lives.
