I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels the same way about this show. It had lots of potential, but is ultimately ruined by the vapid hosts. There's nothing wrong with having a "normal everyday" couple to host a travel show like this, but if you're going to do that, its best to not have the couple upfront and center the whole time.<br /><br />Every place they go to is "the best place I've ever been", each and every hotel they go to is "the best hotel I've ever stayed at", etc. At the end of each episode, the guy and the girl get to say a few words about the place they just visited, and its always the exact same boring crap they said about the last place, but with a different place name. Couldn't the producers have just written something for them to say? As much as I'd like to say this show is great with the exception of thew boring hosts, I can't. The hosts infest this show. They absolutely ruin it.
