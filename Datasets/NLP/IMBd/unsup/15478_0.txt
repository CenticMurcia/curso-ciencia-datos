With so many movies around, "The Journey of Natty Gann" is worth its while. The 1930's is a tough time in some places. The Great Depression is happening, work is out in the Western part of the U.S. And being stuck at home with a hot-headed guardian is the pits. For Natty Gann(Meredith Salenger) she makes a quest to go find him. She goes to all different places, have no troubles finding food, rides along different trains, and gets herself a non-human companion: a full-blooded wolf that's been used in dogfights. Atfer she freed him they would meet again following a storm. When the weather lets up, she was sleeping on a friend; The Wolf. He would return the favor by giving her a rabbit, for food. Then there's the mis-adventures when she failed to getaway from the law, put in reform school. But that didn't stop her. She would later meet Harry(John Cusack), who tags along with her. There's listening to the rails, Harry's soon departure, and finally meeting her father, burned and happy to see her. Very heart-warming, and very endearing, I enjoyed this movie well! 5 stars!
