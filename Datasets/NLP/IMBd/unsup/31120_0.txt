I finally just saw Lookwell after years of hearing about how brilliant and funny it is.<br /><br />It's simply neither. It is mildly amusing, and because it is 22 minutes it is bearable, but that's it. I really don't understand what all the hype is about. Maybe because it is so obscure, people feel like they've stumbled onto a hidden gem? Because of Adam West? O'Brien and Smigel? It's just not very funny.<br /><br />That is all I had to say but not this web page is saying I do not meet the minimum number of lines of text. So I am writing this. I'd recommend you ignore this text. Why would a comment area want users to have a minimum number of lines of text?<br /><br />It's as idiotic as Lookwell.
