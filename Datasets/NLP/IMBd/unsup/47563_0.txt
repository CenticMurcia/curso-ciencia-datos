Simply miserable film starring Olivia de Havilland as the daughter of the American ambassador to France. The trouble is that Edward Arnold, the ambassador, and the visiting senator Adolphe Menjou have very little to do in this hopeless film.<br /><br />It's basically the story of an engaged woman who meets a soldier by chance and the two engage in a whirlwind romance throughout Paris. Tommy Noonan as the friend of John Forsythe, the guy who courts de Havilland, and Myrna Loy, as the senator's wife, are both unable to salvage a poorly written film.<br /><br />At age 39, Miss de Havilland was way too old for the part.<br /><br />The story is nonsensical at best and Forsythe confusing de Havilland as a kept woman of the older Menjou is not written up to the hilt as it should have been.<br /><br />A shame that such a talented cast of thespians were wasted on this nonsense.
