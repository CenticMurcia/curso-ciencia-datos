We expected the movie to be anti-Southern. But we did not expect the full throated polemic it turned out to be. Alternate history is entertaining and interesting to contemplate however there is little or no creativity shown here. The movie simply carried forward anti-black slogans and pejorative terms from the late 1800s and early 1900s which of course originated as a result of white disgust with freed slaves. There is little or no reason to assume that today,names like Mammy and Uncle would be used as nicknames for slaves 150 years later, if the Conferates had won. Also, think about this... European nations and most South American nations freed their slaves without a civil war. It would have spoiled the film's screed to imagine that the Confederate States of America would have done so, years after the war. But they probably would have, with the advent of modern agricultural technology (much of which was developed in the South, by the way.) On the plus side the world would probably not have the atomic bomb, and might not have wasted billions sending a man to the moon if the South had won the Civil War. The production quality was poor and the acting was straight out of an eighth grade drama class. We were looking at our watches 40 minutes into it. A very weak film.
