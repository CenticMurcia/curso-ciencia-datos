Yes, this was a horror movie that did what a horror movie is supposed to do when it comes to the slasher genre. It had lots of blood, lots of kills and was rather tense. The fact that Emory was in it and added actual good acting to this flick was a bonus. The story, the beginnings of the Leatherface killing spree. It showed how the family came to be and how some of them got their wounds in the last movie which is set after this one. The only thing not answered in this one from the last one is who the little boy was from that movie. The rest of the story is the basic Chainsaw premise of the two couples stranded in the middle of nowhere, this time a wreck the cause of the problem, a rather gruesome wreck. Well the newly self appointed sheriff comes by and of course this sets off a nasty set of circumstances that leads to lots of blood, some shootings, meat hooks, cannibalism and of course chainsaws. Once again, whereas the original movie was more realistic these last two are by far the most gory. The chainsaw is used a lot. This sequel, or rather prequel is also a lot better than the only sequel I ever saw to the original The Next Generation as that one wasn't very gory at all and itself was sort of a remake of the original. So if you go to this movie and you don't like it because of the violence and blood and stuff what do you expect from a movie with chainsaw and massacre in the title?
