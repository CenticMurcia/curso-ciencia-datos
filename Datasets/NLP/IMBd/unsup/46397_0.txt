in very simple words <br /><br />the worst computer animated movie of all time it was horrible beyond imagination it should be given a rating of R so that no child has to endure the pain of watching this movie<br /><br />only 3 things happened!!<br /><br />the opening scene, the baseball scene and the alien scene<br /><br />It was so pathetic, this as to be Disney's lowest point. the funny thing is that they expected to receive 350 million for this movie<br /><br />Watching this makes me the wonder what happened to the good old animated films
