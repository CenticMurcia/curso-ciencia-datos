I wanted to walk out of the theater and demand my money back...<br /><br />...but then I suddenly realized that I was working there.<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen, it's simply that bad. Not since The Blair Witch Project 2 has there been such a predictably terrible horror movie.<br /><br />I'll really NEVER understand the public's high expectations for horror films. It's perhaps the most difficult genre to craft a "good" movie in, and sequels....well, sequels in any genre usually suck.<br /><br />This is no different. But, expectedly so.<br /><br />I would recommend a re-watching of the original, or perhaps checking out the various Japanese versions and sequels, because it can't get ANY worse than this.<br /><br />-Frank
