For the first half of the movie I thought McLish wouldn't talk, for the second half I wished she hadn't. Not since Bolo has a lead character had so few lines, both with merit.<br /><br />First of all, what is with the naked woman at the beginning? No joke, just sitting in the background being naked, basically a part of the set.<br /><br />I realize this was a movie about the horrible ways that people take advantage of the Native Americans, but that ended up being such a subplot, that it was almost insulting. Basically this movie was about revenge, plain and simple, oh and if the toxic chemical plant happens to suffer to, all the better.<br /><br />There is also the "professional" bounty hunters, who suffer from all the classic problems. They are really good at luring the hapless hero in, and/or tracking him/her. Then they can't shoot their victim, who is able to get away and hunt them. Only in this case it worse than most.<br /><br />And I will end with the question, how the heck can she run around and climb and stuff with a bullet through her thigh? I mean most heroes at least attempt to limp or have a pained/stoic look on their face.<br /><br />And this is from a fan of the "you killed my ____ prepare to die" genre.
