Film started simply and innocently enough but gradually proceeded to disgust me with its ignorance, sluttiness, dirtiness, whacko storyline and lack of anything special shown by the lead actors, Pearce and Taylor.<br /><br />How these cheap indie films get made is beyond me, but someone gets up the money somehow. Probably an investment film made by a bunch of GenX similar types who have some money but no taste in anything and demonstrate it every day in the foul and useless way they live their lives, just like the characters in this useless film. <br /><br />How could the director get so little out of these good actors? Answer: Take a totally terrible screenplay and let them run with it. That's all anyone could get out of anyone in this shltty film. It's a true waste of time and I want my $6.25 and 109 minutes back!
