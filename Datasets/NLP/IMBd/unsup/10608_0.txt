This show came out when there were a lot of first run syndicated programs. I thought the writing and plots of the show were good enough to watch to week after week. Yeah, it had a couple of cheesy moments, but what do you expect from a show that doesn't have the budget of network shows? I remember them shooting in San Diego, CA. They even came to Southwestern College (a school I was attending at the time) to shoot some scenes.<br /><br />Anyways, if you're an open minded person, and can overlook some "moments" and try to take in the plots of episodes, then you can enjoy this show.<br /><br />If you're a big time nitpicker and that's all you do, then stay away from it and leave it alone.
