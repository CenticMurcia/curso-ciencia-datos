but it's not supposed to be. This one is just a mess, the plot is ... well, where IS the plot? Nancy Guild (rhymes with wild) does a very bad Bacall impression, Hodiak not quite handsome enough to pull off movie leads, Conte and Nolan dependable as always. Fritz and Margo make good impressions in bad parts.<br /><br />The best part of the 2005 version of the DVD is the commentary by Eddie Muller; as a noir expert, he's not afraid to call a turkey a turkey and he has a lot of fun poking fun at the movie and (surprisingly, since Fox paid him) calling it out for what it is. So watch the movie just to get it over with, then sit back and enjoy Muller's critique. It's like a noir MST3000!
