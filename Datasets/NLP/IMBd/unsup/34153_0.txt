This must be one of the all time worst films that I have ever had the misfortune of viewing.<br /><br />It appears that the writers did not have their wits about them when they were attempting to develop a plot. They completely destroyed an all time classic -- "Frankenstein." As for the other horror characters in the film, what were they thinking???<br /><br />The special effects were nothing to rave about either. And to add insult to injury, they didn't have a clue about either geography or topography!!!<br /><br />What was amazing is that the female lead didn't even twist her ankle while doing acrobatic stunts in high heels!<br /><br />How far into fantasy do we have to go before we get slapped with a dose of reality?
