I much prefer a movie that looks great to one with great dialogue. So with this movie I was pretty much satisfied. OK the acting can be a little iffy at times ("those kids do look up to you" said in a bit of an over the top way) but the story line, humour, and fights (very enjoyable at the party, not as much in Mexico because of the more serious tone) are all very good.<br /><br />But this film really excels in the shots of the ocean and surfing. They are quite simply beautiful.<br /><br />I don't really understand why this film did so badly but heh it seems to be more accepted now.
