If you who read this are one of those who hated this movie, I really feel your pain. If you are one of those who thinks this is a masterpiece, then you don't know what a good movie is. I have never seen a movie this bad ever in my entire life. The actors are really, really bad - and even though the main character plays a villain, he seems more like a sissy retarded wimp. All I can remember from this so called "movie" is pain... I suffered through it all the time. I would rather get whipped 100 times than watch this horrible piece of s**t ever again. People ONLY love it because of it's satire of society, which makes no sense. For someone who knows how you actually make a movie, this is a joke. I can actually tell you about the ONLY time I watched it - it was when I was studying the art of film making. In class, the teacher told us we should watch it. Afterwards, our teacher said she actually likes the movie (like most people unfortunately do), but still, she told us this is NOT HOW YOU MAKE A MOVIE. That says it all. And just for the record - this is the only movie that have actually managed to make me feel like a brainless weirdo who should go and bite my hands off, while I dance like a idiot.
