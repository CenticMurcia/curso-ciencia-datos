I love Drive. It's one of the best American Martial Arts films of the past decade (not saying much, I know), being one of the first films to mix Hong Kong-style action with an American film.<br /><br />Mark Dacascos' work is top-notch, and he and Kadeem Hardison play well off each other. Brittany Murphy nearly steals the show as an ever-so-slightly deranged (but not quite Bates-deranged) motel owner, and John Pyper-Ferguson makes a good villain.<br /><br />Whilst definitely a no-brainer, Drive is slick, funny, and bursting at the seams with ridiculously complicated action choreography. Tongue-in-cheek always beats po-faced seriousness for action films.
