Only amusing thing about a made for TV-drama is how you can be given a list of 5000 titles and easily sort it out. If you want to see that actress from "8 Simple Rules" show that really she wasn't acting at all, that's what she actually looks and sounds like, this might just work out fine for you. So this girl (who looks pretty anorexic, but that seems okay in this movie) wants to make a documentary about fat people from roughly seventy points of view. She (poorly) dresses herself up as someone fat and gets humiliated with the weakest fat jokes ever written. They're not even mean really, they're just painfully lame. Menopause is seriously uninspiring. I guess it's still better than the endless stream of my husband is a monster because he only takes me out once a week and even had two beers last Christmas-flicks but man is it close. We even are insulted with some pointers about how not to get fat, like not eating pizza and stuff. Take notes.<br /><br />Edit: I do love how the genre section somehow includes "horror" though
