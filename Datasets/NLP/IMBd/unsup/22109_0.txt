My brother and I have been watching and re-watching Twilight Zones since they first an live back in the early 60's. This episode has always been one of our favorites. "the Big Tall Wish" is a great tale of hopes and expectation wrapped subtly in the history of race. The scene in which the impressible kid who makes 'the BIG WISH' is quite memorable . . . "Please, Please . . . .". My brother and I would talk about when we would potentially need to make the BIG WISH. And then it happened. . . My brother Jeff, who lives in Los Angeles, had been in New York during the ALCS series. Being both ardent Red Sox fans for over 20 years at that point, we were really bummed by the way the Series was going. The night before he was leaving to go back to LA was almost the last straw. The Sox lost to go down 3-1. Jeff, who had tickets to the game the next day stated forlornly "I'm going home to a funeral". The game the next day was close but the Sox found themselves down by 3 entering the last at bat. Don Baylor hit a HR to bring them within 1 run. With 2 outs and a man on, Dave 'Hindu' Henderson came to the plate. The Angels countered with their top reliever, Donnie Moore. My brother, sitting in the left field bleachers and sensing the impact of the moment, closed his eyes and made 'THE BIG TALL WISH'. 'Hindu' promptly launched one into, of all places, the left field bleachers. Although the Angels tied it up, the Red Sox eventually won the game and went on to win the series. My brother called my right after the game hysterical and mumbled something about making 'THE BIG TALL WISH'. I knew immediately what had happened and how our mutual adoration with this series and, in particular, this episode had changed the course of history. at least from our distorted perspective.
