Race across the country for pink slips. Very quoteable "just a second a minute" or "we don't want the goat anyway". This is a real treat to finally get the REAL THING. I have a copy that I taped off Speedvision long ago but it will be like dying and going to heaven to get the genuine VHS. I'm stoked, buffed out, there are no words to describe it.
