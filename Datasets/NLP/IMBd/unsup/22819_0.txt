This is a totally awesome movie not because of awesome special effects, not because it is particularly well written, not because it is at all believable because trust me it's not very realistic at all. The Walk Like A Man works because, it is funny and it has an awesome message. I am very disabled and this movie shows why it is OK to be different. The movie shows how sometimes what people see as different is in many ways better than what most people call "normal". For all Walk Like A Man Lacks in traditional movie POP and FIZZ it makes up for in its message of heart. The movie is more slap stick comedy than serious. If you want a more serious Boy Raised by Wolves Tale I would suggest LUCAN.<br /><br />This is a movie to watch if you still have the heart of child like innocence and you are down and just wanting to feel good afterward. This is not the movie for those who want something deep, meaningful and spiritual. Walk Like A Man is an hour or so of weird fun with an awesome message at the end. I brought a copy of Walk Like A Man from Amazon.COM on DVD and at 46 I still enjoy watching it, but who knows if I will ever grow up.
