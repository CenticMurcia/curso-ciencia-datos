A Distant Thunder uses fiction to portray the very real problem that our society seems to accept as normal, partial-birth abortion, Dilation and Extraction (D & X.) I recommend this short film for all and especially for youth groups, but suggest it be previewed by leaders before group showings in order to develop responses to questions that your audiences will have. The Bonus Tracks, interviews with Principal members of the production, may be necessary to resolve questions of your own and will assist in leading discussion about A Distant Thunder.<br /><br />Because of the powerful theme of this movie, I suggest that it not be shown to unsupervised children or youth.
