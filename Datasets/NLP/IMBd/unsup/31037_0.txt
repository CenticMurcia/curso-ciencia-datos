The previews looked very promising- another funny looking parody film on the 'date movies' we've seen over the past few years. But this was anything but funny. I saw an advanced screening this evening with an entirely full theater and as the scenes trudged along, practically everyone was sitting in stunned silence. The gags are predictable, the jokes are drawn out to ridiculous lengths and the usually comedic cast are, quite frankly, wasted in this mess. This makes the Scary Movie series look like The Godfather collection in comparison. And I happened to enjoy the Scary Movie series. Perhaps if you've never actually seen a satire before you will get a few chuckles out of this, but for everyone else this is just a tired & recycled complete waste of time. The only good thing about Date Movie is its short running time so you won't have to be tortured for more than 80 minutes.
