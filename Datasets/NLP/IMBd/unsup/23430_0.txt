I went to a free screening of this picture on Aug. 23, 2000. The woman from the distribution company informed us: "The filmmakers couldn't be here tonight, but if they were, they would like you to know that the film cost $40,000 to make, and won the Audience Appreciation award in Toronto." THAT'S what they want us to know. Who cares how much it cost?<br /><br />The film is dreary, but girls seemed to like it, because good-looking guys learn their lessons (from women, of course) and become much better people. <br /><br />At the start, each brother (the happy-go-lucky blonde actor nicknamed "Smiling Fish" by a Native-American grandmother, and the serious dark-haired accountant nicknamed "Goat on Fire) is having girl problems. Fish's girlfriend realizes that he is using a ribbed condom--and she buys all the condoms, but never ribbed. Goat's girlfriend keeps crying for no reason at all. It turns out that she is pregnant, but not by Goat, and she's both confused about what to do, and going through that irrational phase that pregnant women sometimes do.<br /><br />Each of the brothers attains a guru: Goat befriends a fellow accountant--an old black man who is trying to eat enough donuts to kill himself, so he can join his wife in heaven. Fish meets a lovely mail carrier, whose daughter (a budding actress herself) acts as his impetus to become serious with her mail-Mom. Goat takes up with a sultry animal-wrangler with an annoying European accent; he dumps her when he thinks that the ex-girlfriend's kid is his, but, after the old black man dies, a tape is played at the funeral that gets Goat and the wrangler back together.<br /><br />I might have liked this movie if it took place in New York, but the California settings and jobs just seemed too la-la-lightweight. The movie seemed like a USC thesis film that cost maybe $35,000. I don't know where the other $5000 went to.
