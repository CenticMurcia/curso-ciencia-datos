i loved LaChappelle's movie... the dancing (both 'clowin' and 'krumpin') was great.<br /><br />i loved "lil mama"... she was so cute. <br /><br />the 'stripper dance' was funny. a few of my friends do a little bit of that mixed in w/their dances... we didn't know they called it the 'stripper dance' and 'stripper booty'.. we laughed at that.<br /><br />it inspired me n my friends so much so that as soon as we got into the parking lot we started 'krumpin' rite there on the spot!! <br /><br />needless to say, police got involved because it was after curfew and i had my little sis w/us.. so we went home w/those feelings and 'clowned' and 'krumped'... it was "ahh" ::sighs.w/relief::
