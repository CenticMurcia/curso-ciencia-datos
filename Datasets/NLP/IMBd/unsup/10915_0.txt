One of Franco Nero movies, known in my native country as Cry Onion. I saw this movie back the late 1970s or early 1980s. It is my kind of movie.It came out around the same time frame as the Terrance Hill & Bud Spencer movies They Call Me Trinity and Trinity is Still My Name. I love them. All these years I thought Cry Onion was a Terrance Hill and Bud Spencer movie. I found out different a few hrs ago while in my search to find this movie. Can anyone tell where I can get this movie to buy known in some parts of the world as Cry Onion or Cibollero, El or Cipollaro, Il or Locos del oro negro, Los (Spain). If you know this movie's title as something different please let me know that as well. Help! send me an email @ rmasterj44@hotmail.com. Thanks!
