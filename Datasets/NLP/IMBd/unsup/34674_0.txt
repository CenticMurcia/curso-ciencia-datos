I won't lie to you, this movie was bad. Really bad. It was god awful. But worthy of the bottom 100, I don't know. Kevin McDonald was part of the second greatest sketch comedy show, the Kids in the Hall(second only to the state). Paul Greenberg was in the Vacant Lot, a highly underrated show that I still don't get all of. I admit that I lost a few brain cells due to this movie, but It did have its moments of good comedy. Uh, I really can't think of any, but I know I laughed a few times. Oh god, I 'm remembering the impersonations. so bad so so bad.<br /><br />Honestly, Dom Deluise was better in Loose Cannons and I hated that movie. and Rodney Dangerfeild should kick it so that we can remember how good he was doing stand up and in Caddyshack.<br /><br />This movie was bad even for afternoon Showtime.<br /><br />***out of 10<br /><br />Disclaimer: Still better than Hudson Hawk
