If you have seen "Meet the parents" or any film like that then you know it will remind you of this film. Instead of your father to be being an ex-C.I.A agent he is black and does not like him at all and trusts no one who is white. Until at the end despite being a liar, upsetting his dad and telling a racist joke his noble side shine's through (after having a major argument with his girlfriend) just like meet the parents they make up and get married. Jokes are predictable and not funny, laughed twice through the film (think that was the go-kart race). I would not bother watching this film instead take a trip to the zoo and stare at the monkeys it's far more entertaining.
