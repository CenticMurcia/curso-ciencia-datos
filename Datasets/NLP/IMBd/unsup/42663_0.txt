I remember one time reading a remark from Robert Mitchum who was discussing how he came to play a certain part after several of the leading men of his generation turned it down. He was quoted as saying that the producers figured "that bum Mitchum will do anything for enough money". <br /><br />If that was the case Mitchum hopefully got a hefty paycheck for his part in this slasher flick where he's on for the last 15 minutes or so as Mark Hamill's shrink. Midnight Ride stars Mark Hamill as the psychotic serial killer who runaway wife Savina Gersak picks up as she's leaving workaholic cop husband Michael Dudikoff.<br /><br />Dudikoff is not operating either with a full deck, maybe his broken leg is warping his judgment. Anyway he's after her and not particularly concerned about how he gets her back. But as it turns out Gersak's jumped from the frying pan to the fire.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Dudikoff's injuries on Midnight Ride were real or not. Certainly a healthy Dudikoff might have taken Hamill out before the film was halfway over. The American Ninja versus Luke Skywalker, what a concept.<br /><br />Which I'm sure was on the minds of the producers of this travesty in getting these two stars passed their box office prime to star here. Robert Mitchum barely can contain his boredom, his famous rumpled eyes barely register a movement.<br /><br />When the force is not with Luke Skywalker, a one legged American Ninja can take him.
