this movie is not that great.i found the story too banal(ordinary).there's not much originality here.it's a combination of many other movies.it's equal parts a Christmas Carol,It's a Wonderful Life,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,and Even The Cat in the Hat movie.the movie isn't very funny,but there is a bit of slapstick that works.this movie is,i felt,overly sentimental and preachy.in fact,i felt like i was watching a 90 minute commercial on how important family is.now,don't get me wrong.family is very important.i just find that subtlety works best with these movies.this was just way too heavy handed for me.but there is some good news.the movie has a great visual style.i mean,it looks fantastically magical.and Martin Short is terrific as Jack Frost,the baddie of the piece.he's not really scary,more mildly disconcerting than anything,and even a bit sad.i also like the look they gave him.this movie is also a bit of a tearjerker.anyway,this is a case of style over substance.and while it's not nearly as mean spirited or creepy as part 2,i still don't think it was as good.the negatives just outweigh the positives.for me,The Santa Clause 3 is a 4/10
