I don't know why other people think this movie isn't great, but I think it's amazing!!! I love Dave Chappelle and Norm Macdonald. I just laughed through this entire movie. I think everyone should give this movie a chance, but I still can't see how people don't love it. I wish I could go back and watch it again for the very first time.
