Another example of Kim Delaney making a poor script believable. More Catholic bashing and supernatural happenings. Unfortunately, the producers decided to kill off Larry Holden early...an interesting character actor who could have added life to this otherwise dull film. At least Kim has a recurring television role to sustain her. Sigh.
