Very good movie with a multistar cast unique to cinema viewing 6 stories only 4 of them which are really good the 2 stories which i don't like are the homework story and the apple story first of all the homework story isn't that good and well it's different from the other stories and the apple story is just wow bad people turning into apples come on and the ending isn't strong enough either and stupid because the movie would have been interesting had it had a different ending besides the ending and the 2 crappy stories this movie is a pleasure to watch and can make for great cinema and can be quite a great entertainer good movie great directorial debut by Prawal Raman and great script written by Ram Gopal varma's selected writers and driectors and for the first time Ram Gopal Varma did a great job a t producing a movie hats off to him and Prawal
