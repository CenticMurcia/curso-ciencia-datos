In 1995 Sean Patrick Flanery was 30 years old; too old for the part. A albino adolescent genius who would make Einstein and Hawking look like preschoolers is treated like a parolee. What kind of school counselor would send such a person on a camping trip with teenage hoodlums under the supervision of a gun-fetish, stump-jumping deputy. Telepathy and telekinesis take a back seat to the antics of redneck cops. Anyone, anywhere with this kind of power would have come to the attention of someone vastly more important than a "grey flannel suit" department of education bureaucrat. In the real world Powder would be kept at Area 51.
