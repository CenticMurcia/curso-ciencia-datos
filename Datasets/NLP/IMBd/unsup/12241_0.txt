If u need some back for the claims I will make below, Ill tell u I have lived and studied in Thailand for 4 years, I have a Thai wife and I have known many bar-girls, some of whom do the job for a lack of a better choice BUT STILL OUT OF FREE CHOICE and some who don't even want to consider different choices because they are contempt with what they do. In Thai society prostitution is "illegal" but it has long roots and a strong frame in the history and culture, the job of a prostitute is considered a low one but they are still a completely accepted part of the society. The life some women, like the character "pla" in this document live is NORMAL for these people. Yes, it is not just good or bad but NORMAL here, no matter what we think of it in the west.<br /><br />I know the girls working in the bars as this one in the document are free to leave any time they want for another job. But they often don't want, because in this job they make 10 times the same money with less efforts. Any other job would decrease their living standards too much so they go for the money. <br /><br />I have lived and stayed with poor Thai people, who are not and don't want to be prostitutes. Thay are students or factory workers and I have stayed in their in lousy shacks and 8 square rooms eating the street food, and though I am not used to it and cant say I enjoy it, for them it is NORMAL and I know they have been contempt with what they have. The bar-girls are not contempt with that or they want to send more money home for the parents, or save up money so they go and sell themselves or just entertain some foreigners to get more money. <br /><br />So even if the choice is not good, there IS A CHOICE for everyone of them (in bars like the one featured in this film). Thats just a choice between a hard life with your pride or getting more money with less pride. Now to the point:<br /><br />This film is very sad indeed.<br /><br />Not because the "story" is sad but because sadly there is no story. Not because the filmatography or any other artistic feature is so convincing but because of the lack of anything convincing. Like others have pointed out here the director obviously had nothing together before shooting this poor film except average camera and editing skills and his prejudice and stereotypical view of the issue and what he would get together.<br /><br />And thats exactly what he tries to carry on to the viewer as well: he is asking the girl direct personal questions to get the answers he wants. What is supposed to look like "caring about her problem" or "listening to her" falls apart with his condescending attitude towards the culture and the girls profession and life. With the attitude, style and language the girl is interviewed with, she is not given an option or possibility to explain anything about her real thoughts.<br /><br />What has happened here is that the girl got annoyed with the film maker (I would have) and the film maker frustrated because the girl didn't answer what he expected. After his few weeks holiday in Thailand money ran out, the director packed his bags and went home with nothing. Thats the obvious reason for the fraud ending and the claimed "murder" of the girl, to get some drama, twist and an end to his story.<br /><br />If this serves as something, that is as an example of what document is not supposed to be. I can not believe this has actually been aired in full length on some self respecting network or station. A document is supposed to look at the real nature of things and openly present them to the viewer instead of reproducing old ideas and clich√©s, lying and controlling the subject to impose a wanted effect on them. That is called propaganda, in this case ethnocentric, bandwagon propaganda.
