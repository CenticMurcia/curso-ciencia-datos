Just discovered this short on atom.com under the heading "Sexy Comedy". A young woman with her hair in a bow goes to a booth where she puts a dollar or more in a slot to hear a couple of men say what a woman like her wants to hear like one of them wanting to watch Enchanting April or another of them wanting to take her dancing. Every sensitive thing this woman hears gets her so aroused that she lets her hair down and goes into orgasmic ecstasy with every word especially when-after putting down $50 for the entire show-she hears both of the men say, "Have you lost weight?" The asides of the men-like when one of them mentions Enchanting April Showers starring Traci Lords-also provides some hilarity. Well worth seeing for anyone who likes comedy with a twist.
