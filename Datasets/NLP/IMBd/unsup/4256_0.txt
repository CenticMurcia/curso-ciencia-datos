This movie is in no way good. The music in the movie, although sometimes too much, was often used to good effect. Many of the scenes were shot in average to above average ways. The acting by some of the secondary characters was believable. And that's the best I can say about this movie. <br /><br />The protagonist, Simon, wakes up from a car-crash induced coma in a hospital into which he was admitted two years earlier. The 'plot' quickly, if ungainly, unfolds. I would outline this but for two reasons: I don't want to 'spoil' the movie experience for those of you who are looking forward to the movie and I don't think that the plot is worth outlining. My biggest complaint about the movie is the plot - as there is little to no chartacter development, the storyline has to be that which holds our interest. While I will admit that the plot held my interest for a while, it was largely due to the poorly handled time travel logistics (which are ultimately explained/explained away).<br /><br />Even the ending refused to yield a satisfying conclusion - yes, I can imagine what the ending was SUPPOSED to convey, but if it's left ENTIRELY up to my imagination (which it most certainly was) then why not just dream up scenarios myself? <br /><br />In fact, you'd probably be more entertained if you just sat at home by yourself and thought about movie plots that you'd like. Stay away from this movie.
