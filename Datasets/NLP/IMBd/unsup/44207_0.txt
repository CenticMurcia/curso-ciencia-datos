I admit that I was obligated to take my children who are 7 and 10. Yes I along with many other parents dreaded the thought of wasting my $25.00 on this trite silliness. But after a while I began to enjoy my children's involvement in the movie and reaction to this which was no less than enjoyable. It's a silly sloppy dog film with a good heart. It's loaded with predictable outcomes, suspense and fantasy clich√©s. Not bad for innocuous entertainment. <br /><br />So adults need to sit back, cut your losses, lighten up and accept the 2 hours of kids laughing. What I find most humorous is to see has been stars reduced to B-movie level as the likes of Lisa Kudrow and Mr. Dillon. That was the most enjoyable aspect for me. So in essence adults can find the inside joke to movies like this.
