Well, not probably, but surely the WORST movie EVER! I can't believe it. The thought of people paying to see this piece of crap sends a chill down my spine... The story is, well, lame, about the race that threatens the human kind, and the chosen few who save the day. The special effects look cheap (I personally think that the special effects in this movie were created using MS PAINT... They couldn't be worth more than 20$),not to mention that the actors' performance is weak.<br /><br />Don't do make the same mistake I made. If you have to choose between seeing this movie, and stapling your eye lids to a rally car, staple your eye lids...
