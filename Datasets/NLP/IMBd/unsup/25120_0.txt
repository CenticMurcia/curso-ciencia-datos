"Grand Hotel" is the kind of film that doesn't lose anything during repeated viewings. It is a marvelous MGM production that pretty much embodies the kind of thing the studio did best, during the company's most prolific era. The narrative revolves around one of Germany's most luxurious hotels, the Grand Hotel, which provides the setting for a series of interesting guests that struggle with different problems. The story is really an excuse to display glamorous stars and MGM's now famous ultra glossy production values, but who's complaining? Certainly not me. The film has an all-star cast, and it is a special treat (and lots of fun) to be able to watch each actor compete for the camera's attention. It was a smash hit when it was first released, and the film even managed to win the Oscar for Best Picture. More than seven decades later, the film has somehow retained its initial energy, thanks to the movie's fascinating cast. Watching it again, after so many years, was an enjoyable experience. I was delighted to find out that the film is still a grand piece of soapdish entertainment, and if you have yet to delved into Hollywood's early classic period of film-making, this MGM production provides a nice starting point.
