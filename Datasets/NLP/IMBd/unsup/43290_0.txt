This movie could've been so much more. As a member of the BDSM community, I have seen first hand the loving relationships between Masters and their pets.<br /><br />This movie could have informed the audience about these relationships, about the growth of both people involved, their character development, and there could have even been subplots of action or care or intrigue without involving a contrived, convoluted, and ultimately damaging subplot involving human trafficking, a horrific and reprehensible practice that has nothing to do with 99.9% of the BDSM community.<br /><br />It was obvious that the film makers have some knowledge of the dynamics of a Master/human pet relationship. But they wrapped it up in bad acting, bad dialogue, and bad story telling.
