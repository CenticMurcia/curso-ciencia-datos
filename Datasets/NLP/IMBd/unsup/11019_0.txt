The movie was too fast paced,not much in the way of a plot that hasn't been done before & the actors could not act to save their lives for an exception of Kelsey & even he couldn't save this picture. It is so clich√© it isn't even funny. The dialogue is also not that great nor is it into going into things explaining things for an exception of a few secs here or there. I wouldn't even recommend it. kelsey can & will do much better.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting a block buster here but come on some crappy low budget film could at least try harder. The effects were so overly cheap its not funny.
