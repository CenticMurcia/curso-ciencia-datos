I hired this film out because it sounded interesting. Being a fan of serial killer films I thought this film would be at least interesting or watchable. Boy was I wrong. Completely amateur made film with horrible acting and rubbish "gore" effects. I probably could've made a better movie in my High School Film & TV class. Also, at the end of the film they show a sequence which is apparently a real snuff film made by the serial killer the film is based on. I highly doubt it is a genuine snuff film because there's no way the censors would let it get released. They'd want it cut. If they throw a fit over the animal killings in Cannibal Holocaust they would've outright banned this film for having a genuine snuff film in it. Avoid this movie like the plague!!! I've rated it one star only because there's no option for 0/10...
