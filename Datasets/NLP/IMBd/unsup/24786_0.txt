For anyone who is an admirer of Richard Linklater's two wonderful films, 'Before Sunset' and 'Before Sunrise' - of which I include myself - then this rather excellent film will show you another side of Julie Delpy that was not really glimpsed in those films.<br /><br />In 'Before Sunset/Sunrise' Ms Delpy's character was a rather sweet, innocent abroad type of character, whilst here her character may start off looking that way, and the voice over helps to build that initial impression, but it does not take long for us to realise that here is another side of her, one seemingly obsessed with sex, and finding the ideal partner. Julie Delpy handles this subtle change superbly well, and is help throughout by a cast that adds enormously to the film. Most notable amongst these are Adam Goldberg, playing what can only be described as Woody Allan on speed!, Marie Pillet and Albert Delpy as her mother and father - not hard considering they ARE Julie's parents! - and the trio of Daniel Bruhl, Adan Jodorowsky and Alex Nahon as her three ex-lovers (respectively, Lukas, Mathieu and Manu). The only wasted cast member I felt was Alexia Landeau as Rose, sister to Delpy's Marion. Her role appeared to be lost on the cutting room floor somewhat.<br /><br />The film is, at times, incredibly funny, and contains one of the funnest dinning scenes I have seen since Meg Ryan and THAT scene! But what gives this film the real edge is the way it is not afraid to veer into viciousness, and does not duck out of attacking the values of certain aspects of the French character. Check out the scene in the cab where Marion riles against the racism of a "typical" French cab driver, and the one in the café where another ex-lover appears and is roundly condemned by Marion for...well, that point I am not going to give away, but it is truly shocking.<br /><br />Around all this Mr Goldberg as Jack really plays up the cliché of the American abroad, but again without failing to use this to again, like Ms Delpy, attack certain aspects of the Yankie Abroad, with suitable very funny results! How true these aspects being attacked are I will leave others to decide, but some of them rang true to me.<br /><br />All praise must go to Julie Delpy not only for her acting, but her directing of the film. Some of the tropes used are clever, and serve to keep reminding you that you are watching a film, albeit one with a real heart and something to say.
