My partner, after renting this movie from the indie rack at our local rental outlet, and sitting through all 77 minutes (I had to beg her to watch the last 9 minutes), remarked, "It is criminal to watch this movie."<br /><br />I won't bore you with the plot -- which has some relation to the first half of Psycho. I won't bore you with a lengthy description of the acting and writing -- suffice it to say that the pace was glacial, the dialogue contained no art "Where are you going ... I don't know ..." a typical exchange.<br /><br />The black and white photography was interesting, for about 15 minutes. Up state New York has never looked more bleak.<br /><br />I only gave it a 2 rather than a 1 because I watched it all the way through.
