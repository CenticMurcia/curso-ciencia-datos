This is an awful mess, so bad it's hard to sit through for more than five minutes. I guess this film was supposed to be "quirky," but it just comes out as a muddled mess. There are no laughs, the couple at the center of the story is boring in the extreme, the acting is pretty awful (Julia Stiles has been good in some other movies, but not here), and half the time it doesn't even make much sense. If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it's pretty close to it.
