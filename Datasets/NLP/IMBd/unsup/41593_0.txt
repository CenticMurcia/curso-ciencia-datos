<br /><br />I used to be a hugh fan of the original Harry Enfield show on english television, but after seeing the apalling excuse for a movie of "Kevin and Perry" last night, I'm definitely having second thoughts. The usually hilarious characters are too over-worked, and simply don't have enough depth to move from a 5 minute TV sketch to a 2 hour movie. The erection jokes weren't funny the second time, and got decidedly boring after the 20th attempt. The film often turned to toilet humour for no conceivable reason other than to make the audience cringe, without actually providing the neccessary laughs to make it bearable. Continuity, originality and direction were terrible. I can't think of single reason why I could recommend anyone to see this ... save your pennys, don't go to see this, put it towards a holiday .... ibiza maybe ?<br /><br />0/10 ... can we give negative numbers ?
