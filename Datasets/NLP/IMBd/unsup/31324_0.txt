Its simple. Its perfect. Its hilarious in an appropriately twisted sort of way, which is entirely the way it should be. Jack Black is a genius. The timing is perfect in the rearrangement of the archived footage, which while not too difficult to ad-lib in theory, is difficult to do well... and it is done perfectly here. Anyone who doesn't find this funny should pull the redwood out of their arse and invest in a sense of humour. If you can't find this funny, there's something seriously wrong. Besides that there's not much else to be saying, as lets remember that its only a rather short piece of the movie it so well satires, rearranged and twisted for the best kind of laugh. It does what its supposed to do, no more, no less.
