I'm not really the kind of person that goes on about television shows, but the second I saw this show I was hooked! It's amazing how it captures high school so perfectly, even down to the actors, who, unlike Dawson's Creek and clones, look like they really go to high school. I love it, and absolutely recommend it to anyone. For those of us who didn't fit in in high school it's a humorous, realistic look back, and for those of you still suffering, it lets you know you're not alone.
