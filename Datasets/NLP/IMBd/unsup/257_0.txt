Since I haven't seen the classic that came before this, I'm unable to compare it, or be biased by it.<br /><br />Robin Williams movies are always a pleasure to see. But, the over the top script for this one is hysterical. I'd imagine one has to be somewhat open minded to enjoy it. ;) Having many gay friends and having gone to many a party thrown by them, I can see it all taking place. And, the drama caused by a very feminine man playing a very straight woman in order to avoid coming out of the closet is too funny. That dinner scene is an absolute riot.<br /><br />The sad thing about it is knowing that so many have to hide their sexuality for fear of being ostracized. But, this puts such a humorous spin on things. It must have been a really fun movie to produce and/or act in. Rent it when you are in need of a laugh! :)
