I took my girls, 7 and 5 to see this movie because it was the only kid movie that wasn't a cartoon. I had seen the trailer for it during Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and thought it looked very good. Well this is the first time that the best parts of a movie are not in the trailer. What an exceptional movie! I would of watched the movie right away again if I had been able too. Emma Thomson did a remarkable job. This was a movie that kids as well as parents can enjoy, an excellent feel good movie! The movie shows that you can still make good quality entertaining family movies! I will be the first in line to purchase the DVD!
