I have never seen this film until last night. Everyone says it's absolutely amazing and terrifying. I expected this to make my skin crawl. A Clockwork Orange has to be one of the worst films I have ever had to watch. The first twenty minutes were okay because it was not boring, then holy crap, the rest of the movie was flat out dreadful! I could not believe that this film got all great reviews. Do critics enjoy boring, non-psychological crap from the 70's? I guess so! There was honestly no point what so ever to this disgusting film. The story line was terrible, the acting was below horrid, and the fact that this movie is a cult classic makes me sick to my stomach. Terrible, terrible film.
