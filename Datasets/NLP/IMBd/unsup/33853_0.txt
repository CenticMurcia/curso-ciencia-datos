Haunted House (2004) is a waste of digital space upon a D.V.D. disc I have ever seen. I have watched crappy movies before but this has to be worst thing I have ever seen. This did not even resemble a movie in the least. The structure, lighting, writing, acting and direction is the pits. I cannot believe this "movie" was even distributed in a major video rental chain store. I mean I can not find one thing good to say about it. The flick was padded out to the extreme and the film makers seemed to have run out of ideas and other ways to extend the running time past seventy minutes.<br /><br />The "movie" begins with some thirty something frat boys hanging outside of what appears to be a spooky "house". They seem to be reliving and old urban legend about people disappearing inside a ghost house. If you have heard the tale before it's old news (a "kid" walks in and never comes out and the frat boys come and and find him dead of fright, the boys soon fall victim to a death curse). The tale is told by a really bad film maker, he convinces his friends (A group of old teenagers) to hang out inside and outside an empty structure that looks like a cross between a barn and a large doll house. After torturing the audience with some of the worst movie making the world has ever since (I have seen Cable Access shows with better film making skills and production) they give us a cheap payoff by repeating what happened in the beginning. The movie ends with voice-overs, still pictures and rehashed footage.<br /><br />They should take all the copies of this movie and bury them with the million copies of unsold E.T. Atari 2600 games out there in the New Mexico desert. Asylum should also be punished for helping to release this garbage. This movie failed all the simple logical steps that are needed to create a watchable movie. Haunted House had no acting, lame writing, terrible direction, no lighting and gutter level production values.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague!
