The Bad News Bears (1976) was a surprise hit of the seventies. It was also another starring vehicle for young and precocious Tatum O'Neal. Walter Matthau co-stars as the Bears' drunken and slovenly mannered manager. The ever shady Vic Morrow makes a guest star supporting role as the Bears' rival's manager. He's a pushy jerk who tries to relive his youth through his kid.<br /><br />The movie is not a classic, it's just a fun film about youth baseball. Unlike the movies of today, the tone and mood is very realistic and it doesn't pull punches. The language is rough for the kiddies so be fore warned. I liked this movie when I was growing up and you know what? I still do. Take a chance and watch THE BAD NEWS BEARS. This film was so successful, it was followed by two sequels, a television series and a remake! Good cheesy family fun for all ages.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
