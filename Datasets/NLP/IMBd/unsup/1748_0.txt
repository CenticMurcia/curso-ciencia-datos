The Final Fantasy series was never one of my favorite things to play. But when Final Fantasy VII hit the PlayStation, I was addicted. But a few years later, when Final Fantasy VIII came to American shores and I piked it up, I was blown away. It was just awesome, the graphics to the storyline, even the music. The game was everything I wanted in an RPG. A must own for fans of genre. Even though most people wanted the FF series to go back to their roots, taking out the modern edge, I personally enjoyed the fact that it was somewhat modern. It's easier to relate with.
