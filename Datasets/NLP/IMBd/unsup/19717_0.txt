In most of the comments I've seen, haven't seen any comments on Adrian Paul's performance. I happen to be a rather big fan of his and am trying to be patient about when I will be able to see the movie. I have no idea of when it goes to video and if the networks are going to air it, but I am sure everyone on the film did a bang up job, and I mean everyone, including the grips and other BEHIND the scene peoples.
