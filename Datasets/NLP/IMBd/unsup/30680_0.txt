Wyatt Earp, has to truly be one of the finest portrayal of a great western hero. I live in the Southwest and here you are closer to the things that took place not that long ago.<br /><br />Wyatt Earp brings to the screen, an insight to each of us just a small understanding of what took place not all that long ago. The west was the last frontier of man, a place where man lived and died by the gun, where law was ruled by the Colt 45.<br /><br />The Gunfight at the OK Corral is one of the last great events that took place in the Old West. The movie brings not only the story of the life and times of Wyatt Earp, but also in showing you the events that led up to the beginning of the end of the Wild West.<br /><br />Any Wild West history buff will enjoy watching and understanding how the puzzle of the Old West fits into becoming a building block of our great nation.<br /><br />This movie will remain as one of my best loved movies.
