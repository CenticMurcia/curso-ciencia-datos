AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA was a hit at the BO so The makers decided to make DEEWANE HUYE PAAGAL, and with the now famous Akshay's comic timing there decided to make a copy of THERE's SOMETHING ABOUT MARY<br /><br />Took Suneil, Paresh added Shahid, Rimii Sen<br /><br />Made a commercial comedy film<br /><br />The narrator act of Viveik that starts the film drowns it first only, luckily the film gets interesting with Akshay's entrance and then a few jokes are nice but then we have so many stupid scenes<br /><br />A boring leading lady whom i doubt any guy of her age will also fall for Sorry Rimii, But why did the director choose her for the role that required someone damn hot and beautiful to explain people like Asrani falling for Budget constraints?<br /><br />Plus there added another subplot of the evil Om Puri and his family especially Suresh Menon which makes the film boring<br /><br />Too many cooks spoil the broth<br /><br />Luckily the comic scenes between Akshay, Paresh make you laugh Second half gets nice but too lengthy The entire climax is so lengthy and uninviting, like a 70's climax The choosing of the right guy too is prolonged and boring<br /><br />Vikram Bhatt does a good job in some comic scenes Music(Anu Malik) is good <br /><br />Akshay steals the show and owns the film, He is the real star though now he has come a long way as an actor Suneil Shetty overdoes the limp bit but does well in some scenes Paresh Rawal is boring and too loud Shahid Kapur is boring in the lead, while Rimii Sen is pure teakwood with a dubbed voice Johny Lever is loud as usual Vijay Raaz is hilarious, Om Puri hams Suresh Menon irritates Asrani is alright
