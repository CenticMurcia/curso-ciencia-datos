Surprisingly funny movie with the dynamic duo Martin/Hawn.<br /><br />The movie brings to life the differences between the American cities and the countryside. Even if these exist, they are seldom brought up in the rest of the world.<br /><br />This plot gives a warm feeling inside and brings up real problems and thoughts with comic twist.
