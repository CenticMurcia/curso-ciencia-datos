I was very fortunate last night, as I had a chance to see AINOA in a sneak preview almost half a year prior to its scheduled start over here in Austria. I was instantly thrilled as I heard a lot about this ambitious project in the past two years! And I learned a lot last night... For starters, Austrian actors synchronizing themselves for the English dubbed version - the one I saw - does not work. At all! It sounds odd and sometimes plain stupid. But as AINOA is a low budget project, it is an understandable decision. Unfortunately one that hurts the movie a lot along the way. Secondly, the movie fails to introduce its main characters properly in the beginning. Therefore the audience - and I am not just talking about myself here - felt not nearly as tied in with the story as intended by the writer and director. Dramatic, sometimes even tragic moments felt as witnessed in a news broadcast far away. And then there is the pace of the story, which is more like a crawl than a rush. Only at the end - the last 20mins or so - does the pace pick up a bit and the movie starts getting interesting, as all the loose ends start coming together. On the positive side, the production design was really well done considering the extremely low budget that the designers had to cope with. The camera angles are often unique as well and give the entire scenery a strange sense of familiarity although they are actually portraying future scenarios. Great idea! The bottom line, as sad as it is, is this: Had the characters been properly introduced and the dubbing been done right, this could well have been a marvelous SiFi epic. As it is though, all the good intentions fall flat on their faces.
