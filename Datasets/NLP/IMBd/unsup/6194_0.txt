What more could you ask for than a handsome thief, two gorgeous women, a wimp of an FBI man, a bully of British cop, a super black Mercedes Coupe, a vintage motor cycle, gambling, a murder, bumbling Gestapo thugs and supporting actors that truly support the play that is in progress! Well written, directed and acted, progress keeps things moving (even flying through the air on a wire!) at a good pace that won't leave you behind, but will get you to the end. There are even street scenes with costumes and vehicles galore! In other words, the sets are good as well! Enjoyable!
