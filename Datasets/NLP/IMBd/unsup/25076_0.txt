Nude women float in a space as a woman's voice hums along. Lannie, played by the multi skilled Traci Lords (Tracy) has been dreaming about naked women again. Why? Her mom (Helga Sven) brings up boys and tells her about a new man, Mr. Kennedy (Don Hodge), who she thinks likes her, but is too shy to say anything. <br /><br />Mark Radner's (Shone Taylor) hangs with Jeff (Tom Byron) and Kevin (Marc Wallice) talking guy talk. Kevin brings up Debbie and Jeff gets teased about not getting any. Mark blackmails his pilfering maid. He brings her upstairs for a triple teaming.<br /><br />Lannie and friends share girl talk by the pool. Debbie, (Bunny Bleu) goes topless with Cheryl (Susan Hart). Lannie takes the cue and follow. Cheryl talks about how she lost her virginity while babysitting with Bill (Greg Rome). She was nervous about going down at first, but he made her comfortable. Debbie boasts of making guys "beg for it." Kevin says he make girls like Debbie beg for it. The friends left when Mrs. Waters show up. She has her sights on Mrs. Waters Mr. Kennedy.<br /><br />Mrs. Radner (Maria Kay) is peeved at boyfriend (Herschel Savage) for driving fast. She "recovers" and comes unto him. She assures him that her son Mark isn't home. Mark hides and watch as they go at it by the fountain. Scene is too short. Richard Mailer and his people should have extended it, or exclude the sex scene between older people like Helga Sven and Don Hodge. <br /><br />Lannie, Jeff, Debbie and Kevin meets. Taking the hint from Kevin, Jeff takes Lannie in the kitchen. Debbie teases Kevin before sex. Lannie's dress get wet and she teases Jeff after getting naked. He gets too excited and finishes before starting. Lannie later pleasures herself to Jeff. The scene cuts back and fort between Lannie and a DREAMT encounter with Jeff (Tom Byron) outside on a picnic table. <br /><br />It's like being teased without teasing. Some anticlimactic artistry by director Richard Mailer: The debut sex scene of the highly sought after Kirstie Elizabeth "Traci Lords" Knussman is during a dream sequence. Viewers get a sample of her distinctive "sexual terrorist" moans. Traci Lords would later write that her first filmed scene was spontaneously done in a kitchen with Tom Byron. Byron has a "sweet, dopey, puppy-dog thing" which apparently tingled her. The production crew proceeded to seize the moment as they were in the act. In any event, THAT encounter isn't in this movie. Lords wrote of a poolside three way BEFORE production of What Gets Me Hot! Herself, another female and male. Regard for her allegedly rose when news of said escapade made the industry rounds. She didn't get paid for it. <br /><br />Other than their numerous on-screen copulation, there's been no mention by Lords of a personal relationship with Tom Byron. <br /><br />Mark talks to Kevin, then seduces Kevin's girlfriend Debbie at his house. He becomes her master. Making her get naked for some secret tongue pleasure from Wendy(Leslie Thane). Louis (David Sanders) joins in. Wendy tongues Debbie until Mark tells her to open her eyesÂ—shocking her. A foursome happened. <br /><br />Debbie tells Lannie Kevin is a boy. She wants a man like Mark. Lannie has other plans after finding out what gets her hot. She looks over at Cheryl (Susan Hart). (Some poetic money shot of sorts). We now know Traci Lords was, how they say, "gay for the stay" in porn. It could be the effects of the drugs.
