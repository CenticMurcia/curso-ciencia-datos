This show is just not funny, and this is not just from the perspective of a straight male, but also from the perspective of someone who enjoys good humor, whether it be from a straight or gay person. This humor is not funny, and is actually too gay for it's own good. That may sound homophobic, but it isn't, and it will later be elaborated on.<br /><br />In a Saturday Night Live/Madtv like sketch show, we are treated to may sketches featuring an all gay and lesbian cast. And to make matters even better, every sketch has something gay in it, making this show one of the gayest shows on television (this is not meant in a negative way, but instead a factual way).<br /><br />Saturday Night Live has, for the most part, an all straight cast. The sketches can vary greatly, and every sketch isn't about a person being straight. With this show, every sketch is about guys being attracted to guys, or men in drag, or lesbian women. It's understood that this is a sketch show catering to homosexuals, but why must every sketch be about someone being gay. It's extremely repetitive. It would be like if every sketch on Madtv was about guys hitting on girls or trying to get with girls. This would be fine for one sketch, but there needs to be more. It's fine to have an all gay cast, but when every sketch relies on them acting gay for it's humor, there's a problem with the writing. On top of that, the performers just aren't very funny, adding to the dismalness of this show.<br /><br />Unfunny actors with repetitive material adds up to a pretty horrible sketch show.<br /><br />My rating: BOMB out of ****. 30 mins.
