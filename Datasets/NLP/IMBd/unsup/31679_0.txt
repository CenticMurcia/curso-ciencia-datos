I never read the books that this movie is based on, but it did remind me a bit of Ms. Piggle Wiggle, and Mary Poppins. I'm 25, and my fianc√© is 31. Yes, I did drag him to see it, but he admittedly enjoyed it. Just a very sweet, feel good kind of movie. I loved the way Nanny McPhee got prettier and even younger looking as the children got more more behaved. It's like she started out as ugly on the outside as the children's behavior was. I laughed a lot and the end gave me goose bumps. I don't want to have 7 children, but wouldn't it be nice for everybody if there really was a Nanny McPhee for those in need. I highly recommend this movie. Especially for those with kids.
