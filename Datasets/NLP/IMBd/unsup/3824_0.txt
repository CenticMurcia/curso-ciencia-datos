Between this CBS Made-for-TV movie and the similarly titled SciFi Original "Locusts: the 8th Plague," 2005 was one whopper of a year for killer locusts. It's bad enough we have our hands full in the Middle East, but now the U.S. Department of Agriculture has its hands full with locusts. Surprisingly, the CBS movie had much better special effects. But otherwise "The 8th Plague" was a better, if predictable, movie. The problem with "Locusts" is that it's not really a horror movie. It's almost like the producers said, "Let's figure out what would happen if we had to deal with a swarm of locusts and film it documentary-style." I expect blood and guts when I watch these movies, which there is very little of here. To be honest, this movie is probably a little better than the 1 I gave it -- at least the lady who plays Xena the Warrior Princess was good in this movie. And "The 8th Plague" is probably a little worse than the 4 I gave that movie. But it's the principle that matters. Maybe the CBS locusts and the SciFi locusts can get together in a future movie and have a throw-down brawl, a la Freddy vs. Jason, and we can really figure out who's badder.
