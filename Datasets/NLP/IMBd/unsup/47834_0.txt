This title is not originally meant to be a sequel.Not just because there is a 25 year gap, also there is no connectivity between two story lines.Only connection available is the former antagonist. And he is seen like 5 minutes. People may think that all the negative opinions may not reflect the truth or not objective. I' m sorry they are objective.There is not even one good point about this movie.The original one had a weird, awful storyline, plot, as a matter of fact a meaning.Deep down there, you may understand the work.But this title; well nothing more than a scary movie trial.Same solid lack of storyline, same concrete example of NOT acting.Well, there are certain examples special effects which are not bad indeed. But that fact doesn't help. As the result, this movie is nothing more than a shell. There is no inside. Just a commercial thing using the name of a cult movie. .If you have time and if you have really no reason to do something else, go watch.
