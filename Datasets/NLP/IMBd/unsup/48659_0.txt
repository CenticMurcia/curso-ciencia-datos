This movie should have been released on DVD first because its only worth a one day rental. Robin Williams is very bad in this flick - so is the director (who has seen better days). I could have written a much better and clever script. I guess producers think: lets take Sonnenfeld and a dd a bit Robin Williams - and voil√†: we have a hit!<br /><br />The story is predictable so are the actors. One has the feeling to have seen this or that scene in another movie already. For example: National Lampoon's Vacation on the other side was fresh and gaudy for the days it was shot. Everyone remembers that film. I spun off several sequels. Who would think that this poor movie would spin off anything. Let alone Robin Williams, I guess he would rather have his name removed from the credit. He has seen better days.<br /><br />Well, this movie stinks and I am sorry for every cent and dime I paid to see it.
