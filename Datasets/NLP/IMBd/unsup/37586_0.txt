This movie tries to have you believe you are actually watching a top rated film. The truth, however, is that it is not even worth to be rated as a "B" movie. Actions follow each other with an unbelievable speed and despite all that, the movie is leading nowhere. I have seen passenger 57 and the story somewhat matches. That movie was also not as believable as I had hoped. This movie cannot begin to compare with passenger 57. And why is that commando's always think so high of themselves? "Let me go up there and I'll solve the problem". Sure! Then shooting around in an airplane as if you're on the ground, is also not the best idea. Normally the bad guys know about this. In this case they and FBI agents seem unaware of this fact. No, I would suggest you find yourself another movie to watch!
