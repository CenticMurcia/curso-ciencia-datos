I Just watched this last night for the first and last time. This one was about an 18 year old girl who didn't have a Sweet 16..so she is making it up for herself by having a sweet 18.I read the reviews here and most of them were talking about how rude these brats are to their parents.but the most thing i noticed is that they really give them selves credit for nothing.All that i was hearing is that she wants to show the girls at her school how so damn rich she is,and how sexy and how wonderful and how she deserves the 300 grands that her daddy-her incompetent daddy-payed for her "bash of the decade". "AWWWW the girls are gonna be so jealous,i have to show everybody how rich i am,we get money to spend it,right daddy? whatever makes you happy sweet heart"!!!!!! she was literally carried on a throne,with a snake around her hand..a snake that she kept whining over cuz her sweet daddy couldn't get it on time! She states proudly at the end of the episode that her dad spent over 300 grands for this party and got her a car.and that she deserves every penny cuz she is a princess. i am not blaming her am blaming her parents,Who managed to teach her how to be a waste of skin. what is the matter with you girl? Who named you the sun and put every single person around you just spinning around you in your little sick galaxy.what did you offer the world.what good have done to anything around you?!you are not capable to face the world.I hope time will be a better teacher for these girls than their pathetic sad parents!!<br /><br />i don't know why i felt like the world is falling apart around me when i was watching this.WHat in the World has gotten to us!!! Did i mention how Fake and cheesy she seemed.Its like they like being on TV so they have to be swearing all the time at their parents and burning then down to ashes with these creepy yet hilarious stares. OK,i'm done!!
