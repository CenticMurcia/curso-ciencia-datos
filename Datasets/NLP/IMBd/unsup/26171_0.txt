This is a then-topical lightweight comedy about the perils of inflation. Not terrible but nothing special, either. It reminds me of other comedies from that era like Harper valley, PTA, which must've looked good on paper. The cast is game and an opportunity to see Jessica Lange's incredible beauty is always welcome.
