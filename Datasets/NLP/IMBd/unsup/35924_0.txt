Has no one in Hollywood a vehicle for James Wood? This is tragic, awful, self-conscious soft-porn. Heart of gold, med student, the whole painful project is an ordeal to watch...and I was unable to go beyond a half hour, I confess. <br /><br />JW: my heart breaks to see what you have cast before salacious trotters. If I were a producer, I'd hire you in a hearbeat. I know you can still menace, can still show depth, can still out-act the handsome rockjaws and the grotesque Brody's every bit as well as Rush or F.Murray ....<br /><br />No one will see your fine work here- and I'm sure you know that too. God bless, -A Fan
