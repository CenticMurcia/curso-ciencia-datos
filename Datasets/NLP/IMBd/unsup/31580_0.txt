this is one of my favourite movies. i always wanted it since i saw the trailers for it on TV in the cinema last year and luckily got it on DVD last Christmas. i still don't understand the story now about if Charlie was part of the dad or a thing that went into different people , cos what was with the pervy next door neighbour ??? still confused now and I've watched it lots of times. it was the first 15 rated movie i saw and it was really good ! the storyline is wicked and i never get bored of watching it, kind of disgusting some of it, but I'm only 14 so i haven't seen any films worse than that,(yet).first time watching it i had to keep pausing it. i recommend it to everyone !!! xxx- Madison -xxx
