From director Luis Llosa (Anaconda), I recognised the title immediately and remembered seeing a short trailer with the leading actor, so I decided to give it a try. Basically Ray Quick (Razzie nominated Sylvester Stallone) used to work for the CIA as a explosives expert, and he is now living as an outsider somewhere in Miami, Florida. He is hired by May Munro, living under the name Adrian Hastings (Razzie winning Sharon Stone) to help get revenge on those responsible for killing her parents Stan (Chase Randolph) and Alice (Jeana Bell) when she was young (Brittany Paige Bouck). Ray agrees to do this and manages to kill three of the mobsters, blowing them up, but one of them is Tomas Leon (The Dark Knight's Eric Roberts), son of crime boss Joe Leon (Razzie nominated Rod Steiger), and Ray's original friend, now enemy, Ned Trent (James Woods) is helping hunt down Ray as the murderer. Ray becomes suspicious of May, thinking that she has set him up, but they do eventually do team up to go against the bad guys. Also starring Mario Ernesto Sánchez as Charlie and Sergio Doré Jr. as Strongarm. Stallone is alright, Stone is her usual sexy and husky self, but she isn't great, but the big problem is that the explosions are mixed about in a stupidly paced film, so apart from these explosions, there's not much to be interested in. It won the Razzie for Worst Screen Couple for Stallone and Stone (tied with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles), and it was nominated for Worst Picture. Adequate!
