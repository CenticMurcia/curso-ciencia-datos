This movie is based on a supposedly genuine piece of film which depicts a family being terrorised and eventually kidnapped by aliens. As to whether or not this movie is based on TRUE EVENTS I cannot say, but i can say that as a believer I think that all the people represented in this movie by actors were abducted by aliens. My decision may be biased due to the fact that I believe in aliens.<br /><br />The movie is basically a typical thanksgiving dinner gone horribly wrong. Aliens begin to attack! All of the events are taped on video by a 17 year old boy. Eventually as two of the sons go missing one of the group goes into a comatose-like state and eventually dies. A young girl whom is seemingly possessed then unloads a gun and at the end supposedly opens the door for the aliens. The group also retreat outside and are followed. One character in particular is felt sorry for and that is the old lady. She is in a state of distraught and denial in several parts of the movie and ends up speaking to her dead husband. This was not a review but a list of key events that may interest you enough as to make you see the movie for yourself. The actors also are very convincing because they do not take turns to talk but argue and debate over each other. The best actor in this movie by far is Gillian Barber who plays the eldest of the characters.She is truly a master of sending the message that she is TRULY scared. I really felt sorry for her during the course of this movie.BRAVO GILLIAN BRAVO!
