This movie is a delightful surprise. We were invited to a sneak preview by our local newspaper. We had no idea in was a documentary as the movie began, we were immediately caught up in the drama of the story line. The stories portrayed were fascinating and well developed. I think the movie is classified as a documentary only because everything in it is a true account of events happening to real people. This movie is about the real people of America - the stars could be our next door neighbors as well as the icons we admire. It is inspiring to imagine that former president Clinton is sitting in his kitchen working on the same Times crossword puzzle that we are. I would nominate this movie for an academy award in the best picture category as well as in the best director category.
