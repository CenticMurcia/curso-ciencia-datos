Avoid this movie like the plague! This stinks so bad it's like the worst thing ever put on film. It ranks "up" there with an Ed Wood flick.<br /><br />However there is something that may make you watch it - it "stars" Keanu Reeves! Holy maceral! I wondered if there was another actor similar to Jack Nicholson who was completely untalented at the start of their career and later developed into a star... it's Keanu Reeves. (But his performance in "Bill and Ted's Adventures" was cool.)<br /><br />Burn the master... they don't allow negative scores on IMDb.com... 1/10<br /><br />-Zafoid<br /><br />PS: Some real good music.<br /><br />-Z
