"As Good as it Gets" shows that comedies can have something more than laughs and silliness.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson (playing Melvin Udall, a very unusual man) and Helen Hunt (playing Carol, a very nice waitress and an ordinary person) really deserved the Oscar. I've already known that Nicholson was a great actor, but Helen surprised me. She's a wonderful and graceful actress; one of my favorite ones. Her character has the gift to change the life of a cold and boring man like Melvin. I think Greg Kinnear should have won the Oscar (he's much more better than Robin Williams).<br /><br />I can compare "As Good as it Gets" with another great comedy released recently - "Notting Hill". They both show you the disabilities and the joy of ordinary people (even if he is a maniac man, like Melvin Udall, or the most famous movie star, like Anna Scott - Julia Roberts - in "Notting Hill").<br /><br />I think this film wouldn't be very good with other actors, but it's a very human comedy and it had the attention it deserved.<br /><br />9/10
