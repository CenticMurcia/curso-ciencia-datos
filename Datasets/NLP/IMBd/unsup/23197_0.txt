"Lois and Clark" was more or less a replacement for me, after "Charmed" stopped coming on TV here. Before "Lois and Clark" there was something my mother liked to watch, and so I did with her. After that "Lois and Clark" came on TV, and so I got addicted to this show. I wasn't a Superman-fan before this. I thought it was something for little boys. But when I saw "Lois and Clark", I realized it wasn't at all just for little boys. The excitement, the romance, was also meant for an older audience. <br /><br />I have not seen all episodes, because I did not watch it when Charmed was on TV. I think I started watching somewhere in the second season, but I think it's a pity I didn't see it before.<br /><br />The actors are great - I have read that Dean Cain preferred being Clark. If so, it's hardly noticed(by me)! I used to think Superman and Clark were played by two different actors. This shows how good the disguise was... Although I do think Lois has been quite stupid, not noticing that whenever Superman turned up, Clark was gone. But, of course, that was part of the whole story.<br /><br />The chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher is amazing. Superman is the hero, but he never acted as though he was more important than anyone else. In the beginning, when you just see Superman and Clark, you might think Superman is arrogant, but when you know him better, he's not at all arrogant. Clark seems a softy in the beginning, but also when you get to know him better, he's different. <br /><br />Martha and Jonathan Kent seem the perfect parents. They are understanding and independent, which shows how good their actors are. The other actors also played their roles very well. <br /><br />This TV show is amazing - still popular while it's been of the network for quite a long time already!
