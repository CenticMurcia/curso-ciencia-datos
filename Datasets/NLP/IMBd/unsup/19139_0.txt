I don't know if directors, screen players or others in the team ever go to analyze the culture of one nation before recording a movie, which has to do with the part of new world history. KFOR troops suffered first victim in 2001, in an accident shooting, and fact is that KLA has never attacked NATO troops, they were allies. Every movie that describes history in a wrong way is to be judged. I have seen the movie out of curiosity, but this production is far far away from qualitative movie. My tip for directors is: before you shoot a movie, analyze the culture of the people first... On the other hand, KFOR soldiers were not positioned in mountains and rural areas of Kosovo, they were positioned in towns, villages and populated areas. Serb soldiers have fled Kosovo one week after KFOR troops marched. If you make a movie just to show the action, then don't use someone else suffering to create so called art, but create a fiction story, don't mess with people feelings, or on the other hand, gather facts and then create a realistic movie, what has happened... but it looks like Spanish troops in Kosovo were partying more than others, and have done a movie just to show how "brave" they are.... pity, shame for world cinematography... Spain is not for action, I say stick with Almodavar
