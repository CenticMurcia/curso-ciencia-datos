In a time when movies like Primer and The Man From Earth are showing us that great films can be made on a shoestring budget, Limbo acts as a cautionary tale that small films can still be terrible.<br /><br />The story is derivative of a series of derivative films. Clearly taken from Groundhog Day, which was taken from the film 12:01, which was based on the incredible independent short 12:01, Limbo offers nothing new to the story beyond a tacked-on attempt at a film noir mystery.<br /><br />The acting is poor, flat and unengaging. The cinematography is pretentious with the DP constantly attempting to do something with film that is far beyond his reach. The music is sad, sounding like the incidental music one would hear in a 90's interactive cd-rom title. The dialog is simply laughable from the first line spoken to the end, both in writing and delivery.<br /><br />This film is by no means a masterpiece, it's not even passable. Comparing this to films like Momento and Fight Club is like comparing Lord Of The Rings to fanfics. Feels like a student film by someone who is minoring in film studies at the University of Nevada. And a C- film at that.<br /><br />All and all, normally I would have given this film 3 stars as it's a step above some youtube videos I've seen lately. However as I feel the average rating should reflect the quality of the film I am sending in a 1 star review to try to balance the score against these bizarrely skewed priors (I am seriously suspicious that they were written by friends and family of cast and crew).<br /><br />To sum up, Limbo is an example that, even in an age where anyone is capable of making a film, you should really think twice about whether your passion for film isn't overshadowed by your lack of talent and vision. Skip this dog.
