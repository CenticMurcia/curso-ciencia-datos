I watched this film with my father and it was truly a worthwhile experience. The documentary is about a father and son who travel around the world and the development of their relationship as they talk with other fathers and sons in various countries. This is a great movie to watch because everyone needs a father, biological or not, and one often loses sight of how important the influence of a father can be. At times it will make you laugh, at times it will make you cry, and occasionally you will laugh and cry simultaneously. It was just a great experience for me and my father to watch together.
