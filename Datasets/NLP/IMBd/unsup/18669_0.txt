I went to Stage Beauty with my boyfriend on Sunday afternoon and we both loved it. Stage Beauty is just about the best movie I've seen in the last year or so. Billy Crudup produces an exemplary performance and if there is a god he should be getting nominated for an Academy Award for best actor. He was very good in "Jesus' Son", but in this film Billy proves that he can do anything convincingly. <br /><br />The film is also unique in the way the main character deals with his self-awareness of sexuality and gender identity. I am not aware of another film that gives so much informed food for thought in this area.<br /><br />There's a strong supporting cast - especially Rupert Everett (who deserves a Supporting Actor nomination) - plus plenty of laughs, stunning visuals and a script to die for. The romance is also tantalisingly developed - a rare element these days.
