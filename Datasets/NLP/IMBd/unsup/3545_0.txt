I was prepared for this movie to be sub-par. However, I did not think that this movie would sink this low whatsoever. To say this movie brings out the best in Christianity, TBN, and Chinese culture would be greatly misleading. In fact its an insult to people who study Asia or Christianity at any length.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie begins in "1941" in "Shanghai". I use quotations because I don't believe either to be true. Somehow Japanese troops take their house and bomb the pond. And when the Japanese troops spoke Japanese, the subtitle was "Asian Talking".<br /><br />But that confusion is not all. Somehow, we are transported to the 1950s in a post-Civil War China. Yet, little damage is seen to Shanghai. I highly doubt the city was fully rebuilt in only a few years, especially after years of conflict.<br /><br />Somehow, through writing, she becomes Christian again because she could hear God in the wind and chalkboard. Yet, everybody is speaking English. But when Mandarin Chinese (I assume its Mandarin) is spoken, its also couched as "Asian Talking". But not only that, its usually only spoken in a 'evil' tone.<br /><br />In dealing with the CCP authorities, she doesn't say the right things and it lead to more hardship. Her arrogant tone in trying to have a hate/hate relationship with the authorities has nothing to do with being Christian. In fact, her character was mostly counter-productive.<br /><br />She marries, has kids, but lives in a camp for a while. Why? Because she is moronic and didn't flee to Hong Kong earlier. Neither did her father, who could have fled there long ago and avoided this stupidity.<br /><br />Overall, the acting was phony. The story was ridiculous, especially if she claims she said all those things. I thought the effects were miserable. Why did they use American jeeps in the film? Why did her Chinese classroom have Filipinos, Indians, and a Japanese teacher trying to be "Chinese" students? This is a reason why TBN should NEVER make films if its focus is to win converts. Instead, it makes Christianity look bad. Only worth watching again for pain and laughter. "F"
