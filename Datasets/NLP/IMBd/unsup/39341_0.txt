This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why did Dennis Quaid star in this? I picked this one up at the Redbox. I misread the plot. I thought it was about 4 people who had one thing in common, they were all the bringers of the apocalypse. I thought they were the 4 Horsemen. Instead, we get a cheap rip off of 7even. It tries so hard to be suspenseful, scary, creepy, etc. The movie was very boring. I wasn't the slightest bit thrilled or given the creeps. The movie is basically about 4 serial killers who base their killings off the 4 Horsemen of the apocalypse in the bible. The serial killers kill their victims by suspending them in the air with hooks digging into their backs. The more they squirm, the more they bleed. The even post it on the internet where supposedly, millions of teenage serial killers are watching. This is a rip-off of FearDotCom and another film which I can't think of the name right now.<br /><br />There are plenty of plot holes and problems in this film. I would strongly recommend you avoid this part if you don't want to be spoiled: <br /><br />1. Alex's Bedroom: Late into the film, Aidan enters his son's bedroom and finds white paint everywhere! Alex has been painting his room white for 3 years. His father hasn't been in his Alex's room for 3 years. This is stupid. Wouldn't Sean, the younger brother or Aidan smell the fumes coming from the paint from Alex's bedroom? Everything in his room has been painted. His bed, pillow, sheets, walls, ceiling, floor, possessions, computer, etc. Everything has been painted white! Wouldn't Aidan or Sean notice the smell of new or fresh paint coming from Alex's bedroom? Big, BIG plot hole! Also, wouldn't Alex have been so sick to the point that the poor kid is bedridden. He hasn't been that sick in 3 years? No colds, flues, food poisoning, etc? I usually get colds about once or twice a year.<br /><br />2. The 4 Suspension Rigs: The suspension rigs are about the size of my bed. It is a queen size bed. These rigs would be pretty suspicious if a bunch of teenagers were buying them. Wouldn't somebody notice these kids unloading these things and putting them into abandoned buildings? Also, when the cops go to the store where they bought them, the owner of the store says he's only sold 4 of them to a bunch of teenagers. Yet, the store owner doesn't act suspicious or anything! What do 4 teenagers need 4 suspension rigs for? Why not just buy one and rinse whatever you need to rinse in alcohol so you don't get an infection? Is rinsing suspension rig hooks in alcohol too much of a chore? <br /><br />3. Alex: I knew he was one of the Horsemen right when I first saw him act shy, blame his father for not being there for his mother when she was dying of cancer, taking care of Sean while his father is busy working, etc. It was so obvious he was one of them. This was only 20 minutes into the film.<br /><br />4. The Ending: At the end when Aidan comes home after his son dies, he wakes up Sean and Sean asks where Alex is. After telling Sean not to worry about Alex, the credits start rolling. I'm not even kidding. That's the ending. I expected a funeral before the credits started rolling. You usually get that in movies but not in this one.<br /><br />There is one scene that just bugged me. There was a homosexual who invites his bigoted brother to a restaurant to chat. Instead, he drugs his coffee and takes him to an abandoned building and hooks him up to a rig. Before his brother wakes up, he fills a syringe up with a medicine of some kind. I think it might have been PCP or a very powerful drug like morphine. After he does this, he wakes up his brother and proceeds to kill himself in a very gruesome manner in front of him. He tells his brother he must do this because he is gay and that he doesn't deserve to live in this world.<br /><br />That is unacceptable. There are hundreds of gay teenagers all over the country who kill themselves. We shouldn't use a scene like that in this movie. Who knows, this movie might make the problem worse. Maybe some heterosexual will get the idea that if they cuss, taunt, and harass them enough, they'll kill themselves. This is very inappropriate and very, very dangerous. The movie could have done without this scene.<br /><br />That's most of the movie. I hope Dennis Quaid chooses better roles. I would hate to see his career wind up in the toilet cause he chose to star in a lot of bad movies.<br /><br />I give this movie 1 star out of 10.
