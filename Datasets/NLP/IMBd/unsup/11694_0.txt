This is a movie that people should be forced to see! It is an amazing display of the facts. These are real issues that everyone is going to have to deal with! The problems are not going to be solved by pointing fingers and expecting our governments to mitigate the problem, the problem lies within us as consumers! It is time that we look to our own lives and determine how we can live with far less than we currently do. The people that can grasp this concept will be far better off than those who are stuck in the past. Relocalization, reduction, more efficient use of energy and a serious reduction in consumption are great first starts. <br /><br />Thanks Basil for the great movie, I look forward to your next film!
