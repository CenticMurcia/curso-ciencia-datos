This is an excellent scifi. The genre is usually dominated by "touchy-feely" stories which have men exposing their soft gooey center, or "horror" stories which have men exposing their soft gooey center. In either case man is shredded into little pieces for the audiences pleasure. I find both of these types to not be "scifi" I think of them as "fantasy with the watchable part being scifi."<br /><br />This movie avoids the pitfalls of femininazation and horrorization (is that redundant? :) and instead remains true to the original intent of the genre' - a true scifi. 9/10<br /><br />I found the ending annoying, which if cut would push this movie up to 9.5/10. But half-a-point does not ruin this movie at all. If you like *REAL* scifi's, like this one, then also see the movie version of "Lost in Space."<br /><br />-Zafoid<br /><br />PS: Kudos to the special effects. They were absolutely brilliant - from equipment to backdrops and the robotics!<br /><br />-Z
