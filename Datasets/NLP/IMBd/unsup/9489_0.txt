This is my first time watched movie directed by Kim Ki-Duk. I was quite shocked about story line. One bad guy(he is a pimp) suddenly fall in love with college girl, but she made embarrassed him in front of peoples, so he trapped her to become a hooker. This is short story. you might think not that special. You gotta see then feel! He used paper to kill. He never talked a word in the whole movie except once. Bad Guy is really unique style movie. I gave it 10.
