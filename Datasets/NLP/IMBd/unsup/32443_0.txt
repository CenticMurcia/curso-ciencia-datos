I kept going from laughing to feeling almost physical pain, so completely awful it was. All of the other comments are right. Some time later I accidentally caught a TV special about either the movie or J.M.Vincent (I think it was a about him, one of those Hollywood true story shows). They said JMV had a huge drinking problem (it's also in the trivia) and that when he got on board the producers or whatever hadn't met him. Most of the time he couldn't remember his lines, or mumbled them out, or just got totally spaced out watching nothing, just frozen. Towards the end it was the best of the worst, with that shadow creeping over the astronaut face... want to know what happened? Watch it and suffer. I'm thinking about renting it and watching it whole. I'm a masochist.
