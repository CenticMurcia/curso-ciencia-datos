I don't know if this movie uses a little or a lot the author's own past, but it could have, it is, somehow, very much like a memory exploration (and it talks a lot about memory actually : remembering school pals, remembering teachers word, remembering the 19th, etc.). The storyline is a mess, but that is not the point, this movie doesn't offer a message like "the good one wins", "the girl married the nice guy". The image is fantastic sometimes. The acting is great. The whole thing reminds me a lot of Mark Kalesniko's comic book called "Alex" (a very good comic book, too)
