Just watched the movie at the LONG ISLAND INTERNATIONAL FILM EXPO on Long Island, New York. What a great film! More films should be made like this one. Audiences wait for a movie like this to hit the screen as it gives them a reason to feel a film, instead of just watching one. I really enjoyed the story and the depth of the characters. I learned after the film that it was semi-autobiographical of the writer/director Carl Thibault. I also learned that this was his first film, and what a way out of the gate! His direction was flawless and the performances he got from his ensemble cast came together to execute a story that was truly heartfelt! The photography alone is a reason to see this film!
