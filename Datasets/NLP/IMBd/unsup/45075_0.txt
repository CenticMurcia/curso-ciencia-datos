I saw this movie yesterday and was surprised to find only a few other people in the theater. It's shame too since everyone who was in the theater for BLUE CRUSH missed a fun, exciting, and hilarious sci-fi adventure. I later found out the movie was suppose to come out in April of 2001. I guess the long-delay gave people the feeling that this was a bad movie, but the truth is this isn't a bad movie. It's a great movie. It's full of fantastic special effects, intelligent humor, and good performances by the talented cast. This is a movie that I think will do better on video than it will in theaters, though I'd encourage people to go see it. It has a very original concept and proves that Ron Underwood is America's most underrated director. Four Stars.
