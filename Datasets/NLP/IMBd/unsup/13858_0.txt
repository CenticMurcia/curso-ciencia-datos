This film is just the best. A pure joy.<br /><br />It is a remarkably good representation of the comic strip "Lil Abner," which was incredibly popular across America for many, many years. It is very sophisticated humor disguised as a bunch of yokels with no apparent education.<br /><br />The actors and actresses in this film are magical here. Peter Palmer is absolutely perfect as Abner, and may well be the most gorgeous man to ever live. Stubby Kaye makes you feel like you really have walked into Dogpatch USA in his role as Marrying Sam. There's not a weak performance in the whole lot. And one AMAZING surprise awaits you when you see the Dogpatch girls singing "Put 'Em Back the Way They Was" and notice that a very young VALERIE HARPER is one of the Dogpatch girls! Long before she gained fame on Mary Tyle Moore and her own shows, she sang and danced in "Lil Abner"! Who knew?! It is hard to imagine a more wonderful musical than this. The great Johnny Mercer wrote brilliant & memorable songs for it, which will have your heart singing for days. This movie is an absolute MUST-SEE.
