Please give me a break. You have the opportunity of a decent sound track, a good cast, and you come out with this drivel. The film makers must, if not be ashamed of themselves ,must wonder what they were thinking of. My head hurts after this. Watch at your own peril.I can not repeat that this movie must not be seen by anyone at all, not ever please.<br /><br />There are parts which would entice self harm it was that bad.There was<br /><br />one really good scene when the boy runs away,run run with him. No it is really that tiresome that I feel the need to fill 10 lines of please don't watch this garbage.I really do not usually moan about a film but this needs to be stopped.
