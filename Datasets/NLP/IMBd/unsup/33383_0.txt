I read some reviews before I rented this little movie and I heard that the quality wasn't that great but i decided to try it out. BIG BIG MISTAKE. Well actually I love watching horrible movies because then at least i can laugh and wonder why anyone would ever make this. First of all it looks like someone took my video camera and decided to do a student film. You can see the camera shaking and you can hear the camera man moving the camera to get different shots. Haha, that amused me. The acting is horrible. haha and man the story itself was just bad. Being sold to white slavery...trying to be funny? Sorry you failed and made me go LAME. Haha this movie...this movie... if you want to see a good movie go see Latter Days or something! Don't SEE THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE READY TO HIDE YOUR FACE IN YOUR PILLOW BECAUSE YOU FEEL SO BAD FOR THE ACTORS.
