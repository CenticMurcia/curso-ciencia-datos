Hackneyed dialogue, every cop show cliche you can think of, car chases that defy physics, a boom mike in the apartment, ill-timed "humorous" scenes, and a predictable ending. Adam Ant turns in a respectable performance but everyone else falls flat. See it if you're a diehard Sharon Stone fan but otherwise the movie offers nothing you haven't seen a hundred (thousand?) times before.
