I am rating this film based on my memory of it through the eyes of a child who enjoyed it and who loved little Volkswagen Beetles, possibly in part because of this film. As I am rating it from a child's point of view and have not seen it since then, keep in mind that as an adult, the enjoyment may have run out. I thought that it was a fun film, and it seems to be well-received by a wider audience too, based on other reviews and remakes/sequels. I also have seen at least four cars over here in England that look like Herbie and have various 'HERBIE' personalised licence plates and markings. It's a fun film (for children, anyway), and the old VW is pretty cool.
