given this is a short, the viewer is fooled by grasping a lot in a small amount of time. this was made possible by a superb cast and talented writing. since "fine lines" between anything in life prove to always be a more complex and deeper matter that what is seen at the surface, it is truly a feat that this film gives the viewer a chance to see both sides of a very entertaining situation. in the dating game, perceptions of cute and creepy are in the eye of the beholder--and in this case, the eyes and minds of the viewers of the film as they are allowed to draw their own conclusions and create their own definitions of two seemingly different words in our vernacular. i enjoyed this film for its blurring of lines and boundaries and for making me redefine my own perceptions, it only for a short amount of time.
