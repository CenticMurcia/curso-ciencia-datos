In Illinois, while chasing a Djinn in an old building, Dean is attacked by the creature and faints. When he wakes-up, he is in Kansas, living with the sexy Carmen; his mother Mary is alive; Sam is graduated in Law School and engaged with Jessica, but they do not have a good relationship. Dean wonders whether his innermost wishes have been granted by the Djinn, but he is haunted by visions of a weird young woman.<br /><br />"What Is and What Should Never Be" is another great episode of the Second Season, actually one of the best of this series. The acting is top-notch and the dramatic story with another reality is excellent. One of the funniest moments is when Dean questions whether the Dijnn gave a "supernatural acid" to him. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Apenas um Sonho" ("Just a Dream")
