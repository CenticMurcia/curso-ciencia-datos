When I buy a movie (Usually a sequel) I expect that movie to be reasonably the same theme and plot to that of its predecessors Amityville curse is one of the worst sequels in the history of sequels. I am not joking. If you are curious about buying the movie becuause its the only "Amityville Related Topic" you haven't seen - Please dont let curiosity get the better of you! The only reason they called this movie Amityville curse was to attract the attention of the public into buying and watching the movie. The facts are plain - This is not Amityville. The infamous long island house which we see in many of the true Amityville movies and most strikingly "Amityville horror" is not present in this movie. The house is not amityville, just some other house in the town of amityville - Terrible!!! (I like the amityville movies becuase of the house - This decieved me into buying this trash!)<br /><br />The acting is so bad its not possible to comprehend and the script is awful. I still fail to see why the guy's who made this film went through the process to acquire permission to use the "Amityville rights" which would have cost money. (The book was a hans holzer novel) but when they got permission they did not use the amityville style house or anything for that matter! This movie is a disaster and is inconsistant with the others. If you have any sense you will take a look at the other reviews and follow their advice in AVOIDING this mess of a movie. (I bought it just to see if it was all true about it being a pile of junk and it was!!!!!!)<br /><br />Watch this movie and you will suffer the curse of boredom, terrible acting, stupid scripts, awful effects and a pompas storyline.<br /><br />The only way this movie could have worked is if they had seperated it from amityville franchise. Making this a seperate haunted house movie may have been OK, but as we all know its supposed to be amityville its laughable.<br /><br />well... what can I say...<br /><br />This is not Amityville 5... I suggest you watch Amityville dollhouse or Amityville 1992.<br /><br />They ALL beat this by miles!!!!!!<br /><br />***AVOID***<br /><br />
