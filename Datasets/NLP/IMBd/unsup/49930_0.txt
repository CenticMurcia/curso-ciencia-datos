Hi, I saw Double Take. It was complete and utter garbage. I was so sick to my stomach and was mad that i wasted money on it. It was completely stupid with an impossible plot to follow, and the only parts that were funny had been extremely over used in the commercials. I dont want a yardburger, cult 45, or to ever see that that godless sick twisted movie ever agian.
