The Pack a.k.a. The Long Dark Night (1977) was another one of those "nature rebels against man" films that were cranked out during the seventies. This time it's dogs and that's where this movie went to. Joe Don Baker and some residents of a Pacific Northwestern town must contend with a pack of mean and wild dogs who decide that they've had it with man. Dogs of all shapes and sizes join together to try and defeat man. Can Joe Don Baker and the beleaguered residents ward off the mangy mutts throughout the long dark night?<br /><br />It's a real cheesy movie that's no great shakes. But if you could find a copy watch it with some friends so you can get a few laughs. I highly doubt that this movie was intended to be a comedy but that's how it turned out. Many of these films were pretty hokey and this one is no exception. The problem with most of these films is that they try too hard. The film makers forget that they're making a cheap animal exploitation film.<br /><br />Not recommended, unless you're extremely bored.
