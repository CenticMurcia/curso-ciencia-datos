I saw "Son of Dracula" when it was first released and six times over the following months. It was not a "B" picture, but had top billing on double features in first, second and third-run movie theaters in my home town. When I first saw it I believe the second feature was "The Mad Ghoul," starring George Zucco. Even as an 11-year old I thought Lon Chaney Jr. was an odd choice to play the Dracula role, although I was a Chaney fan since I had seen "The Wolf Man." (I even wrote to him and got an autographed photo that I still have.) However, I loved the eerie atmosphere, especially in the jail cell scene, with the muted trumpet playing in the background and what is apparently a dead tree silhouetted against the sky seen through the high window. I recently watched it again on DVD and the moody background still is impressive, and I think in an understated way more so than the modern computerized special effects in movies.
