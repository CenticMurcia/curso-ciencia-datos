I watched this movie at a bad movie festival that included "Plan Nine from Outer Space". Plan 9 made me laugh my head off; this one caused me to look at my watch every two minutes to try to see how much longer it could possibly last. The most unfunny comedy I have ever seen; it wasn't even unintentionally funny.
