First of all, this movie is painful. Downright painful. It's really nothing more than an incest sex story soft-core porn. First, the Dad brings home the daughter a "special gift" and let's her know she's extra special. Then they kill him off (5 minutes in to the film) and the family moves back with the crazy grandparents in a Transylvanian-type mansion where the grandmother strips the mother down to her panties and whips her in front of the grandfather... the reason?? Her husband was her uncle. Yes folks, the kids are inbred. Then, the grandmother makes a big deal about the kids sleeping in the same bed. Finally the girl (who's supposed to be like 11 or 12 or something) practically masturbates in the bathtub while the brother sponges her down. Creeeeepy.... Oh, and the acting on a porno would be a step up from this travesty of a film.
