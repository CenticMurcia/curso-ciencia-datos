What a fantastic movie! Great characters you can't help but love, a quirky upbeat soundtrack and 100 minutes of pure fun! You really go on the journey with these characters and are excited by their relationships and antics. Excellent performances, fantastic cinematography and loads of laughs (fabulous writing and direction). GamerZ shows the comic side of Gaming and has characters everyone will recognise. Dungeons and Dragons took itself too seriously - this takes us back to the fun element of role-playing games and you really get involved with the game young Ralph has created. This is a film for everyone, we all know these people and it's interesting to see how a single interest can connect such different people. They may well be pariahs but you can't help but like them. Although the film is set in Glasgow it could be anywhere, any university campus with any group of people with a single interest. It's truly a universal film. There are some fabulous comedy moments which really do have you laughing out loud. I urge everyone to see this film. You don't have to have been a Gamer to enjoy this film, I'm not and I loved it. Give us more, Pure Magic Films - PLEASE!
