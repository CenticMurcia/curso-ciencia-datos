I recently saw a brief clip on (I can't remember what) channel interviewing a Vietnam War era fighter pilot who skirmished with four or five MIGs to save his downed buddy and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, or something nearly as prestigious and darned if I wasn't looking into the face of actor Roger Perry 40 years hence! <br /><br />I began thinking the actor who played the '60's fighter pilot in this episode left Hollywood, joined the air force, went to war and became a hero. A little research, of course, shows Roger Perry continuing to act through the '70's, and I never did catch the name of the well-regarded Phantom pilot being interviewed in that short news sequence.<br /><br />Perhaps the script for "Tomorrow is Yesterday" has not yet been been played out.
