I had never heard of the movie before but when they showed it on TV it had a great review and since I like everybody from the Friends cast very much I thought let's give it a try. And I am so glad I did. The actors did a great job and I am surprised you only hear so little about them (beside David Schwimmer). David was cast totally against his Ross character from Friends and I think he pulled it off very well. The actors who portrayed Jay, Sam and Andrea were very good, too. The story is told in flashbacks to a really funny couple and there is some great dialogue in this one. A really pleasant surprise, give it a try!
