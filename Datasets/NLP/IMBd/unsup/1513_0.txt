I watched this twice this day and then hollered for my husband to see this. He actually laughed aloud during scenes where I rolled my eyes. HOWEVER, I must add that I too had a fun time. I DID enjoy the premise meaning the interaction/interjection of the '40's film noir characters slipped into this.<br /><br />I also admit that going in I knew that the combo of Steve Martin with Carl Reiner's direction it was going to be somewhat silly but wow, it was done wonderfully..AND again I had a fun time. Being that gorgeous Rachel Ward agreed to costar in this was a plus...shows she had a tremendous sense of humor let alone shedding any ego.<br /><br />Oh see it...it's in the caliber of something Mel Brooks would pull-off. I DVR'd it and I may watch it another 20 times!
