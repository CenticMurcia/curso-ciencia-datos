Angelina Jolie is brilliant in her portrayal of a wealthy young woman's journey from glamorous to humanitarian. Angelina's real life journey begins coinciding with the film's-she's rich, happy, young-everything that everyone wishes they could be. But when her life is disrupted by a look at the "real" world through the eyes of a passionate and handsome man. She is shaken by the truths he shows and hopes to help the less fortunate-but it's more than she bargained for. The life she struggles to lead as a humanitarian is anything but glamorous. She quickly learns that her hopes are not the only thing she must change to survive. Her heart must have the strength to endure the mental and physical dangers of fighting the battles of poverty.
