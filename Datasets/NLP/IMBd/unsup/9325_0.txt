Watching this movie is challengingÂ… I mean it challenges your patience, even your ego, because the makers offend human intelligence with the so- predictable script. The CGI are made to show themselves as CGI, and not to create a setting or a specific background. Low budget shows the shark as a poor victim of some fish-tank. Low mobility of the monster, lesser thrilling moments than any other horror movies (I totally dislike them), the whole movie looks like a project of a junior student in cinematography studies. Don't watch it, it's not even a B category! I should, though, pay my respect to the actors, that didn't suck, even though the directing, the images and the script were totally under any level of tolerance. So, I salute them and I wish them much better movies to play in. 3/10 (5/10 for the CGI, 7/10 for the actors, 1/10 script, 2/10 editing, 2/10 director, 1/10 music- bad plagiarism of "Jaws" theme)
