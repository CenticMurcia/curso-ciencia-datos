Hmm, so many words describe this film, but only one will sum it up.<br /><br />crap.<br /><br />First off you see a man going diving, I wasn't paying much attention at that point so I wasn't completely aware of what he was doing, anyway man dies as you would expect, 6 months later man finds tooth, searches tooth on internet and decides that over the 5 or 6 species of sharks that this tooth is not there and therefor is a complete mystery and the shark obviously ends up a dinosaur.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie felt like a incomplete replica of the jaw movie's. y'know with your basic skinny dippers, shark eats through boat and swallows men, and also eventually gets blown up.<br /><br />However, what they didn't include in this movie (which in my opinion the first war of the worlds used better technology and special effects) was good actors, a good script, emotion, half the time it looked like the lady was smiling when she was obviously supposed to be doing the opposite.<br /><br />There was plenty of boob showing which probably got this film up to two (down from -0).<br /><br />But I can honestly say I had never laughed so hard at people being chewed up by this incredibly big shark which looked as though it was used from a completely different film.<br /><br />if I could I would give it a zero, that's what it needs, and by golly I hope the actors NEVER act again.
