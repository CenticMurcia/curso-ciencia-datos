This adventurous tale spends most of its time showing the hardships endured by the Rangers. Major Rogers and "Harvard" are the main characters, and they have an interesting relationship as comrades - Rogers is teaching Harvard how to be a "real man." It's almost a father/son thing they have going. Anyway, the acting isn't particularly impressive from any of the cast, but it's not terrible either, especially considering the time in which it was made. <br /><br />Speaking of which, the main problem I saw in this film is that it is quite dated in its views of morality and life. It was made during World War II, during a time you went to war and became a man through the test of battle. It shouldn't be surprising then that it glorifies war by subjugating and dehumanizing the enemies - in this case primarily Indians (Native Americans). It is a testament to the attitudes of the time that the Indians are treated mostly like slaves (good Indians) or rabid dogs (bad Indians). They really are less than human. The racism is difficult to ignore, and detracts heavily from the film.<br /><br />Overall, it was a fine movie in its time, but that time has passed, and the movie does not hold up under the scrutiny of modern values.
