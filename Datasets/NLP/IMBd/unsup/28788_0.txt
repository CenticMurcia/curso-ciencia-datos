PRC earned its reputation for bad movies, but "Border Feud" is from "The New PRC" and actually is pretty good.<br /><br />Director Ray Taylor was usually capable and, except for some script supervising or directing errors, this runs pretty smoothly.<br /><br />Al "Fuzzy" St. John would have been funnier -- seriously, he seldom makes a move that isn't at least a little funny -- if he hadn't been quite so intrusive, which is not his fault but that of the script or director.<br /><br />Most of the characters are played by competent to even talented actors, even though most of them never became stars.<br /><br />Except Al "Lash" La Rue, as it is spelled in the credits on this movie.<br /><br />He seldom gets the compliments I think he deserved. Really, he is more than competent although, as another commenter said, there should have been more whip work.<br /><br />La Rue and St. John were both very good cowboys, and "Lash" seems to have done most of his own stunt work.<br /><br />The score wasn't always appropriate but it was always nice music and composer Albert Glasser should have been given screen credit.<br /><br />To those of us for whom there is hardly such a thing as a bad western, "Border Feud," despite a misleading and pointless title, is a good one.<br /><br />My copy is on a disk from "The Treasure Box Collection," and, except for being a few generations too old, is in pretty good shape.<br /><br />There is also another Lash La Rue film, "Ghost Town Renegades," on the back side of the disk, although he is "LaRue" in that film's credits.
