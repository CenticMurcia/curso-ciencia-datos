This was on TV, with a crappy rating (1 star); I recorded it, based on liking Zellweger (how bad could it be?), and wound up liking the film, but being disappointed in René Zellweger. At one point, she does something that told me "This is a character that was written for Jennifer Aniston, but there was a schedule conflict, so they asked René Zellweger instead." René does her job, but she doesn't bring anything personal to the role. Meanwhile, the cadre of elders surrounding The Bachelor himself( Hal Hollbrook, Ed Asner, James Cromwell and !Peter Ustinov!) has many of the best lines in the film. Towards the end, it veers into surrealism, with an army of would-be brides demanding "Criteria! Criteria" as if at a labor rally, then becoming an army divided into three battalions that converge on a single SF intersection in pursuit of the Bachelor. It's worth seeing, if only for the script.
