Hell no, damn it! Okay, this very well might not be a very good movie. For one thing, the acting certainly is below par. Another thing is that the story-line has a lot of loose ends and the screenplay just rattles. But this really is a typical Yuzna-production, featuring all his well-known ingredients and, to round it up: he knows how to deliver the goods. The special effects are pretty good considering the obvious low budget. There's gore. Gratuitous nudity. An orgy-scene. A little kid gets his face completely torn in half. A cop hacks off is own limbs and enjoys it. And the main villain is creepy and scary, very reminiscent of PHANTASM's The Tall Man. Why the hell should anybody nag about an incoherent story or bad acting if you got all of the above? I for one know what to expect from a Brian Yuzna-movie, and this time he delivers. So maybe, yes, this movie doesn't really deserve 7/10, because, well, it's not as good as THE NUN, to name another Fantastic Factory production. But it still is fun and I'm rating this on an enjoyment level solely. I'd say: if you enjoyed FAUST: LOVE OF THE DAMNED, then you'll probably like BENEATH STILL WATERS too. It's just more of that lovable Yuzna-madness. And if you don't dig it, then you probably didn't like much about his other films either. Or maybe you've just outgrown his stuff. I say it's about time he directed another movie.
