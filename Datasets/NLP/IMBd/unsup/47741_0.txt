I wish I could give this film a negative number just to emphasize how AWFUL it is. To be honest, I'm not even sure how to begin to explain it. Here goes: It basically concerns a man, who's name escapes me at the moment, well, anyway, this fella has a fetish with dolls. He takes his fetish with dolls a little too far and begins killing women to make his dolls. In the end, he said he just wanted to make girl's dreams come true. That's about it folks. As stupid and amateur as can be. Usually I enjoy foreign films, but as with American films, there is plenty of junk to be had. I just wish I could get a refund! Do yourself a favor, avoid this film. And seeing that I am the first one to review it, I set the tone hopefully.
