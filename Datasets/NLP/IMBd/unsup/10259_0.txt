This film is not as bad as you might think by reading the other user comments. Of course The Inside Man is not original or artistic thriller, but I think it is far more better than an average thriller. The production values are not high, so the filmmakers haven't even try to make spectacular action-scenes. And that's good. Otherwise the film could have been unintended humorous. <br /><br />And I don't agreed what people say about the accents. Gösta Ekman's 'Swenglish' doesn't disturb me. Ekman is a charismatic actor and I like the way he talks. And i't's great to see him with such great stars as Hopper and Krüger. But I agreed with those who think that the role of Thomas Kallin should have played by someone else than Kåre Mölder. Rolf Lassgård would have been suitable for that part.
