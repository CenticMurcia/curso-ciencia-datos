More typically barmy brilliant fun from Brian Yuzna in this movie about a flooded town, the curse contained within it and the effect it starts to have on the poor, unsuspecting locals trying to get on with their lives and one particular celebratory day.<br /><br />There's really too much nonsense and ridiculousness to detail here so let me skip the in-depth analysis and get straight to the important stuff for genre fans. The cast is a very mixed bag (including, bizarrely enough, a minor British soap star in the male "hero" role) and the acting is generally quite bad but, if you're male, this is outweighed by the highly attractive women on screen most of the time. I was especially taken with Charlotte Salt as Clara, the young woman at the centre of a lot of unwanted attention. Then we have the FX work, which is excellent most of the time (well . . . . the practical work is, not so much the computer effects), supplying plenty of inventive gore and eye-popping atrocities. There's also some good underwater photography and a finale that throws in a number of bizarre horrors and even more bizarre sexual fetishes.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed it. Fans of Yuzna's work should definitely check this mad movie out.<br /><br />See this if you like: Brian Yuzna, H.P. Lovecraft, Dagon.
