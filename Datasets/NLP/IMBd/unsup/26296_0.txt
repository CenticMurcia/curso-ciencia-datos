Well, I read a review of this movie, and it didn't sound too promising. However, it had been relentlessly plugged by one of my best friends (who happens to be Indian) and she practically forced me to watch it. I'm really glad she did. This was a hilarious portrayal of a Indian-American guy trying to come to terms with his heritage, all while his hormones were raging. I admit, if I had watched it by myself, I probably wouldn't have been all that impressed. But with my friend there to explain all the cultural and religious references and jokes, it was a truly unique, educational and wholly funny experience.
