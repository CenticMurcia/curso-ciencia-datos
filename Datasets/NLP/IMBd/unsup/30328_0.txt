This film has it all. The occult, Catholic girl's school, nudity, everything a male movie-goer could want. I haven't seen "The Craft" so I couldn't say if this film copies it or not. Mimi Reichmeister shines as the "good girl" who gets in over her head. She brings a fresh-faced innocence to the role. Too bad her career doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
