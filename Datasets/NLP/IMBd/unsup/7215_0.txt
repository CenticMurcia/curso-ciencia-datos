This movie is so hilarious I can not even put it down on the comment box, that is just how insanely funny this movie is. This is one of the funniest if not the funniest movie(s) I have ever seen in my life. The movie is hilarious from start to finish that I barely had time to breathe during scenes. This movie has a good bit of cursing but overall the movie was phenomenal and I loved every second of it. Joe Pesci has always been extremely serious when he needed to be, and also very funny when he needed to be and by God in this movie he is one of the funniest actors in one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I loved this movie so much that there is no way I could give it any less than 10 stars.
