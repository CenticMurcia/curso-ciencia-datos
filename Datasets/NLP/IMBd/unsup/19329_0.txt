I'm a big sci-fi fan who has a bad habit of sitting through just about any sci-fi movie once. This one was another in long line of those movies I should stop after the first five minutes. This movie is beyond terrible it's so bad. The acting and I use that term very lightly is downright awful. This is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen and this is very lame attempt to cash in on King Kong. The big sorry looking poor CGI ape in this movie is pathetic. You also see all of about two sorry minutes of him. This is trash and Sci-fi channel is really scrapping the bottom of barrel showing this crap. I loved the old big white movie far better then this crap. I can't believe someone got money to make this and I'm shocked Bruce Boxleitner is so hard up cash he take this sorry role.
