Be warned. William Shatner does NOT know how to run Iron Chef shows. This is "Iron Chef USA." The real show to watch (American version) is "Iron Chef America!" Still, the Japanese "Iron Chef" beats them both with little effort. The real Iron Chefs are Chen Kenichi, Hiroyuki Sakai, Masaharu Morimoto, Masahiko Kobe, and Komei Nakamura. When I saw "Iron Chef America", I thought the show could use an Iron Chef Chinese in Ming Tsai. I just love how he prepared the duck dishes. I think he should become Iron Chef Chinese in "Iron Chef America." I also agree with Bobby Flay's comment that cooking can become an athletic sport and it should be on ESPN2. I hope that "Iron Chef America" can serve to make people forget the atrocities of "Iron Chef USA", which is NOT the same as "Iron Chef America." Also, "Iron Chef America" should let Morimoto speak English.
