I'm a huge fan of the first movie. And watch it every chance i get on cable. And had no idea there was a sequel till i saw it on AMC recently. I said to myself, what the heck. I'll give it a lookover. I noticed from the IMDb profile that they got the original Hanson brothers to play there roles. And they really look the same. I didn't recognize no one else from the original. Baldwin and the rest of this cast are terrible. There's nothing funny or even interesting here. Its a terrible movie in every way and form. And Stephen Balwin as the captain? You could of cast Pauly Shore and make it more believable. If there was going to be a sequel it should of been done right after the original. Maybe have them moving to Florida like the Newman made up in the first movie. When was this in the theater if at all? I keep up on new movies, whether in the theater or made for cable. This one must be thee old- straight to video cat.
