A creature of Native American legend is awoken and escapes from a cave to reek havoc on an unsuspecting bunch of forest rangers and forest trekkers. Hunting and killing it stalks forest ranger Danielle who is coping with the fact that she was responsible for the death of her best friend.<br /><br />It waits reads like a great storyline and it is a good plot for a movie, I would says its just watch able, its a modern B-movie with so-so special effects and scenes which I could say where rip offs from other movies, i.e. Jeepers Creepers 1+2. The relationship between Danielle and boyfriend Justin bares no chemistry whatsoever and the sex scene just seemed like any other sex scene in a movie. In a nutshell the movie wasn't that great, and it was disappointing to see Cerina Vincent try to out act the bad storyline, after a first class performance in Cabin Fever.
