I really liked this film - it's one of the few films I've seen that has provoked me to think. Unlike some reviewers, I think this film is coherent, streamlined, and finishes with a fitting climax.<br /><br />The film explores the dichotomy of disability and enablement, suggesting that, ironically, enablement comes about through dependence rather than independence. Bob, the tragic figure in this movie, is shown to be unable to genuinely allow others into his world, and this is ultimately his downfall. Correspondingly, his female interest discovers that it is only when she is forced to depend on someone else that her life truly begins.<br /><br />Spoiler ahead: The film's conclusion is really the fitting endpoint of the tragedy that has been going on since the film's beginning: Bob becomes his own victim... Like a goldfish that refuses to be fed from outside the bowl, he has barricaded himself into his own world, and thus cannot survive.<br /><br />This is a great film - and, apparently, as tragically misunderstood as Bob feels himself to be...
