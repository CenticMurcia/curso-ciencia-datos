This movie had some twists in it that kept you on your toes but other than that...it was a boring movie in my opinion. The main character Emmett, played by Scott Wolf was new to me. He didn't seem to act well and seemed like he just got out of college into acting school.<br /><br />What would you do if you were dying? Would you even go to all that trouble...? At least the DVD has some deleted footage. Besides that, I would only rent the movie if you want some unrealistic drama with little action and poor acting.<br /><br />Even the DVD & Movie Guide book rates the movie 3 out of 5 stars. No wonder why everyone is selling this movie cheap...it is because it doesn't capture your attention in a way you would remember it and make your jaw drop.
