The ONLY reason i could think of to watch this terrible mess is the presence of beautiful Rebecca Gayheart. what a gorgeous woman. why does she keep winding up in horrible films like this and Urban Legend (she was also in Scream 2 but that film was decent.)<br /><br />this is one of those movies that thinks being really meanspirited translates into being hip and funny. another film Very Bad Things had this same problem.<br /><br />it's not that i have a problem with material such as this (i've got a REALLY SICK SENSE OF HUMOR!) but it just doesn't work. this film tries to be Heathers meets Clueless but completely lacks the charm and quality (not to mention acting) that made these films work.<br /><br />also, Rose McGowan believe it or not, doesn't get naked in this movie. not that i care (she has great breasts and nothing else) but a lot of her fans will probably rent this thinking that she does.<br /><br />STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />rating:2 (barely avoids a 1 just due to Rebecca Gayheart)
