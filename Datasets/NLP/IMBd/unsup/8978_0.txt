Todd Solondz seems to specialise in hating everybody. From "Welcome to the Dollhouse", through "Happiness" to this film, he seems to thrive in misanthropy, delving into the worst aspects of human nature.<br /><br />"Storytelling" has two separate segments: "Fiction" deals with a college student (Selma Blair) who breaks up with her disabled boyfriend and has a brutal one-night stand with her creative writing professor. "Non-Fiction" describes the attempt of an aspiring documentarian (the always good Paul Giamatti) to make a film about a typical high-school loser and his wealthy family.<br /><br />As always the film is savage and bitter and is bound to have something to offend almost anyone, and yet it is very funny. In a way the laughs are almost shocked out of you by the casual cruelty on display. In my opinion "Storytelling" is better than the over-rated "Happiness" (which just went too far at times).<br /><br />When you want something to make you feel good about life and humanity, don't watch this film.
