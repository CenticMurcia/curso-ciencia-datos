The book, from which this film was adapted, is probably one of Agatha Christie's best. The plot centres on Linnet Doyle, a woman who stole her best friend's fianc√©. The scorned Jackie pursues the couple wherever they go, and when she follows them onto a Nile cruise, it seems that Jackie is not the only one who has a motive for murder. Of course, the ever dependable Poirot is on hand to solve the incredibly cleverly planned crime.<br /><br />This film contains some fantastic scenes set in the heart of Egypt, along with an all star cast. The most brilliant performance of all comes from Angela Lansbury, who plays Mrs. Otterbourne, a drunken old writer who apparently used Linnet in one of her overly erotic books and is consequently being taken to court where she may loose everything. Lansbury captures the humorous side but also the unfortunate aspect of the character and it is this immense acting ability that should have won her an Oscar.<br /><br />The chemistry between the main characters is marvellous and at the end, when the final solution to the affair is presented, the audience is shocked when they learn who did it, appreciating fully the extent of Christie's genius. This is a fantastic film, which builds up tension fantastically, and is perhaps one of the greatest films ever made, and is always underrated.
