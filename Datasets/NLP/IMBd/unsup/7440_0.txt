The first season of the X-Files went out with a bang. The Erlenmeyer Flask delivers in so many ways. It has the most exciting opening teaser of any episode so far, an intense car chase on the docks of Maryland. This marks the first time that the tag line changes at the end of the opening credits. It reads, 'Trust No One' instead of 'The Truth Is Out There'.<br /><br />We get our first glimpse of the alien/human hybrid experiments and their toxic green blood. The story is fast-paced with some good dramatic moments between Mulder and Scully and Deep Throat. The episode begs the question, after having been misled by Deep Throat in 'E.B.E.', can he be trusted again by Mulder and Scully? Early on, Deep Throat accosts Mulder as he returns to his apartment, asking why he is giving up so soon. How did Deep Throat know that Mulder was giving up? There is really no way he could have known. The writers just needed to advance the story is how I figure it.<br /><br />Mulder has plenty of one-liners in this episode as usual, and even Scully gets in a rare joke with her 'monkey pee' line.<br /><br />With the second appearance in the series of the voice of Danny, Mulder gets an address from him for Zeus Storage. It is located on Pandora Street. I think this episode is kind of like opening a Pandora's box for the rest of the series. The first season was fine and all, but this episode really jump-starts the popularity of The X-Files. I find it to be an interesting parallel. And, that was the actual name of the street in Vancouver where they filmed that scene.<br /><br />The scene where Mulder enters the warehouse and discovers the bodies suspended in liquid is a breathtaking visual. Another classic visual from this episode is when Scully removes the alien fetus from the canister. Irrefutable proof for Scully? Maybe not. <br /><br />The end of the episode has a near exact ending to the ending of the Pilot episode with the Cigarette Smoking Man putting a piece of evidence away in the basement of the Pentagon. I like how that shows that the first season has come full circle.<br /><br />The Erlenmeyer Flask keeps you jumping up until the end when the ultimate sacrifice is made to save Mulder. This episode is a must-see for all.
