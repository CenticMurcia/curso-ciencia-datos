Flicking through the channels late at night, I came across this movie and figured I'd check it out. I missed a bit at the beginning as the first scene was of the 3 men walking outside to find out what happened to the power (as it went out).<br /><br />The bickering between the 3 men was starting to bore me and I was about to flick to another channel, when they introduced the aliens and the ship. Now it got me interested.<br /><br />This could've been a really good movie if they spent a little more time on a lot of things about the movie. The constant yelling and tantrums that many of the characters performed was irritating. Many will say that it makes the movie more realistic. Yeah but too realistic and it is boring.<br /><br />Overall it has a few good tense moments, but nothing overall scary. The ending, with the position of the camera, made it all too obvious as to what is going to happen. I had my eyes watching that hallway all the time waiting for them to appear. In fact, nothing in the movie surprised me; I knew what was going to happen (including the so-called alien that was shot in the bedroom upstairs disappearing).<br /><br />The ending wasn't all that scary either. They could've amped it up a little more, but no. Trance-walking-out-the-door is the preferred way of doing it I guess.<br /><br />The little girl was also annoying always trying to get to the 'aliens' (who looked more human than aliens really) and betraying the family by removing the shotgun shells from the shotgun. She shouldn't even be touching the shotgun at her age either. She was my absolutely-disliked character in the entire movie. More annoying than even the wine-drinking mother, or the blonde woman who wanted to leave the house all the time.<br /><br />Could've been better. Too disappointing.
