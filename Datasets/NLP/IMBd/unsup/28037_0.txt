This film is dreadful. It could have been so good....Caine, Tim Healy, James Fox, Lesie Grantham, but it sucks to high heaven.<br /><br />Did Caine have a big bill to pay the year he made this? It looks like an episode of Wycliffe or as if it was made exclusively for Channel 5, but even these are too much like compliments foe what is a truly dreadful film.<br /><br />The credits look like they were done on an Amiga 500.<br /><br />In terms of the scenery, they seem to be going for the 'Inspector Morse' look, but it fails miserably. The child actors are hilariously bad....do private schools still exist like this?<br /><br />Total and utter dross...I know Caine likes to keep busy but maybe it is time he started taking some pride in his output.
