When my husband picked out this movie out at Blockbuster I was expecting a movie I would cringe at and probably never finish watching. Being one half of a gaming couple who met online I tend to get impatient when all gaming females and males are portrayed in the same way. Although this movie is guilty of complete stereotyping, I surprisingly found it very enjoyable and funny. It is genuinely humorous, does not take itself seriously and the characters although stereotyped are very likable (but definitely far into the weird side even for someone who has played fantasy games).<br /><br />I had no trouble with the dialect due to being British and having lived in Edinburgh for 5 years while I was at university. I could however see it being a barrier for people unfamiliar with Scottish slang, although if someone could understand "Trainspotting" they should have no trouble with this movie.<br /><br />The fantasy sequences were done using "shadow-play" which in my mind was definitely one of the best decisions of the film makers. It let people (particularly non-gamers) see what the players were visualizing without looking silly, and the art landscapes were nicely drawn.<br /><br />Overall it was an enjoyable film that should appeal to anyone with a lighthearted sense of humor. If you liked "Napoleon Dynamite" you will definitely like this!
