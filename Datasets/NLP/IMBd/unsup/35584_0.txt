Bigfoot movies can be fun. This one is terrible. The acting is atrocious (except for Sue Lynn Sanchez), and the script is a mess. Probably the most absurd scene takes place in a "newspaper office" (obviously a high school), where an editor patiently explains to a young reporter why mass killings by an unknown animal are of no interest to readers. We're to also believe that this thing is running around, abducting women and ripping people apart, and the state police never arrive and no media circus ensues. Apparently, the families of the women abducted and the people killed just forget the whole thing. The ending is also absurd. Why would a babe like Talla want to spend any time with a loser like the reporter? I won't even get in to how absurd the sasquatch looks, except to point out that the monster is supposed to be a male, since he sexually assaults women -- so why does the costume have breasts? I've given this mess two stars only because of Sue Lynn Sanchez, who is gorgeous and puts in a spirited performance despite her horrible lines. Hopefully she'll get some real roles soon.<br /><br />Stay away from this film. It's not a fun B-movie. It's just a typical, low-budget blood fest with no new ideas. It's terrible.
