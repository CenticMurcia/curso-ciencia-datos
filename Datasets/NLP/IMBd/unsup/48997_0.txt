This is not an offensively bad or even plain bad film, it just isn't very good either.<br /><br />The performance from Joeol Edgerton is good enough, and Portia pulls off a good Ozzie accent but Dennis Hopper and Mel seem ridiculously badly cast and frankly (hehe) make you hate Frank Sinatra from the get go.<br /><br />The plot is slower than a sloth running through molasses and nothing really happens - no tension, no real antagonist/protagonist struggle, just bumbles through what I believe is a semi-accurate take on the 74 tour of Oz by Frank.<br /><br />If it's the only thing left on the shelf then it passes 2 hours, otherwise grab something else to spend your time with.
