Let me say first thanks to BMW. Though the original idea for The Hire movie series was inspired by commercial purposes (of course, they must sell cars), all movies are oriented to a real artistical approach more than to a market strategy. It's not just a matter of publicity... well done! This short by Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu is the best of the series. Alejandro is clearly one among the most talented directors of the new generation. His own powerful and dramatic way of shooting gives no way to compromises. Alejandro's language is made of cold lights, cameras never standing still, zooming and moving like it was a video reporter filming a battle. Take a look to his first (and of course, awarded and successful) movie Amores Perros and you will understand what I mean. Hope he will never give up his style for easier ways to make money. Great!!!
