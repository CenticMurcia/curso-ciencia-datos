Now I love Jennifer Lopez. Nothing but respect. Who one their right and brightest mind would cast beloved MARC ANTHONY on the lead role ? Why oh why ? As Hector, he is nothing but a short man who disappoints us from the beginning to the end. "Hector never knew how much people loved him. And that's the thing. It's like he didn't want to know." But Marc Anthony (OH YOU SANG TO ME!) seriously should accept the fact that NOT EVERYBODY loves him or his work. He must also accept that he cannot act even if he was tortured. Best thing would be to tie him up and make him listen to all of his songs over and over. And make him watch his music videos over and over. That would be the best punishment for dear Marc. Rest of the cast is great. Everybody else has done a great job. But, the way this movie was shown, could've been better. Some films may not have the element of keeping the mind of the audience stuck to it or keep yer heart pounding and waiting for something great to happen. When movies without these elements are made, they should be shot well and need proper actors. Not someone like OH-YOU-SANG-TO-ME! The narrative could've been better. if you already know about Hector Lavoe, then this movie will just help you add slightly to what you already know. Surely, the movie has great detail. But Marc Anthony is a major turn off for me. Playing a role like that. Its not that he doesn't look the part, HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AN ACTOR in the first place. Now that's what you call a major casting problem. Lets be glad he was not cast in DANCE WITH ME or any of the CHE GUEVARA movies for that matter.<br /><br />You could watch it for Jennifer Lopez (fine and fine performance as usual) and the rest of the cast. Movie loses major points because of Marc Anthony. But if you are a OH-YOU-SANG-TO-ME fan, then go watch it. Cause there easily wouldn't be any other movies with MARC ANTHONY playing the title role. (But that could change if J.Lo was planning to produce for the little prik)
