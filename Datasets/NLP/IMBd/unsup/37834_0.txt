Just don't waste your time. Seriously. <br /><br />As a science fiction connoisseur, I am grading this film as just plain lousy. The effects are horrible. The acting is atrocious. The costumes make me yawn. Worst of all.... I felt no sympathy for either the supposed "good" guys or the supposed "bad" guys.. which means they failed on the most vital point of film making. To create empathy for the characters within. To cause the viewer to cheer for their victories and cry at their defeats. <br /><br />I'm not going to bash the people involved in the film. The fact that they are in such an horrible mess is enough. <br /><br />I've placed this as a spoiler comment, because the fact that it sucks is the whole film.
