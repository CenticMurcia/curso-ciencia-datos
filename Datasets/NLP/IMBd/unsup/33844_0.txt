OK, in theory this film does sound interesting. In execution, it's terrible, far more terrible than one could ever ask for. The idea is that there's a dog-napping ring that's supplying a neo-Nazi fast food empire run by a Hitler-like Pope, which is all well & good, and there's a junkie fetus and a drunken ventriloquist dummy helping out a couple cops who are investigating the whole thing. However, it's got super-amateur filming, acting, and effects, and put me immediately in mind of something I never wanted to think of again which was a flick called "Zombie Toxin", another no-budget piece of crap that washed up on our shores from the British Isles as well. However, despite its resemblance it appears that these films share no actor or other staff unless the names have been changed to protect the guilty. Evolved is so bad that I finally stopped it as the evening wore on because I wanted time for an antidote, something ELSE to watch before bedtime so I wouldn't think my entire day had first been wasted by work and now THIS. I think I would be hard-pressed to find any less-talented people than the ones that were responsible for this mess, and boo and hiss to Troma for even putting it out, although my uh, respect for Troma has waned increasingly over the past couple of years as Lloyd Kaufman continues to get more unbearable with his shameless huckster shtick. Here it is 5:15 AM and I'm already in a bad mood writing about this...well I'll cheer myself up and go to work, so you KNOW this film must have been bad. 1 out of 10, don't even consider renting this at all, really.
