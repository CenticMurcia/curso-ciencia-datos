OK, I recently got the pilot off from itunes and all i have to say is if the CW does not pick it up, then they do not deserve to be a network because this show is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />I love superhero things, and Aquaman has always been like the lamest superhero, but this show brings a whole other side of Aquaman to the surface (no pun intended). Mercy Reef is so great because it provides us with a history of Aquaman and starts out by showing his past and talks a lot about his mother and father and how he is connected to Atlantis. They also tie in a lot about missing people in the Bermuda Triangle and how these people return. The battling of the sea creature named Nadia is also a cool plus. Finally Aquaman has some sort of past and coolness brought to him The story line is very interesting as there is so much involved, but not so much that the viewer has a tough time following along. The acting is great, no one i can say did a poor job. Even the effects were great, especially for a pilot. If this show is picked up, or should I say when this show is picked up, it will be an instant success because audiences love superheros and this show brings Aquaman to the level of any other great superhero rather than just being the loser one that talks to fish.<br /><br />Ten stars for Aquaman and I know I am joining the many already fans of this show!!
