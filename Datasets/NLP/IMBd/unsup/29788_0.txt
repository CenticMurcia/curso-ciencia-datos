The movie did not portray most of the characters in a believably authentic manner, although the Hackman character for the first 90% of the picture was fascinating. Breaking into the State Sovereignty Commission's files was gratuitous,unrealistic and added nothing more to the plot that a straightforward, legal examination of the files would have added. Fulfilling the death-row Last Meal request of Hackman for a bowl of Eskimo Pies by giving him Eskimo Pie ice cream pops, instead of the (nearly ) unique traditional Eskimo Pie seemed to underline what seemed like a lack of authenticity found throughout the movie. Very disappointing.
