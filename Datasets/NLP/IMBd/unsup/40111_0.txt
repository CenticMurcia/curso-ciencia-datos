I was going to agree with everyone here who claim HELLWORLD isn't really a HELLRAISER movie but I'm having an internal debate with myself as to what constitutes a HELLRAISER movie ? The original was like Hitchcock on acid with an AIDS allegory . HELLBOUND was a rather plot less runaround but was still reconisably Barker inspired . Since HELL ON EARTH the series shows often cynical flaws of being a franchise with a lack of internal continuity and unimaginative repetitive plots . HELLWORLD continues - and probably concludes - the series <br /><br />The film starts with something Barker couldn't have envisaged 20 years previously - people spending their lives in front of a computer . Somewhat unimaginatively these people are teenagers wearing Cenobite paraphernalia and right away you're reminded of Wes Craven directing a screenplay written by Kevin Williamson , effectively Pinhead Meets SCREAM . To be honest though there's absolutely no reason for Pinhead and Co. to be in the movie since the villain is Lance Henriksen a father who is embittered about the death of his son <br /><br />There's all the symbols , iconography , plotting and situations common in all teen slasher films . There's also a couple of nods to SAW which like HELLRAISER started off as a well regarded horror film then became a franchise factory churning out sequels to lower acclaim and box office . HELLWORLD isn't a terrible horror film in its own right but there's a seen it all before feel and people who have enjoyed most of the sequels will certainly feel cheated that they're watching something that could be any type of horror film
