I have yet to see the first Ginger snap or any other Ginger snaps movies in the series.<br /><br />I saw this when it came on TV once, all i knew about this movie before I watched it, was that it had something to do with a werewolf.<br /><br />Brigitte seem to be haunted by her dead sister, who a was werewolf too and she will become too but she then takes a deadly second dose of monkshood, which would stop her of changing into werewolf. Jeremy with her library books at her door and he see that she has taken drugs and then is about to take her to the hospital but is attacked.<br /><br />After that She wakes up in rehab clinic for drug abusing girls. she locked up and a little girls know about this and then helps her out to get more drugs to help her not to turn into a werewolf.<br /><br />This was really interesting werewolf movie, I didn't find IT boring, which i thought I would, but it was really entertaining movie,They had some really nasty bloody deaths in here too and i did like how the werewolf looked, it was little scary.<br /><br />The acting from the main girl was really good, the rest of cast was just okay but the little girl acting was really poor. <br /><br />I give this movie 7 out of 10
