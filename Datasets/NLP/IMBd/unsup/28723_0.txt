I only decided to watch 'The Lion,The Witch and the Wardrobe' as it was showing on BBC1 This Evening (Boxing Day) and the family were all sat down to watch it...I was convinced from the very start that I would not find a great deal to like in The Film, but had nothing better to do so gave it a whirl....I'm very glad that I did! It's quite possibly one of the most Enjoyable Films I have EVER seen....and it's little over 2 hour running time flew by,Now I was aware and so should all viewers be that C.S Lewis was a devout Christian,and therefore Christianity does feature rather heavily and at times Too Heavily, But most should be able to ignore the bible lesson and enjoy the spectacle. <br /><br />****1/2 out of *****
