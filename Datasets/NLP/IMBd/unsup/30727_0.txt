Viewed this film early in the AM and never knew that Rock Hudson,(Michael 'Tiger' McDrew),"Embroyo",'76 starred in a picture as a coach and practically seduced every young girl in the high school. There is plenty of nudity, frontal and back along with wild scenes and Angie Dickinson,(Miss Betty Smith),"Dressed to Kill",'80, seducing a teenage boy. Telly Savalas,(Capt. Sam Surcher),"Backfire",'95 plays a police office who investigates a mysterious murder in a men's room at the high school. Roddy McDowall,(Mr. Proffer),"Lassie Come Home",'43, plays the school principal and looks too young to play this role. Even Keenan Wynn,"The Lucifer Complex",78 plays the role of a dumb police officer who manages to foul up the crime scene. This film has everything, Drama, Comedy, and plenty of Romance. Poor Rock Hudson must have been worn out trying to play this role, his performance sure surprised me and so did this film.
