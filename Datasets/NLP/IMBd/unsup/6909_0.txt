How do films like this get selected by film festivals? I seriously question the programmers who allow such a blatant waste of screen time. I am quite certain there are hundreds of films more deserving. I found "Flying" to be self-indulgent drivel, undeserving of an audience. As she travels the world exposing herself as an "ugly American," the filmmaker ignores cultural differences, choosing instead to apply American values to foreign situations. I wish particularly disturbed by the way she exploits her own family. Often contrived, always boring, director Jennifer Fox should have spared us this painful cinematic experience by staying home and continuing therapy.
