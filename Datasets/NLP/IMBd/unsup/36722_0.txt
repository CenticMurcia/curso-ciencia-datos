I had the opportunity to watch this movie as a screener and was not shocked by its disappointment. This movie reunites Kristy Cotton(Ashley Lawrence)and Pin Head (Doug Bradley) for the 4th time and hopefully the last. The plot revolves around Kristys husband Trevor and his abnormal life after a car accident. Flashes of the cenobytes and pinhead and the fact that he cant remember the previous month causes Trevor to go insane. No one has seen Kristy for since the accident and the cops are thinking that foul play was involved and Trevor is their main suspect. Later on you start to realize what pain and anguish you have to go through to get "all problems solved".<br /><br />The problem with this film is that its lacking in what made the first 2 films popular. Pinhead and his cenobytes are rarely seen in this film and it lacks the hellish looks. The film starts to resort to nudity to help keep interest in the plot. The series would of been better if the creators would of stopped at bloodlines. It seems like the produces are milking this for all that its worth by coming up with plotlines that have almost nothing to do with the original film. There are no morals to the story and there is nothing you can gain by watching this film. One thing that this film can be praised on is the used of special effects and the sound track, which is a rarity in most direct to video releases. In conclusion I would say watch this film if your a huge fan of horrible rip offs of great 80's horror movies. If you liked this film I would suggest Texas Chainsaw Massacre 4 The Next Generation.
