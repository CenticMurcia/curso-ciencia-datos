Spoofing porn movies in the '60s was kinda like writing sci-fi in the 1800s - the genre in contention didn't really exist yet. Porn in 1968, pre-Throat/MissJones/Mona etc., hadn't yet developed the wah-wah guitar pizza delivery slo-mo money shot vocabulary we know and love to mock today. That said, tho, Candy has some funny moments, especially the ones taken directly from the Terry Southern novel the movie was based on.<br /><br />Beatleholics seek the movie out to see Ringo Starr as the perpetually confused houseboy Emmanuel. Candy gives Starr a terrific catchphrase that, despite his irresistibly deadpan delivery, never seems to have caught on. Other than at my house, where I STILL frequently say, at any given opportunity, especially when confronted by anyone about anything I've supposedly done to vex them, "Emmanuel GOOD boy!"
