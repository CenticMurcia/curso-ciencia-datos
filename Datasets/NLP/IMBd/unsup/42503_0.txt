There are some films that you wonder what the actors were thinking and whether their careers will be irreparably damaged by the poor, B- quality. With a cast like Robert Duvall, Busey and Harmon, you expect no less than average medicrioty. I should have known when I saw Glenn Frey of the Eagles listed as one of the cast.<br /><br />This is a lazy effort which is not at all credible and that is the film's problem. The characters go into dangerous territories without the fear that would be natural and go around shooting in movieland. Some of the shootouts are downright hysterically bad B-movie and it's like there was a discount at 7/11 for the six pack of the "let's have the bad guys get shot and fall down off a ledge" package. Their clothes weren't right for an "expedition" of this nature. The dialogue was not natural.<br /><br />In his defense, Duvall does all that he can with his character. He oozes charm. Busey acts like a Bucktoothed third rate actor here with the entire film quality feeling like a lesser Jean Claude Van Damme effort -- and that's not good.<br /><br />Fortunately I only saw snippets of this film because it became just too stupid to watch. One scene, not a spoiler, shows Duvall's character trying to negotiate a flight while much grass is being unloaded. One of his "party" has a problem with the illegality that is going on. It is not only out of place for this kind of stupid morality statement (hey, they have submachine guns and are supposedly ruthless and will kill you in a moment) but the resulting dialogue is laughable.<br /><br />If you just want a shoot em up, let's go get em type film, irrespective of any reality check, go for it. The other reviewers were not too harsh in nailing this film to the wall.
