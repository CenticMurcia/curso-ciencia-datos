This was the second Wallander film I've seen. In the first one (Mannen som log), Rolf Lassg√•rd did an admirable job of portraying Wallander, but I was mildly irritated when the film ended in the complete opposite way: the villain got away! <br /><br />So I was hoping that the new project with 13 films would be more true to the books, but Noooo. <br /><br />In this film (Innan frosten, eng. Before the frost) - why does the director or script writer change the story so radically, and add stuff that wasn't in Mankell's book? The "new" material is so bad, almost to the point of embarrassing.<br /><br />I'd be hard pushed to see another one in this series.
