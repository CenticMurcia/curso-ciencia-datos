You can't beat the comedy in this movie. It's all so funny, you'll be in stitches. From the Schizophrenic SAAB driver, to the scary next door neighbour you can't get away from fast enough, to the dog who you have to put a mirror under it's nose to see if he's still breathing! And when the previous owners joke "we're taking it with us!", you have ask, "are they really just joking"... Richard Pryor, who has now left us, should be so proud of this movie, his comedy is rare and so well timed. Dana Carvey also shines, as the clean cut SAAB driver with multiple personalities. And who can forget Randy Quaid playing both parts of the neighbour from hell, both in New Jersey, and in Boise, Idaho. You'll never want to move again, but you'll die laughing at the Pear's attempt to move!<br /><br />PLEASE PLEASE get this movie brought to DVD!
