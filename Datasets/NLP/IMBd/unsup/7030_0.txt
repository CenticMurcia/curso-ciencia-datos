I have lived in Chicago my whole life and can tell you two things for certain: one, no honest cop(least not the ones I know) could afford a house like Truman's, secondly, the area where he lived is typically crowded with cars; there is no way the mob guys could have just pulled right up in front of it. Liam Neeson was completely believable as a hillbilly,and the train jumping scene was fun to watch. The flophouse he was staying at is EXACTLY where someone like that would end up. And I must say, that Patrick Swayze added a nice visual interest. Is a shame that his real life wife didn't recieve credit for playing the violin. But, if you're a native Chicagoan, rent this movie...just to see the sights. Lake Shore Drive never looked better.
