Monty Python's "The Life of Brian" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/ drew plenty of controversy in its day. I'm a Christian yet I really liked Monty Python's movie. Well, I'm a Mexican-American so my perspective certainly colors my view of "A Day Without a Mexican". That said, I enjoyed and laughed a lot in this movie. For me it's message was to remember that immigrants are human beings, deserving of acknowledgement for their efforts. The interesting question is, why would that need to be said at all? It seems obvious to me that they're people and deserve our compassion and respect, just like everyone else; but maybe it's not obvious to everyone else. The director said he was inspired in part by what happened in California some years ago, with the infamous Prop. 187. I'll certainly not touch that one here. My point is to stress that this movie is part of a historical and public dialogue about immigration in California. <br /><br />I say it adds good points to that dialogue. Immigrants contribute 100 billion to California's economy yet take only 3 billion. Seems like a good deal to me. Now, maybe we can argue a long time about statistics but I'll tell you one point very clear to me, there's nothing wrong with people standing up for themselves. Seems like the American thing to do.<br /><br />I also see other points, like white Americans being portrayed in a negative light. I can understand someone objecting that this movie would portray white people as merely racist or, at best, foolish. It's not a title anyone wants, I certainly don't. Today I went to volunteer (giving food, clothes and friendship) in a tough neighborhood and lots of the people on that bus were white Americans. The people on the bus were of varied ethnic backgrounds, so were the people we helped. I wouldn't want anyone insulting those kind people. I don't think this movie did, it had plenty of likable white characters. However, it's not easy to see from another's perspective so I'm sure there are more qualified opinions out there on that point. .<br /><br />A satirical movie about a sensitive issue isn't going to meet everyone's expectations, but it's good to laugh and let your mind open. That's why I like Monty Python and that's why I liked this movie.
