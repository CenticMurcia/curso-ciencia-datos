I saw "The Commission" in September 2004 at the AARC meeting on the Warren Report in Washington, D.C. I had high hopes, but was disappointed. The producer and the actor who appeared to introduce and discuss the film were personable and dedicated, to be sure, but the results did not live up to their billing. While the film was entertaining and contained a great deal of information, I found it to be quite biased against the commission, its results, and its integrity. It resembled the typical JFK conspiracy conference, with lots of innuendo and little proof. It stereotyped the bad guys (the commissioners that the film-makers disagreed with) as well as the good guys (the ones they agreed with). Most importantly, the film glossed over the powerful fact that the Warren Commission's two major findings (that Oswald did it all and that there was no solid evidence that he was helped) have stood the test of 41 long, hard years. The WC and WR were not perfect, to be sure, but this view of them was a little too slanted for my taste. B for effort, C- for results.
