How can you make an entire movie about Ben Hogan and capture nothing of his spirit? Nothing of his essence? Somehow, the makers of this awful "tribute" movie managed to do just that. Okay, Ford is a poor physical match for Hogan. He is tight-lipped enough, but that's about it. But the philosophies espoused by Ford in the film, and his white-bread demeanor and points of reference are totally alien to Hogan's own background or his life essence. The complex relationship between Hogan and his unhappy wife is also misrepresented badly. Throw in Dennis O'Keefe and the homogenization of one of the greatest comeback stories in sports is a complete whitewash. If you wish to learn anything about Ben Hogan and what made him tick, avoid Follow The Sun.
