This is the worst space/science documentary I have ever seen. There is no real science in it, mostly is just tries to amaze with doomsday scenarios where the earth is destroyed. (ohh the sun will blow up one day ... scary!) Also, there seems to be a lot of time spent on corny graphics, which isn't necessary nor visually pleasing.<br /><br />The section on black holes does not even describe the event horizon or singularity, very simply and key traits.<br /><br />Then there is the fact that it is called hyperspace, yet I don't think it mentions higher dimensional space anywhere in the documentary.<br /><br />My opinion, If you want a science documentary, look elsewhere.
