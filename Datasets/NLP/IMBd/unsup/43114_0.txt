I saw "Death Of A President" a few nights ago and found the movie to be incredibly boring. Aside from all of the "hype" regarding whether or not the movie has moral issues, to me, this is of no concern. I just found the movie to be plan boring. So boring, in fact, I left three-quarters of the way through it. Don't waste your money or your sense on this ridiculousness.<br /><br />Though the acting seems real, at first, the actors lose their grip as the movie progresses. Do the motion-picture business a favor and just forget about this money-thirsty, controversy-seeking film, really.<br /><br />Second thought, do us ALL a favor by just ignoring it, period.<br /><br />Thanks!
