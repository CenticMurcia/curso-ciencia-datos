I saw this film as a James Marsters fan and was truly not disappointed by his performance. He and Kimberly Quinn were fantastic together. I can't get some of the depth of feeling they both portrayed out of my mind. The other actors, another being well liked one of mine, Michael Weatherly of Dark Angel fame( very small part) were good too. I felt the stories were compelling and this movie was well worth my watching. I will be honest there was a few flow problems and I'm not sure if it was the script or editing but you should know it was there. It didn't matter to me this is on my DVR permanently and soon to be on a tape. I'll watch it again!.... Yes because of James' performance but the others were good too, because honestly I couldn't just watch it for him... I'm not that far gone of a fan.
