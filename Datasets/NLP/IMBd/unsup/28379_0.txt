At a mere 77 minutes, this delicious serving of pure hilarious cynicism still seems a bit long while you're watching it -- maybe because the writers at times invest too much in milking all they can from certain scenes. But when this satire rolls, it really rocks. Too, too bad that so many film makers of today lack both the insight and the skill to produce a match for this old chestnut. Carol Lombard gives her usually fine performance playing a character who gets too deep into her once-innocent scheme to back out gracefully. She does some over playing here, but isn't that the way Lucille Ball played Lucy for so many years? Frederick March turns in one of his best performances, Walter Connolly and most of the others are right on-key. You can add this to W. Wellman's long list of very professional directing gigs. And warn everyone -- this is one movie you DON'T walk into in the middle!
