Wow I can't believe I put off seeing this movie until now! I am honestly considering watching Tougher Than Leather(!) But seriously the first rap cassette I ever bought was Fat Boys Are Back in 1985 when I was 9. I would eventually turn into a life-long Hip-Hop producer after that. Back in the day(early 90's) I/we/they took De La Soul's lead and shunned R&B and commercial rap so I never felt the urge to see this...<br /><br />...until now, as I watch the people who used to be plastered to my wall when I was a kid in what appears to be an actually good movie! I put this movie on while doing something else and ended up watching the whole thing standing up(a first for me). It seemed to move at a perfect pace and was well shot and directed; I loved the funky scene changes sometimes with a scratch and screen dissolve. Most importantly though are the stars, especially the brilliant Sheila E. who I now have a crush on. <br /><br />I haven't seen High School Musical or any modern show of that variety but I would imagine this movie is the blueprint for that, at the very least it's a blueprint for today's fashion trends. If you like over the top 80's movies with heaps of heart and moments of panic-stricken hilarity, look no further. I think I'll watch The Last Dragon next...<br /><br />Rap, Hip-Hop, whatever you want to call it, this is a great piece for the culture in general and probably an awful amount of fun for those that were there to make it. Definitely Def! P.S. - Recommended accompanied viewing is the 1986 Dutch rap documentary called Big Fun in the Big Town which can be seen on Google video for free. This shows interviews with Russell Simmons, Run DMC and LL Cool J, offering further insight into the story behind Krush Groove(there's other great stuff in there as well but I won't give it away).
