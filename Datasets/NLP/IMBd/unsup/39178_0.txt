When I say 1/10 I really mean awful in a cringing but enjoyable sort of way.<br /><br />This movie was shown late at night because it is supposed to be scary but I found it hilarious! <br /><br />Any body who tries to analyse the characters or seeks hidden meanings needs to watch more movies like "Atomic train" and "Tales from the crypt." <br /><br />Christopher Lloyd must have had De ja vous of "Thing" from "The Adams family" when filming this little beauty.<br /><br />A fun movie to watch with your mates when your all broke and drunk on cider and cheap wine! I urge you to add this to your DVD collection or a very least borrow it from someone.
