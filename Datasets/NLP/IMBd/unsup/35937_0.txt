I usually enjoy these kinds of movies. A masked killer infiltrates a sorority and begins to knock of the beautiful ladies one by one. Movies like SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE and SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE 2 had the cheesy, inept charm that made them irresistible to horror fans. This...is just a bland, badly acted entry in the slasher genre. FATAL PULSE is about a black-gloved killer stalking and slashing members of a college sorority. I can understand why very few people have even heard of this movie. For one, it offers nothing new to the genre, all of the actors are wooden and look constipated when having to display fear. It's also hard to keep track of how many characters there are. They are introduced only to be killed off a couple minutes later. It sports a nice body count, but I just didn't care for any of the characters due to the poor character development. Also, you the typical red herrings. There's Ernie (the oh so wonderful Joe Estevez) a tormented Vietnam vet who owns the sorority house, the leads douche-bag boyfriend and a college professor (I think. I lost track to be honest). Of course, the killer is no surprise. But I'll let you find out for yourself.<br /><br />Overall, FATAL PULSE is a late, yet woefully inept entry in the genre that has become nearly impossibly rare and to some, underrated. Slasher fans only should seek this out, if only for curiosity's sake. But remember... I WARNED YOU!
