After seeing the truly excellent 'Clerks', director Kevin smith's first feature, I had high expectations of 'Mallrats' and have to say that I was dissapointed.<br /><br />True its not the worst film ever but its not a tuch on 'Clerks'. Here's why:<br /><br />The characters: Brodie (Jason Lee) is a good character, the 'Randal' of 'Mallrats if you like but I found T.C highly annoying and irritating. T.c is meant to be the' straight guy' to Brodie's wise-ass but he just angers me. All he does is whine (Thats all Dante did but...)<br /><br />The script: 'Clerks' had a brilliant script, the dialouge was well observed and real without being meaningless. 'Mallrats' script isnt bad but its not as clever or as well realised as clerks.<br /><br />Jay and Silent Bob: IMHO, these two characters cant carry a film on their own (JASBSB is a prime example of this). In mallrats they're normally supporting roles are made to be more main, more involved in the story. IMO they are weak characters and Mewes' acting is extemely poor.<br /><br />While this film isnt terrible, it is the 2nd worst film in the new jersey trilogy. JASBSB is the worst.
