This is the first Otto Preminger movie I saw and I would have liked to enjoy it, or to find it at least interesting. But man, what a schlockfest. About as exciting as doing your laundry, only more predictable. No stereotype is left out. The role models that are set for the sexes are just terrible. You can feel the large Hollywood machinery humming in the background, and the actors play along with it, but you get the impression that Preminger and others who were creatively involved with this movie phoned their performances in. I got the impression that Preminger's stance was "What does the studio want? A Western? Man, I wish I was in Europe. Well, for chrissakes, lay on the blond floozy with a heart, bring in the kid and the butch guy with a past, and put some makeup and greasy whigs on the fall guys. Let's get this over with, and move on." I'll betcha this movie would have been long forgotten if it weren't for the celebrity cast. To say "they don't make 'em like that anymore" would be wishful thinking on part of the cineast.
