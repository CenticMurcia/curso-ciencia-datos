Hey, this film was awful. I mean, there are bad films that are so terrible they are fun to watch. But this one just goes waaay beyond imagination. There was no way I could bear till the credits rolled and I had to give up around 55 mins into the story at the junkyard scene.<br /><br />The plot is like it was written in a kindergarten for the mentally disadvantaged. Plot holes of the size even an ocean liner would sink in them.<br /><br />Mr Griffin is the unfunniest, most annoying wannabe ever giving a try on comedy.<br /><br />Be warned and avoid at any cost. I would like to ask the guys who scored this garbage 10 what were they able to like in this - er, okay, I just would not want to call this a movie - so in this complete waste of efforts ?<br /><br />Though the cutting could have saved the film, but then the musters should have been cut lengthwise.
