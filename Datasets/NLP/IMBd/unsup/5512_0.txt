Some one told me a while back that I should check this movie out. I do not really like low cost films so I declined. One Sunday (after hearing how good it was from so many people)I was at the video store and decided to pick it up just to give it a try. I enjoyed it very much. You could tell it was a low budget film but the story line was pretty good. I enjoyed the work of the young actors. The older actors were not half bad either. With a little more funding and a few corrections to the script this really could have done well on the big screen. If you rent it watch it early because there is a good chance that you may want to watch it again.It had me waiting and guessing whats next. Growing up were I grew up this film was true to life for me. I ended up buying a copy. It is a great add to the DVD collection. If you are from the hood you will love this movie. CHECK IT OUT!!!!
