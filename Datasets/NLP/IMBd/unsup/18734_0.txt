Yor is great when there is nothing to watch and along comes YOR you can easily stop clicking channels you have been saved .You can watch Yor in any mood and it fits .There is only one catch you can not tell your friends you watched it by your self.You can watch it and drive someone else in the room crazy.I just wish it was a series there is so much more he could do . Stunts like Yor falling off the cliff is amazing I can not tell how they pulled it off.Some how I just knew when he killed the Great flying moth he was going to use it to swoop in on the Hairy Monster men .I don't know how he easily overcame the leader when he was wearing Yors strenght necklace. In the sequel Yor could face the underwater men. The adventures could go on and on Yor the ever living cave dweller.I even think Yor could reach out into the space age and fit in. LONG LIVE YOR
