Well,i watched this movie first reading on IMDb as to what a masterpiece it it.and i must say Am not Disappointed at all but inundated by the amount of effort put in to make such a classy piece of cinematic experience.<br /><br />The movie talks about woman coming back to the orphanage where she has stayed,to recreate an environment for needy kids.her son is affected by a terrible disease,his son keeps telling about the invisible friends of his??but who are they??what do they want???you must watch the movie for that??don't wanna spoil it for you!!though it would seem the movie is inspired from greats like poltergeist etc.but there is something different which leave you in awe.<br /><br />Take my word you must watch this won't be disappointed at all for people who like atmospheric horror rather than the gory kinds!
