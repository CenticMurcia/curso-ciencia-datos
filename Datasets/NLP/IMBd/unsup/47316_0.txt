Let me start by saying that this "movie" is just pure rubbish. It proves that the creators had only one thing on their mind: "How can we make as much money as possible with no effort at all?"<br /><br />The story isn't new, but that's OK. Someone or something dies and the ones who are left behind have a hard time to live without their loved one. But there is a solution. If they bury the death person, dog, cat,... on an ancient Indian cemetery he or it will live again ... as a zombie. A good director can do some great things with this, with or without a lot of special effects. But this clearly isn't a good director.<br /><br />I know, from a commercial point of view a sequel or a prequel to a popular movie is very interesting. You can be sure that a lot of people will watch it. But why do you have to insult your fans with such an awful movie? Do they really think that a lot of gore, a dog with red eyes and a dumb zombie will make a great movie??? I sure hope not! Perhaps in the early fifties, sixties and seventies they could scare people with that kind of uninspired nonsense, but today they will have to come up with a lot better.<br /><br />If I have to give my advice to someone who didn't see it yet: DON'T WATCH IT! There are a lot of good movies, but don't watch this one! You'll only regret it. Not because it is too scary or whatever, but just because it is a pure waste of your time! I think a lot of people will agree with me if I say that this so-called movie isn't worth much more than a 2 or a 3 out of 10.
