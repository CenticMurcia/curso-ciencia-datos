This is a funny movie and an interesting perspective on culture shock (Germans in Japan) and, generally, of coming to terms with one's life. It is at least not as superficial as many other movies I've seen, and that's not because the dialog is in German or because it is mostly shot with a hand-held camera. It's just a different movie.<br /><br />Don't expect, however, that a movie will give you the answers to everything, or that a movie, any movie, will depict Japan or Zen philosophy in their entirety and in detail. This movie, and any movie, will necessarily have loose ends and inconsistencies. Do expect to be amused for a couple of hours, what else can you ask for?
