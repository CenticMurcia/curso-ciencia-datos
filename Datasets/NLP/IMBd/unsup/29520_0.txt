I hate to say it, but I'm a sucker for these Lifetime thrillers. This is one of those fun one's where you think you know the ending, then change your mind, then change it back, and then change it again. It's one of those one's where you just want to say, "Stop, he's going to kill you." But as I've gotten older I realize the characters on screen can't hear me lol. Alexandra Paul's in amazing shape and her villain co-star steals the show. I actually know people like the Janis character (well kind of), which makes me want to get extra locks on my doors. But the old fashioned deadbolt kind. My only complaint, why'd you have to kill the dog?
