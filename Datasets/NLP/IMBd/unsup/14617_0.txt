Dean parks the car in a diner and waits in the car while Sam brings some fast food and pie. Suddenly he realizes that Sam vanished and finds the staff murdered. Without any lead, he meets Bobby and calls Ash; later, Ash calls Dean and when they arrive in the Roadhouse, they find the place burned to the ground, Ash and other hunters dead and Ellen missing. Meanwhile, Sam awakes in the ghost town Cold Oak, South Dakota, with Andy and Ava and they meet two other strangers, Jake and Lily. The Yellow-Eyed Demon visits Sam in his dream and explains that only one member of the group will survive and become a soldier in his army of demons.<br /><br />"All Hell Breaks Loose: Part 1" is another engaging episode of "Supernatural". Now it seems that the war of the Yellow-Eyed Demon and his army of demons is set in motion with the contest of the gifted children in the haunted town. The conclusion is absolutely unexpected and probably Dean will make a deal to save his brother. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Demônios a Solta  Parte 1" ("Demons Break Loose  Part 1")
