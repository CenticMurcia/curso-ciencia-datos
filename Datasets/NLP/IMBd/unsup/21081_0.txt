This is a claustrophobic little film, independently made with a small budget, yet it delivers the goods. Think "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" combined with "Vampirella". An average run-of-the-mill Midwestern serial killer meets up with a lovely vampire. She then runs off and leaves him to the tender mercies of another lovely vampire who teaches him how to feed his own hunger for blood. The serial killer then struggles with his conscience and his sanity--all leading to a somewhat twisted ending. Not a great film, but well worth watching.
