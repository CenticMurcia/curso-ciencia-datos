the untouchables to me is one of the greatest action movies ever. all the untouchables from Sean Connery ( who won an oscar for his role by the way), to Andy Garcia, and the hero of the movie kevin costnar is brilliant.but this movie belongs to Robert Deniro's captivating perfomance as the villain al capone. yes al capone the greatest gangster of all time. "spoilers ahead" this movie is about the untouchables, four men and thier quest to bring down the crime lord al capone. with an ending that will leave you cheering the untouchables is definately an American classic.<br /><br />Ps: listen to the score by Ennio Morricone, the same guy responsible for the unforgetable score of the man with no name westerns (Clint Eastwood).
