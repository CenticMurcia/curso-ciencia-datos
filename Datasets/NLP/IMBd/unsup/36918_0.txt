It would be nice if a comedy show were actually scheduled in this time slot! This show is pathetic and far from funny. You spend more time being embarrassed for the heroine than on any other emotion (well - maybe irritation). If all else fails, just thru in a "big boob" joke? If this was supposed to appeal to the 17 - 20 age group, it may be doing fine. Many have been divorced and found the way, this shows writers and lead have no clue -funny or otherwise. On the plus side, the little boy is cute and the uncle IS funny. The ex-husband and new girlfriend are played by well known master comics, able to carry the show on their own,
