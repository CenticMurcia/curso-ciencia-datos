Buster Keaton, never heard of him. I only new Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, before i turned into a comic titles searcher. And guess, I would have missed some of the best works from the silent era.<br /><br />"The General" is the best Silent movie, I have seen. Even if I remove the last 3 words from the previous sentence, it would be true.<br /><br />The Plot is known as "The Great Locomotive Chase". Keaton plays a railroad engineer and story is all about how he saves his side, without any help (with some help from his love), in the war. Keaton's less expressive face suits great to the subject.<br /><br />I enjoyed the background music. A commenter said it is repetitive. Yes, it is, but the action goes on steam engines throughout the movie and the music just felt like going with the engine.<br /><br />Fans of Chaplin and Laurel & Hardy, will love Buster Keaton for sure. A Must watch movie.
