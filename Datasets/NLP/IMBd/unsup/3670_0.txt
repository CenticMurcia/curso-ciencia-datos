I may have seen only one other film from Chile, and was pleasantly surprised by the interesting concept and fair execution of this one by director Mat√≠as Bize. Two strangers at the end of their 20s meet for a one night encounter of casual sex in a motel. They may have done it many times in the past, but this night will prove to be different. The film starts with the two having sex, this is where many other stories in movies end, but here this is just the pretext for a dialog and a possible relationship. A relationship that will probably not last beyond the night, but its temporary nature gives it the occasion of intensity and sincerity. These do not come instantly however, it takes several rounds of dialog (and more sex) to start peeling off the layers of convention and get to the intimate truth, insecurity, intimacy of each one of the two characters. Sex is only the external layer of a relationship, and the most superficial of all, it hides rather than it represents what the man and the woman in the couple really are, and it takes special circumstances and dialog for the truth to pop out - this is the essence of the story that is being told.<br /><br />Such a movie cannot keep the interest of the viewers even for its about only 80 minutes without good acting, and we get indeed here two excellent actors that pass well the screen and the challenge of explaining their characters beyond the physical appearances, which as with the story is the principal acting problem they face. Playing almost at nude in the perimeter of one motel room and yet building complex and human characters is not an easy task for an actor. Both are more than OK, Bianca Lewis is even close to bright. Director Matias Bize succeeded to make an interesting and different film, I wonder if he will be able to avoid closing himself in the formula or format of experimental films and rather continue to follow the emotional dimension he brought to screen in 'En la cama'.
