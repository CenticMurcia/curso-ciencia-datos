A group of annoying bikers get stuck in the dessert and fall victim to the remaining members of the savage killers.<br /><br />As good as Wes Craven's original film The Hill Have Eyes (1977) was, this sloppy sequel is as bad! It's dismayingly routine, with very few remotely interesting characters. This sequel just lapses into clich√©d, uninspired slasher garbage, and pretty much lacks everything that made the original film a cult classic. You know a sequel is bad when the only good scenes in it are the flash-backs to the original film! The only bright spot is a decent music score from Harry Manfredini.<br /><br />Robert Houston, Michael Berryman, and Janus Blythe return as their original characters, but it's all in vain.<br /><br />Hands-down Craven's worst film.<br /><br />BOMB out of ****
