This short (approx 15-20 minutes) film is right up there with the car chase from "Bullit". If you're into fast cars-this is for you! Lelouch borrowed a friends Ferrari, strapped a camera on the front and took a high speed drive through the streets of Paris at daybreak. Thrilling! Listen as he goes through the gears. We have a tradition in my (British) car club of showing this at the last meeting of the year-and no one has tired of it yet! (Equally as exciting backward as it is forward!) Credits should read-"Sound track by Enzo"!
