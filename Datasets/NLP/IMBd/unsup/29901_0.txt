This movie was soooo bad I erased the tape before I finished recording it. Here is why: 1. Jurors cannot contact an attorney during a trial, if they do... mistrial, and if the attorney gets caught it is an ethical violation that would effect their license. 2. No police dept would leave the decedents car in the parking lot, without collecting personal effects of the victim no less. 3. No parking lot would keep a dead persons car parked in their lot for as long as it takes a murder trial to be tried. 4. No female attorney for either side would wear a short, tight, leather skirt during a trial.<br /><br />For these glaring and about 10 others, this is the worst movie depicting a criminal trial EVER!!!
