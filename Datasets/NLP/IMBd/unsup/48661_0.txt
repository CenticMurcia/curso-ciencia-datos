Anyone associated with this movie should be subjected to one of two following punishments: Be stuck in a cave for 50 years and be forced to exist on small troglodytic mammals and insects; or Be forced to watch this movie over and over for 24 hours.<br /><br />I would rather choose the first of these.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine how this movie could be made and then released onto humanity. It will forever become the fifth horseman of the apocalypse. Death, famine, war, pestilence and RV will ride on that day of world ending.<br /><br />Shock and awe. I cannot even begin to describe the feelings of waste that I feel for dropping $4 on it for a rental. Now, I would rather have paid $4 to have not seen it.<br /><br />Poor Robin Williams...to drop to this level. I feel nothing but shame and sorrow for such a great performer.<br /><br />I am aghast.
