This movie seems to make people think of Highlander. I disagree. It's as much Highlander as it is Excalibur. The plot is nothing spectacular or original, and does remotely resemble Highlander, but it certainly ain't no Highlander. Heck, even Star Wars looks remotely like Highlander. It's all a case of level of abstraction from the story. But enough about that. It was sorta disappointing that people thought it normal when the "immortal" (actually reincarnations) died with a lot of lightning.<br /><br />So: it ain't no classic, but it certainly is worth watching.
