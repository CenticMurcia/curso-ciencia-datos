not only does this film manages to have no plot, it also has some of the most awful dialogs i've seen.<br /><br />certainly, the story may offer some potential, but i can't help the idea that someone threw a few clich√©s into a pot and tried to obtain a film (?) out of it.<br /><br />from the start one can tell it's going to be a very amateur film, but as the film develops, we realize even the production is amateur - the scenes that should be happening at approximately the same time are filmed in what seems different time spaces (i can't tell how many days have passed, as time passed differently for the different characters) and the effects can't even be called "special"...<br /><br />i'd like to say that the actors tried to save this production, but it never happened, they just got lost within the absence of plot.<br /><br />save your time and watch something else instead.
