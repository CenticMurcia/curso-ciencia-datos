Hmm... so Cameron is a psychic kid who accidentally brings a ferocious demon up from hell into his closet... Sounds like it might have potential. It did, but did it utilize that potential? No. Though this movie is tad creepy, it had some real major lows to it. Examples: the stomach growling noises coming from the closet, the almost 80's music video special effects (no wonder the thing died at the end, I think I would too if someone shot bad special effects at me through their finger tips). So, you should only preview this movie to see if you really like it first, but I don't recommend buying right away, especially without a preview.
