Don't go see this film. At least, don't if you're a kid or if you liked the first Babe. This one is nothing like the first. The first Babe felt real; this is a dark fantasy. The first one was open and upbeat; this is dark. The first one was kind - kind animals, people, plot; this one is just mean. How kind is it to watch a dog held head-first underwater, with no hope of survival? How uplifting is it to watch a clown entertain a room full of cancer victims, old people, sick people, all without hope, and the big laugh comes when he burns it down by mistake? How exciting is it to watch a crippled dog smacked across a dark street, left to die.<br /><br />It might be artistically fun and ok to try to emulate Fellini, but not riding on the coat-tails of a very good kids' movie. It's not bad marketing, it's deceptive.
