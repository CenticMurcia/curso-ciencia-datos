Wow!I am quite disappointed that this could not compete with his recent sh*t called 'Kaalai'(The Bull-It was even more pathetic) Vallavan-has no story,screenplay and direction.It only has a good original score by Yuvan Shankar Raja.If he hadn't been there,the movie would have fallen flat.Even when he is there the movie still falls flat.<br /><br />A youngster falls in love with a girl 3 years older than him,and thinks its no mistake.He even has sex with her.After knowing that he is a young boy the girl gets annoyed and refuses to marry him.Now another female who had a crush on this guy in high school enters and kidnaps a friend of this guy.How he convinces the older girl and marries her,deceiving the crush is the story.Okay,we can't call this a story but unfortunately this is what we have as a story.Now there is cheap and vulgar scenes which is more or less pornography,comedy which makes you weep,acting which makes you puke and horrifying punch dialogues to stab you over and over.Simbu is there to give you goosebumps!I wish I could rate this movie in minus infinity,sadly IMDb allows me rate 1 star as the lowest.<br /><br />Are you nuts?Are you a dumbo?Are you a bozo?Watch this movie.(I did because some nutcases recommended me this movie) <br /><br />Watch a tom and jerry episode,funny videos or even old photo albums.Try to miss this movie by all means.Otherwise you will repent on doing a life-time mistake.
