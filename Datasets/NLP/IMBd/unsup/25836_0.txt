This is so awful that it's offensive to movies that are just plain awful.<br /><br />The acting is garbage, the story is garbage, the filming is garbage.<br /><br />It's just a bunch of kids (whom many seem to old for the parts) that talk about their and other peoples genitals, and commits acts of violence for no apparent reason.<br /><br />Also the bad guy (as if the "kids" weren't dislikable enough) is a disgusting old bald man who likes to dress in leather and works as both a butcher and as a amateur porn film-maker.<br /><br />If you have had the accident to buy this movie, find the closest dumpster and dump it down quick.<br /><br />Yes, you could of course sell it to some poor soul who hasn't read this review BUT do you really want that on your conscience?
