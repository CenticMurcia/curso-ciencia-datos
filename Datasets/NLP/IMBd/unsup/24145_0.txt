Candy is one of my all-time favorite films. Although cited as one of the worst movies of all time, it had many things going for it including a big-name cast and excellent 60's psychedelic cinematography. It is impossible to see now unless you can find someone who can sell you a pirate tape. The Movie Channel used to show it but I haven't seen a listing for Candy in a decade or more. Who has the video rights? Did Marlon Brando buy them up out of embarrassment? I would like to see both the film video and the soundtrack (Dave Grusin w/Byrds & Steppenwolf) become available.
