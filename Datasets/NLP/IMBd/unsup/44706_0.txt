I saw this movie a while ago, awaiting a good and critical movie. I´m not afraid of a little violence in movies, but in this movie it just made no sense. Random useless violence all the time. There just wasn´t any goal. Maybe the director wanted to bring this feeling to the viewers, but that could have been done in much better ways.<br /><br />The characters in this movie also have a complete lack of personality. The are flat characters who just commit violent stuff.<br /><br />A ´not so good´ movie which stands in no comparison to American History X and Romperstomper.
