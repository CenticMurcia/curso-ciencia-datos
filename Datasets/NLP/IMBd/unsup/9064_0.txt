***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** It is a great film about what can happen when a father looses a son by a suicide and the feeling of guilt appear when he's the only one who knows all the truth. I liked it a lot, I liked all the characters and specially Andy Garcia's character. I've discussed this picture with a lot of people and there are two points of view about why the boy commited suicide. In my opinion, he had a big depression, he was forced to go to the psychiatrist who happened to be his father's friend, he abused him and he wasn't able to talk about it with his father even though it seemed that he was a good father and was open to hear everything his son wanted to say The boy felt too bad and desperate that he prefer to die than to speak... On the other hand, there's people who told me that they think the boy was depressed and forced to go with his father's friend and when he started abusing him, he started to feel dirty but at the same time he liked it, so he got confussed by the feeling of being gay, that he commited suicide. This is not my point of view, but many people got it that way...
