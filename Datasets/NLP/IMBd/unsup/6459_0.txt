Of the many Beat Takeshi portrayals of ice-cold men facing death (usually a gun pointed at him), this film has the most impressive (to me). It is the scene when the Okinawa mission goes wrong: the yakuza group from Tokyo is attacked by assassins in a restaurant. The two groups stand up, and go on firing without ducking or hiding until one group (the assassins) has 100% casualties.
