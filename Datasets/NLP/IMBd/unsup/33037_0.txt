This film could have been great. It had a great premise, where an alien visitor decides that man is a virus to the planet Earth and sets about destroying him, money for some neat special effects and name stars to attract attention. What the movie doesn't have is much of an imagination. What could have been a good "battle movie" like Aliens turns into another chase film like "Deep Rising". The characters run around, they don't know where they're going, we don't know where they're going and after about 20 minutes of this you lose interest altogether and just pray for a good ending, sorry not in this one. The film is pretty much a rip off of Alien with a bit of The Terminator thrown in for good measure. While it rips off the plot it doesn't rip off the pacing or style and maybe it should have. Without much of a script to work with the director uses fast pacing and quick edits to create the action in the movie moving from one action scene to another each has very little pay off and becomes tiresome quickly. It is quite obvious that this movie was made quickly on a low budget (I hope) and was expected to make its money back on its opening weekend and then quickly move to video. If only they'd taken their time with this one and spent more time developing the alien creatures (personality wise) because they do look pretty good but cannot carry this film, which sinks long before the end credits roll. (4 out of 10 just because it looks good. Works better as a comic book.)
