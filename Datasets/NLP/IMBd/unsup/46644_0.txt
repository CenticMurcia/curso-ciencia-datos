I have seen Mommie Dearest when I was younger, and I have to say it is one of the absolute worst movies ever! Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) is the adoptive mother of Christina, who is telling her side of the story. I have to admit, I'm not sure whose side is true, but in this movie, Joan is nothing but a two-faced (witch) who says she loves her daughter but is just plain horrible to her! I mean, she wants Christina to be perfect. That's why she (spoiler warning!) tries to make her eat raw meat (My mom, sister and I personally like our meat well-done, too!); she has a swimming contest with her daughter than gloats when Christina loses, then Christina says it's not fair so Joan spanks her and locks her up in a pool house. Then (more spoilers!) when she hangs her dresses on wire hangers Joan yells at her and beats her with a hanger (I don't care for wire hangers either, but my goodness!); Joan makes Christina scrub the floor, beats her, chokes her, and fusses at her constantly, expecting her daughter to call her "Mommie Dearest," which sure as flip is not the right name for her. Well, guess what, Miss Crawford? Like it or not, you are this child's mother and you don't show her a part of the love she tries to show you. I hope someday you can live a decent life without wanting to be perfect, but, you know what? Your daughter's not going to be perfect (until she gets to Heaven), and neither are you! Nobody's perfect, so deal with it!!!!! To the viewers: If you like this movie, good for you. Whoever doesn't, I don't blame you.
