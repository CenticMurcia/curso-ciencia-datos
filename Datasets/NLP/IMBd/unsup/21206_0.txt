Identical twin-filmmakers Michael and Marc Linn made this film when they were 15 and 16 years old, and think this film is more a rip-off than a parody of the _Indiana Jones_ films, the end credit actually says "based on...") but _Indiana Jed_ is full of youthful inspiration in the all-teenage cast. They spent almost $4,000, and budget constraints put the film in a contemporary setting, which gives the film a lot of funny twists in itself. Unlike the Jones film, this is a male-buddy film with Jed and Cmdr. Marc as the buddies, and the film is played for laughs, which it does effortlessly. Highlights include the character Jeremy, some drunken teenagers, Carl Schoenborn, and especially Hethe Henrickson as Beloch, a rival archaeologist (whose last name happens to be Henrickson), who is also the ultimate in ham villainy, who is after the Infinte Power, which will make him shoot rays like Emperor Palpatine. Unfortunately, because the brothers see the film as a rip-off, they have no plans to re-score it (it currently uses a temp-track that includes the Jones films, The Addams Family, The Rocketeer, Ricochet, The Hard Way, Mountains of the Moon, Sleeping With the Enemy, JFK, and lots of Cliff Eidelman's _Star Trek VI_ music, among others) and release it officially (which they can't in this current state), though they do sell it through their website.
