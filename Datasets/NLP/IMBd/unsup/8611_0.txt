This is great movie for everyone to see. It is totally awesome for a cartoon movie. Lets say when you get done watching it you'll never cry again. The prince was a real Hottie and i liked when he jumped out the window. My favorite scene was when stepmother uses the wand one last time. Here's summary of it. Stepmother forms a green hole which make's it look like aliens are coming. Then 3 of the guards get turned into chickens, then another three gets turned into pigs, ans then the last three guys turned into rabbits. Last Stepmother points the wand at Anastasia. Drizella says she should be turned into a toad. So it's two against one. Then for some reason Cinderella goes and defends Anastasia. So then it's two against two. But team two dose't have anything to defend themselves with. So then the prince rushes pulling out his sword with makes the magic bounce back making Stepmother and drizella being turned into toads.
