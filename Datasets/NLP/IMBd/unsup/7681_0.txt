If you can get pas the very slow pacing, this is quite a satisfying film. it takes it's time getting where it's going to but the acting by the whole cast pushes it along and keeps the viewer's interest. Christopher Lee does his usual great work and Nastassja Kinski brings just the right note of naive innocence to her role (plus you've got to love a movie that has full frontal Kinski nudity!!!!)<br /><br />Well worth a look, especially for fans of the Hammer type horror films, and despite being real slow at times, is well done.<br /><br />rating:7
