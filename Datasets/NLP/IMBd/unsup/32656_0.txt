This highly redundant sequel involves Taj stuck in that tired old plot where he has to lead some misfits into victory against a superteam of unbeatable snobs. Meanwhile he also falls in love with our main villain's girlfriend. Gee, I wonder how all this will end. Kal Penn tries his best and comes of as pretty sympathetic, but these lines he gets are just, ugh. How many double entendres can you cram into an hour and a half? The first time it's pretty funny, the thirtieth time not so much. The writing just consists of working in the word "hard" with every opportunity that comes along. The most amusing scene comes somewhere in the middle, and that's just because it's ripped of from the first one. Are there really any redeeming qualities to this movie? Well, I'll give it a go. The lead snob lays it on really thick, which makes it somewhat enjoyable when he gets his comeuppance. That's pretty much why I kept watching, to see what would happen to him. Also, Holly Davidson is pretty hot. That's pretty much it. It's not enough to hold together a movie, sadly.
