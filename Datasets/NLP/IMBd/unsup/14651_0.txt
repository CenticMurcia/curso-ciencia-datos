Melanie comes from college to start teaching at a school where she wants to be "a breath of fresh air." The thing is that she's a doormat and a pushover and that's why the students don't obey her and why the other teachers make fun of her. Melanie tries to be friends with her neighbor but she tries too hard and is too clingy. I didn't like the way this film was shot but I got used to it by the end. I also noticed that there is no plot or storyline. She doesn't solve any of her problems at all and she's back where she started from. On the other hand, I did like the acting and the attempt of Melanie to find a friend amidst the chaos she was going through. I did like this movie because it was different from other movies that I usually see and I understand about the way it was shot. It's an independent film and a really great one. I would have been her friend because she seemed like a nice person.
