My wife dragged me to this movie and I kinda thought I might enjoy it, so, I didn't fight it too much. Once the movie started and I got into the plot, I was hooked. My wife started crying within the first 15 minutes and she didn't stop until we walked out of the theater!!! It was the good kind of crying... not bad!!! Take the WHOLE family to the classic Disney type story!!! If you have any ability to follow how these types of movies go, then you will know the outcome long before it happens... it doesn't matter because you'll be wanting that outcome and you'll embrace it when it happens!!! Good acting, as always, from Kurt Russell and even Kris Kristofferson showed some range. Young Dakota Fanning has to be one of the most talented actresses of our time!! I could never see her as a 'child actor'... she an actress that just happens to be a child!!! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! You won't be sorry!!
