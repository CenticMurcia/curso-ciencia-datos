Special effects was quite cheesy, as you can see a lot of the shots were poor CGG (computer generated graphics). Also the story line was dorky and boring, and quite implausible. The lady character was good-looking. huh.<br /><br />The vehicle looked like it was from Battlestar Galatica.<br /><br />Not much more to say, not worth the money to pay to see, but if it's free, I guess it's okay.<br /><br />That's about it.. don't have much more to say.<br /><br />The "Wil" character from Star Trek didn't add much to the story line.<br /><br />The Chinese connection was lame.
