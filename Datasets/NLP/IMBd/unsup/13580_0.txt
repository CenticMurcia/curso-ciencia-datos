I adore this movie and have watched it over and over again. It continues to hold my attention every single time. The storyline is lovely and very moving. How Andrew forms a very close bond to Little Miss and Sir is enchanting. I thought the clothes chosen for the film were perfect - Portia's ball gown was absolutely stunning and the music throughout was wonderful! The character of Andrew played by the brilliant fantastic Robin Williams is absolutely delightful. Robin is a superb actor and I have just finished reading his autobiography. In my eyes everything he touches turns to gold. I totally love this film and will watch it forever!!
