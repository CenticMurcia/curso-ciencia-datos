At the time of this tragedy it was international consensus that Pearl had a death wish going into Pakistan with an obvious profile as an American Jewish Journalist at a time when Muslim Extremists and terrorists were at their most volatile state. Pearl took outrageously foolish risks for money and fame in a country where the Bacteria even want to exterminate Jews and paid the price with his life , very stupid and cavalier. Brad Pitt has taken a risk in producing this movie for his arrogant spoiled no talent wife who appears in every scene as if she has just walked of a Vogue magazine shoot except for all the obvious failed cosmetic surgery. The cinema veritas style of hand held camera is overused and cost saving. The film is generally very cheap in few location shoots and obviously cheap extras level actors. <br /><br />The Film offers nothing in terms of offering any value about the human condition or Political Insight. Angeline Jolie's three screaming fits during the investigation , the news of her husbands death and child birth punctuate mindless one line arrogantly performed mumblings throughout the film and she expects us to believe this great acting let alone academy award winning stuff.<br /><br />This movie is terrible and boring and just another self aggrandizing performance for Jolie and Mrs Pearl should be ashamed of herself capitalising on her Stupid and Foolhardy Husbands horrible murder.
