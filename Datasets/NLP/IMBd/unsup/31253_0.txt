Viewing this film makes you question, no pun intended, yourself on whether or not you want to continue watching it. Not because it sucks, not because its boring, but because you have to question on whether or not the deep, crass, in-your-face approach to its storyline falls within your humor and cinematic appeal.<br /><br />At first I was disgusted, but then when I started to get to know Art (poor big, rich teddy bear character), I couldn't help following his plight and unbalanced relationship which develops with his co-star (West - twisted, disenfranchised, sociopath) until the film presented a resolute conclusion.<br /><br />The story progresses with these elements flaming into a feverish pitch until reaching a climatic ending, while the whole time holding on to its roots of truly twisted humor.<br /><br />Why not?!
