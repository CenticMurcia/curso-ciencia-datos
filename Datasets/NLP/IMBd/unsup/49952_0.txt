First of all, the judges on the show really lower its quality. They never seem to know what they are talking about, they judge the acts on entertainment value rather than talent, and they are all biased and opinionated. Hasselhoff seems a little weird these days, Brandy has nothing to say at all, and Piers is just some guy with, as far as I can see, no real credentials. The show should be called "America's Got Stupid Entertainers." It doesn't live up to its title. In fact, one of the judges' favorite acts was the "rapping granny," who was only mildly entertaining and hardly talented at all. The caliber of entertainers on the show is rather low; most of the acts are very amateurish. Regis doesn't really make the show any better. He doesn't do much of anything. He must be asking himself how he got himself into this at all. America has Talent, but you won't see it on this show. At this point, I feel that no one in the competition is deserving of the million dollar prize. This show stresses me out.
