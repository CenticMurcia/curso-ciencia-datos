i know, i know, i know that a movie astronomically lame as this is more for fodder along the lines of the torture scene from A Clockwork Orange, but lord help me i couldn't turn away (or the channel). I generally don't believe in the concept of guilty pleasure because i don't think pleasure should ever be the source of guilt (at least in the realm of film). But if ever there was a reason. I didn't enjoy the film, that's what makes it all the more wrong. What can I complain about in this film that i didn't already know would be terrible to begin with. The wretched lecher in me however could turn away from the sheer nubile aura of visceral pleasure. A terrible movie made all the more terrible for my having watched it. This my friend is ground zero for the darkness of every human heart (or perhaps just mine) turn away at all costs and let us pray quickly for a lindsay lohan pornography to at last re-invigorate us with a sense of decency and respectability.<br /><br />two out of ten, only because i cannot deny......<br /><br />and god wept....
