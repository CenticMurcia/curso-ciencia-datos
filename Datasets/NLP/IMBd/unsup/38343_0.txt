This film supposedly takes place during the first few days of Operation Market Garden, which was one of the biggest Allied assaults of the Second World War. In that attack, British and U.S. forces moved north into Occupied Holland, both by land and air drop, and this tale begins with a small British parachute unit being diverted under orders to a remote location behind German lines. In fact, the first ten to twelve minutes of "The Last Drop" are really well done.<br /><br />Or to be charitable, the first eighteen minutes, are quite good.<br /><br />And then this supposed tale of British derring-do and their nemesis, an S.S. Major appointed by Adolf Hitler to steal priceless Dutch artworks and artifacts, comes unhinged. The first flaw in this rickety fictional adventure is that it has three flaws: 1. The British detachment is led by a fascinating character, a Scottish captain, who is killed in the fire-fight following their crash landing in a glider ( off course, of course ). For the rest of the film the rest of the British soldiers quarrel amongst themselves over who's the real leader.<br /><br />2. The National Socialist S.S. officer is clearly an important character to the plot development but we never learn much about him, until almost the very end of the story. This is a serious flaw, as it erodes the otherwise natural dramatic tension.<br /><br />3. Three renegade German soldiers -- who somehow know about the treasure trove of Dutch artifacts and artworks -- are introduced in the crudest possible way, i.e., as they interrupt an S.S. bureaucrat while he's in a dalliance with courtesan. Who is really a part of their plot, only the S.S. dunderhead is too stupid to figure it out.<br /><br />4. Oooops, there's a fourth flaw !! This kind of a film -- the "caper behind enemy lines movie," was done with such superb dramatization and excitement in "Kelly's Heroes," that any film auteur who wants to take it up again had better get himself or herself the current equivalents of Donald Sutherland, Carroll O'Connor, Don Rickles and especially a world-weary Clint Eastwood as the central player or leader. This was not done here, despite the fact that the budget for this film enabled wonderfully accurate costuming, equipment and weapons, accurate replication of tactics and lingo, and some exciting battle scenes.<br /><br />They had the money to do a great film and they muffed it. For some wholly unknown reason they drafted Michael Madsen for a meaningful cameo role and he gave them less than a cameo's worth of value !! The plot is an intriguing one and based on many known historical facts but the execution, directing, music and the very ending itself fail miserably. By the real end of this film I was very glad that it was the end of this film. It's not a spy movie but it has espionage elements, it's not a buddies at war film but it has buddies at war, it's not a cultural and political statement about war, but it has cultural and political statements about war. Yikes. What a mess. Unless the reader can get this film on DVD for free .... forget it !!
