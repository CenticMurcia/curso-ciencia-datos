The fourth miracle would have been to sit through this thing. Ed Harris is a little old to play the brooding self-absorbed stud priest who has the hots for Anne Heche (of all people). Takes a strong stomach to watch these two make out. Only Hollywood would make a movie about a middle aged foul mouth priest and then cast a lesbian as his flame. The assault on religion is non-stop with the Catholic hierarchy living lavishly and wearing gold chains and big medallions and using foul language. Maybe they were trying to identify with the rap culture? What ever they were trying it didn't work with me. If Ed's character wasn't bad enough Heche's character is also angry and brooding too, I guess it's tough to have a mother who was a Saint. My advice is to skip this turkey.
