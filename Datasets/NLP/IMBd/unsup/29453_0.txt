Little Jerusalem is an amazing film about a family of Orthodox Jews living in Paris.<br /><br />The best reason to see this film is Fanny Valette. I think Fanny Valette may be one of the greatest actresses ever. Seeing her in this film was like seeing Brad Pitt for the first time in 'Cool World'. Although I hated, hated, hated 'Cool World', the second Brad Pitt appeared I knew he was going to be a major, major star. I felt the same way about Russell Crowe in 'Romper Stomper' as well. All I can say is brush up on your English Ms. Valette, because Hollywood is going to be pounding down your door any second now.
