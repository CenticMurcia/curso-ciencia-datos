This movie has to be one of the worse movies I've ever seen. The plot seems to start all of these mine story lines but does nothing with them, all of the characters are poorly developed, the main story line makes absolutely no sense, and it just plain isn't scary.<br /><br />I'd avoid this one at all costs, there was absolutely no point in seeing this movie. It had a bad plot, bad characters, bad direction, and mostly bad acting.<br /><br />But on a somewhat good note, I have no idea who Gary Oldman is, but he most certainly had a very good screen presence. His acting isn't too great, but I think it is because he was not given a character to act out. But he definitely is talented.<br /><br />Overall a just plain bad film.
