Didn't get past the first 60 seconds of the film. How disgusting to depict the mindless murder of a kitten in a major film! Why can a film studio do this when others would be charged with the crime that this is if they filmed it? Doesn't matter that it "isn't real", it is still depiction of animal abuse/torture. Worse yet, it displays yet another method of animal torture to the soul-less cowards who do this already. I'll be loud and clear to anyone who'll listen what I think of it, and that it should be banned. So, so disappointed in Diane Lane--the only reason I was interested in seeing it in the first place. Won't make that mistake again.
