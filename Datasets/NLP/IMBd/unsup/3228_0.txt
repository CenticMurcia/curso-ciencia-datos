I heard about this movie and found it in a recycle bin at the video store and bought it. I popped it in the VCR and watched in amazement as the movie unfolded. All I can say is WOW! This movie actually sucked so bad I had to turn away a couple of times, because the acting was so corny and ludicrous! Words cannot describe the lack of real plot (if there was suppose to be one) and the disjointed script. People who saw this tripe know what I am talking about. However if you like bad movies then watch this one and suffer like the rest of us. Obviously one of the worst movies ever made, but have fun anyway.<br /><br />1 out of 10, and don't just go by my rating watch this movie!
