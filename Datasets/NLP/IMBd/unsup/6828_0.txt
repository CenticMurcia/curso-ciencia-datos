Hello I am a fan of this series and as they are not releasing it on DVD, was wondering if anyone has copies of all the episodes they produced and are willing to trade for something? I am based in the UK.<br /><br />I briefly got a glimpse of an episode in the UK but sadly missed all the others, can somebody help please?<br /><br />I love Lexa Doig and think the other characters are cool.<br /><br />The 70's series was good for it's time but we live in the modern world and time/technology has moved on and its seems very dated to me today.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Roger
