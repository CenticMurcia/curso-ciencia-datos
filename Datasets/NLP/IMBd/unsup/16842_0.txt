Along the coast of Cornwall, duplicitous Charles Laughton (as Sir Humphrey Pengallan) helps budding romantic twosome Maureen O'Hara (as Mary) and Robert Newton (as Jem Trehearne) fight smuggling pirates. Everyone comes to the conveniently shore-situated "Jamaica Inn", where leader Leslie Banks (as Josh Merlyn) and his gang hang out. Alfred Hitchcock directed this old English costume drama, before taking his work to Hollywood. So, there are some understandably well-directed moments; and, the coastal and cave scenes are nicely done. However, "Jamaica Inn" is a poorly staged version of Daphne du Maurier's novel. The actors and director make it mildly entertaining; but, the story does not captivate. Apparently, the cast had a contest involving outrageous eye make-up, which Mr. Laughton obviously won (by a hair). <br /><br />**** Jamaica Inn (5/15/39) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Charles Laughton, Maureen O'Hara, Robert Newton, Leslie Banks
