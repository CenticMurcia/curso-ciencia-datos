Though it might well describe a prodigy I point out some of the negative things about this glossy movie. <br /><br />The boy struggles with his feelings and, at least for awhile, under pressure, wants to abandon his training and live a common life. That was seen also in "Little man Tate" or "Searching for Bobby Fischer".<br /><br />Unlike these, though the movie tries to be sentimental, on most parts it is cold. The boy actions are often impudent, especially in relation with his parents. It's not sufficient that he is talented in music art: he must excel in math, sciences, market analysis. <br /><br />The way his parents act is unrealistic. That could be excused if you think it's a "feel-good" movie. The grandfather buys... a flight simulator where he plays... 3000 hours.<br /><br />What is with his mother using English words especially when she must be annoying? Or was that for the line: "Is that your English humor"? There should be other way to suggest snobbery.
