Enjoyed this film about a woman who was self-centered and cared only about her large home and as much possessions she can accumulate in a lifetime. This horrible woman is Harriet Craig, played by Joan Crawford who gave an outstanding performance only because she was actually playing her true self on the screen. We all know that Joan Crawford had a very dark side to herself and she did her very best when she had this type of character to portray. I felt real sorry for all the people who had to work in her household and especially her husband, Wendell Corey, (Walter Craig) who Harriet kept wrapped around her finger so to speak. There is a big explosion when Harriet decides to upset her husband's career and goes to his boss to make matters even worse. If you like Joan Crawford and enjoy seeing her act the way she really was in life, this is the film for you.
