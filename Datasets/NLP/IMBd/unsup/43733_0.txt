I have to tell you, I was prejudiced against this movie from the very beginning. The thought of Joe Lara playing a character who was not Tarzan was kind of disturbing at first. But eventually, I realized that this was not just an ordinary movie. This is a movie where people walk (sometimes run). People walk (see above paranthetical reference about running) and OTHER people chase them as they walk. Without revealing TOO much of the plot, there is a fetus that Joe Lara has to protect for some reason. And protect he does. Meanwhile Joe Lara and the girl who plays Mary (in a VERY subtle reference) walk around a nightmarish vision of the future. It was...KIND OF ugly. Anyways, I voted with my conscience and gave this movie a 1 out of 10.
