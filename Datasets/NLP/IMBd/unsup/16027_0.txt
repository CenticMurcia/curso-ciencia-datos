This wasn't a big hit when it came out, but it should have been. Martin Scorsese is a master of creating atmosphere and exploring a specific setting, and he has proved that in movies like Taxi Driver and Gangs of New York. In this film he brings the SoHo of the early to mid 1980s to life in brilliant and surreal fashion. Griffin Dunne is a great Every Man character. You like him from the very first scene and you follow his adventures with excitement and dread. The tension in this film is also intense, and that is amazing for a light hearted comedy. I am always surprised to hear that people have not seen this movie, or that people don't like this movie. I urge all Scorsese fans to see it. It's one of his best, even though many critics did not like it when it came out. It's a cult hit, but it deserves to be more than that too. It's a masterpiece.
