I can't bear him anymore!<br /><br />"I Know What You Did Last Summer" was OK, specially because of Sarah Michelle Gellar (the most beautiful woman in the whole world). But this sequel is very very bad.<br /><br />The screenplay is just terrible. I can say the same thing about the actors. Jennifer Love does not convince (one more time) as the silly, boring and annoying girl named Julie. Freddie Prinze Jr. should get real - he's awful! And Brandy should just sing.<br /><br />There are some scary moments but that's all.<br /><br />I think I gave a 7 out of 10 for the first film, but this one doesn't deserve more than a 2 out of 10.<br /><br />I won't be surprised if in the year of 2027 we see something like "I Died On The Last Movie, But Now I'm Alive And I Remember Everything Clearly. So I Continue to Know What You Did 30 Summers Ago".<br /><br />Rating: 2/10
