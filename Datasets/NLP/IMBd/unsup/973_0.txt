I got this movie because I wanted to see Shannen Doherty in a different element from 90210 and Charmed to determine if she could really act. The answer is: No. She displayed absolutely no emotional range in the character, hardly any visible change from a constant dead-pan expression, and no deviation from a monotone delivery of dialogue or narration. The one obvious opportunity to display any kind of emotion was when she discovered that she had been conned by a trusted friend, but no, an expression of anger seemed to be too difficult, so instead we get nothing. I mean Zero. There are numerous actors who get bottled into their TV persona, but eventually break free to prove they are talented. I really was hoping Shannen Doherty would be enjoyable to watch. She wasn't. This movie stunk.
