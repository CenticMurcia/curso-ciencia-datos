Usually animated movies are simply fun to watch, they rarely touch deeply in our feelings. But in this case, the animation is so perfect that the characters seems to be real people. In one of the first scenes I really got thrilled by the horse racing, although they were just two cartoons "risking their lifes", I felt as if that scene needed a stunt!!! What I mean is that the animation is so realistic that it entertains us as a regular shot movie.<br /><br />The story is really interesting, and the epic songs gives it a special thrill. Even to those who have already watched billions of movies on this story, this particular movie is really worth watching! Unlike most animated movies it's a really dynamic one, with no such "crying songs" all the time!!!
