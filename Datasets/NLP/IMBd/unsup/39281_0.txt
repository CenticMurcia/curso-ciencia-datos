UP THE JUNCTION is a "kitchen-sink" drama made in the UK in the 1960s. It is an adaptation of a novel of the same name by Nell Dunn. I have never read the novel so I am in no position to say whether it is an interesting read. I find it hard to believe that it could be more depressing than this travesty of a movie adaptation however,<br /><br />The setting is London. A well-off young woman moves from Chelsea to Battersea. There seems to be nothing further to the plot of this movie - no indication of what could have possessed this seemingly bright woman to move out of swinging Chelsea. What is played out on the screen are a series of scenes highlighting the despair and depression of run-down Battersea.<br /><br />The opening scenes with the depressing score by Manfred Mann (famous for such great upbeat hits as My Name is Jack) already indicate that Battersea is a run-down hell-hole who no one would want to find themselves in. Peter Collinson seems content with dragging this dreary theme down the viewer's throat through the whole of the movie. Characters are thoroughly nasty, mean-spirited, foul-mouthed and in some cases violent. A variety of social themes are raised here, including abortion. Unfortunately they are addressed in a way that fails to interest the viewer and instead just drags the mood of even the cheeriest of folk right down to a point where the depression simply becomes unbearable. Trust me, if you are fortunate enough to have never endured this awful movie you would be well advised to steer well clear.<br /><br />Suzy Kendall has the misfortune of playing the main character - Polly. This was an early role in her career. But even still, I can think of no reason why such a talented actress had to stoop to something this low. After seeing this movie, I was very hesitant about picking up anything else with her name attached. Fortunately Ms Kendall's career picked up in the 1970s and she starred in some great movies, including THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, TALES THAT WITNESS MADNESS, CRAZE and one of my favourite giallos - TORSO. Trust me, she can act and she has starred in movies that are a million times better than the depressing tripe known as UP THE JUNCTION.<br /><br />Dennis Waterman in his pre-Minder days is also an unfortunate actor. He was great in the TV series, MINDER. But in UP THE JUNCTION, he is stuck with a hopelessly dull role that he carries off without the slightest hint of charisma. I have to say that I don't blame Mr. Waterman for his lack of enthusiasm.<br /><br />To make matters worse, an excellent supporting cast in the form of Adrienne Posta, Maureen Lipman, Michael Gothard, Liz Fraser, Alfie Bass and Michael Robbins are all wasted. The latter three names I have just mentioned are famous for comedy and could have brought some much-needed light relief to this bore-fest. But unfortunately the absent-minded scriptwriter decided otherwise.<br /><br />The only actor who manages to hold attention here is Aubrey Morris - an actor famous for playing eccentric professor or doctor roles in TV shows and movies during the 1960s and 1970s. Mr. Morris feels at home here as an eccentric estate agent, but only because his character has very limited screen time and also plays no part in the unpleasantness that almost the entire remainder comprises.<br /><br />Perhaps UP THE JUNCTION could have worked as a social message about poverty, hopelessness and social decay if it had been done in a satirical manner. Instead the result was perhaps the most depressing movie I have ever had the misfortune to endure.<br /><br />Ironically, the director of this atrocity - Peter Collinson - directed AND THEN THERE WERE NONE - a truly entertaining and suspenseful adaptation of the novel of the same name by Agatha Christie. Mr. Collinson can direct and really came into his own with AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. I actually prefer his adaptation over the more famous 1945 one. I would instead advise readers of this comment to see that movie instead. It is executed almost entirely without humour but is highly entertaining, suspenseful and ultimately compelling. The DVD has finally been released in 2010 after years of dithering by Optimum Releasing. The transfer is great and the aforementioned DVD distributor can once again be congratulated.<br /><br />Overall, I wholeheartedly advise everyone to steer well clear of UP THE JUNCTION. It will depress you to unbearable levels. I mean that literally. You have been warned!
