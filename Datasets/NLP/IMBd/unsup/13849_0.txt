Adaptation of a hit musical based on a comic strip. It's about a tiny town called Dogpatch and its various strange inhabitants. Chief among them are strong, tall, incredibly handsome Li'l Abner (Peter Palmer) and incredibly beautiful Daisy Mae (Leslie Parrish). There are various plots flying around but basically Daisy Mae is in love with Li'l Abner and wants to marry him...but he keeps stopping short of it and doesn't know why. There's also various other characters that have names like Earthquake McGoon and Marryin' Sam.<br /><br />This is one of the few movies shot in a widescreen process called VistaVision. That was a great idea because there are some huge musical numbers that completely fill the wide screen. The dances are colorful and (to put it mildly) energetic. The songs are all pretty good with some very clever lyrics. In fact all the characters introduce themselves by singing to the audience! Some people may enjoy the fact that all the young women here are in great shape and wear VERY revealing costumes. We also have a sequence with some muscular handsome men are shown only wearing shorts. Cheesecake AND beefcake! However there are drawbacks here. Palmer and Parrish are both incredibly beautiful people and can sing and dance...but not act. Palmer's acting was incredibly wooden--Parrish wasn't much better. Everybody else overacts to a large degree. The plots are pretty stupid and full of corny humor. A little corny humor goes a LONG way and, at two hours, it gets annoying.<br /><br />Still this is worth seeing for the colorful sets and costumes, the songs and the incredible dance numbers. Also Jerry Lewis does a (thankfully) brief cameo. Also look for Valerie Harper and Beth Howland as two of the women who have husbands at the end.
