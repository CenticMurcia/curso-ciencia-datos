This movie was the worst. There are no laughs to be found. The car stunts are horrible. What's with the animated birds during the cocaine scene? I mean, I loved Owen and Ben in Zoolander, but there is no chemistry and no humor to found in this anemic, poorly directed piece of garbage. If you found this funny, I'd go see the doctor to make sure you're not suffering from a massive brain tumor or a broken funny bone.<br /><br />Also, if I have to see one more movie where Ben, Owen, Luke, Vince, and/or Will make another set of self-serving cameos, I'm gonna rip all my hair out. Please save yourself the pain and rent something else. Something funny.
