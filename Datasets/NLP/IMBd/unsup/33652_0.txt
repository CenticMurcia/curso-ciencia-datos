This film takes the position that society has no legitimate interest in "interfering" in a romance between a fifteen- and a twenty-nine-year-old; I disagree, but more than that I was offended by the portrayal in the film of those who share my concern: bigots, drinkers, military disciplinarians. The film presents a repellent point of view: that those who advocate relationships with minors -- and the minors themselves -- are victims of society's intolerance; to make their point more profoundly, the filmmakers make their couple victims in many other ways: Charley's mother and best friend are deaf, his mother was killed by a drunk driver while he watched, his father is senselessly cruel, while Eban has been fired from his job (a boys' athletic coach) and is hounded by his ruthlessly "concerned" parents. At one point, a propos of nothing, Charley's friend Sunshine (whose parents kick her out of the house for dating a non-white) asks Charley if he's heard about a young man in Seattle who was beaten "just for being a gay kid." Where does the bravery in the face of injustice end? The film's composition and tone are spare; I was reminded of a Belle and Sebastian cd cover, and then lo and behold, the band was thanked in the end credits. For inspiration, I wonder? 1/10
