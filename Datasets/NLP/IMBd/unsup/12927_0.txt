Terrifying film about an evil old fortune hunter and his villainous cohort that plan to knock off his niece for her inheritance. Splendid film with memorable performances by Derrick DeMarney, Katina Paxinou and lovely young Jean Simmons as the three main protagonists. Great background music adds just the right touch to this British made gem. Unfortunately, the U.S. prints have been edited, altered and the title has been changed from "Uncle Silas" to "The Inheritance" (Why?). I hope that one day the American Film Institute will obtain an unaltered print of this film from the British Film Institute and get it properly played on the American scene. Great chiller that is definitely worth viewing.
