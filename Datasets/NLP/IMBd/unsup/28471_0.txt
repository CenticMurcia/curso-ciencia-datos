The first time I watched Common Ground I actually sobbed. Unless a person is Gay, Lesbian or Bisexual, I really think it's very hard for heterosexuals to understand what many of us have gone through, or are currently going through!<br /><br />This brilliant story links together three generations of gay and lesbian struggles in a mythical rural town in Connecticut. I came of age sexually in the second story, which takes place in the 1970's. I can identify only too well what the young gay man experienced at the hands of his fellow bigoted classmates. And it ain't pretty! But the courage and fortitude he showed to everyone made me feel proud - and relieved - because I know there are people actually like him in the real world! <br /><br />While Common Ground ends on a positive note and Connecticut actually is one of the first states to legalize gay marriage, I wouldn't want to be holding a wedding (or similar) ceremony in a place like rural Oklahoma or in 2/3 of the United States, for that matter! The struggles of previous generations (the first two stories in the film) are still common in way too many places, even if substantial progress has been made in the West Coast, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Iowa (who would have guessed a gay person would have more rights in the heartland than in California? Good For You Iowa!) Unfortunately, the struggle for fairness and common sense needs to continue! <br /><br />Few area of a person's life are more personal and important than one's own sexuality! I wonder how bigoted heterosexuals would feels if they woke up one morning on another planet and they were made to feel something was wrong with them for being straight instead of, let's say, bisexual! What, you don't engage in romantic relationships with BOTH genders! How strange! How odd! How could you possibly not be sexually attracted to both genders? What's wrong with you? This is a lovely fantasy I wish I could have every bigot experience!<br /><br />I can only hope that in 2009 Common Ground is released on DVD and the extremely ridiculous "R" rating is downgraded to PG-13. To realize that a teenager struggling with his or her sexuality could not privately order Common Ground on their own is simply OUTRAGEOUS! The "R" rating and the fact that this film has not migrated to DVD speaks volumes about our society's utter stupidity when it comes to treating Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual people fairly.<br /><br />See also: Out of the Past: The Struggle for Gay and Lesbian Rights in America
