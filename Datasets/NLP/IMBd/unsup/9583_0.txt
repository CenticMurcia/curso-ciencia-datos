i have seen this film a few times but have never really been drawn to the storyline, i find the story predictable and boring, how ever i find the filming of the movie is eye catching and very cleverly done. the films major downside is that it is in french, with reading the translation below the screen you miss half of the story and the main events of the film.<br /><br />the film is about a young lady called Amelie who finds a box in her bathroom, and starts her search to return it to the rightful owner, along the way he imagination brings even the little repeated event to be blown into a huge per portion.<br /><br />with watching the film numerous times i have now picked up on the camera work and the magnificent colours, with noticing in the first time i watch Amelie the fantastic camera work and special effect which bring the film to life and help tell the story with out the translation, the camera work has defiantly made up for the storyline in Amelie and you notice something every time you watch the film.the colours also help the film and always give your eyes something to notice.<br /><br />i dislike this film but at the same time i love it, Jean-Pierre Jeunet has made up his story line with fascinating camera angles and shots which have even made the biggest movies look dull.<br /><br />i would recommend this film to other media students who would like to look at good camera work and fantastic colours but not to someone who would like a good storyline.
