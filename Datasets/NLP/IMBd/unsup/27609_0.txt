This film is memorable for one reason and one reason only:Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor,together as a unit.They had a chemistry that was undeniable,and they are in full force here.The script is flawed,the supporting cast,at least for the most part,forgettable,and I'm not knocking Sidney Poitier as a director,but I always considered him to be much better in front of the camera than behind it.Much of the dialog and interaction between the two main stars was no doubt improvised,and they probably needed no instruction from Poitier whatsoever.As funny as the two men were separately,there was just something special about them on screen together.They were just knock down,drag out funny,and if you were to just put them on an empty stage with no sets,props or even a script,put a movie camera in front them and just said "action!",the result would most likely be priceless.See Stir Crazy for the unbelievable talent that was Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor.Without them,the film would have been forgotten,and very quickly.
