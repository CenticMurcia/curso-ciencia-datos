This is bleak and uncompromising stuff. Made in a tradition reminiscent of the best Cold War books and productions on nuclear war, an activist, a physicist, a politician and a geologist explain in rational and dispassionate terms the background to the energy crisis we face and, most alarmingly, highlight how totally unprepared we are to adjust to a world where oil is a scant resource, one we will all face in just a few years time. There are no vox pops to add light entertainment, no colourful graphics, no sense of theatre, no narrator to soften the blows of the stark reality in the experts' words. The effect is highly disturbing and makes a movie no-one with a sense of responsibility to the next generation should miss.
