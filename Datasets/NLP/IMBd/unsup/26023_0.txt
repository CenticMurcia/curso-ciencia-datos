(Warning; Spoiler. skip to the last paragraph) this is just my opinion, but the first movie, up until Kraine (Bacon) changed the passwords on the lab doors, the movie was all about what we'd do (or what we'd fantasize about doing, anyway) if we were invisible. After that point, however, the movie basically becomes a rip-off of Alien.<br /><br />In hollow Man II, they basically skipped all the Paul Verhoven stuff and went directly into the Alien rip-off. This makes about as much sense as making a re-make of "the Wizard of Oz" and focusing on what Uncle Henry and Aunty Em are doing while Dorothy is asleep. there's only two scenes in which a female takes her clothes off, and then Christian Slater doesn't even really do anything to them.<br /><br />In the first movie, Kevin Bacon is actually there all the time, and he becomes "visible" in several ways; blood splatter, water, plugs on head, infrared, manipulating objects (and body parts) etc. Even when he's wearing a latex mask you can clearly see both that he is there and that he isn't. In hollow Man II, Christian Slater is often just a voice-over and the other actors are just miming. At one point, Christian Slater is wearing a ski mask with eye holes, and the female scientist sprays him in the eyes with yellow spray paint (the SAME spray paint she already used to see his vein) and yet, for some odd reason, the spray paint only made the mask yellow around the holes, it didn't make his eyelids visible.<br /><br />You don't even see the actual anatomic transformation, You do see; Slater washing some blood of his face with tap water, two invisible guys fighting in the rain, footsteps on grass and carpets, but nothing even close to the sleeping redhead in the first movie. Most of the "Effects" in Hollow Man II are no more high tech and nowhere near as clever as the scene where Elizabeth Shue's coke kept disappearing.<br /><br />To summaries; if you liked hollow man for the same reason I did, don't waste your time with this one.
