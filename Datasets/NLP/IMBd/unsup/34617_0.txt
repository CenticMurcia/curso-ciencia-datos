all i can say is i fully expected the tavern wench/lady pirate to start removing all her clothes at every turn, as i have seen this caliber of acting before... in another genre. +++SPOILER+++ this is NOT a porn movie! tho it would make more sense if it was. i was about to wager that Asylum Home Entertainment was a company trying to break in to mainstream producing, when i noticed comments elsewhere that it appears their M.O. is to 'piggy-back' blockbuster movies by releasing 'C' movies with similar titles. this certainly would explain this release. i know better now. watch this expecting a 0... and u will be pleasantly surprised with a 1 by the way... why hasn't the producer or the grips' mother written in the lead review yet? usually they get it in fairly fast.
