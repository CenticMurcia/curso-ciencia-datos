Overlong and indulgent by what feels like 15 different dream sequences, the sequel to "Billy Jack" barely redeems itself with bigger budgeted action scenes. Tom Laughlin may have been able to coax the Billy Jack character out of his slumber, but in this sequel the man practically needs a pair of crutches. Now the lovable hippie school from the first movie has become a regular college, this accompanied by plenty of ominous voice-over about the endangered state of American universities due to rioting and violent National Guard suppression. To further send home the point, Laughlin throws in a hideous Vietnam flashback massacre to boot. Now the town's hillbillies are better organized and subdue/harass the peace-loving long-hairs and Native-Americans with even the FBI involved. Laughlin gained weight after the blazing success of "Billy Jack"--instead of getting buffer like Stallone for his follow-up "Rambo"--and it shows in the fight scenes. Now, Billy Jack likes to talk even more to his combatants before kicking their heads in. One exceptional dummy thrown out a window, only to land on its head, is actually a real human, but the rest of the action is unremarkable. By the time the government soldiers roll in to mow down the hippies, we've grown so tired of their singing and ceremonies and the 15 hallucinatory dream sequences Laughlin has included to suggest his kinship with Jesus Christ (seriously!), it's reminiscent of the end of Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate", where every romanticized immigrant per screen hour practically justifies the finale massacre. Tucson and Florence, Arizona do provide some wonderful locations.
