I would just like to say that I love this movie. First of all, it pleases me to see De Niro when he is at his prime, or at least a lot younger. I think this is the kind of movie, where De niro's desire for humor in movies comes at his best! His ability for perfect sarcasm in this film is beyond me. How many times a laughed in this film, I don't know. Probably trough out the whole movie. But it's not just De Niro, which makes this movie great. Every single actor does his best to make this a fine movie, with good acting and directing. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a GOOD movie, where he can laugh , or enjoy the action , or even enjoy the "romantic moment" === ( e.g. when his daughter runs out, to give all her babysitting money. To her father, who she hasn't in 9 years.) Thought this was a touchy moment. I gave it 10 out of 10, just because I couldn't find anything that was missing in this movie !! One of the greatest , watch it !!
