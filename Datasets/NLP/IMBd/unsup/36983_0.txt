In between the sexy VIXEN and the sexy and hilarious BENEATH THE VALLEY OF THE ULTRAVIXENS, Russ Meyer made this horrendous piece of cinematic crap. The women in it are pretty, to be sure, but they're also totally unlikeable. Even Clint, the hero, generates no sympathy in the least. There are two things that I DID enjoy about this: One is the performance of Charles Napier as the slimy, despicable Harry Sledge. Truly one of the best villains to grace the silver screen. The other good thing is the scenes involving Stu Lancaster and the incomparable Uschi Digart as a married farm couple who take Clint in after he is mugged. Watching Uschi be . . . well, Uschi . . . almost make it worth sitting through the surrounding nastiness. There is also the appearance of fellow Chicagoan Anne Marie (Eufala Roop from ULTRAVIXENS) that is all too brief.
