-of the Hughes Teen films, which I think is an important genre of films, especially from the 1980's. This one is basically joke/joke/joke/maudlin moment/joke/joke/joke. But it somehow works, largely on the strength of the cast. Molly Ringwald has never been better, and Anthony Michael Hall is superb. Their chemistry holds it together, as is the case in most of the Hughes films. But there is an undeniable glee and anarchy present that makes this worth watching, despite some crude film making and jokes that fall flat.
