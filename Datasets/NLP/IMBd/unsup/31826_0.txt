Of all the films of Shahrukh Khan which are available on DVD, I would say this is one of the least pleasing I've seen. Try just about any other one first. This tangled, jumbled mess of a film makes little if any sense at all. Any film with Alok Nath trying to slash someone to death with a sword is a bad one.
