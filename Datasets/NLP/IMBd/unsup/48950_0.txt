This film deserves recognition by virtue of its cinematography and for the first class (almost brilliant) job done by the leading actress. The story was over worked and under researched. The suspension of disbelief must be supported in drama, not undermined as it was here. For a man to change sex, face a mirror for the benefit of the audience (look, breasts and no penis) and then declare that she felt no different but only looked different, is the biggest insult ever leveled at women in the history of storytelling. The differences between men and women (even the obvious ones) go far and above breasts and a penis. For many reasons, the story was too simplistic too obviously a slap in the face for pater and a nudge in the ribs for anyone who would giggle and snort or nod knowingly. What could have been a meaningful story about the dreadful abuse of women and the crazy notions forged by generation after generation of self interested, jealous and frightened men of power, turned out to be a soulless and simple romp, highlighted here and there with the help of "painting by numbers."
