Yes, some of the events in this movie may be predictable, but I really loved this movie. It's got everything... scares, heartbreak, sadness, pain, happiness... everything except a sappy love story included. I really like Leelee Sobieski, and I think she's a great actress. (She's totally a young Helen Hunt.) I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be scared... just not to the point of terror.
