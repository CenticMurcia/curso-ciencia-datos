Vincent D'Onofrio was wonderful in this film! I Have heard him referred to as a "simple" fisherman, but, on the contrary, I found him to be the more complex character of the so-called romantic duo. Gavin had qualities such as an inner strength, loyalty, kindness, and he never stopped growing as an individual until he died.<br /><br />The Gavin who first appeared at the beginning at the film was different from the man whose death was being Mourned at the end of the film.<br /><br />George(Greta Scacch) was a pretentious, shallow, and unkind person who mistook acts of sexual passion for love, and remained unchanged until the end. Her many small unkindness towards to Gavin irked me, and her "contempt" for the presents he chose for her during their trysts together are a prime example of that.<br /><br />I thought the saddest and most poignant scene was during their last meeting together before his death and she finally approved of the small gift he gave her. Gavin's sweet happiness when he exclaimed, " at last, I got you something you really like" broke my heart! The character of George was a stone cold witch and she proved it until the end when she intruded on Gavin's funeral like an unwelcome guest to hurt his wife (who had truly loved him and shared her life with him) only to reminded her that that she hadn't had all of his love!
