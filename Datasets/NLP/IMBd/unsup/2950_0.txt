Okay, the make-up and sfx (or lack thereof) are simply ridiculous, but that in a way adds to the fun. The movie is cleverly written, with some definite and obvious nods towards Quentin Tarantino's style of pop culture infused script. The naked for the hell of it zombies are swell, and the movie delivers more than a few decent chuckles. I think an attempt to make viewers more aware of this films spoof nature, as opposed to actual "scary zombie" would garner it a more wide spread enjoyment. The spaceship angle is a bit goofy, but plays up the randomness of the Romero films, with the "why did this just start happening" aspect. And the preacher going off on his church was a clever bit. For a micro-budget film, this one really is worth picking up and giving a view.
