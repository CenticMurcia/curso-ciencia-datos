I can't believe I just spent the better part of two hours watching this movie. Melanie Griffith is completely wrong for this part, although I can't think of anyone that would be good in this story. This movie is simply terrible. Terrible acting, terrible story, just terrible. I wanted to turn it off after about 30 minutes, but I was a glutton for punishment. I felt I had to sit through it to the end to find out what happened. I wish now that I had just turned it off. There is nothing believable about what happens. It is a poor man's version of "Witness." There is no chemistry at all between the lead characters. I thought Melanie Griffith was horrible in "Working Girl" but she was even worse in this movie. I was torn between laughing at how bad it was and complete astonishment that it was actually released in theaters. Don't waste your time.
