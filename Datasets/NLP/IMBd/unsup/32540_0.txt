After waiting so long for this title to be released I have to say I was rather let down. It did not have the feel of the other films (aside for the chronic overacting)and thus left me feeling as though I was watching any old "camp in woods, people dying flick". Nothing felt right about it. The mean kids were not mean enough by a long shot, the lazy camp staff just plan pointless and useless and the horror, well Maybe I watched the sanitised version but it was all but non existent.<br /><br />The one saving grace of this film, the Cancer Inflicted Cop. I am not sure if his character was meant to be so intentionally funny but I found it hard not to laugh each time he had screen time. <br /><br />Oh and no prizes for guessing who Angela is after the fist 10 minutes.
