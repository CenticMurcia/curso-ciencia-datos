This movie does the best job I've seen in portraying what it must have been like to see and live in Auschwitz. It is a better movie then "Schindler's List" which is avowed to set the standard for movies about the Holocaust. The story is about a conspiracy among some death camp inmates who have been set aside to create temporary labor in the extermination process. Their conspiracy is to destroy the crematoria which are a crucial link in the factory of death that was these special concentration camps.<br /><br />It was especially good to see Keitel and Buscemi in this movie where their reputations and experience prevent it from winding up in the art film ghetto.
