This movie is just flat out beyond horrible! After reading many comments about how bad it was, I decided to see whether or not I could watch the whole thing.<br /><br />The result: enduring the movie is almost impossible, and something I would never recommend watching. <br /><br />In retrospect, I actually feel like crying. NOT because it was good, but because high noon is a complete disgrace to the other 3 movies.<br /><br />The 3 replacement actors don't seem to know martial arts at all. The acting was pretty bad and fake, and the characters of the original three ninjas were destroyed as a result.<br /><br />Like others have mentioned, I would not consider high noon to be part of the 3 Ninjas series.
