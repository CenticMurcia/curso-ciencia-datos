Casting was horrible. Chun-Li was my favorite character from the game. Kristin Kreuk does not have her thighs. She never wore the short dress as in the game. She only had her hair in two bobs once in the movie. Chun Li is supposed to have amazing thighs, two bobs, sort of pale, and she is supposed to yell yep-yep while she is fighting. She also had way to many flying fighting moves. With todays technology they could of made her moves glow in every fight. Bison never wore his uniform and did not perform any of his sliding moves. Balrog was horribly casted with Duncan. Vega is supposed to be like 7 feet tall. I am just so mad at this movie I could just beat up the scriptwriter/director and whoever did the casting needs to be shot. The first half of the movie should of been back story and the second half should of been a worldwide tournament. How hard is this? The back of the DVD states "round one fight". This is misleading as hell.
