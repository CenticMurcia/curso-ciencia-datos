One of the worst films I've seen (but not the worst so I'll give it that.) <br /><br />It's clear that someone spent a lot of time and effort making this film but I must admit it just didn't do it for me. The various camera experiments didn't really pay off, it's still got that kind of daytime drama feel to it, (great for daytime dramas, not so good for films) and the less said about the painful slow motion scene the better.<br /><br />A couple of the plot lines were more than a little ridiculous and generally the story was fairly poor. The script was only rescued by the comedy builders with their refreshingly bawdy banter. (There were other parts of this film that amused me but I don't think they were meant to.) <br /><br />If you want a good Voodoo film then try Skeleton Key, it's a bit glossy Hollywood but it's better than this.
