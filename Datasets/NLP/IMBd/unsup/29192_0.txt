Luis Buñuel's "The Phantom of Liberty" is definitely a thought-provoking film. His surrealist approach to film questions society's rules and customs. Though the scenes are quite bizarre, they still manage to feel "right." The way in which they question the social order of things is like a visual manifestation and elaboration of questions I have asked myself. The contradictions Buñuel proudly exhibits are fabulous. People have been brought up to think a certain way and expect certain things, and Buñuel's humorous defiance of our expectations makes one think about where our expectations come from, and how legitimate they really are. And yet, everything is done with a lot of fun. "The Phantom of Liberty" is like a philosophical discussion about life and individuality and independence of thought made into a movie. I really liked it because it truly made me think about why I am the way I am. It's a good movie to see. I definitely recommend it.
