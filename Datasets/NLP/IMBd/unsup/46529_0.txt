I caught this film on cable the other night, and I totally mystified me.<br /><br />Los Angeles in 1972 was one of the most influential periods in the history of rock music. The Eagles, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt and the best session people in the country were located here. David Geffen was starting Asylum records. Tom Waits was playing in the local clubs. They ended up dominating the 70's in both critical acclaim and record sales. That would make an interesting movie.<br /><br />Or if you wanted to make a film about groupies and English rockers (who wouldn't be playing at the Whiskey for crying out loud) then why not make a film about Rodney Bingenheimer's English Acid where cute underage Valley girls hooked up with stoned out limey superstars. Again - the possibilities are endless.<br /><br />Unfortunately the makers of Sunset Strip decided to make a somewhat racy version of Love American Style - complete with the kinds of characters and clothes that would have fit easily in a Barnaby Jones episode from the time. They could have easily set the film in today's Hollywood and then at least the film might have been more marketable, and the retro music might have made more sense. (The film's English superstar band sounded a lot more like the Psychedelic Furs then Led Zeppelin.)<br /><br />One more thing - the only film I want to see that features the clap in a prominent role is something for ninth grade health class or the the Fatty Arbuckle story.
