It's amazing how even an ultra-talented ensemble cast couldn't save this film. According to Moore's "Adventures in a TV Nation" book, many of the featured actors agreed to make Canadian Bacon because they were shown the TV Nation pilot. They likely didn't know what they were really getting into.<br /><br />Canadian Bacon is less entertaining than colon-rectal surgery. It's tedious, unfunny, and meandering. And when it attempts to recreate Dr. Strangelove (which is frequently), it borders on being unwatchable. I smiled ONCE during the film ... during the graffiti scene. Cabin Boy is more fun to sit through than this dumbed-down "comedy."<br /><br />I like Michael Moore a lot. I think he makes great reality-based satire. I also think he realized that was his calling after seeing this finished product. I really hope so.
