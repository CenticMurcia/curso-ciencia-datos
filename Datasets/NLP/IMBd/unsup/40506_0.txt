This film has a cult following, much like Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator or Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, but isn't close to entertaining as the two cult classics. I am a huge fan of cult films - I even enjoy such obscure cult flicks like Head of the Family and Don't Look in the Basement, so I was anticipating an enjoyable ride with Basket Case, but it didn't deliver. Everything about this film is bargain--basement, from the acting to the effects. The stop-motion effects are TERRIBLE. I realize this isn't Harryhausen, but low-budget filmmaker Brett Piper uses stop-motion quite well.<br /><br />The film tells the tale of conjoined twins - one little more than a head growing out of his fully developed brother's right side. His father hires a trio of quack doctors to remove the head, named Belial, from the body of the anatomically correct Duane. The doctors throw away Belial after removing him from Duane's side, but Duane picks his brother out of the trash bin and they go on a revenge murder spree, killing the doctors who separated them.<br /><br />STORY: $$$ (This isn't the problem. The story is interesting but everything else is muddled. This dialogue is bad and the effects are terrible. In more capable hands, this could have been the cult classic that some people proclaim it to actually be).<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$$ (There is plenty of blood in this film. The best scene is when Belial gets busy with a set of scalpels and plants them in the female doctor's face. If gore is your thing, then this won't upset, but if you like well written dialogue, then don't bother).<br /><br />ACTING: $ (Terrible, from top to bottom. There isn't a soul in this film with a shred of talent. The lead, Kevin Van Whatever, is in desperate need of acting lessons as is his love interest, Terri Smith, in her only film credit mind you. The doctors were poor actors and the people inhabiting the motel seemed plucked from off the streets).<br /><br />NUDITY: $$$$ (Plenty of it - men and women
