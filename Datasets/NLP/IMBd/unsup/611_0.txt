I have been watching Days of Our Lives for 11 years and am still a HUGE fan. I have found there to be at least one good storyline at all times on the show even if there are a couple other ones that are slightly on the boring side. For the most part, the acting is well done and isn't as cheesy as some of the other soap operas I occasionally watch (minus Deidre Hall who is REALLY breathy and over-the-top with her acting at times). Some of the story lines are truly memorable and stick with you for years (for example, Sami on trial for Franco's murder). I will admit that when I first started watching it, there seemed to be more romance with the main couples (Bo and Hope, John and Marlena) and that some of the story lines in recent years have really affected these relationships. Nevertheless, this soap opera still offers romance and a variety of story lines that cater to the genre interests of television fans. It delivers high-quality entertainment for soap opera fans and luckily has many of the original actors that people have come to know and love (Alison Sweeney you are still my personal favorite). If you are looking for a new soap opera to fill your daytime television schedule, Days of Our Lives is a great choice to consider.
