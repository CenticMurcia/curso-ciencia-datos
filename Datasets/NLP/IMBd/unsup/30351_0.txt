...that a human mind is capable of creating such intriguing plot - so terrifying and captivating this movie is. Frank Capello is obviously a man of genius. But he is not nice and gentle to his audience. The movie is sharp-straight, honest and pretty cruel to a person watching it. It doesn't compromise. Don't expect it to comply with general drama movie rules. <br /><br />*** BE AWARE OF SPOILERS BELOW ***<br /><br />After you ve seen 50% of it or so you think it's pretty common drama, quite predictable and possibly happily ending one. Well, its not. Not at all. And so shockingly not.<br /><br />Cast is perfect. I would never think Slater could fit into the role of Bob. W.Macy would fit better, I thought. But these thoughts faded away.<br /><br />The movie is not open-ended despite what some people say. You just have to think harder than you usually do while watching a regular movie. Be more attentive or watch it again.<br /><br />Capello makes you think. If you want to know what really happened analyze the details. There are answers.<br /><br />I give 9 out of 10, because Capello rudely and savagely ruined my hopes for the better ending :)
