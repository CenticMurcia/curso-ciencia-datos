When Shirley Temple was too old for those little girl films, she was able to play enjoyable Teenagers in some classic roles and probably her best is in this one. She plays "Susan Turner" the sister of "Judge Turner" played by Myrna Loy. Poor Susan seems to fall in love whenever a guest speaker arrives in her high school and the very bachelor "Dick Nugent" Cary Grant ends up with her. Susan is deeply in love with Grant but that begins to become a "love triangle." Grant and Loy are at their best as two grownups falling in love, but trying to deny it because of Susan. This is a fun and fast paced film with characters that you love. The supporting actors are great also lead by "Lt. Tragg, oops I mean Ray Collins" playing Uncle Matt to the Turners. Memorable Dialog catches your interest especially about the one about the "man." It goes like this: "You remind me of a man! What man? The man with the power! What power? The power of whodo! Whodo? You do! What? Remind me of a man! This is one film that you will always enjoy!
