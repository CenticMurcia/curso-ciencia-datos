Went straight into my bottom 10 movies of all time.<br /><br />It's not even so bad it's actually funny.<br /><br />It sets whole new standards of how bad a movie can be. Horrible pacing, awful editing, bad acting, and that's without mentioning the "Dinosaurs". I've met 16 year olds who could do better CGI & compositing than exhibited in this stinking mess.<br /><br />It has no artistic merit, and wound me up so much I actually finally got around to registering after using this site for years simply so I could post this dire warning..<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.
