I will not write of the non existent talent in this piece of trash, nor that I think any person (gay straight or refined beyond that) who writes positively about this is either playing tongue in cheek or totally high. Rather, I only add my 2 cents to the comments that we need to be supportive and gentle to reviews of gay indie films because they are so "hard to get made." Well, if this is an example of the product put before filmmakers or distributors it's no wonder! There is no excuse for this movie - I honestly cannot believe that all the people on camera are as talentless as they come off - they just bet on our lowered standards so long as they throw us a few tight torso's and full frontals. The ancillary characters were like penance for the good stuff, but there was no good stuff. <br /><br />So long as we praise this poop, we'll continue to get dribbles of it. If we aim higher we might just make a film that we can be truly proud of.<br /><br />I only hope that Ang Lee, and Annie Proulx save us from ourselves.
