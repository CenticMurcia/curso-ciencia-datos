This is an interesting propaganda film from Hollywood in the early 1950s. While in the early 1940s, Hollywood had experienced a short love affair with the Russians (mostly thanks to the US becoming allies with the Russians against the Axis), this film represents a different era--one where fear of spreading Communism and Stalinism gripped much of the world. This film is a far from subtle and occasionally heavy-handed short film about the menace of international Communism and was narrated by many of the biggest Red-haters in Hollywood (such as Robert Taylor). While nowadays, many in Hollywood have a bit of nostalgia for the old Soviet Union (or at least use moral relativism to make the Western nations seem somehow comparable to it), this was a time when there was great dread of Communism spreading everywhere--thanks to statements by Stalin himself that they would do so.<br /><br />From a historical point of view, this is an amazing look back into the scary days of the nuclear arms race, though as I said above it's all very heavy-handed. While the basic message is true, the silly way that Communism was passed off as comparable to a "snake oil salesman" was a bit goofy and this comparison probably caused more laughs than anything else. Still, an important little film and interesting history lesson from an era that seems so very long ago.
