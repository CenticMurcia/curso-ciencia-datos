And I don't mean that in a good way. 100 % Dullsville all the way through. The film doesn't contain anything worthy of my interest. Even the chicks aren't good-looking! So when they get naked, it's like, "Who cares?" Plus, I assumed since the film is titled "Sorority House Massacre," it would be about a bunch of GIRLS being stalked by a psychotic killer, and not a bunch of girls AND THEIR BOYFRIENDS! That totally destroys all the homo-erotic undertones. There's no moments of humor. The acting is mediocre, which is worse than bad in the case of a film like this, because I can't be impressed by the acting, nor can I laugh at it. There's a nifty scene involving the girls trying to escape from the bedroom window with a ladder, and the killer is waiting on the other end. Not exactly a Hitchcock moment, but it was pretty exciting and that's the only reason I'm giving the movie a score of "2." This is definitely not the trashiest B-slasher ever made, but it's definitely one of the most boring! And in a genre like this, being trashy is not a sin. Being boring--major sin!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!!<br /><br />My score: 2 (out of 10)
