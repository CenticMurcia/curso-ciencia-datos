I read the book in my English class and after we had read and assessed the book we were told that we were in for a treat because we had done such great work. We were allowed to watch the film of I capture the castle in class, It was nothing like the book. they took important bits out and added useless bits in in their places, we lost the motherly characters for rose and Cassandra when Mrs blossom was just a dummy we saw in the corner of the screen and ms Marcy was just a school teacher with little say in their lives when both characters had a great deal of say in the book for as i said they add a kind of motherly atmosphere for the girls for they have no mother and it shows just how much they miss their mother but in the film without them they also loose the atmosphere for rose and Cassandra and their lose and suffering without their biological mother. it is a good film but has little to nothing to the book, if you haven't read the book and are thinking of watching the film then i say that you wont get the real story that Dodie smith wrote.
