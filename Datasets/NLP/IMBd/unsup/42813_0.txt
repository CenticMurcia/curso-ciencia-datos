The only thing really startling about this film is that they could be so predictable. Strong strains of Jurassic Park-type ideas were used without any attempt at even a thin veil of originality.<br /><br />Plot twists were more reminiscent of lazy half spirals as it plummeted to earth in a hurry. The CGI effects were okay but seemed to be done in an effort to distract the viewer from the lack of substance.<br /><br />For a film of this price it's a bad story with even worse execution: 4/10
