I'm open to every ones opinion on different things but come on!!! This movie was great! I loved the fact how it used that the people we send to war are often not treated with the respect they deserve and the consequences from the seclusion and being locked up can do to people. All though this doesn't affect Norman the only non hospitalized Vietnam veteran who was bitten by Tony King (Note that is the guys real name)and how their urges of hunger come to matter (cannibalsim), and yes we can all say "We know what they are feeling." but truthfully I don't think they'll really believe you unless you were actually in Vietnam also. Well since I doubt many have an uncut version on VHS lets talk about the DVD it is loaded with the European trailer Japanese Teaser. A featurette (I think) over the movie and there is a text part about all the cut versions. There is more but I can't think of it right now. So go and enjoy some brought on by war violence in this (what I consider) tragic tale of misfortune.
