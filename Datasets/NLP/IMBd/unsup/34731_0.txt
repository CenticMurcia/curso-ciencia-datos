By now, you probably already know what this movie is all about. But just in case, here is a brief overview of the film: A ship dumps several barrels of nuclear waste into the ocean, apparently too close to the shore. One of the barrels washes onto a beach and begins to leak. Marilyn Fryser (played by Joan Collins) is an unscrupulous land dealer whose only intent is to take money from people. She hires a yacht owner (played by Robert Lansing) to take her potential investors to the proposed building site to see if she can convince them to invest their money in her project. Her plans fall apart when the group discovers the area is populated by dangerous ants who have apparently come into contact with the nuclear waste mentioned earlier.<br /><br />I'm actually a big fan of bad movies. My DVD collection includes a bunch of bad films that probably never should have been made. Watching these films helps me appreciate the really good films even more. Sometimes, these really bad films can also be accidentally hilarious because of how poorly created they are. I recently watched Empire of the Ants because I like Joan Collins, but also because I wanted to see if it was really as bad as everyone says. They were right. This movie is absolutely terrible. Watching this film was a complete waste of my time. <br /><br />The storyline could not have been more boring. Nothing unexpected happens except for one silly thing at the end. The characters are one-dimensional, bland and completely unremarkable. The script was horrible, and the special effects are just awful. I've seen films that were made in the 1920s and 30s that look better than this.<br /><br />I hope you do not make the same mistake I made. There is nothing here that you should want to see. Skip this movie, at all costs.
