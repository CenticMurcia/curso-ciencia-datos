Long, languid shots of an immense beauty define this beautiful story. Warm, gentle colors fill the screen with stunning images and sounds, both music and painful silence awaken all our senses. This is a movie of a different kind than the average Western viewer sees in the theaters.It doesn't bombard you with explosions and cheap thrills. It doesn't cherish the obvious and trite. It dares to force the viewer to introspect and face the disquiet. This is a different world, where the real action and thrill is in the eye of the beholder, where director is not expected or required to chew everything for us, so that, God forbid, the viewer doesn't choke on the plethora of meaning. And guess what? We survived and we are better for it.Thank you.
