There were few new aspects about Michael Jackson's life in this movie. It is worth watching it, because you'll see some never-shown-before footage from Neverland, Jackson's ranch. And that's about it...<br /><br />I watched this movie, because I was hoping to finally learn to know some facts about Michael Jackson, especially as a famous reporter as Bashir could interview him. Jackson might very well be the weirdest performer on earth, he is also one of the most popular and famous ones, so I really thought this movie would get us to see objective aspects of the man's life. Very disappointing... Bashir only asks very suggesting questions, all about Jackson's plastic surgery, his childhood and the scandals about child molesting. For 120 min. you'll hear no other things but Bashir trying to force Jackson to say that all gossip written about him is true. This becomes very, very annoying, and one might even begin to feel embarrassed for ever having believed that Jackson's nose was indeed made of plastic, or that he slept in oxygen chambers...<br /><br />Do yourself a favour: after watching this TV movie, it is absolutely necessary to watch "The truth about Michael Jackson", in which you'll see the footage Bashir never showed, in which he for instance praises Jackson's parenting skills. I bet Jackson never even dared to dream about the day that a journalist would be the underdog for once, instead of backwards!
