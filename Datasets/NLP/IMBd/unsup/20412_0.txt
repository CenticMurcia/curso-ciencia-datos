Sometimes HBO will air the most random movies. I just watched "Paternity" again. I saw it back in the day and loved it then and now.<br /><br />The story of a middle aged successful single bachelor who feels eomthing is missing in his life. He decides he wants a baby, but not a wife or girlfriend...just a baby. He hooks up with Maggie (Diangelo) who is a waitress who also plays the french horn saving for a trip to Paris. He offers her money to be the surrogate (not quite as common then as it is today) and she accepts. During the months that they are together while she's carrying the baby it's obvious to see that they are destined to fall in love, but while it may be predictable it is just very sweet.<br /><br />Great chemistry between buddy and maggie (reynolds and diangelo).
