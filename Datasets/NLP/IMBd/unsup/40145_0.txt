I will admit I didn't pay full attention to everything going on in this film, but to be honest, I don't think it would have mattered. Basically the film takes place at a lavatory factory owned W.C. Boggs (Kenneth Williams), assisted by Sid Plummer (Sid James). The factory is having problems with constant workers calling strikes, most started Vic Spanner (Kenneth Cope), and his co-workers, including ChloÃ« Moore (Joan Sims) and Bernie Hulke (Bernard Bresslaw), were bound to get fed up with him. Meanwhile Charles Coote (Charles Hawtrey) is keeping up work and has invented a bidet, and W.C.'s son Lewis (Richard O'Callaghan) has secured large orders for it, but of course Vic is going to cause another strike out of this. For some reason the story then becomes a work outing on Brighton Pier, but when everyone does get back, everything is resolved. Also starring an annoying Hattie Jacques as Beattie Plummer, Jacki Piper as Myrtle Plummer, Patsy Rowlands as Hortence Withering, Worzel Gummidge's Bill Maynard as Fred Moore, Davy Kaye as Benny and Margaret Nolan as Popsy, but where's Barbara Windsor when you want her? The innuendo attempts have almost zero effect, and the obvious toilet humour is just too ludicrous, so this is certainly one of the weakest entries in the series. Pretty poor!
