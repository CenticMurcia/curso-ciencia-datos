The kind of movie that might have been made in the fifties, when Hollywood was beginning to discover police stories and the gritty cities, with a B cast. This is not a put down. this is praise. very well made. good story. and NOT morally ambiguous, a phrase that I have learned to hate. Mos Def's performance is Oscar worthy. He's very funny and touching. Willis is excellent as the weary cop who sees his last chance to do something right. There are some problems. The minute David Morse comes on the screen, you know he is up to no good before he opens his mouth. And when Willis and Mos are on the bus, why doesn't Willis just call in the police negotiator and explain things to him. But if that happened there would not be a story because the movie would have to end then.
