If you have a good sense of humor -- sophisticated humor, not slap stick or farce -- you will enjoy this movie about character actors and their efforts to break out of their ruts. The premise is that four actors who have long been close friends, are all dissatisfied with the parts they have been lucky to get, if they are getting them at all. Johnny DiMartino, the short obese bald member of the quartet, is called by Theresa (Beverly D'Angelo), a casting director who is a friend of the quartet, for an audition about the title role in a Marty Scorcese (who plays himself) movie about Al Capone. Only he has to keep this very hush hush. The one predictable part of the film is that keeping a secret in Hollywood is not going to happen. The first half of the movie involves the comedy of how the secret gets spread (no, not by the actors' wives, but by actor envy and insecurity). The second half deals with their preparation for the auditions, and of course the climax.<br /><br />An interesting piece of trivia is that actor Robert Costanzo who plays Johnny DiMartino, the actor Theresa selected to audition for the part of Al Capone, actually played that part in "Sizzle," a 1981 ABC TV movie featuring John Forsythe and Loni Anderson.
