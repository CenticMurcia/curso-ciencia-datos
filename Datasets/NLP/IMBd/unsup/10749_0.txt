This movie was extremely funny! Chevy Chase is always hilarious at getting into bad situations, like being forced to rob a bank and becomes a fugitive. Chase stars as a writer named Nick Gardenia, who is the ex-husband of Hawn's character, Glenda Gardenia Parks who has re-married a District Attorney named Ira. Nick desperately needs Glenda's help to hide from the police. She reluctantly hides him at her house, and he is always so close to being caught by her new husband. I love when Glenda and Ira are trying to have dinner with the Governor, and Nick poses as a waiter. Will Nick be able to prove his innocence and still get his ex-wife to love him again? I highly recommend SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES!!!
