Wish this great film had made it to the Big Screen! Absolutely the best film ever made on Teddy Rosevelt.<br /><br />Great for the whole family in my opinion!<br /><br />It not only documents his life... it also presents his great ideals and character as very 'Presidential' and to be desired. The same cannot be said of all our Presidents.<br /><br />The depiction of the battle for San Quan Hill was one of the best war documentaries I've ever seen.<br /><br />An all-star cast helps make this a classic movie.<br /><br />I will get this movie for my collection for sure.<br /><br />I will recommend it to all our family and friends.<br /><br />-BGLewis of Spring Hill, FL
