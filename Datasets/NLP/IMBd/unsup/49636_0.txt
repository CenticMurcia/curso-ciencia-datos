Hmm... it doesn't follow the story very well. Guys don't lay eggs. Draco's death was significent because it was to be the last dragon's. And, the content of A New Beginning deserves a G rating.<br /><br />Seriously, the dialogue was simply childish. Like, "Wow," and "I don't wanna leave!" So yeah, this was pretty fake in and out. The first one had a serious storyline and was awesome to watch. But watching a baby dragon spit fire out his butt, spit on someone from a mile away, to be taught to breath ice, you can't possibly be thrilled by that.<br /><br />Next thing, the special effects were miserable. When Drake breathed "ice," it was was like seeing a bunch of kindergarteners throw chunks of styrafoam as a wall!
