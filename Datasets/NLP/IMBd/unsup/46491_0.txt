From the start it looked to be a good movie, we got a look into the Chun-Li history, followed by a good fight sequence with her father, Micheal Clark Duncan and 3 henchmen. The story continues, and slows down a bit and we follow Chun-Li's journey. Then we are introduced to Charlie Nash (Chris Klein) and Det. Maya Sunee (Moon Bloodgood), who's corny and horrible one line's make you wonder why they are even in the story. Their presence in the Movie ruined anything good in the movie. At one pint Chris Klein delivered a line and sounded like a funny punchline; it wasn't, neither was anything that came out from him. Another disappointment to fan's was the short fight scene between Chun-Li and Vega, the fight was not worth the slight build up for it. In general, I enjoyed a bit of the movie, mainly watching Chun-Li's journey and Bison (Neal McDonough) playing a cold blooded villain; which was the only character that was fun to watch. The opening fight was the best through the movie, after that the rest just are plain. The end give's us a nice little hook to see the next one as they mention Ryu and the Street Fighter Tournament, but if the same writer and director are to do it, I rather save my money and avoid watching it, especially if Charlie Nash (Chris Klein)will be in it.<br /><br />I was disappointed, as a fan and a movie goer.
