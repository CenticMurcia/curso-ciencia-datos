The Party which you refer to is called "Dansk Folkeparti" and they "only" have 12,5% of the votes and is not racist, but they are very hard on immigration, I hate this party from the bottom of my heart, but I love the movie, I think it is the best danish movie ever. So it must be a question of very different types of black humor if Albanians have any (black humor that is), Danish humor often is more black and morbid than British humor, which I normally consider the unofficial world champions of black humor <br /><br />Cheers Bo<br /><br />I have nothing more to say, but there is a minimum of 10 lines, which I think is a lot, I mean not everybody has that much to say! I can appreciate the fact that they don't want short comments like the F-word and such, but 10 lines!!! come on! that's overdoing it, well I hope by now I have written enough, so that my comment will be posted
