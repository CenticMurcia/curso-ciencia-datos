When I heard that Identity lends a lot of the Classic Agatha Christie novel Ten Little Niggers my curiosity was aroused. I like this novel very much, but never really saw a good presentation on film. This movie does start off as a take on the novel: ten people are stranded in a remote location, they all have something in common and then the killing starts. It's quite suspenseful and keeps you wondering who the killer is. But there are little hints and another storyline that makes you suspect something else might be afoot.<br /><br />Then all of a sudden half way through the movie you're hit on the forehead with an enormous revelation and plot twist of almost `Sixth Sense' proportions. This changes the `who's the killer' routine completely and unfortunately also reduces the tension felt before the twist. But still a very good thriller until the decision of the writers to put in another plot twist at the end that completely spoiled the movie for me.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are anything between average and very good, but it's John Cusack, who seems to get better with each movie, again who really carries the movie. Both sound and vision are very well balanced to serve the mood of the story.<br /><br />So would I recommend this movie for your viewing pleasure? I would even with that extra twist at the end that spoiled it for me.
