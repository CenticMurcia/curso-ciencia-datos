Today I feel many people get off on watching famous actors engage in sex and roaming in position which this film portrays. I don't think that this film is for people who love to watch sex on the box, but however for the people who never go that step to engage in hiring a prostitute.<br /><br />The movie explores the lives and feelings in which call girls, escorts and gigolo's work. It provides some fantastic screens shots like the technique of framing a street. Clearly its providing the viewer with the environment which these people earn money to survive.<br /><br />Denise Richards and Darryl Hannah I believe did not really have large roles in this film. The workers themselves got the fame and glory and the above girls were added as actors but portraying somewhat the main objective of the storyline.<br /><br />It was interesting, I really liked the foreign use of language and subtitle, It makes the story more real rather then fake Hollywood. Have Denise and Darryl play there roles split-ed the film and was very clever in how it was timed. Everything flowed making it so much more interesting.<br /><br />10 stars for the foreign girls who have the guts, 7 all up.
