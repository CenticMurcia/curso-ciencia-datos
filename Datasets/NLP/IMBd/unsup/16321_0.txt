If you're a fan of the movies of David Lynch, then you will most likely enjoy this. A tailor is somewhat mediocre at his craft, and when his sister shows up on the scene and starts showing him up, well, he becomes a little nutso. It has certain touches that make it quite a bit more than ordinary, like Thomas's dad, who has a thing for garbanzo beans (they're everywhere) and a bleak, industrial-type setting in a big city. Lots of dark, dark, imagery, and some inexplicably strange things that go on that are never explained, they just ARE. The Annual Tailor's Ball, wherein participating tailors guess the sizes of models as they dance around on stage, is beyond weird. I have to mention the giant needle sticking through the wall of the tailor shop, because it's the point of focus many times, and one just waits for someone to be skewered on it, but that never happens. The ending leaves one wondering exactly what was going on, since some things that preceded seemed to never have happened, but overall this is a excellent watch, very well done. If you're not picky about movies making sense, then this might well be for you. Eight out of 10 stars.
