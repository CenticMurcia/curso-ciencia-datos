Knowing that the filming of this movie was at a Renaissance festival that I have been too, I was intrigued to see this movie. To sum up the movie, it was fantastic! I watched; and as I watched I was enthralled! Some of the characters I recognized from seeing them on the circuit, it was fun to see them again on film. Esmerelda, Don Juan, Miguel, and all the other actors and actresses. The writing was fun to view and listen too! The movie was well thought out, the characters were all well done and the concept was unique and a breath of fresh air! Well done to Don Juan and Miguel for making an independent film that I can allow my children to view. Not to wax eloquence on this, I will simply conclude with, to believe it, you must see it! Thank you.
