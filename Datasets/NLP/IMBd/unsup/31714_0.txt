(SPOILERS) This is the story of a man (Delon) who commits a mistake (a bank robbery) and, although being an excellent person, is never given a second chance by so-called justice. The film is slow (but certainly not boring) as we assist to the development of the character; we see him recovering from 10 years of prison after the bank assault. We also see his love for a first woman, who dies in a car crash (note that nobody actually goes to jail for that "accident" -it was during a car race, and Delon and his wife find themselves right into it without not even knowing it-). After that, he recovers and moves to Montpellier, always under the assistance of his protector (and narrator of the film), where he finds a good job and falls in love with a wonderful girl who happens to work in a bank. Misluck follows then. A "fair" cop who was in his first arrest ten years ago finds him in Montpellier and immediately believes that he is running after mischief. As the cop harasses him (and his wife and his friends) more and more, and tries to link him with another Bank robbery that he has definitely not committed, Delon founds himself hopelessly trapped in the net of justice. Exhasperated, Delon finally kills the cop in the wave of rage (quite understandably) and predictably he is sent to jail and sentenced to death. Death sequence that follows (operated by the all-times star french guillotine) is tactful and strikingly hard, and (thankfully) rather short. The film is quite surprising and the sequence of acts matches like an infernal machine of doom: he main character cannot escape but can see it approaching (so can we). All in all is a perfect rebuke to the hypocrisy of the so-called Justice. A must watch.
