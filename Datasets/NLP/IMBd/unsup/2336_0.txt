Lee Rogers has a unique, sharp style -- both in shooting/laying out a scene, and story-telling. I know he has done several Aussie commercials, but Iwould love to see him do more features. Any in the making? I recommend this film highly for people new to Lee's work. I suppose what attracted me to this film initially was the star, Kate Ceberano, who I know as an incredible singing sensation from Oz. Who knew she could act as well? Maybe it was her director-husband who coaxed that out of her, but the result is still a star-turn for both her AND her husband. I know she has done more music videos, but I would also like to see her in more feature work. Maybe the two of them can work again together soon? I for one will be there in line to watch their work.
