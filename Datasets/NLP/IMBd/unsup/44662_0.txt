Having enjoyed "She's All That" a sweet teenage romantic comedy, I had high hopes for "Down To You." These hopes were dashed about five minutes into the movie. There is little plot and less character development in this film. (Having your main character want to be a chef does not flesh out his character). The dialogue was inane and insipid, the situations completely unbelievable--particularly the pornography subplot, which I can only imagine was meant to be quirky, but fell very flat. The film ends with the two lead characters--right out of college--in professional, well-paying jobs, living in an extremely well furnished apartment--they look like little kids playing dress up. Besides this, the film was boring. The best moment of the film had Henry Winkler throwing a bit of raw salmon onto a table behind him in a sushi restaurant--the only spontaneous, fresh incident of the film. Apparently the makers of this film wanted to repeat the success of "She's All That" without actually having to create a plot, specific characters, or clever situations.
