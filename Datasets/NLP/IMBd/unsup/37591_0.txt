Django (Franco Nero) has given up his brutal past and spent the last ten years in a monastery. When he is captured by slave traders and learns that one of the kidnapped children is his daughter, he escapes and seeks revenge. This woeful update of the Django series, considered by some the official sequel due to bringing Nero back to the role, is not even a western and doesn't even seem to be set in America! The film is in English and is terribly predictable with Django digging up his fake grave which contains his machine gun coffin and just when all seems lost toward the end, the main villain's (Christopher Connelly) jealous servant sets Django free. Although the film seems proud to be associated with the original Django (1966) going to the trouble of listing - "Django created by Sergio Corbucci," this is a disgrace to the original. Co-starring the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance.
