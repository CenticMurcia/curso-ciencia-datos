This cheapie PRC production is pretty much a re-working of the same studio's 1941 THE DEVIL BAT, only it's got George Zucco and a killer bird instead of Bela Lugosi and his lethal monster bat. Zucco is a professor who's discovered Montezuma's treasure and aims to protect it for himself by unleashing the mythological half-reptile "Quetzalcoatl" (it's funny hearing Zucco personally addressing his flying feathered serpent as such) to dispatch his enemies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is nowhere near as much fun as its predecessor. Still, there are some pretty neat attack scenes of the soaring creature flapping through the air to latch onto its victims' throats.
