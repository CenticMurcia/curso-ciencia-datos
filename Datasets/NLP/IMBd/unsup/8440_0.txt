Okay first of all, forget the egghead, moviegeek, fanboy rumblings you will read about this movie. They are taking things way too seriously. This is my all time favorite "B" movie. Bar none. This movie has it all, cheesy effects(I will say that the weather effects were beyond top notch, though), classic acting(come on Jan-Michael Vincent and Paul Winfield? It doesn't get any better!), and a great "B" storyline.<br /><br />Damnation Alley starts out with a lot of intensity...okay it meanders like a drunken parapalegic, but once we get beyond that we realize that lo and behold-the world- *poof* she is gone. World War III is done and over in less time than it took to get Normal, Ohio off of FOX. We then jump right into the world after the war, which apparently show us that the only people surviving nuclear winter will be "B" actors-go figure.<br /><br />George Peppard, Jan-Micheal(Hiccup!)Vincent, and Paul Winfield head off on a road trip to stop a home made porno from reacing George's girlfriend in...wait...that's not right. Oh yeah, they go to Albany, NY-the last bastion of civlization (snicker snicker) And on the way they meet many strange settings...well George and "Hard Livin'" Jan-Michael do...Paul gets offed by a bunch of blood thirsty cockroaches-see I told you the only thing to survive would be "B" actors.<br /><br />They soon meet up with a slu..I mean a woman of questionable repute in Las Vegas and a young man who I believe to be that possum looking kid from deliverance. After running into the local branch of NRA in a secluded ozarkian setting they make their final run to the promised land....Albany, NY. I won't give away the ending...yeah like it's a shocker...but I do recommend you see this classic "B" film.
