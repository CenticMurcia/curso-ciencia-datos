This sure looks like a hurry up and get this thing over with movie. A perfect movie for when your mind is not totally on the movie; such as the drive in theater fare of the late 50s. This flick might even be funnier than it is scary.<br /><br /> A young couple in the heat of their passions discover a bug eyed creature from who knows where. These alien beings have detachable hands that crawl and have an eyeball and fingers that inject alcohol. Got your interest?<br /><br />Fun to watch for a laugh. Yes that is Frank Gorshin. Also in the cast are Steven Terrell, Gloria Castillo and Lyn Osborn.
