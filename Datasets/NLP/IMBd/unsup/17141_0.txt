I saw this in the early 1950's broadcast in Minneapolis/St. Paul between late 1953 and 1956. It made a big impression upon me so that I do remember the name but only some sketchy scenes. For an 8 or 10 year old it was exciting.<br /><br />I never saw it rebroadcast and had almost convinced myself that it was a figment of imagination.<br /><br />I too would like to view this film to see if it "holds up" over time or would be as laughable as "Action in the North Atlantic" which is only shown now because it has Bogart. Would this movie compare or contrast to "The Big Red One", "Tora, Tora, Tora", "Das Boot" or "All Quiet on the Western Front"?
