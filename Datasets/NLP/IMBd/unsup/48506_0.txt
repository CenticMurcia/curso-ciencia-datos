Pros: *It's only one hour long *Teen Ape is a very likable character *Lots of angular goofiness *Lead actress Missy Donatuti could probably be pretty good with some competent direction<br /><br />Cons: *Many of the referential jokes fall flat. REAlly flat. *BoneJack is a collection of terrifically embarrassing racial stereotypes *Mulva is like the most insipid SNL character you can imagine run amok *Many people consider the saving grace of the film to be the 4 minute cameo by the star of "Bikini Bloodbath." What does that tell you?<br /><br />On the whole, the movie is likable in that the folks involved seem to have given it their all - that same sort of pathetic earnestness that make Ed Wood films impossible to hate. But please guys, rent some decent equipment and lighting next time, OK?
