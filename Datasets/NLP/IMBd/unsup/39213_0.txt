Please, if I can stop just one person from seeing this movie my life will not be wasted. I wanted a fun movie for the whole family. I expected a weak plot and bad acting (both of which I got in abundance), what I didn't expect was this movie's negativity. The boy says shut-up at least fifty times, and the parrot says moron at least a dozen times.<br /><br />The movie begins with an upset boy who gets into lots of fights with his Dad (his home-life sucks). He likes his Grandpa. The first thirty-five minutes of this movie is how horrible this boys life is at home. So at least the rest of the movie is uplifting. WRONG! On his quest the boy is constantly badgered by this annoying parrot, whom is rude and cruel to complete strangers in airplanes, hotels, etc. The boy fails and fails to believe in himself until the parrot calls him a quitter (just like his good old Dad).<br /><br />To top off the movie, the boy destroys someone else's property and is declared a hero for doing so.<br /><br />Therefore, my kids learned lots of mean words, watched a negative outlook on life, and learned that if you destroy other people's property you can profit from it. If you like all of the above, plus the bad plot/acting/directing, than see this movie. Otherwise avoid it at all costs.
