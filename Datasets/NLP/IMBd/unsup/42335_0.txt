Not impressed by Jenny Agutter - she seems to be there simply for the sake of providing a pretty female. BUT the Donald Sutherland character is simply dire. I assume that when a play or drama is cast the actors will be able to fit their parts. Sutherland however, is a total embarrassment in his part. His attempt at an Irish accent is quite simply a joke - pathetic and totally unrealistic. I love to hear regional accents if the actor is capable of doing the required accent. Sutherland is not - his attempt at an Irish accent is both puerile and embarrassing. There must be hundreds of as yet unknown Irish actors who could have played the part convincingly but we have to put up with an American "star" who insults our intelligence with his pathetic attempt at an Irish accent. I ask, and not for the first time: Where a part requires an actor to speak in a regional accent, can we please have an actor who is capable of delivering that accent accurately, even if the actor is hitherto unknown, rather than some "big name" actor who is happy to earn a large pay packet for insulting viewers with a puerile attempt at the accent. Mr Sutherland is not only dire, he insults our intelligence!
