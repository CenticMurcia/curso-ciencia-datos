I saw this film when it first came out and I loved it then and still do so I'm pleased to have finally bought it on DVD. Just watch it!!! I found it funny throughout and the end of the film where the villain (played beautifully) suffered at the unknowing hands of Dennis is a joy to watch. Just watch it!!!
