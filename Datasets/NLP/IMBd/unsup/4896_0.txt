Nebbish everyman Henry Winkler (shedding his Fonzie image) abandons Wall Street brokerage for the more quiet and subdued night shift at the city morgue, much to the aggravation of his weight worrying girlfriend. While there, Winkler meets a rambunctious, hyper active "idea man" played by a pre-Batman Michael Keaton in his first leading film role - also the one that made him famous to begin with. After a somewhat rocky start, Keaton talks Winkler into starting a call girl ring in their morgue, utilizing Winkler's Wall Street know-how to win over the fellow prostitutes of a prostitute he just happened to meet in the morgue, played by Shelley Long, whom he naturally falls for.<br /><br />Surprisingly good natured and engaging despite its seedy subject matter. Winkler and Keaton play well off each other, and Long is adorable as the hooker with a heart of gold.<br /><br />Director Ron Howard has a cameo as the "annoying sax player" on the subway.<br /><br />"I was my hands and feet of you!"
