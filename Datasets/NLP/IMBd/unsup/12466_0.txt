this movie has an unexpected ending, and for some if your not interested in cars it can be quite a bore. there are up and coming actors in this flick. two guys embark on a journey across the u.s. and find themselves in races all over the u.s. it is a loose love story, it shows how delicate and impermanent life is. this is a movie that has the REAL feel of drag racing and not this rinky dinky 2fast 2silly racing movie, there are classic muscle cars, that go fast. you'll just have to watch two lane black top, it is a must see, if at anything just for the sake of watching cars drag. i think that writing a few lines not ten is good enough to get an idea if you'd want to watch something.
