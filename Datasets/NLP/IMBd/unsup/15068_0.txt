The movie just came out on DVD, I read other comments and agree and disagree with some.<br /><br />This movie and especially on the BONUS part...the making of Un Dimanche a Kigali, JUST THIS PART IS WORTH IT, where the producers, directors and actors talk about the condition 10 years later after the genocide. To hear and see how professional the Rwandans were and helpful in producing and being extras of the movie was worth buying the DVD.<br /><br />There are hidden and internally scars that will never heal however my hope is that this movie will present a lesson to how the UN forces from France, Belgium, Italy, Canada and the US were inactive in their missions to police and stop the massacres. My anger was raised when the Canadian general Dallaire who saw all this could do nothing because of the political stance of the countries mentioned and how he wanted to do something but his hands were tied.<br /><br />Although the story was based on a fictionalized romantic story, and the rest of the characters and events were true, I congratulate ALL for this poignant VISUAL STORY TELLING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THERE. I have not read the novel, heard it was an international bestseller and certainly raised the question what in HEAVEN is wrong with people/governments who had the military potential, the tools and certainly the possibility to stop this tragedy. <br /><br />Unfortunately, other dissimulated wars are happening still in Africa such as in Darfur and no once cares...Will it take filmmakers with a conscience to raise awareness??? What are the news media doing in all this? Questions asked but that will be never answered.<br /><br />If you are one that cares...see this BEAUTIFUL movie...some end scenes are graphic but like one Montreal newspaper critic said...it will show you the bad and good side of humanity.<br /><br />FYI....according to the movie producers Rwandans are genteel, soft-spoken people....that is what is most surprising about this genocide.
