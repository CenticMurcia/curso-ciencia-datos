The late 1980's and early 1990s were the time live in. Especially if you had cable or big dish satellite and could pick up WWOR TV New Jersey 9 out of Secaucus. Howard Stern back then unleashed his adult brand of radio and TV humor that would be recognized later from E and Howard TV OnDemand.<br /><br />This version of The Howard Stern Show was on the level of Public Access. It had that cheap budget on the fly kinda feel with a bit more lean towards Party Time and Rock On all night long.<br /><br />The Howard Stern Show was sponsored by Snapple Ice Tea and this helped introduce it's pitch lady Wendy Kauffman "The Snapple Lady" to the rest of the world.<br /><br />Today ownership rights of the master 3/4 inch video tapes keep changing hands and there is no possibility what so ever of this show ever coming to DVD and Blu Ray Disc unless Alpha Blue or Anchorbay Entertainment gets hold of them.
