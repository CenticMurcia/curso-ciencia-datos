Further proof that Freddie Prinze has no right to put down 'Actor' on his resume. This movie has a half-decent cast that are unable to do anything with this awful script. Sometimes you can watch a comedy with a predictable story but still enjoy it because its funny. This one is predictable and incredibly unfunny. Prinze, of course is a write-off but Claire Forlani, Jason Biggs and Amanda Detmer are usually solid actors. Forlani looks embarrassed to be there, Biggs can't pull off the lovable loser he aced in the American Pie series and Detmer comes off whiny and pathetic.<br /><br />I don't know why Prinze gets any roles but he definitely deserved this one. If you see this movie in the video store, walk on by.
