If the world was facing a nuclear extinction, a civilization fallout. Would you care if Jake kissed Emily?<br /><br />Bad CG, bad acting and unbelievably cheesy lines.<br /><br />These are the only things that came into my mind after watching the first series...but don't get me wrong i loved the story and the whole concept of the post-nuclear atmosphere.<br /><br />In my opinion there's a very good reason for the show being canceled, they took a bulletproof and a very appealing back story and messed it up, nothing was good but i kept watching because i loved the fact i was watching a post nuclear based TV-show.<br /><br />They had their chance, they should have stayed canceled in order to get picked up by people that really care about the storytelling, the current ones are bringing nothing but some used up, horrifying soap opera plots and dialogs, which for me destroyed the feeling that i was watching something good, not some b-series that are turning every single aspect of a script into a argument which ends in a "I'm not talking to you until you ask Emily if she kissed Eric" ...leaves me pretty angry and unhappy, there are so many shows that deserved that re-airing.<br /><br />The show did nothing for me, maybe I'm the only one.<br /><br />3 stars for trying.
