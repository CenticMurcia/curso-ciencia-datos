In my opinion this movie is a basic sci-fi cult. The history of IKARIA is based on the novel "Magellan Cloud" of Stanislav Lem. The distance between the novel and the movie is similar to H.G. Wells "War of the Worlds" and Cruise-Spielberg movie or Lem's and Tarkovskij's "Solaris". According to reminiscence of Lem, this novel was not from his favorites. But at that time (1962) and I think nowadays also it is a remarkable novel and movie also. In interpretation of Soderbergh's and Clooney's Solaris they was finding the heaven or paradise to live there (and at the end Rheya and Kelvin have found it). Interpretation of Ikaria was full of agreements with "new" socialist ideas against capitalist ideas (dead casino in space, criticism of red nail polish, etc.) but in one time "between lines" there is the criticism of socialist reality during fifties and sixties (predestined madness and "no future" impasse: deadly illness from radioactive accident at the end of the Magellan Cloud novel). Mainly I agree with other comments. I hope sometime they will make and we will get the color DVD!
