Words like "vile" and "reprehensible" don't even begin to express my contempt for this movie. Russ Meyer is just a filmmaker with a quirky sense of humor and a fetish for big breasts, right? Well he's also got a mean misogynistic or maybe just plain misanthropic streak in him from what I can tell. Despite all the busty women this film is not the least bit sexy. It is, however, definitely obscene.<br /><br />In interviews Meyer has put down hardcore pornography but I've seen scores of porn flicks and not a ONE of them has anything in them as disgusting (and disturbing) as the brutal stomping and electrocution a young woman receives in this movie. Anyone who argues this is fantasy violence has some pretty sick fantasies. This was made during an "anything goes" era, the 1970's, but I have to wonder what the participants really thought of this twisted vision. It should be avoided at all costs by anyone with a sense of humanity.
