Duvall is a hitman who's hired to fly to Argentina and kill a former general who presumably was responsible for tortures and executions of innocent people during the troubles of the 1970's and 1980's. He's professional, speaks some Spanish, but moreover has a fascination with Tango and other ballroom dance.<br /><br />Duvall has shown he can run a one man show before, with The Apostle, and while this film is entirely different, it's every bit as good. It has quite a respectful display of Argentine Tango, and it manages to be a suspenseful thriller at the same time. I've never met any assassins or their co-conspirators, but the everyday characters in the film are perfectly realistic. If you appreciated the banter between characters and intense yet subdued violence from Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, you'll like this movie.<br /><br />Duvall is the brilliant veteran assassin who's not altogether pleasant all the time (this isn't the sweet nice guy Marky Mark assassin from The Big Hit), but you still wish him well. Blades and Mechoso are the idealistic co-conspirators who seem to be a bit too eager. Miller is his stepdaughter, the apple of his eye for whom he always shows his nice side, and Pedraza is the Tango student/teacher who seduces Duvall's character by her very nature in more ways than one.<br /><br />It's not a hot steamy thriller with over-the-top action sequences and acrobatic heroes like Assassins, nor a romantic comedy like Grosse Pointe Blank, just a movie that shows a man's dance with life and death and his fellow human beings in a very enjoyable way.
