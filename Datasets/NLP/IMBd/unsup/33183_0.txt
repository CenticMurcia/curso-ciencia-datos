I'm a huge fan of z-grade horror flicks. I can definitely appreciate some pretty low budget trash. Ghost Lake, Aquanoids, Evil Cult, The Day The Darkened Arise--that's some quality bad cinema. Dark Fields falls into the category of sub-bad cinema. This movie is so bad (and in a totally unwatchable way) that I won't let any of my horror trash loving friends borrow it. Terrible story, acting, no memorable lines. Just plain bad. Seems like there wasn't any effort put into any portion of the movie. <br /><br />The concert must be 500 miles away from how dark it gets during their pointless drive. Quite the major trip for them not to have bought tickets in advance or gotten their rides all figured out. Just one small example of the lack of thought put into the movie. It starts bad, and just gets worse from there on out.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this movie. Don't watch it thinking it could be so bad that it's fun to watch. It isn't. Stay back, back I say.
