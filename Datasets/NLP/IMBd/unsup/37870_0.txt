I can't believe anyone could rate this above a 5. Even sappy people will groan at this film. The characters all seem to be mentally retarded and have the emotional depth of 10 year olds. Really, this is a painfully bad movie that I would have walked out on except that I was too lazy to reach for the remote control which had fallen on the floor.<br /><br />Borderline soft-core porn is fine if you can actually believe it, but this movie was just a joke. The scene where Morgan Freeman wanders into the stadium to see two people getting it on actually made me laugh out loud, then I realized the only way to watch this film is to treat is as a joke, laugh and make Mystery Science Theatre 3000 style comments and you will have a good time.
