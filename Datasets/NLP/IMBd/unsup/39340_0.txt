What a piece of junk! I would really like to know how movies this bad are made. Dennis Quade is as bad as Mark Wahlberg in the Happening. <br /><br />The whole plot is a kid becomes a mass murderer because his dad didn't spend enough time with him. That's it! Nice home, school, neighborhood, but dad was working hard, not home, so he is so sad he just has to become a mass murderer. And convince others who are sad to murder also, because people were mean to them. <br /><br />Dennis Quade was horrible in The day after tomorrow, and he stinks this one up also. this could have been good, but they worked over time to ruin this one. There must be a great story behind the making of this bomb. I would love to know what it is.
