The premise is enjoyable, the effects are great, and the action is OK. Too bad they had to put a brigade of john-wayne-esque american heros in the film to ruin it. It was actually going along quite well until those loud-mouthed boneheads appeared. Problems with the general plot (of how, dragons that dissappeared because thier food was exhausted, managed to stay alive below London for millions of years - and come awake the instant a human touched them... and then only one male exists on the planet) can be distracting. Far worse, the M.M. character - not sure if its the screenplay or the acting that did that - though the screenplay should be blamed for putting them in there to begin with.<br /><br />Its a good enough to occupy a couple hours of time.
