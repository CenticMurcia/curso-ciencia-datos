This is an interesting romantic and funny movie from Hosimin, and it fulfilled my long waiting desires to watch it. And it should inspire all the directors of his genre. The scenes have been mostly shot at outdoor spots like bangalore, pollachi, chigmagalore and chennai, and this entertains us as if we are experiencing ourselves a real tour. Again and again seeing daily studio scenes made the eyes wounded and fed up the mind. And thats why it's a nice pick up at nice time.<br /><br />Although the storyline is not that new with the old movies as a boy meets girl and slowly fall in love but the way Hosimin presented each and every scenes are worth to watch. From the beginning to the end I personally enjoyed the whole movie, and happy to spend some amount of bucks on it. After Kaadhal this is second time in which barath has proved that he has all the required potentialities to become a genius actor one day. But I was damn irritated by renuka menon's irritating and annoying much chatty and talkative role. But still then, beside this the whole story became a sweet and funny love story. For Barath's lovers and fans, you must have got something relaxed after watching this unique love story (just like ME!!!). I love the Barath cartoon so much!
