This movie seemed promising with a decorated actor like Kal Penn starring in it, but unfortunately that ended up being the only attraction to this movie.<br /><br />This movie is the most hypocritical movie I have ever seen. This movie has it all backwards, the South Asians who are born and raised in America are the ones who are being ostracized by the (what are referred to in this movie as) "FOBS". The American born South Asians are the one's who are constantly bending over backwards trying to please the "FOBS" because of their constant criticism of us being too "American". We are constantly struggling to find a balance in our lives and we are the one's being treated like outcasts because the "FOBS" are the ones who are so critical and stuck up with their own set of standards that they expect from us. The person who made this movie should try actually making something accurate and portray the struggles that South Asians living in America have to deal with. There is a reason why everyone has heard of Bend it Like Beckham, and that hardly anyone has heard of this movie unless you happen to be browsing around your local video rental store.
