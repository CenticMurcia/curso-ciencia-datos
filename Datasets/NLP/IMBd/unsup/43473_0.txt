Forget Plan 9 and all the other Ed Wood classics, this effort must really take the biscuit as the worst film of all time! To call it tedious, is to pay it a compliment. How on earth actors with the talent of Lugosi and Zucco managed to get involved in this mess is anyone's guess. From the opening credits to the finale, it is one long experience in total & utter unease. There is nothing that can be said in this film's favour and Nat Pendleton's performance must be the most irritating & unfunny in the history of the cinema. The whole thing is just too ridiculous for words, and neither chills, thrills or raises a laugh. In fact, it's very difficult to fathom out exactly what its purpose is - it's certainly not entertaining. Avoid this dross at all costs!
