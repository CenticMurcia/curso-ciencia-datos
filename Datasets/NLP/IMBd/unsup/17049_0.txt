This one was a lot better than it had any right to be, given the fairly lurid storyline. I give the producers credit for delivering a credible and compelling story, as well as a believable performance from Danielle DeLuca. Not sure if this will qualify as a spoiler, but not going to take any chances: Story takes a little while to get going, but once the hunt is on, things really take off. Yes, Ms DeLuca is naked for a good part of the second half but, unless you're a twelve year old boy, you become engrossed enough in her predicament that you aren't focusing on that fact. While I appreciated the choice of the camera not lingering on her naked body, I did find it somewhat annoying that it did linger on other unnecessary shots. Sunsets, a car backing out of a driveway and several shots of trophies mounted on the wall. Seemed to be trying to make a point continuously that was gotten the first time around, but it's a small quibble. What points they may have lost from me were gained back by the unexpected ending. Not earth-shaking, but not something I saw coming, either. Bravo.<br /><br />While this obviously isn't going to win any awards, it's a more than passable way to spend an hour and a half. An hour and a half, to paraphrase so many "original" reviewers on this site, that I happily don't want to give back!
