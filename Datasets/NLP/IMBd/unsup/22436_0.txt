Personally, I have a weakness for cheap and trashy Jaws rip-offs and I'm on a mission to track them ALL down one day! So, I was destined to like this little movie no matter what, but even from a more objective viewpoint I can't possibly bring myself to say that this is a bad film. The story is a clean copy of Steven Spielberg's classic (not even bothering to alter the species of the shark) but the makers never make a secret out of that and even openly refer to it. Not good enough for Universal Studios apparently, as they started (and won) a lawsuit in order to ban "The Last Shark". The story is structured exactly the same as "Jaws", with the first half revolving on the introduction of a tourist beach communion where local politicians rather risk peoples' lives than cancel the popular annual surf contest. During the second half, a bunch of brave (but very stupid) people try to destroy the shark themselves. There's quite a lot of suspense and the underwater camera-work is surprisingly nifty. The shark itself is an engaging creation, even though it's over-the-top gigantic and a little too robotic-looking when it pops out of the water. I was also expecting more gore and nudity but director Enzo G. Castellari obviously opted to make his film a serious-minded and ambitious horror adventure (unlike the Mexian "Tiger Shark" by Rene Cordoba). The music is excellent and the acting performances are far above average. Maybe the owners of the official Jaws rights were a bit jealous, as this should have been an official sequel to the 1975 classic. It unquestionably is better than Jaws 3-D and the god-awful Jaws 4: The Revenge. Recommended!
