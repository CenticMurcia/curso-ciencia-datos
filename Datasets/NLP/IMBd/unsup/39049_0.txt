WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS <br /><br />The author couldn't decide what she wanted to tell her audience.<br /><br />All the main characters in this film are, quite frankly, insane.<br /><br />Mona, whose real name is Lisa, lives with her brother, Phil, above a pub called The Swan.<br /><br />Much to Mona's disappointment, Phil has recently become a religious nut,and turned The Swan into a place for prayer meetings. What they're living on since The Swan is no longer a pub, I never figured out, but with this delusional mess, it doesn't much matter.<br /><br />Mona, meanwhile has been messing around with a married man, who is a real jerk. Not only is he cheating on his wife, but he has sex with Mona and THEN tells her their affair is over.<br /><br />Mona next meets the young, attractive Tamsin, a girl who has been temporarily suspended from boarding school, so is home for the summer, and living nearby.<br /><br />The two develop a friendship and then a romance. Tamsin, however, is ever bit as unstable as Mona, and the two indulge in breaking out a car window, harassing Mona's ex-boyfriend's wife, conducting a semi-s√©ance session, and eventually Tamsin even leads Phil into nearly succumbing to her seductiveness.<br /><br />Phil, meanwhile, is running around like a nut-case, building a huge wooden cross and trying to force his newfound religious beliefs down his sister's unwilling throat, what time he isn't kicking her, shoving her lover Tamsin, or locking Mona up in her room. Yeah, this guy is really filled to the brim with the "gentle love" of Jesus! <br /><br />Finally, when Mona tries to hang herself, Phil loses his religion, and Mona packs her suitcase and trots over to Tamsin's house. There she finds Tamsin packing her own suitcase and calmly announcing she's returning to school. <br /><br />Disheartened Mona then encounters Tamsin's sister, Sadie, whom she and us, had been led to believe died due to anorexia. So what the heck was THAT ABOUT? And where was Sadie all that time? No explanation is really given.<br /><br />After a near murder attempt, the film concludes with no real ending. <br /><br />I gave this convoluted, nearly plot less film, with its nutty characters a 4 and that was being darn generous.
