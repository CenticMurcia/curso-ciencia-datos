DARNA MANA HAI is the most refreshing movie of the year 2003.....and those who put it out as a crap are just a bunch of fools who have no idea of movie making.nor do they know the pulse of all the viewers. .<br /><br />The only disappointment with this movie is that it has been advertised as horror...but is not much of it...its actually a fantasy thriller.<br /><br />the movie is full of creative zests....something that few foul reviewers cant identify with....the BACKGROUND SOUNDTRACK and Camera-work are worth special mention.Though the film has many newcomers, they have delivered their parts very well, and the acting on the whole is quite good. also, the direction is slick and technically brilliant,although the screenplay needed some corrections. few of the stories were simply amusing and not scary at all....but they should be appreciated for their strange themes. Overall, a very good movie if you care for some really imaginative work. this one {supposed to be inspired from twilight zone, creep show...etc...} is much better than its Hollywood counterparts and cannot be ignored as a spin off..its nothing like it. A Truly GREAT AND CREATIVE MOVIE....WORTH WATCHING MANY TIMES.<br /><br />P.S:--those who complain about the weird stories should be reminded that this is not a typical bollywood fare and is meant for those who like this subject, ONLY...the others can watch their own crap and need not post their stupid and idiotic comments.!!!
