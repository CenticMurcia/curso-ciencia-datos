I watched this film on the belief that is was notoriously gory, what a mistake I made. I can't begin to describe how mediocre the film is, it has so many wretched traits. It starts off OK with the first killing of a couple, albeit a cheaply staged one. Then we are introduced to the two cops on the case, a portly, inept and tactless duo who couldn't catch the killer if he/she was trapped in a phone box. They start the investigation at the drive-in where the owner is a foul-mouthed and acerbic character, and also interview a janitor there named Germy, a dozy but amusing simpleton who is possibly the only slightly redeeming character involved. Needless to say there is a lot of appalling acting, some of the worst I have seen, most of the cast seem to have their minds elsewhere throughout the entire film. But just when you think it can't get any worse it does, with an utterly ridiculous and infuriating ending. Avoid this film like the plague. The video cover is good, though.
