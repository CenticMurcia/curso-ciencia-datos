I was lucky enough to see this with my dad (cool guy) when I was a kid at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. At the time the only animated movies that you would get to see were Disney type stuff so this totally blew my mind. The soundtrack was and is so cool, you never heard heavy metal music in movies or on the radio for that matter(well OK maybe on after midnight on Sunday if you got the tinfoil just right.) so needless to say it was an experience I'll never forget. If you have not seen it yet then by all means rent it..............My comments are not the minimum length for comments of ten lines of text so I will add some more. Movie goers maybe a little more jaded now (Me included) but this movie still holds up. The b-17 segment still is as exciting and creepy as it was when I first saw it. And who wouldn't want one of those flying bird things to ride around on.
