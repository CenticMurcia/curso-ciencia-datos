I don't mind low budget movies - "Saw" started out with a small budget & worked very well. Even the "Blair Witch Project" had some redeeming moments. Unfortunately, this one didn't.<br /><br />From the very beginning, I couldn't understand what the plot in this movie was supposed to be about.<br /><br />I understood that the lead character was undergoing some serious issues in his life, which affected those around him, but there seemed to be too many obscure incidents being introduced that had little or no relevance to what was going on in the movie.<br /><br />In the end, I decided to log on here to see if anyone else had the "answer" to what the heck was supposed to be happening - unfortunately not.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't invest my time on this wasted effort. It's not the money I was concerned about losing, it's the time I'll never get back again :-(
