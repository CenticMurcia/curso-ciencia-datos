Dumb and Dumber is the funniest movie ever for the following reasons: two pals lose their jobs, but Lloyd (Jim Carrey) finds a briefcase that belongs to a wealthy woman (Lauren Holly) that lives in Aspen,Colorado and he and his best friend Harry (Jeff Daniels)must travel cross-country to return it to her. Along the way they encounter kidnappers, a state trooper, and many more hilarious moments from this comedy that you must see for yourself. I first saw this on TBS when they aired it last year and I laughed harder than ever. I loved it when Lloyd says "Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world? "aaaaaaaaaaaaaagh. One of the funniest quotes from the movie. If you don't like obnoxious and dumb humor, then this isn't the movie for you. But, if you love dumb humor, are a big fan of slapstick comedies, want to laugh your butt off, or if you just like Jim Carrey's movies, then this is for you. My rating for Dumb and Dumber:10/10!
