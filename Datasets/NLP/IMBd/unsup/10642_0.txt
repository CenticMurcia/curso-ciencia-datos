I love this film. I love the soundtrack written by Tom Waits and sung with Crystal Gayle. Their voices blend beautifully; one would never have guessed. This is incredibly stylized; the basic and simple plot is almost irrelevant; the imagery, the direction, the sets and the performances are all enchanting. If the DVD would only come out I would order in a nanosecond. Find a copy to rent, duplicate it and save it for your next first date with someone. A little promotion of a new DVD, theatrical re-release, and FFC/Zoetrope would probably make all their money back. I wonder what it would take to make this happen.
