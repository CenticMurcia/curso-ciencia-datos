Strictly, I don't go for really cheesy films, but this one's so offbeat that it makes my list of all-time favourite films. Every time I see it, I forget how funny and romantic it is, and how good I feel inside when they get together. Bit sad... stupid...? Yes, maybe, but I totally love this movie. Adam Sandler is fantastic - so sweet, but also hilariously (makes-you-feel) sympathetic when he gets mad at his ex-fiance in the song he shows Julia. The ending is just how all films should end. The soundtrack is irresistable, and Sandler's singing very good and truly gorgeous. Drew Barrymore is so sweet and beautiful, and still remains my favourite female actress. You have to see it to love it! (obviously)
