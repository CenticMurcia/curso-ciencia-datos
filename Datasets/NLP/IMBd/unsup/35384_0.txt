I would like to take this opportunity to say that this film is 100% RUBBSIH, NOT NOT WATCH IT UNLESS YOU LIFE DEPENDS IN IT!!<br /><br />This is without a doubt one of the worst films i have ever seen! I was absolutely speechless after watching it and quite frankly I am absolutely appalled at the good comments its bin given on this site! where they watching the same movie as me? First of all the movie was terribly written and acted badly. Lindsay lohan can barely act. why did they make her sing? 9 also why was everyone so shocked when she sang for the first time? she sounded like a freaking cat being strangled!) She hasn't been good in any movie since the parent trap (also why are people saying shes hot? SHE IS UGLY AND A CHAV!). I found myself wondering what on earth this whole story was all about and i never got to the end because it was making me severely depressed and i couldn't stand another twenty minutes of this rubbish - it would have made me suicidal! It seems to me that the director just wanted to make a teen movie and couldn't really be bothered to get a story or a proper script. Lots of people have said that it was great for the target age, what was that exactly? I am thirteen and didn't like it!<br /><br />In conclusion if you were to rent or buy this movie it would be a complete waste of your time, energy and money.
