I went to high school with Ed Amos. I worked at the same General Motors plant as Ed. I knew all three wives. This movie only scrapes the surface of the lives of the people involved. As was said before in another comment: no body in Anderson was interviewed, Ed did not run for Mayor, he had filed in the primary and then Saundra was found dead and he withdrew. Why did the movie leave out his college love interest died falling from a balcony, his parents house mysteriously burnt to the ground after being for sale after he inherited it. His sister's husband had a mysterious stroke while jogging and Ed studied Pharmacy in College. I wish someone would really investigate all the things surrounding Ed and then write a book. What a mystery!!!!!!!!!
