Okay - the film is not some earth shattering piece of cinema, but I'm sure that was not the intention of the director. She has made a very gentle love story come to life without huge trauma. As a big cinema fan, I know it's not on a par with other slick films, but again, this doesn't appear to be the director's intention. I think it was brave to make a film that didn't fall into making stereotypes of Asians or gays (although a queer man doing drag is old hat) and the choice of very attractive leading ladies doesn't hurt either. Regarding the accents, there were four that wobbled for me. That of Nina's and her mother's, Sanjay and his father's, but that doesn't make it a bad film. They've done a darn sight better than us mortals could have done. So more power to your elbow Ms Parmar.
