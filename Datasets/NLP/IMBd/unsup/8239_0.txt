Mice Hubie and Bertie, tired of eating cheese all day, wish to end it all by suicide via Claude Cat eating them. But Claude doesn't want to eat another mouse as long as he lives and the prospect wants him want to attempt suicide via a dog eating him. The dog is reasonable perplexed & a little bit scared in this very funny cartoon. The last of the six shorts that Hubie and Bertie starred in and probably for the best as where do you go after the insanity of this?? This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2.<br /><br />My Grade: B+
