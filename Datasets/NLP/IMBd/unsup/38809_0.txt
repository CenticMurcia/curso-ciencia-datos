Normally I do not run down writers or producers , but in this case I feel I must . Stephen King did not and I repeat not write "kingdom hospital" he simply bought the rights to it . I am not upset about this I am more annoyed that King's version of "Riget" has been nothing more than an expensive but poorly made copy of a masterpiece . The other problem I have is that Kings version lacks that certain dark humor that helped to make "riget" the masterpiece that it is.<br /><br />FYI I only give this 1 Star because the system wont let me give any less.<br /><br />Thank you Stephen King for fouling up !
