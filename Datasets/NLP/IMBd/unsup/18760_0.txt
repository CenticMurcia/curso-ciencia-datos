Three....Extremes has some pretty disturbing stuff in it for your viewing...pleasure. "Dumplings" is the nastiest, with a woman that seeks to regain her beauty by eating dumplings made with a special ingredient. Box, by Takashi Miike, is probably the weirdest (big surprise, eh?) and the offering from Korea is probably the least effective of the three but is still OK. Box is about a woman haunted by dreams of her younger sister who died when she was a child, in an accident that she seems to have caused, but is it just a dream? Of course if you watch "Dumplings" and you haven't got a strong resolve then you may not make it to the other two films. Overall this is a pretty sick & disturbing trio of films and it will stick with you long afterward. Recommended for fans of Asian Cinema but bring a strong stomach & sense of adventure. 8 out of 10.
