I bought this film in a small shop not knowing anything about previously about it. However it's reasonable price, cover and back cover overview on the story seemed decent to say the least, How i was wrong. The films starts of with a real stereotypical low rate vampire flick, with a bar, one guy to seems to have a idea of whats going on, and a damsel in distress, what more do you need? However this movie went from poor too terrible, bad to worse, was just awful, everything about the movie made me think to myself is this for real, several times i paused the movie to check on IMDb that this movie was in fact a horror. The movie is just summed up when the i become aware that Satan was in fact just a man, with pure white long hair, which is a key stereotype for a angel, so just from that aspect any one can tell this film was so bad that i demanded a refund, i stronger recommend no one buys this movie and watches it for that matter.
