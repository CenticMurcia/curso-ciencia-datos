This film is best enjoyed by fast-forwarding to the sex scenes. If you are expecting good acting, this isn't the movie for you. The acting is atrocious and unbelievable, with the exception in the movie being the mother who must have been fooled into thinking this was an actual serious movie. The rest of the cast is absolutely terrible, unless you are regarding this as a porn movie. For a porn, it's excellent. But as a serious movie for porn stars turned good, it's garbage. If you watch the added features interviews with the characters, it is hard to imagine it is even the same movie they are discussing when you watch it. To reiterate the point made earlier, fast-forward to the sex or don't watch this one.
