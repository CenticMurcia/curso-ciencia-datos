You probably wouldn't go if you didn't already like Vin Diesel's style and deep voice. This one you can skip, though. The first half of the movie plays out OK-- nothing special, but an OK action film. As the movie progresses, though, you realize that all the interesting action scenes were already contained in the preview. The longer it goes, the damsel in distress character gets old and flat (and wasn't great to start with). Then in the final half the plot goes to hell, interweaving a bizarre pseudo-religion without any prior explanation or interesting foreshadowing, with the film turning truly incomprehensible. It felt like a movie trying to be based on a much more complex book, but with the book non-existent in this case. I was reminded of the last 20 minutes of the strange Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, but without any cool special effects. Strongly avoid, even if you generally like Vin Diesel or B-grade action flicks.
