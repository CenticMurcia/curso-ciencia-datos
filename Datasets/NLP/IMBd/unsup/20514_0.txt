A Action/Comedy/Crime/Thriller about a cop Washburn(Jimmy Fallon,Anything Else) who gets his license taken away so when he gets the call that there is a bank robbery.He jumps in a cab but not just any cab Belle's(Queen Latifa,Chicago)cab.So now he is in for a big surprise.<br /><br />Jimmy Fallon was funny in this movie he was the only good part of this entire movie.Then you have Queen Latifa who did a horrible job with her acting and her comedy and her boyfriend in this movie is way out of her league.The screenplay was stupid funny at times but mostly stupid.The directing was a joke it didn't even reach the medium it looked like somebody was filming it with 2 cameras and a camera stand so BORING!!.The acting was pretty bad especially the stupid models i mean they tried to make people want to come to see a couple hot model bank Robers but it ended up just insulting my intelligence.<br /><br />Best actor/actress-Jimmy Fallon<br /><br />I cant believe somebody would even think about making this movie-Jake Hyden <br /><br />I gave this movie a 3 out of 10 <br /><br />Rated-(PG-13) for language, sensuality and brief violence <br /><br />3/10
