This is not good. It's some sort of generic, B-movie, noir epic ...with all of those ideas in conflict. Twenty "developments" get teased out, to no discernible entertainment value. It's a very, very long movie trying hard to believe it has peaks and structure, but the meaninglessness begins piling up quite early. The actors drift, because Mankewicz isn't doing anything to shape the movie. It ain't deep, so why is it the length of an opera? I'll give you twenty minutes to detect the big twist. You'll still be ahead of the characters by 80 or 90 minutes. The script is overdeveloped, and can't bear inspection for its two hour length. The cast of characters is rather extended. It's just a mess, going through the noir motions, and a uniform texture of tedium. It's uninvolving in the extreme. <br /><br />Hodiak has leading man looks but very little presence. He's exactly the same from scene to scene; inexpressive, diffuse. He's like a prop that can talk.<br /><br />Eddie Muller seems silently aware of the problems, and doesn't even bother with any framing remarks in his glib, unhelpful commentary. He just starts describing things on the screen. If Eddie Muller can't help you find the merit in a noir, you're in for a long ride. I can't think of a single reason you should watch this. This and 'The Big Knife' are the two most tedious movies I've seen in the last ten years. Not recommended.
