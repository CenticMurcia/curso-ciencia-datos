This could have titled "Issac Newton" because the story bears about as much of a resemblance to his life as it does that of Wyatt Earp's. Some filmmakers will never learn that the truth or a semblance of it can be just as interesting as their imagination. This movie is a historically inacurate tale purporting to be about Earp and is actually nothing more than a plotless, western soap opera with some shootings. I gave it a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1 simply because the visual effects and cinematography are good.
