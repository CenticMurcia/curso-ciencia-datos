The above comment from none other than "America's Anchorman" himself pretty much points out the folly of Deal of the Century. William Friedken has given us some winners before, but this film is not one of them. The story deals with Chevy Chase, Gregory Hines, and Sigorney Weaver scheming to sell a dangerously unreliable aircraft to a third-world nation after it fails miserably in a demonstration for the US military. Comedic moments happen here and there, but ultimately, this film is just a left-wing "message film" that actually discredits itself in two key scenes.<br /><br />The movie seems to be attacking on two fronts with its message. First off, it points a finger at the industrialized nations of the world who are selling large quantities of arms to underdeveloped nations. The logic being, if these weapons were never sold, these nations would be less apt to go to war. It might be a good idea to remind anyone who agrees that throughout human history, war has always been the constant. Regardless of what weapons are used, people are always fighting about something.<br /><br />Deal of the Century also wishes to indict the US military build-up of the Ronald Regan administration. For what? Keeping the country safe from Soviet expansionism? Regan's policy worked, and war never broke out between the two superpowers.<br /><br />There are two scenes that demonstrate the folly of the thinking behind this film. Early on, Chevy Chase is mugged by a man with a tiny handgun. Little does the man know that Chase is actually carrying a huge machine gun in a box which he takes out and points at the mugger. Obviously, having the superior weapon thwarted the mugging, and possibly saved Chase's life! In a later scene, Gregory Hines is accosted by a maniac with a knife and tire iron at his disposal. The man begins destroying Hines's car after they collide in a mere fender bender. Hines pulls a flame thrower out of his trunk and torches the maniac's car and chases him and his bimbo girlfriend off! Once again, the man with the superior weapon won the dispute! The only thing this film proves is that the person/country with the most guns will have the biggest advantage. Without the proper means to defend one's self, a person/country is completely vulnerable! 4 of 10 stars.<br /><br />Watch to Live and Die in L.A. instead!
