I Can't believe this movie got the reviews that it did! I thought this film was completely unoriginal, and left nothing to the imagination. It was one of those types of movies that is completely predictable, and actually manages to be somewhat insulting to those of us that don't pride ourselves on our religious beliefs. Thats right, I said it. The second I walked out of the theater, I felt like I had just been in church for the last hour-and-a-half. The ultimate flaw this film suffers, in my opinion, is that it is completely reflective of the evangelistic Christian mindset. "All rich people are evil." "The only honest way to earn a living is manual labor." Imagine my surprise when I saw a poster for this movie hanging on the window of a Christian bookstore. Bottom line is this: the only way you might find this movie entertaining is if you fit into on of three categories. Either A) A Christian; B) an overly sensitive woman looking for a cheep tear-jerker; or C) just generally lack the ability of free thought. There was nothing about this film that I would recommend to the average person who doesn't fit into one of those categories.
