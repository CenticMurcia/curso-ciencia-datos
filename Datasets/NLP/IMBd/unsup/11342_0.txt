OK, firstly if your not a fan of RPG's or Dungeons & Dragons the Game, you probably should stay away from this film. As a film its fairly average , with undistinguished, but not awful acting, low budget effects, and basic plot outline. That all said as a fantasy film its got all the requirements you want, villains, monsters, a party of heroes, Inter-party conflict, and high magic. I really enjoyed this film, it contained many classic elements from the D&D game: From a Vorpal sword, walls of fire, fiendish traps, strange monsters, and classic character classes. <br /><br />It was far more the film that the first outing should have been, which was truly awful. it is a shame it didn't have a larger budget. That said it sits high up in the ranks of Fantasy Movies.
