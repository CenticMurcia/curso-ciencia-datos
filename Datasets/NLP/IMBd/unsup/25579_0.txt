So far, with Norm McDonald movies you really cannot go wrong. There is of course the suspension of disbelief, but the laughs carry the movie beyond this. Screwed also has work by other good actors/actresses (like Danny Devito), who plays an auspiciously named mortician whom never ceases to find (and use) discusting things out of the bowls of his corpses. While the performance is a little discusting, the overall character is really funny. Through Grover Clever, the filmmakers manage to work in clipping of "Voyage into Space", "Glen or Glenda", and the very important "Hawaii Five-O". Now who can really argue with a movie that manages to work in Ed Wood without totally Screwing itself and while still being good?<br /><br />Unfortunately, there was a lack of publicity for this movie and the trailers don't look all that great. BUT--> I do Hope you take a voyage and enjoy "Screwed". Any Norm or Ed Wood fan would enjoy it.
