Claude Lelouch was at the top of his career when he conceived this immensely satisfying thriller. Not having seen it, we caught with it recently thanks to finding it in DVD format. The only bad aspect of the disc we watched was the poor sound track it had, we had to keep pumping up the volume during the dialogs and lowering it whenever the musical number of the film-within-the-film was shown. As with most of his movies, Mr. Lelouch relied on Francis Lai to create the score. The most amusing scene happens when Simon is being interrogated by the police and the inspector tells Simon about a "man and a woman" and Simon, without missing a beat begins to sing the music from the real "A Man and a Woman", a film by Mr. Lelouch, where the same actor, Jean-Louis Trintignant appeared.<br /><br />The film will probably confuse some viewers because there is no clear indication that after Simon meets Jeanine and goes to see Martine at the park and his subsequent escape to either Spain, Switzerland, or Genoa, the narrative will go back to tell the real story in flashbacks. Other than that minor incident, "Le Voyou" is a perfect movie about a caper and the people that planned it.<br /><br />Jean-Louis Trintignant was also at one of his best moments in the French cinema. He is a joy to watch as the slick Simon, who is always a step ahead of everyone else. Danielle Delorme, Christine Lelouch, Charles Gerard, Yves Robert and Charles Denner, do excellent work for the director.<br /><br />Another interesting fact is that Claude Lelouch did the interesting cinematography in the film. His camera angles, especially when the inspector is interrogating the Galloises after their son has been kidnapped, he shows the couple on both sides of the police, of whom we only see the back of his head. The chase scenes are cleverly done, showing cars speeding through the Parisian streets.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended film for fans of the genre and Mr. Lelouch.
