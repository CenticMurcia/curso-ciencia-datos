What a stultifyingly dull and inept portrayal of Britain! This movie was obviously written by an American who doesn't understand our country, and has probably never even been here (at least not for any length of time).<br /><br />There were so many inaccuracies, not least the total misrepresentation of our political system, and the hopelessly outmoded portrayal of our "class culture".<br /><br />This is an England that does not exist, and has never existed!<br /><br />Worse still was the plot, which presented a nauseatingly sentimentalised picture of family life, not to mention a hopelessly unrealistic adolescent relationship.<br /><br />If you want a good British movie, you'd be much better off with "The Ghost of Greville Lodge", or "One Against the Wind".
