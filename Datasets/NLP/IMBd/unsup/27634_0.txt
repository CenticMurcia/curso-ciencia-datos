If you liked the Tasmanian Devil in the Bugs Bunny cartoons, then good news, he has his own show. I always got up in the morning to watch this show on Saturday mornings. I liked the theme tune and the interesting things that happened. Taz has a family now, a Mum, a Dad, a younger sister and a little brother. Taz works in Hotel Tasmania (some episodes) as the cleaner, run by Bushwacker Bob and his Mom, and his work buddies Constance the female Koala bear and Mr Thickley the kangaroo. There were some other good characters throughout the show as well. These include: the Platopus brothers, Digeree Dingo, Francis the Bushlad, Bull and Axel the hunters, Buddy Boar, Willy Wombat and many more. The kids will like it. Very good!
