This is honestly the worst film I've ever seen. Saw it at the recent London Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and boy does it stink. I should have known just how much it would suck by the casting of Jim Verraros as one of the leads. A loser in the first season of American Idol (America couldn't kick his signing butt off the show quick enough), a horrible actor on screen. Eating Out suffers from all the cliches which befall 95% of gay-themed films. The script is over-written, the acting over-hammy. I'm sure it was funny on page. But no one actually talks like they do in this movie. The only redeeming quality here are the two penises on show. And even those are limp.
