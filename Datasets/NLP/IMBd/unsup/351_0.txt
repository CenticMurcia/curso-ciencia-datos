Deadwood is the finest Television program of all time in my opinion. This is high praise, considering West Wing, Hill Street Blues, and LAPD Blue. Everything about this series is top notch. The sets, the lighting, the lack of music to lead your emotions with only timely exceptions. The acting is outstanding across the board. But it is the writing that puts it in the stratosphere. David Milch combines the profane with an Elizabethan, Shakespearian, dialog that defies description. It is almost otherworldly in its beauty and deep meaning. Nowhere, in TV or movies, have I found writing and characters this good. It was truly a pleasure to see where each new episode was going.<br /><br />I was deeply saddened when this show was canceled, as it seemed there should have been one or two more years left to finish the story of Deadwood and these remarkable characters. We may never see this rich a collection of both characters and actors again.<br /><br />Well done everyone involved.
