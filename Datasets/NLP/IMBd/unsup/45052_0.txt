***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** For some reason I decided to pick up this film to rent and have totally and completely regretted it ever since!!!<br /><br />This has got to be one of the most absolutely stupidest flicks of all time.<br /><br />*** Possible Spoilers Ahead ***<br /><br />First of all, a group of people play roleplaying games (I didn't realize that people who are in their 30's played roleplaying games, but I guess they are trying to act like teenagers for the film), then one of the losers kills themselves because they are in love with one of the other losers (ooh, very dramatic). Some of the roleplaying people start receiving roses from an unknown person. Finally a knight shows up on a horse, killing them.<br /><br />This film just doesn't have any good parts to it at all.<br /><br />The "actors" are all so stiff and fail to portray any character reality at all, so you don't really feel for them or care about the story at all.<br /><br />The direction of the film keeps changing and you're left wondering "what was this film even supposed to be about?"<br /><br />Whoever wrote this piece of crap needs to try a LOT harder if you want to entertain people.
