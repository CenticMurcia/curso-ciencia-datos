I actually saw this movie on TV a couple of weeks ago and I sort of enjoyed it.<br /><br />This movie shows how powerful sex and attraction can be. It is so powerful that can lead even sisters to betray one another. To me this is quite accurate since our whole entire culture is filled with sex in advertisements, television, and movies. "Easy" somewhat represents how, much like the idea of sex rules in our society today (most of the time, without consequence), sex overpowered Jaime's life and everywhere she went she deceived by sex. <br /><br />The sex scenes were VERY realistic and I even considered that perhaps I had turned the channel by accident. But despite how realistic they were, I don't think all the situations were realistic at all. Somehow Laura's sex crazed husband gets another woman pregnant(whats with the hat!) while at the same time, Mick gets his lesbian ex-girlfriend pregnant. Then Laura ends up sleeping with Jaime's(HER SISTER'S) past/present love interest, John, and so on and so on. Its kind of like a sleazy talk show. I thought the ending was a little strange too. It was your traditional happy ending that seemed somewhat out of place. This didn't seem like the type of movie that should have been full of "happily-ever-afters" and friends and family forgiving and rejoicing. I doubt that would have happened in the real world. It sure wouldn't have happened in my house! So it was a relatively good movie only because of the lessons she learned alone the way, but frankly, with this nauseating emotional carousel full of let downs and betrayals, I think Jaime should have sworn off sex forever.
