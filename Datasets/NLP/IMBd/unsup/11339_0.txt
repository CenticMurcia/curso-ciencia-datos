This was on the whole, an enjoyable fantasy movie. Players of the Dungeons & Dragons game will be pleased to find references to material from the game. Those unfamiliar with the game will still enjoy it as an action-oriented fantasy movie. <br /><br />The drawbacks of this movie include a script that sometimes gets bogged down in melodrama, especially with the main villain's long-winded monologues about his evil plans (particularly at the beginning of the film). Other elements are campy, but done with enough tongue-in-cheek attitude to give me a chuckle or two. The movie also suffers from some minor sub-par theatrical production values. Since it was a direct-to-video/TV movie, these faults are largely forgivable. The most glaring examples are that some make-up work looks drawn in with marking pen and some monsters clearly look CGI. Special effects are about the same quality as the Hercules and Xena TV series, so I was still able to enjoy the movie despite these flaws.<br /><br />Even with all of the above against it, the movie is still several times better from the theatrical Dungeons & Dragons movie that came before it. The producers wisely dumped all of the characters and plot except the bad guy's assistant, Profion, from the first movie; changed the setting; and conformed the fantasy world to be more in line with the latest version of the Dungeon & Dragons game. Those changes make for a movie that is light years ahead of the predecessor and much more enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The magic and monsters (especially the dragons) are fun to watch. The "rogue" of the party (an expert in disarming traps, picking locks, and other sneaky stuff) is the most interesting of the bunch. On the whole, I highly recommend Wrath of the Dragon God for anybody looking for a fun and enjoyable "B" fantasy movie.
