I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even if you are in the mood for the worst of the worst B movies. The sound must have been recorded in a studio post production and rarely syncs with the film. But technicalities aside, it isn't the low budget that killed this movie. The acting is monotone for almost the entire production, even when a zombie is disemboweling some unfortunate victim and even then you can't even rely on the violence to carry this one.<br /><br />I laughed a couple of times at the complete disregard the living had for the other living suffering at the hands of the undead, but even that was too rare to warrant the drive to Blockbuster. Luckily I was able to trade this one in on the same night I rented it for a better option.
