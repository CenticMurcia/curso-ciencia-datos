Yeah, hard to sympathize with any 'mass-killers'---yet Mr. Stone strikes a true blow vs. the USA's continuing personality of same. When 'Mickey' explains 'We all have a Demon', best remember he is speaking as an American, not an Amsterdam 'hippy', Canadian, current German (they learned), rather as a member of a 'mass-societal-killer', political 'mob'---who simply reflects his heritage.<br /><br />Are 'Mickey and Mallory' as 'guilty' as our present, past Presidents, illegally slaughtering millions? Not by a long-shot---as guilty as our 'Big-Pharma'? Nope. Our 'cig-industry'? Nope. The potential mass-extinction, of humanity, via the Green-House? Nope. Small change, simply portraying 'victims' of a dangerous-laden criminal society---that is the core of this work. Bravo! Now some of you don't 'get-it'--2,000,000 wasted Phillipinoes, before and after they helped stop the Japanese invaders? 3,000,000 Indo-Chinese, after violating The Geneva Convention's lawful ruling--Nixon destabilizing Cambodia, leading to Pol Pot's 'killing-fields? The millions of Native Americans? Who knows how many Central, South American's murdered? Who of you knows, my father was a principal maker of the Nagasaki bomb, he told me, 'We saved those two Jap cities, as they were flat, no military significance, but 'the Brass', fearing Field Marshall Zhukov's troops would take all Europe, needed to both test the bomb-efficacy--and stop the Russkies. Sad, but true--Zhukov would have torn the other allies apart. That is why we waited for invasion, 'till Normandy--not to save Europe from Hitler, Russians did that, but to get men there to counter them--'the bomb' settled that deal---a nation of 'Natural Born Killers'---don't blame Mickey & Malloray--simply a product of a murderous history---did the Canadians need a Revolution? Nope--wake-up America, or else---that makes this movie great--just don't have a cop in your audience.
