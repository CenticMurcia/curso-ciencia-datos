This suspense movie was the directorial debut of Danny. He chose a good theme and a good team. The plot is very interesting and keeps you guessing till the end. The music by R D Burman is very melodious and haunting at times. Rajesh Khanna the Super Star plays a different role with great aplomb and performs excellently. It is a must see for people who like clean suspense movies. It is a must for Rajesh Khanna fans as he does a different role in a different style. Danny, Aruna Irani, Kim, Jagdeep put in good support. The movie is recommended for its plot and one who sees it should not tell anyone the suspense of the movie. Great movie of the Great SuperStar.
