Heartstopper: 4 out of 10: After twenty minutes this movie really had me psyched. A true Eighties throwback it begins with two characters, a Death row inmate who has trouble being electrocuted (Shocker) and a good looking suicidal shy girl who is called whore by a bunch of teenage cheerleader vixens (Carrie). They meet in an ambulance and the Death row guys tattoo transfers to the suicidal girl. And we all know what happens next don't we.<br /><br />The girl goes back to high school and takes revenge on the vixen sluts and her mother and everyone else and there is violence and nudity and sexy high school girls kicking ass. (Okay let me calm down for a moment) And had the movie actually done that I would have been happy. Instead it remakes Halloween 2. Yup an abandoned hospital, (The staff is about 5 people) and the serial killer comes back to life using his patented heart through the chest maneuver (hence the name) which looks silly the first time and gets progressively sillier as the movie goes along.<br /><br />In the Jamie Lee Curtis role we have Meredith Henderson who is surprisingly bland for a suicidal girl being chased by a serial killer. The killer is played not by title actor Robert Englund (Who is an Amish Sheriff and leaves the movie fairly early) but James Binkly whose serial killer won't shut up.<br /><br />In fact dialogue is a real problem in this film. Nobody talks like real people. All the conversation is either a witty rejoinder or a plot point or god forbid horrible self-conscious foreshadowing. Needless to say nobody has been crying out for a Halloween 2 (or Visiting Hours) remake.<br /><br />And while the sets are unconvincing and understaffed and the script and story derivative and pedestrian this is hardly the worst direct to video horror movie I've seen. Its biggest fault seems to be it does nothing I haven't seen done better dozens of times before.
