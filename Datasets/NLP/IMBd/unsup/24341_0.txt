Despite many criticizing the pre-Renaissance 1980's as the worst-ever decade for the animation industry, it produced memorable films like "NIMH 1", "An American Tail", "LBT 1" (all three produced by Don Bluth), "Oliver & Company" (Disney), and this, one of the first full-length cartoons ever to be based on a toy franchise.<br /><br />From the Canadian company Nelvana comes the first installment in a trilogy of big-screen movies centering on the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins follows the adventures of Kim and Jason, two small children who feel that people don't care for them enough. At the start of the movie, they are starting to be befriended by the Bears when Friend and Secret Bear come by them on the city streets.<br /><br />This mild-mannered masterpiece (if not a real classic in the wake of "Rock & Rule", also produced by Nelvana, as well as the Disney films of the early 90's) is so sweet, you'll think the whole world needs more films than this and not slice-fests like Q & U's "Kill Bill".<br /><br />ALSO RECOMMENDED: Nelvana's Care Bears show (all of season 1 and a few in season 2), the next two Care Bears films, and "My Little Pony: The Movie".<br /><br />9/10
