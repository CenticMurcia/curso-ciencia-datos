I wanted to see this movie because I love music and movies about music. I also wanted to see it because of the star filled cast. There were a lot of problems I had with this movie, though. First off, it was just plain and endlessly boring. The story revolves around a lot of different characters and their lives in the Nashville country music scene. I found all of these characters to be completely uninteresting and unlikable. I also found practically all of the music to be terrible. The only exception was "Hard Ridin Cowboy Man" which I liked, and for some unknown and confusing reason, that song is not even listed on the soundtrack. The rest of the movie just seemed to be a bunch of scenes scrapped together, with no plot or meaning. Maybe this is the kind of movie you need to watch more than once to appreciate, but I am not willing to give it another 3 hours of my time to find out.
