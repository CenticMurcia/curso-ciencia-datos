If you are as curious about this movie as I was I would highly recommend not wasting you're time, it kinda sucked. So instead of wasting you're time looking for it i'll save you 87 minutes by spoiling this movie completely. <br /><br />PART 1 A group of stupid bikers get ready to go into the the desert for a motocross competition, oh yeah one of them is blind. Bobby has a bunch of flashbacks and Ruby is now known as Rachel (she is now sibilized and pretty much normal other than THE FRIGGIN FLASHBACKS! <br /><br />PART 2 The kids make there way into the desert and there bus breaks down (duh duh duhhhhhhhhhhhhh) After realizing there pretty much f***ed they decide to look around. Thats when Ruby gets attacked by Pluto and kicks his a**. She then claims to the kids that she is the now legendary Ruby.Pluto takes off on one of the bikes. Two of the idiots go catch him, they catch him he surrenders. But one of the kids falls into one of the family's traps and is killed by the reaper (papa jupes big bro.). <br /><br />PART 3 3 more kids are killed and ruby hits her head on a rock (you never find out what happened to her) The blind chick and one other survivor burn the reaper to death.
