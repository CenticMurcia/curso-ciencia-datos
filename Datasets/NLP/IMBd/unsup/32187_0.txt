The shame in Delilah's portrayal in this movie is not so much in her being a good person as in her being a non-person! She might as well be Lassie or Rin Tin Tin for all the individuality and power to act independtly she has. She is simpleminded, seems to be able to function only in a relationship of dependency, as is illustrated when she turns down Miss Bea's offer of a 20% stake in a multi- million dollar business that was based on her pancake recipe because she wants to stay a housekeeper. A moment earlier on in the movie is particularly offensive when she is asked to hold a goggle eyed, smiling "darkie" pose to model the sign for the pancake business. While the moment was clearly for comic effect, her staying obliviously frozen in the pose long past what was needed is to me emblematic of the frozen stereotype that her character was, and it is not fair to say that her character was simply all the "Mammie" could be. Just look at the work of Hattie McDaniel or Ethel Waters to see that despite its limited range, the Mammie could be something other than a simpleminded "faithful soul." On an up note, despite all of this Louise Beavers does a good job in this very limited role, and I've always been a fan of Claudette Colbert. In addition, I know Fannie Hurst was genuinely trying to be sympathetic in her novel upon which this film was based, so I can see someone enjoying this, but please don't miss the reductive stereotyping.
