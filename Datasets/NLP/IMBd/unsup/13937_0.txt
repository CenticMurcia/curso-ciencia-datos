I believe this is the best war drama around concerning WWII naval action--and was the first major sea battle of WWII. The story is true as well as the fact that news of the battle was radio broadcast to some of the world at the time of action. Were any others possible as such--not likely--as the battles were usually far from land and news was slow in release. I see only a few faults other than those listed---officers and sailors out on deck watching 11 inch shells going over their heads--and they have no battle gear on? Out on open deck in battle? The Graf Spee (played by a US ship) has a radar dish spinning around on the upperworks. Radar did not exist in 1939 and if it had, the Graf Spee's ability to move about undetected would have been compromised to some extent (not in 1939). This great movie is a history lesson and must be seen. Well acted and produced thanks to the Brits!
