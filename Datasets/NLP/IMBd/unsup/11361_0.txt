I saw this film 17 years ago, and I must say that I found Johnny Yune's performance funny when I first viewed it...<br /><br />However, in retrospect, I consider this film to be an insult to the great Asian American community. There are so many Asian-ethnic stereotypes in this film that I am not too fond of the way Asians are being portrayed in western productions, such as this "B-grade" film. I have to admit that Johnny Yune is a talented comedian, who once had a thriving career in South Korea, but he comes-off almost as bad as Garrett Wang (the dysmal, one-dimensional Asian ensign on "Voyager"), because he is shown less as a human being, and more as a degenerate foreigner struggling in a thriving western world!<br /><br />If Johnny Yune's character is based on Bruce Lee, then shouldn't he at least have some of his confidence, machismo, and charisma? But no, this film, and its sequel fails to deliver in that department! Also, Johnny's character of Bruce has lived in the United States since childhood, having immersed himself in American culture for many years, yet he comes-off as a confused tourist who is in the states for the first time? Man, that is about as UNBELIEVABLE as Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) speaking in broken-English, after having lived in the United States (since his teens) for over 50-years!<br /><br />It's interesting that this film still has a following in Australia. I wonder what they think of all the contrived Asian stereotypes in this film? Even Jackie Chan films show Asians as 3-dimensional characters. With so much bologna here, you can open up your own deli.
