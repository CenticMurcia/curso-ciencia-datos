well personally.. i don't know why you people are so hating against this movie. I found nothing wrong with it. I enjoyed it. its a good old movie.. we are just so used to how movies are today.. with like comedy that makes us laugh cause its dirty and it how we talk with our friends or something .. this is good old fashioned comedy thats all. I liked how the movie had its twists and turns, and the fact that he keeps changing from human to animal like made it more affective because it shows the struggles people go through. It wouldn't be simple to change right into a human and do human things after you've been living in the woods with wolves for 28 years. Thats a long time. So whatever. I enjoyed this movie.
