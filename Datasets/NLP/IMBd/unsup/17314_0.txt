I tried to watch this and actually lost interest, except of course when "Leatherface" was sawing off the face of a hapless victim, in the fashion of Ed Gein.<br /><br />One of the problems is the female lead; just couldn't have an interest in whether she made it or not. R. Lee Ermey is always a good addition; couldn't help but wonder how much he was being paid for this, and how did he end up doing this after doing the great Kubrick film "Full Metal Jacket".<br /><br />In fairness, I loved the first TCM and even Part 2. Maybe there was just something missing in this one. Perhaps the next sequel will be better. They could get Dennis Hopper in the cast again.
