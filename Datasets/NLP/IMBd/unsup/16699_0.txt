I enjoyed the movie a lot. I like movies in which the characters are kind of ¨mysterious¨ at the beginning and then become clearer as the film progresses. Ramillo is ¨dumped¨ onto this island as an exile, but we don't know anything at first about why he's an exile or where he's being exiled from. All of this is gradually revealed in the film. All of the characters are fascinating. The drunk who dies at the beginning, the diver, the men in the bar, the woman and her father, the ¨seer¨ who warns them that the sea is coming. <br /><br />I wonder why it was named ¨La Frontera.¨ I also wonder why Maite does not go with Ramillo. She seems to have lost her mind somewhat at the end. She is sexually starved, but then refuses a life with Ramillo.
