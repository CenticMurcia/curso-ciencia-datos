This film is really just something to watch when you are bored. It's by no means the worst film on the world, but it could have been so much better.<br /><br />There are some funny moments, and parts where you do wonder just what the hells going on. You can decide for yourself whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.<br /><br />I did enjoy the beginning, the way it kind of gave you a false sense of security; how it gave you the impression that the film might be something that was completely different from what it turned out to be. But it did go down hill from there on end.
