I got this film free and didn't know what it was about - I guessed from the box cover it was some sort of romantic comedy (what other sort of film has hot air balloons?). How wrong I was! Daniel Craig gives a really excellent performance as the stalked university lecturer and Rhys Ifans manages to keep his trademark pantomime acting style under control enough to be convincingly creepy. Poor old Samantha Morton is left without much to do - and her character comes across as quite callous. Why the Daniel Craig character would want to marry her after she's so unsympathetic about his mental problems caused by the hot air balloon mayhem at the start of the film is a mystery. I found certain aspects of this film irritating - ie the endless dinner parties, the middle class media circles the characters inhabit (from this film you'd guess every person in the UK gets their picture in The Guardian) and the Samantha Morton character - but over all I was pleasantly surprised! It works well both as a creepy-stalker thriller and an examination of how easy it is to end up hating your loved ones.
