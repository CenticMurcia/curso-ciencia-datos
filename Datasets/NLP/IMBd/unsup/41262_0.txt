Here's an excellent example on how a good true-life story can be totally lost by an eager-to-make-money producer. The lead actor portraying Andrew Cunanan is possibly the worst actor I have seen in a legitimate movie production. The plot gets lost and the story has no point what so ever. I got it on VHS and now its the prank gift on birthdays. Nobody who gets it wants to keep it. It has now been handed over seven times and only one of the owners (bar me) took enough interest to watch it to the end.<br /><br />Never spend the time on this movie it SUCKS!! BIIIIG TIME!!
