I tuned into this on late night TV a couple nights ago, without having a clue about what it was. I thought it might've been one of those documentaries about a family, or a really low budget soap opera, but I knew it was different once...well, once the aliens appeared. After a kind of average beginning, this movie only gets better. The performances are realistic, the action and thrills are intense, and, even though the budget is obviously very small, the director does a great job of keeping the aliens out of view. Along with all this, the story keeps twisting and turning, and although it's a movie about aliens abducting people, it could make the biggest skeptic believe some of this stuff. It's one of those movies that, after it ends, leaves you kinda (or very) shaken up. And it's not like I get freaked out easily by movies or don't watch enough of them--I watched The Shining the night before, and Alien Abduction at least equals it in suspense and intensity. Apart from being the most clich√©d basic idea EVER (average American family is abducted by little green men), this is a surprisingly great movie. Low budget doesn't mean low quality.
