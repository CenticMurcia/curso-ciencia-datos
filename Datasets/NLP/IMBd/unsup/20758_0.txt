A movie maker trying to make money by making a movie about people making money off of homosexuals.<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly how to tell you my disappointment in this movie. Subject material and eye candy should be plentiful but somehow the director missed all of it. Was there a goal? Where's the story line? If all it takes these days to make an independent film is for some whack with a cheap handicam to wander around and aimlessly shoot people then suicide may be my best option. The sound is off for most of the film, the directing lacks direction, and the film could use a talented editor.<br /><br />If you find this at a film festival near you keep this in mind -> You are better off brown nosing in the lobby with the real film makers.
