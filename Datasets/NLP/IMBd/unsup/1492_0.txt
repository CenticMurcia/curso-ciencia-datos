I was lucky enough to see a preview of this film tonight. This was a very cool, eerie film. Well acted, especially by Skarsgard who played his role of Terry Glass perfectly. Sobieski did a very good job too as it seems to me that she has a bright future ahead of her. The music was well placed but was fairly standard. The use of shadows was quite interesting as well. Overall, this was quite a nice surprise considering I'm not much a fan of this genre. 7/10.
