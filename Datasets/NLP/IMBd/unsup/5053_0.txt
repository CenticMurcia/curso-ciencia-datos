"Escape from (the) Brothel" is one of those Hongkong films that mix drama with action, nudity and pure terror to make a notorious "Category-III-classic". In a way, it's also a love story, but don't expect to get a Hollywood-standard happy end here.<br /><br />A man falls in love with a prostitute who works in a brothel. He wants to get her out but there is no way to do that. The more he tries to help her, the more violence he witnesses and he has to fight against it. In one scene, he is attacked by a kick boxing nude amazon blonde (sic!).<br /><br />The second half of the film is a violent "tour de force", and as bodies are piling up during the action-packed climax, this film also becomes one of the goriest Hongkong films aside the great "The Untold Story" and the viciously funny "The Ebola Syndrome".<br /><br />I recommend this film to everyone who likes "Category-III"-movies from Hongkong. However, people who are easily offended by the blending of sex and violence surely should let this one be.
