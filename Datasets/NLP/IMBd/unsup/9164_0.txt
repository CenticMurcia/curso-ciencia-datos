This movie is a rare gem. All of the shots are completely hyper-kinetic, which eliminates the possibility of emphasis or accent on any of the films (convoluted and yet, ironically predictable) events. It works out as a collection of tenuously related 2 minute music videos in which character development and plot are almost non existent. The director, who is a very good director, as he showed in his last film "La gente de la Universal", decide to show of his 12 plus years of producing TV commercials in detriment of any sort of narrative criteria. Its overlong, overwritten and I have no idea what the deal is with having an aborted child narrating it. Its Fax meaning at its best, a whole mess of sound and fury signifying nothing.
