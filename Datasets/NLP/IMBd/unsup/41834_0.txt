I wanted to like this film. Sydney Pollack is a liberal-minded director with an interesting filmography. But I found myself asking why Kidman had to play the part and not a black actress. She never convinces as a half-African fighter for freedom in the disguise of an interpreter...Too many compromises -Pollack - hints at something like this in the DVD specials - and no thrills. The ending is neither touching nor thrilling. The alternative end which you can find on the DVD is even worse - a naive dreamer's version of what politics should be like. Technically a perfect film, as for the contents: unconvincing and flat. Sorry Sydney, but the UN as a location is not enough as a concept for a convincing political film.
