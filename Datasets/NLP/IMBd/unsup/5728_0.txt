This is a great takeoff on Al Jolson and "The Jazz Singer." It's also a nice tribute to the famous entertaining of yesteryear.<br /><br />In this version of the famous film, we have owls playing the parts. Papa Owl, a strict sort, is pleased when his wife has four eggs. When they hatch, it's immediately discovered one is a "Caruso," the next is a violinist like Fritz Kreisler, the third is a Mendelsohnn. Daddy is thrilled until the fourth one hatches and the chick is - horrors! - "a jazz singer, a crooner." Mama Owl faints, but Papa reassures her "we will teach him to sing like we want him, too.<br /><br />You can guess the rest. If you're familiar with the story of The Jazz Singer, you should get a real "hoot" out of this animated short which has a very sweet ending to it as young "Owl Jolson" wins 'em over on the "Jack Bunny" radio broadcast.
