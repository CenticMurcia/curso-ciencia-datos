I rented this movie because I love Bob Odenkirk's comic genius in the Mr. Show, but this movie is a complete waste of time, an excruciating exercise in bad breath.<br /><br />If watching 4 pretentious L.A. hipsters talk on their cell phones and blab incessantly at a restaurant is your thing, than you'll love this. If not, stay the heck away! Having lived in Hollywood for years, the scary thing about "Melvin Goes to Dinner" is that people like this truly do exist, in droves! Having said that, I'm sure this film will find an adoring audience of pseudo intellectual blab-meisters and self important hackensteins.
