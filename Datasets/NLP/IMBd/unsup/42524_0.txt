STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Dolph Lundgren plays a captain called John Foster in this DVD sci-fi film, who's also one of a select group of people in 2209 Los Angeles who is 'genetically unique' and has an immune system that can fend off the effects of a deadly bacteria which has come off some meteorites that have crashed on earth and caused death and disease amongst the people. He has a spaceship that can travel back in time and stop the meteors from crash landing but on his way some mutinous members of his crew attempt to take over and control history for themselves. In the struggle, Dolph winds up in the past in Antarctica where the ship that will cause the disaster is located. But as he liaises with the captain of the ship and the crew members, forces are at work that are out to get him.<br /><br />Even by Dolph's standards, Retrograde is seriously bargain basement so it's best enjoyed on a strictly trashy, campy fun level. This is a film so ultra low budget and cheap looking it makes Fortress 2 look like Independence Day, with sets and props so unconvincing you feel as though you could better them with items from your own back yard. With the budget constraints showing on screen, it's not surprising that the cast aren't exactly top quality either, with a truly horrendous no name supporting cast delivering some truly laughable, awful performances. Even Dolph isn't exactly putting his heart into it, and with so little encouragement around him, who could blame him? With all this going on, it would help if there was an exciting, fast paced story to get into with Dolph doing everything he can to liven the action scenes up, but this fails even in this department, with a slow, meandering story with a pace that seriously drags in parts.<br /><br />Retrograde gets everything right by doing everything wrong. It's a film that's best enjoyed on a trashy 'so bad it's good' level. Go in expecting a film of The Punisher or Universal Soldier quality and you're going to come away miffed. **
