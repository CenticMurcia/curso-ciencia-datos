Let me start by saying I think that people who torture and harm animals are sick and should definitely be punished. That aside, this program shows these officers and people stretching the definition of "animal abuse" to ridiculous proportions. Before watching this show, my first impression was that it is wonderful that society has taken a proactive stance against people who hurt animals and made a division of law enforcement specifically to stop it. After watching it I have mixed feelings about the people involved. <br /><br />One episode I remember, some ducks were in a parking lot some guy owned (but was rarely there), and one of them was sick. It ended up dying, and the people on the show were talking about how the results of why the duck died were inconclusive, and they were angry because they couldn't charge the owner with any crimes or tickets. I'm sorry but that's just insane - people now have criminal liability for animals that randomly come on their property and die? The same episode showed these two incompetent officers going after a cat and completely tearing this guy's apartment apart, wantonly destroying his property, and literally throwing boxes of his stuff across the room to get it out of their way.<br /><br />Some of the shows detail some pretty sick people, but at the same time, some of them go a little too far in their zeal to just find people to prosecute. Many of the shows I've seen, maybe it's just chance, were officers harassing poor people who were kind enough to take what little extra money they had and feed an animal or let it stay on the property. Then fining them or arresting them and acting like these normal, compassionate people who were of meager means and doing what they could were actually sadistic freaks because they couldn't afford to get some stray dog they were leaving scraps for a $8,000 kidney transplant.
