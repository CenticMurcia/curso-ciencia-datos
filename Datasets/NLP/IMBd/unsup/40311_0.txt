i'm really into war films but this has to be one of the worst. i think Oliver Stone should stay clear of war films. he just doesn't make them well. Platoon isn't a favourite of mine either even though its rated high. Oliver Stone did make Platoon pretty well though but it doesn't even close to Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers.<br /><br />i think Tom Cruise did a half decent job of an injured war veteran that has been rendered to living in a wheel chair. Tom Cruise really is a fantastic actor but i didn't feel for him as much in this.<br /><br />the film is really showing its age too. films like Apocalypse Now still looks absolutely fantastic even today but every time i give born on the fourth of July another try it gets worse.<br /><br />you should watch this film if your a war fan because its not a rubbish film but you will agree with me that its no way as good as other war classics<br /><br />i really have no idea why this film won 2 academy awards either. there was nothing special that stuck out of the film that made it worthy of two academy awards........ 4/10.......j.d Seaton
