I've been anticipating this film for a while, ever since it got such buzz at SXSW 2007 (and I missed the screening). I finally watched it in NY recently. What a disappointment! The premise is promising for an off-beat comedy - a frustrated twenty-something, fresh on the heels of his failed play opening, decides to rob a bank, discovering that crime may be his calling in the world.<br /><br />But the creativity stalls from here on out. The two slacker best friends are cringe worthy - at attempt at indie quirk that is too forced and self conscious. The romantic relationship between the main character and the bank teller is promising but the lack of spark between the actors doesn't help the poorly flushed out story line.<br /><br />The film is adequately directed, though Miranda's commercial roots are definitely showing, but the merits of "Skills" don't earn the hype. I've seen so many wonderful festival films that never get distribution - I am left scratching my head wondering who the producers had to bribe to get this three year old bomb into limited screening! I doubt it will ever see a DVD shelf.
