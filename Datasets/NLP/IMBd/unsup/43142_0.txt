I have to admit I haven't seen Grudge 1, but I have seen The Ring so I understand that Asian horror films are a bit different. But really, this film was terrible and not the least bit scary. Incomprehensible is a better descriptor. Corny, predictable and dull, yes.<br /><br />The plot just left me going "what?" as you had a succession of undeveloped characters getting bumped off in disjointed "future-past-future" sequences that just left you scratching your head. Large chunks of the film went unexplained - such as the whole schoolgirl extra storyline, why ghost-woman-and-boy were targeting people who hadn't even been in the house (boyfriends, schoolgirl extras etc), why the hell ghost-woman-reborn-as-evil-child waited five or six years to kill mum on a whim....etc, etc, etc....<br /><br />Sorry, this one just left me thankful we hadn't paid good money to see it at the movies.
