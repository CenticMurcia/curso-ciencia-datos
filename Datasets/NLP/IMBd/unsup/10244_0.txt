What a delightful little movie. What i really enjoyed is the minimalistic camera work, which was heavily based on close ups and long shots. The way the camera lingers on the characters' faces and floats between them has great insight. Also credit goes to the amazing actors, especially the girl. She steals the show with her expressive style. You can see all the hope of being loved by someone, all the agony , all the fear of being alone... Maybe the movie was 3 minutes too long but that's totally forgivable. RIEN A FAIRE is certainly a movie to discover.
