I always wanted to know what Monasteries are like. Quiet, Peaceful places of Contemplation and Compassion? And in today's time where almost everybody writes a book about almost everything, it shouldn't be a problem to find out. But I had no luck so far; until I have seen this movie (it's really a documentary).<br /><br />This movie was shot on a single small camera (I'm no expert) using the light that was available at location. Some of the shots are very grainy (see above, I'm no expert), those make a very dramatic effect. And apparently, it took 16 years for the monks to grant the filmmaker permission to film. And even then, only on his own, no artificial lights.<br /><br />The film has almost no dialogue (no need to learn Latin to understand the movie) and is almost 3 hours long. The camera freezes on a certain scene (like somebody in prayer) and stays there for a few minutes and then it goes to a different scene. I was especially impressed by the recording of the changes in the seasons. The beautiful location somewhere in France is highly suitable for that type of movie. Large amounts of snow followed by birdsong and lots of greenery in summer. Combine that with a tremendous ability by the filmmaker to compose the pictures and you are in for sensational treat.<br /><br />But it doesn't stop there, for the film takes you into the Monastery,i doesn't look in from the outside, it tries to look in from the inside. This is not a documentary telling us "How to be a Monk in 10 easy to follow steps". It rather explores the silence and the solitude. One of the repeated shots is of a red candle flickering inside a glass, no noises whatsoever, just the red glow using a tele lens. Other shots are of monks in deep prayer or engaged in their other activities.<br /><br />The film doesn't explain why these people choose to live a life like that. Nor does it explain the level of self-sufficiency. But what it does explain is the material sacrifice and the related spiritual freedom.<br /><br />I know that I am not the only one in today's society to suffer from the stresses of 21-first century life and the constant noises of our cities. And probably from the breakdown of moral and ethical values in our society. I admire the monks that they are able and committed to that kind of life. It certainly appears to be a lot more difficult than to choose which TV channel to switch on (or other mundane tasks).<br /><br />I always considered going into monastery as a step too far. Not anymore now, but I fear it is still a step too big for me.<br /><br />A final note: this movie lasts for about 3 hours, and it is a very encouraging way to assess your levels of patience and consideration, and several people walked out when I watched it. But the reward is exceptional, I came out a slightly different person. And even if you are not interested in Religion or Monasteries, the photographic value of this movie is more than anything I have ever seen before. The shot selection and composition is outstanding !
