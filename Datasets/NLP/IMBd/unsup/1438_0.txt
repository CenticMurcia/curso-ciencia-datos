...for this disappointing short. This movie is full of embarrassing clich√©s (e.g. the asylum inmates behave absolutely unnatural) and looks to me like a "work in progress" that was finished by all means. The fuzzy and arbitrary story and the David Hamilton optics are just an obvious trick to cover the dilettantism behind all. However, some people will be fooled and mistake it for poetry... for those I recommend the insightful audio commentary on the film fest DVD that reveals absolutely no useful information - not to let room for interpretations - just because the directer himself doesn't have the slightest idea why he did certain things. I'm pretty sure that "deep inside" this german equivalent to Mark Borchardt (I clearly prefer "Coven" to "Dolphins" by the way) is aware that he is actually an untalented filmmaker...even (and much more because) he thinks he has created something wonderful and unique. The latter it is. 1 out of 10
