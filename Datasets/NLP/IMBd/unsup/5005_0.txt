A psychological thriller maybe, but not a "horror" movie!<br /><br />An elderly couple move into a house that's been empty for years. Naturally the reason it's been empty for so long is because everyone has heard the tale about the ghost that haunts it......many years ago a young girl lived there, with just 2 servants to look after her after her parents died, and when the girl too died, the servants (a married couple) were bequeathed her fortune; as was her wish for their kindness. But when a young girl (Margaret Lockwood) comes to live with the Smedhurst couple as companion for the wife, the soul of the dead girl takes over her mind, leading her to madness and near certain death.<br /><br />Quite exciting, but marred by a few dull scenes. Good ending though!
