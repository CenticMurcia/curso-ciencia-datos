I rented this thing tonight and was VERY disappointed. The reviews had this as one of the Top 10 films of 2004, but yet the story was disjointed, not very interesting and just overall not entertaining. I stuck through to see how it would end, not because I was tremendously interested but rather because I had made it through half the film and thought it might improve. Somewhat predictable -- you can pretty much figure out which character will "surprisingly" reveal themselves as gay, or guess that ***SPOILER ALERT*** BADASSSSS is going to pull in the crowds at the last minute**** <br /><br />It's a shame, though, because the acting in this film is really REALLY good. Van Peebles does a bang-up job as an auteur on a mission, his secretary and his producer friend Bill are played dead-on, and the kid in this movie is also really talented. It just didn't work for me.<br /><br />3 1/2 out of TEN
