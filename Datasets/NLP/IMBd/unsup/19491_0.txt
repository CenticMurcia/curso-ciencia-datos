This movie is a re make of an old Bengali classic starring Uttam Kumar. The role of Uttam Kumar has been played by Rajesh Khanna in this Shakti Samanta movie. However, the performance of Super Star Rajesh Khanna, Sharmila Tagore and the music of Rahul Dev Burman are a life a time effort and they have created magic in this movie. Other characters also do their part well- Omprakash, Leela Mishra,Sujit Kumar, Vinod Mehra and others have done their part well. The movie will be remembered for its 6 nos- 3 by Kishore Kumar, 2 by Lata and 1 by S D Burman. The story is a classic and the movie deserves more than what share it has got in last 38 years and is a timeless classic and is life time effort of all the cast and crew. Dialogue of the movie "Pushpa I hate tears' is immortal. A must see to see how the magic of Rajesh Khanna, Kishore Kumar and Rahul Dev Burman worked in the early 1970s to be later spoiled by Amitabh Bachchan and his trend of action movies. It is true people forget good things like Amar Prem and remember all the bad things. A must see and a tear jerker.
