I don't know about you guys but Reaper is one of the best shows i've seen cuz it brings something totally new (for me at least. I mean were can you find a show that is funny and has demons). I have seen the season like 3 time already and I can still watch it. What I'm wondering is what took them so long I mean the show was aired like in 2007 and it takes the 2 years 2 make 13 episodes. I can't wait till season 2 arrives in March, damn, it will be one of the most outrages shows in '09. Ps: I wonder if Sam is gonna finally use his powers I mean it shoud have been even better if he were able 2 make fireballs right? So I made my self clear and because the review needs 2 be 10 lines long I need 2 make usless points.
