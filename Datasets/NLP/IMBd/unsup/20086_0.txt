Ice Queen starts as a military convoy is attacked by someone or other, the film doesn't think such details are important so why should we, & a unique prehistoric humanoid shaped female Ice Queen (Ami Chorlton) creature recently discovered is stolen. Scientist Dr. Goddard (Daniel Hall Kuhn) decides to transport the Ice Quen to somewhere not far from the Snowshed Ski Resort Lodge by plane, unfortunately the cold temperature outside revives the Ice Queen & she kills the pilot, the plane crashes, causes an avalanche which buries the ski lodge trapping Johnny (Harmon Walsh) & his buddies. Besides having to survive the avalanche Johnny & his buddies also have to contend with the Ice Queen who kills on sight...<br /><br />Co-edited, co-written & directed by Neil Kinsella this is yet another brainless straight-to-video/DVD low budget piece of crap horror film with lots of unintentional comedic moments. The script by Kinsella, producer Peter Beckwith & David Williams is boring, dull, clich√©d & full of plot holes. The whole Ice Queen thing is wrong, no explanation is given as to what she is, when the equipment in the back of the plane stops working there would have been all sorts of alarms going off as is the case with medical equipment, if Ed phoned the emergency services to report an avalanche they couldn't just say 'we don't believe you' & not bother to investigate, the emergency services are obliged by law to respond to a call for help & that's a basic fact. I could go on but you get the idea, the script is dumb & had little thought put into it. The character's are awful, they do stupid things, they split up, no-one seems that bothered about being trapped under an avalanche of snow or that some of their mates have been killed & are dead & they are just plain annoying. The film seems to go on for ages, it's boring, it's predictable, it's stupid & it's not a film I enjoyed.<br /><br />Director Kinsella doesn't do much to liven things up, the direction is poor & the film has pacing problems. The Ice Queen herself is awful, she has these spastic looking exaggerated movements, she stares, sneers & wiggles her tongue at the camera & she just looks retarded. It's not scary, there's no excitement, tension or atmosphere. There's no gore either, someone has their hand pulled off, there are several scenes of the Ice Queen sticking her hand into people's chests & that's it. I will admit though that the avalanche scene is quite well done even though it steals footage from the film Avalanche (1999) so I can't give it that much credit since the best sequence in the film was at least in part stolen from another film. Also, when Johnny & his mates crawl out of that air vent at the end there's no snow anywhere & the ground is dry, where did the snow that covered the building go all of a sudden? Also, why didn't the avalanche destroy the jacuzzi & who left it on?<br /><br />Technically the film is alright, it's nothing special but it's reasonably well made. Apparently shot in Vermont. The special effects are OK & better than a lot of low budget horror films of recent times. The acting is poor by no-one you've ever heard of.<br /><br />Ice Queen is one of those dumb low budget shot on a camcorder type horror flicks the kind everyone seems to think they can make. I didn't like it & I doubt many will.
