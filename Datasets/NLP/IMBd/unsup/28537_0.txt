Much more than a car commercial, Powder Keg explodes with energy, intelligence and heart. A powerful statement on war and our response to it, this film short packs more punch than most major studio releases. Clive Owen and Stellan Skarsgard prove once again that these two actors do not know how to give a bad performance. Well worth watching for film and car buffs, alike.
