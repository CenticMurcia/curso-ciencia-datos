Finally after trying for so long, i have watched this movie. It's either always rented out, or not available.<br /><br />This is not a wonderful movie, but still very enjoyable. For the first time ever i have noticed how absolutely beautiful Kate Hudson really is. Wow, she is just so pretty ! She was absolutely hilarious. It's been a while since i laughed so much while watching a romantic comedy. There's really some things you can take away in this movie. It's fun, it's funny, it's enjoyable, and there's really some chemistry between Matt and Kate. <br /><br />The bet part is so clich√©d, and i didn't like Michelle all that much. I recommend seeing this movie, even just for the fun of it. I'd give it a 7/10.
