Jason 'one-dimensional' Statham appears in another film of brainless action and mind-numbing car races. The script is cheap recycled material, which exploits the unimaginative crash-bang-wallop of the film.<br /><br />The films key audience is the young-gamer, gizmo's generation. The film is created as a fast-paced action computer game hoping lots of crashes, burning cars and weaponry will entice. For the majority Death Race is way too brash, ugly and destructive to appeal, indeed the car scenes are messily edited and repeated.<br /><br />If the stereotypical and annoying characters are not enough to halt proceedings the endless one-liners should do the trick. This is where I can give Statham credit, he does have the ability to churn out cheesy and ill-opportune 'one-liners' with an ounce of believability and authority, which his co-cast cannot do.<br /><br />Death Race is unashamedly one-dimensional and the idea that placing a few guns on tops of cars will appeal and make this an engaging film is hard to fathom. However, nowadays if you want to make money throw in some cars, guns, girls and booming hip-hop and you seem to generate an odd following.
