I cant honestly say that this game is better than a single of the other warcraft games. I could play Tides of Darkness for hours and hours but WoW really was amazingly boring. You do the same thing every level every city every char. Don't really get the game. Don't get how people can play it non-stop for days and not get sick of it. I sold my copy of WoW after 2 weeks. Have seen my friends play and they all have 60's and I cant see any difference from my level 20. There is no change in this game and one must have a simple mind to find it entertaining for a longer period than a week, maybe 2. If I gave this game a 2 than i really would be to nice, so i decided not to.
