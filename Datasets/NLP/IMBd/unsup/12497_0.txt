Hanna Barbera - the Kings of Animation for over 4 decades created this wonderful cartoon memory - a western-type horse named 'Quick Draw' ("I'll do the thinnin' around here!") and his (mule? pony? donkey?)assistant Babba-Louie ("Quicks draw!"). Loved that accent for Bubba-Louie. To be honest, I didn't know this cartoon was THAT old. Amazing, I must have seen it in repeats - but I thought I saw it in first run. But it was fun. And my favorite was 'El-Kabbong'. When my parents bought me a guitar at 6 years old, I tried to copy that goofy sound for years! Going off the beaten track ...let me also take the forum to write about two things regarding Quick Draw McGraw: One, this cartoon did not promote violence and again, I was totally ticked off at the 80's parental group that ruined it for the next generation of children behind me to be able to see this....and two - in the 90's when the Arsenio Hall Show was on, I remember he came out and performed a monologue about "El-Kabbong". Many in the audience didn't seem to know who that was or what cartoon was referring to...and Arsenio explained how this cartoon was one of the best cartoons of his childhood. It was one of the funniest monologues he ever did.<br /><br />I'm loving the Turner Corporation for creating the "Boomerang" Channel where Quick Draw, Babba-Louie and the Zoro-ish alter ego of Quick Draw, "El-Kabbong" now has a home. My children, my little relatives can see what I saw and have a great time too. Hanna Barabara had many hits (and some misses) in their pursuit to entertain children and adults. This is definitely one of the hits.
