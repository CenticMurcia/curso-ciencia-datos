I really wanted to like this film. A great cast of talented comedians such as Lyndsey Marshal, Stuart Milligan, Daniela Nardini, Stephen Mangan from Green Wing, Richard Ayoade and Chris O'Dowd from the IT crowd, Amelia Bullmore from Alan Partridge, Raquel Cassidy and Tom Goodman-Hill from The Worst Week of My Life, Duncan Duff given a preposterously short and weird part, Matthew Holness from The Office and Meredith MacNeill from Man Stroke Woman. So much talent here, and so badly wasted.<br /><br />The plot is neither interesting nor funny; the script is boring beyond belief, with the few jokes thrown in being totally lame. Plus the random inclusion of disgusting and/or completely unnecessary scenes such as a priest going after a young boy, Stephen Mangan's genitalia, one of the Irish comedians being f*sted while holding some puppets, you get what I mean. It is just strange. Take it from me just don't bother, I began watching it, thought, yeah not so good but maybe it will pick up, no, an hour in, nothing happens, still no sign of any plot, comedy, I then did something more interesting like watch someone else watch paint dry.
