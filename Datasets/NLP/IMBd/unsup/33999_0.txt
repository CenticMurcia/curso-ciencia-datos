"The Exorcist" is one of my top five films of all time. Imagine my horror and dismay as I watched this stench-laden sequel. Awful dialogue and a horrible storyline kill the movie. Quality-wise this movie isn't in the same solar system with its predecessor or the REAL sequel to "The Exorcist," the underrated "Exorcist III." Shun this movie unless you're looking for laughs.
