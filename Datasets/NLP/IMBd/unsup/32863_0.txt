I tell you, I've never walked out on a movie before, but I was desperate to walk out on this horrible disaster of a movie.<br /><br />I respect Ed Harris as an actor and I went to see the movie because I am fond of all the people who starred in the film. However, Ed Harris has proved that his understanding of film-making is greatly lacking.<br /><br />This movie had so many scenes that were directed the way a college student just learning the basics might direct. Bad edits, amateur camera angles, and long... long... painful long sequences of meandering dialogue that did nothing for the story except make you wish it would end soon.<br /><br />There were also some scenes where they failed in the sound mixing so you couldn't catch certain lines that might have been funny... but the direction for the actors was just as poor as the technical miscues and failings. The script had scenes that could have been funny if they had been delivered in a form other than FLAT... which was the feel through the whole film... FLAT. All the lines were delivered with dismissive feeling toward the film over all (another reason the movie fails to capture or interest.) The plot was very basic and straight forward, leaving no surprises... and there really seemed to be no sense of consequence for any action. There was no real tension in the film... or real anything (except for the town itself. I do have to give credit that the town and costumes were very realistic... succeeding in making the town looking lived in).<br /><br />I suggest Ed Harris not direct another movie ever again...<br /><br />and I wish I could get my money back...
