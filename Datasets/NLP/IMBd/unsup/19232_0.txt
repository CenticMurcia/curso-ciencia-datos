You go see movies all the time hoping to be entertained, then something like this blows you away and makes all those evenings watching rubbish go away.<br /><br />Cowboys with pencil drawn moustaches, grisly ultraviolence, corny romance and beautiful but very strange sets and cinematography.<br /><br />Best of all, you can take your girl. She'll like the romance and you'll like the shoulder mounted missiles and Peckinpah (Can I spell that?) style squib bursts.
