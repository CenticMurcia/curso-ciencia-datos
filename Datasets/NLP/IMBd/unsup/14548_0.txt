Just about every adult born before 1970 will know who "Peanuts" are. That lovable gang of children, with Snoopy, the worry-wart Charlie Brown's pet beagle, is the center of it all.<br /><br />This movie, Snoopy Come Home, is a great film, for young and for old. I remember watching it many dozen a time when I was between the age of 4-6. Every character has something a child can relate too! The musical score to this movie is fantastic, each tune being both catchy and sounding delightful to one's ears.<br /><br />If you have a sensitive child, I'd strongly urge you NOT to let them watch this film, as it WILL run the risk of damaging them down the track in years to come! From being hilariously funny to downright sad, there's a lot to love in this little animated dog, and a lot of attitude! So from giggling at Snoopy's delightfully cute laugh, or clicking your fingers along with one of this film's many tunes, this is a perfect movie for a parent and young children.
