I had a chance to see "The Item" and was pleasantly surprised. This film combined the aspects of other Blockbuster films (like PULP FICTION) and the twist is that it does this while making fun of itself.<br /><br />It was well acted, the lead actress was superb and her character was refreshing (think La Femme Nikita only brunette and Latina).<br /><br />Entertaining aspects like Drag Queens doing martial arts in pumps are still making me laugh. In short this flick is KOOL.<br /><br />
