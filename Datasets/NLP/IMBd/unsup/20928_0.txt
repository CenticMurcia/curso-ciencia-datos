ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE had plenty of laughs, but some of the humor was stupid. Jim Carrey was part of that. He was funny mostly, but also very dumb. The reason I like this movie is because I like that type of movie-Cops or robbers or detectives and stuff(BEVERLY HILLS COP, 48 HRS, LETHAL WEAPON, etc.). This one was like those, but not quite worthy. I liked it, and recommend it to any Jim Carrey fan, or someone who just wants some, comedy that's stupid, yet funny. 7/10
