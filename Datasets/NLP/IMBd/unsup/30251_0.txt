The words are Emily Leighton's (Molly Parker), who defied her Senator husband and risked losing her daughters to fight for their right to be counted as citizens of the US. She, and many other women fought long and hard, and endured pain and suffering, to give women what was rightfully theirs.<br /><br />Hillary Swank was magnificent, as was her sidekick played by Frances O'Connor. Swank was the top of a stellar cast and should have gotten more credit for her performance. Hollywood tends to pick favorites instead of the best, and they did so in this case.<br /><br />This is an important film that should be seen by all to remind us that our country has had and still has a history of denying basic rights to it's citizens. The fight is not over for everyone, and sometimes it takes herculean efforts to get what should be everyone's rights in the first place.
