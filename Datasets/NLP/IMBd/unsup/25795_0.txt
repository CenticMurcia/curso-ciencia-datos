This has to be one of the most aggravatingly dumb movies ever made. I can't believe the positive comments that I see here!!! Maybe it didn't make any money at the box office because it stinks!!! Did any of you ever think of that? You get the feeling while watching this thing that all of the characters are moving in slow motion with no sense of time. The dialog is horrid and the acting is worse. Plot holes galore!!! Did anyone else notice the similarity to "After Hours" in the night scenes???
