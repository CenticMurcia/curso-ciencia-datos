BOYS ARE EASY (1993) is a very funny movie about a Father (Richard Ng) that is worried that his three daughters are never going to get married. So he decides to cook up a scheme to get them engaged. Faking a terminal illness and playing it up to the hilt, the three daughters (Brigette Lin, Maggie Cheung, and Chingmy Yau) dig up three men (Leung Kar-Fai, Jacky Cheung and Ekin Cheng) to pose as there fianc√©es. The results are bizarre and hilarious. It has many memorable scenes and crazy dialog. In the vein of the screwball/romance comedies that used to come out of Hollywood in the thirties.<br /><br />One seen to watch for is the Triad Games (I kid you not). Filled with cameos from Wong Jing's Workshop and his usual slapstick farce. If you enjoy Wacky comedies then this movie is for you. The finale is just as silly as the rest of the film. Only if Hollywood could make films as half as entertaining as this one. Wong Jing once again proves that a "chick flick" could be funny for both sexes. **** out of ****. Check it out!!
