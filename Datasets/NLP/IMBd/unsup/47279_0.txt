***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Me and my friend were really bored and decided to go to Hollywood video to pick out some movies. Well we found a bunch of movies on sale for 2 bucks, so we're all, okay let's pick some out. So she picked out this really bad one with Jay Leno as the star of the movie (that was entertaining enough)And I picked up this..this neat looking movie hobbs end (Come on, it had a chainsaw on the front!)<br /><br />I must say this is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The beginning is really strange, the woman's talking to herself most of the time. I thought the part that was bizzare was when she (catarina) starts sniffing the air, and said "something stinks, it's you isn't it" (to the psycho killer guy) "you need a bath." And then the guy says: "Would it be okay if I took a bath?" And then she says "isn't your timing a little off?" Ummm okay. This is how the movie goes the WHOLE TIME! I started laughing when he started stabbing his arm..that was really classic. Another classic part is when he tells the woman that he has "feelings" for her after 3 hours of knowing her. Well I don't want to blow the movie for you, it's a must see (yeah right) Major BLUNDERS: THERE IS NO CHAINSAW. Okay, I have no idea what the cover has to do with the movie. Another blunder: Who'se that guy creeping around the house, the starwarsy guy. I have no idea!!!!! All I know is that he ends up dead. My mom says it's "Obscenely Insipid" I'm making everyone watch this movie, because it's so painful. I could go on about this forever, but I think you'll have to see it for yourself. It makes me laugh just thinking about it.
