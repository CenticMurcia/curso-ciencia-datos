"Happy Face Murders" is a below par whodunnit which has little to offer and is very ordinary in almost all respects. Ann-Margaret is not believable as a quirky old woman; Helgenberger isn't believeable as a tough cop; the script is sophomoric; directing abominable; etc. Unless you're really bored and happen upon it on broadcast, don't waste your time.
