Yes. A 1.<br /><br />And as other commentators have noted, it feels like you are watching a medievalized version of Star Trek. Everyone is giving Patrick Stewart like performances, talking about democracy and human rights---<br /><br />What is this, a 16 year old girl's vision of the Middle Ages? <br /><br />I don't feel fear, I don't feel fear, I don't feel fear, this is the damn mantra repeated by Gere throughout the entire movie . . .<br /><br />So-- <br /><br />Apparently Dare-Devil was a medieval American knight, who had memorized every line spoken by Commander Ryker---<br /><br />The only thing good about this movie---it is hilariously bad.<br /><br />To imagine a middle ages like this, no dirt, no toughness, no rape---<br /><br />Just a Fabio-like fool running about, putting himself through a gauntlet of swinging blades to kiss the hand of the Queen--- <br /><br />Not to be taken seriously you say? Well, if I am not to take it seriously,I am sorry.<br /><br />There are two hours here of silliness to laugh at and foppish villains who talk like Italian designers--<br /><br />But I would say see this movie, if you want to laugh--- <br /><br />Because it is certainly funny.
