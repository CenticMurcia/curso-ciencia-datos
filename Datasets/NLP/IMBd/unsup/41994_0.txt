I get mad every time I think about this trash. I watched it on late, late cable years ago and it was a horrible experience. <br /><br />First, it has NOTHING to do with Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece "A CLOCKWORK ORANGE" I don't know why the producers and distributors of this crap compared both films. This film is sick in boredom, terribly directed, the plot is non existent, and the acting is just as horrible as the title!!! The director does not know a thing about film making! Terrible film, it shouldn't even be considered as a morbid flick. There is no excuses for this trash, it should be banned worldwide. It's almost impossible to find this disgusting film, but if you do find it just ignore it. DO NOT WATCH IT, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Crap stands out compared to this film. <br /><br />I will give it a second chance when I find it because as far as I know, it isn't available on DVD. Last time I watched it was probably around 2000.<br /><br />Bury it! And be sure it won't resurrect in the next 3 days.
