Until recently I had never heard of this film. After seeing some reviews on Amazon.com, I had to see it. Well, all I can say is why isn't this film known as a classic Christmas film like Miracle on 34th Street. What a delightful movie! This is perfect family fare- This is the kind of movie I only wish they would make today. Jimmy Durante is as usual the lovable looser! He is perfect for the role of Terry Moore's father. The original title of this film was 'The Great Rupert', Rupert being a magical squirrel Â– The use of a puppet type squirrel was very innovative in 1950, but of course is very campy by today's standards. It would be interesting to see what they could do with today's technology. All in all this is a fun family film that is a must for all to see- Now that it is available on DVD maybe more people will get the opportunity to see it. If you have not yet gone over to DVD, be aware that this film is also available on VHS. Take a chance; I think you will enjoy it!
