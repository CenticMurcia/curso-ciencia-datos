Oh Gina, my lovely Gina, how bad have you fallen? Then again, you were never really an A-lister. Prey for Rock n' Roll features an all-girl punk rock band, but maybe hard rock too, in LA, supposedly in the late 90s or early 2000s. Jackie (Gershon) is the lead singer, who is turning 40 and still doesn't have success or a respectable recording contract. While the cast looks the part and the acting is decent thanks mostly to Gershon and Drea DeMatteo, the plot has several odd and un-realistic situations. 2 of the girls are lesbians, while another is bi-sexual. I didn't know straight rocker chicks didn't like punk. 2 of the bandmates were sexually abused when young, then one of them is raped, another dies in an accident, while the remaining one is a drug addict. The rapist has the word "rapist" tattooed to his forehead (oh wow). Why not send him to jail? According to the writers it seems, people in rock bands lead trash existences and suffer constant calamity. Funny, I've had many friends who were in rock bands and I can't recall any having such a decadent band history. And at least their music was decent. Clamdandy (where did they get that name?) had terrible music, I believe courtesy of Linda Perry, formerly of 4 non blondes (East Village crackehead supreme if there ever was one). Their songs simply weren't.....great. Also, the characters kept talking about the rock n' roll lifestyle that they ended looking to much like poseurs wanting to look like rockers. We never find out Animal's real name. The girls seem to have only one connection in the recording industry. The band performed too many of their songs on screen. Who becomes a rocker after watching Tina Turner? That would be R&B. One of the few bright spots is that Gershon's voice over narrative seemed cool and had some good lines. Oh and did I mention she looked hot in those pants!
