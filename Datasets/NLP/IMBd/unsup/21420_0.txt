I caught this one zapping around during morning television. I saw a bunch of my favorite actors (George C. Scott, Kathy Bates) and decided to sit it out.<br /><br />My conclusion, "Angus" is an overlooked gem.<br /><br />One thing baffles me though: this movie is listed as comedy, but I found not much to laugh about.<br /><br />"Angus" is in fact a rather painful movie to watch sometimes, because the strongest subject matter it deals with is bullying.<br /><br />It deals some very real and emotional issues, about parents' frustration about their inability to protect their children all the time. The acting is superb, and to be honest, the comic relief was a tad out of place.<br /><br />The movie contains some very good acting and some excellent scenes and dialogue. It also features a heart wrenching monologue by Angus (played by Charlie Talbert) when he confides in his grandfather (George C. Scott), who's about to be married.<br /><br />So, see beyond the awkward comic elements and "Angus" is an enjoyable, "actor driven" movie that did not get the attention it deserved.<br /><br />You'll probably enjoy the soundtrack as well. Whatever happened to the obviously talented Talbert anyway?<br /><br />
