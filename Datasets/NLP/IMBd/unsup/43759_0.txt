"Fools Rush In" is not funny, not romantic, not cute, it has a slight heart, but that's about it. Not one joke in the film worked, and even if it was a mediocre one (which is the best they had), it still was terrible because of Matthew Perry's awful timing and the overall bad acting.<br /><br />Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry) is a semi-successful business man, and Isabel (Salma Hayek) is fresh out of Mexico in Las Vegas trying to make a name for herself as an artist. These two have a one night stand, and *surprise, surprise* Isabel becomes pregnant. The plot, which consists of dozens of bad jokes and clichés, has Alex and Isabel becoming a couple and how their different cultures collide. This was a comedy, but I did not laugh once. The only person to have joke lines was Matthew Perry, and he was not funny in the least. Any time the movie was trying to be romantic, it become extremely corny. The climax of the movie ended in the rain (despite that it didn't show any signs of rain the rest of the film). One bad cliché after another corny joke, with bad acting thrown in cannot make a good movie.<br /><br />My rating: * out of ****. 113 mins. PG-13 for language and sexuality.
