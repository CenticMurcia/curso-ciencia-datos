Not worth waisting to much time on this, i just have to say it's one of the worst movies I've seen( and I've seen my share of bad movies from Manos to Master of Disguise), and you should stay away unless you want to see how bad sergiu got in his old age... Kinda sad he's so lame and doesn't even know it... Pretty much the worst thing that ever happened to romanian movies <br /><br />I know pretty much all his stuff is awful, but he outdone himself this time. I mean It's not even so bad it's funny it's... well just bad<br /><br />PS I usually don't like to insult people online but whoever gave this one a 10 is either a retard or sergiu got 10 accounts and voted himself.
