"During a sorority initiation ceremony, something horrible goes wrong and one of the new members is accidentally killed. Seven years later, the remaining sorority sisters receive invitations to attend a reunion at an isolated mountain estate. Unbeknownst to any of the women, the resort is owned by the father of the deceased sorority member, and he is looking for revenge," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. Very poor, but not a complete waste. There are a couple of cute scenes, early in the picture. The women, including 1970 Playboy "Playmate of the Year" Claudia Jennings (as Judy), are pointedly beautiful. Ms. Jennings was much more entertaining in "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase" (1976). This horror film is not frightening, and you won't see much more, or sexier, than you would in a TV episode of "Charlie's Angels".<br /><br />** Sisters of Death (8/77) Joseph Mazzuca ~ Claudia Jennings, Paul Carr, Arthur Franz
