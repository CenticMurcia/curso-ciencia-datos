I used to be a law abiding citizen. I went to work, paid my taxes, and came home to my wife and three children. We'd have dinner together and laugh as the children regaled us with tales of fantasy they came up with on the playground. The wife and I would laugh and hold each others hands, looking lovingly at each other, knowing that the love of our family would last forever.<br /><br />All of that changed the day I accidentally saw Comedy Inc.<br /><br />Nothing was ever the same. As soon as it ended and the credits began to roll, I stormed into the kitchen and beat my wife unconscious. The kids started screaming, so I promptly crapped my pants and mashed a load of feces into their faces. When they started crying their eyes out, I punched them all in the balls and sent them to their room without supper for the rest of their lives. I couldn't stop screaming 'WHAT A TERRIBLE GODDAMN SHOW' over and over, until my vocal chords became so swollen that a doctor had to remove them, forever ruining my career as Canada's Greatest Opera Singer.<br /><br />A young boy dying at a nearby hospital had one last request - to hear my beautiful voice singing 'The Circle of Life', but he wailed in agony and died as soon as he heard that would never happen.<br /><br />I now live out on the streets, typing this review on a laptop I fashioned out of some old pizza boxes and dead cat hair. I hope you can all learn a lesson from my sad tale, and ensure that neither you or your loved ones ever watch a show as bad as Comedy Inc. I know that it's tempting, since they show commercials for it every 5 seconds, but please! AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS! I'm now off to the park, where I plan on mugging and raping some innocent jogger.
