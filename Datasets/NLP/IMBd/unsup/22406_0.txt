I've seen some bad shows in my time, but this... this show takes the cake. It is possibly the trashiest shows I've ever had the misfortune of viewing. I don't give out 1 stars often, in fact, this is the fist 1 star I've ever given. Personally, I think the only people who could possibly like this show are rich, stuck-up, snobby, shallow brats, just like the stars of this show. While watching 'My Super Sweet 16', one starts to wonder what the creators were smoking when they thought of this show, and why anyone would put them self through the pain of watching this poor excuse for television is beyond me. Now, to my main problem with this show, how could this possibly count as 'music television'? does anyone remember when MTV wasn't full of shows that couldn't be any less about music if they tried? The worse part of the show are the birthday girls, if the slight possibility of the party being too expensive and it having to be made cheaper arises, even though it is still 10 times more than most people could afford, they cry a bloody river until they get their way. In conclusion this show is a MUST avoid, and if you're a tad curious, watch 5 minutes of this show, if you manage to last that long without wanting to gouge your own eyes out that is...
