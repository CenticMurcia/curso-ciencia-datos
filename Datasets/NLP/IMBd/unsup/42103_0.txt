The most important and interesting part of this movie is probably the 3D animation. And clearly, it is very professional and able to compete with other animated movies or scenes.<br /><br />But I don't understand why the rest of the film is so unprofessional: not only are some technical assumptions, such as the stability of a DC-10's nose gear, highly uncertain, the characters, acting and music are very poor, too. It should have been possible for the producers to find a competent actor or actress for the driver, or to find or compose better music.<br /><br />The fact that 405 is an action movie don't make interesting characters unnecessary. And the comedy is somewhat over-used.<br /><br />Watch the movie, but, except for the animation, don't expect much.
