An amazingly predicable pile of television schlock, with third-rate casting and even poorer writing. Lacking the fun of most post apocalyptic camp, and certainly the zombies, this show takes itself all too seriously. In contrast, the first episode of its popular predecessor "Lost" opens with chaos mediated by a broken hearted hero, but with comic sidelines such as a panicked character looking for a pen to perform an unneeded tracheotomy. Two years later, CBS spins its own version of a small town stranded with its own love wounded hero preforming a genuine tracheotomy on a little girl on a bus load of stranded school children. Gone here is the humor, back are all the old television clich√©s in mind-numbing earnest. In all fairness, I've only watched three episodes on DVD and it must get better? I fear for the worst, and find myself longing to rent "Red Dawn" again just to hear Patrick Swayze coach me to "let it turn, let it turn...." Go Wolverines! Ho hum Jericho.
