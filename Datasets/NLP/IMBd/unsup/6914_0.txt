OH MY GOD - this woman needs to read the book HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU. She tries to convince us that she is a "free woman" by choice, but it is painfully obvious she is only a free woman because the men who deign to sleep with her don't want her for anything more than sex. She spends the ENTIRE series discussing these horrendous relationships, for which she is obsessed. And she is completely remorseless when her married "lover's" wife finds out about their relationship. And she completely ignores the obvious meaning when he not only doesn't leave his wife, but virtually cuts off all contact with her. She even misses the import of her Swiss boyfriend deciding to work all day when she comes to visit him in Switzerland. It's really sad. Instead of portraying strong womanhood, she is one of the worst examples of a female's obsession to be loved and accepted by men. When will these women realize they ARE NOT any better than the women who have chosen to be in asymmetrical relationships with men but do it in a way that makes them happy.
