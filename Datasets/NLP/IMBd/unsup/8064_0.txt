This film is amazing, it's insane, and it's wonderful. You have to be suicidal and very intent on making a movie to take such risks to get something on film. Through red lights, up one way streets, scaring pedestrians, past the Arc de Triomphe, through the Louvre and up to the Basilique de Sacre Coeur at dawn in Paris... he never lets up for a moment, full speed through traffic lights, dodging buses and garbage trucks. It's only nine minutes long, but it never ceases to intrigue me. I've never seen an footage like it. Need for Speed underground Avant la lettre. Whether it really is a Ferrari 275 GTB he's driving an alpine A110 or whether the soundtrack is real is irrelevant. Even if it was done in a Parisian taxi, the footage is still amazing.
