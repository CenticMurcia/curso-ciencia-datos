I've always been a big fan of the film Freaks and think it was very ahead of its time although in its day it was thought disturbing. Freakshow stays near to the originals plot but as a story it loses its moral,in the original you care for the unfortunates of the title and they are the heroes of the film.In Freakshow there is very little character development and you really couldn't care less about them,as they are neither likable or admirable and towards the last 10 minutes of the film they turn out to be bigger sadists than those who portrayed the villains,so i really couldn't see the moral of the story,it all seemed more like a film of revenge and sadism. The last 10 minutes of the film was so unnecessary with the girl Lucy {baring in mind she hadnt actually killed anyone herself}being gruesomely hacked at so that she could be turned into a freak,i thought they were just going to cut her tongue out but oh no that was only the beginning,i couldn't believe how long this scene went on for or what they were going to stop at.It was also silly really as no one would survive all that blood loss. Very pointless
