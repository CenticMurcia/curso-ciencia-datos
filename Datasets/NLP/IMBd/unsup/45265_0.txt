I'm an action movie buff, so I feel an argue to just go out and rent everything with Arnold Schwartzenegger in it. If you're like me, you've seen "Conan the Barbarian", think that cheesy is kind of OK as long as a lot of stuff blows up.<br /><br />That's the only way you'll get through "Raw Deal". Also, you might have to fast forward through some parts.<br /><br />Poorly acted, with a sub-intellectual plot, and cardboard characters, the film's dialogue is so bad it's actually funny at times. For example, say this slowly with a serious Austrian accent: "You should not drink... and bake." Does the film itself seriously? No, but sometimes campy doesn't make "bad" good. Sometimes "bad" just stays B-A-D. Skip this and rent "Payback", which has a similar tone but is done well.<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- Serious action buffs only, and then only on a rainy day,<br /><br />and then only if you've gotten through Conan & Predator,<br /><br />and then only if you're getting it free on TV.<br /><br />Like most viewers, I'll give "Raw Deal" a 4 out of 10.
