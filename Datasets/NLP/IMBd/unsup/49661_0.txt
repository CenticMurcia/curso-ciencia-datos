i thought this was a truly awful film . Nothing in it made any sense , even by horror movie standards.The premise wasn't too bad but it just fell to pieces after the first 5 minutes its an Australian movie and the male actors have Australian accents but the women have these terrible fake American accents and one of the womens accent is so appalling i have no idea what country she is supposed to be from . the ending made even less , i presume it was to set it up for a sequel but there is no way this dog of a film would get the funding for a sequel . i was surprised it got the funding at all sense than the rest of the movie. after watching this movie i tried to find a way to get in touch with the director to sling some abuse , no other movie has driven me to that point before don't watch it unless your video store has a ' didn't like it? get your money back ' policy
