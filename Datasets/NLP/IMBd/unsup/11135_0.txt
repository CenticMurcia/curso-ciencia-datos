I love film. I am not a sucker for cheap, TV Disney movies. I was pleasantly surprised. I am a 14-year old boy, and I didn't like this movie. I loved it! The acting by young Lindsay Lohan as the emotionally disconnected tomboy dealing with loss was really good.<br /><br />I also find most of these types of movies to be shallow, to only speak to a young audience and to patronize (all copies of Get a Clue should be destroyed.) This movie is more than that. The moment I saw the opening scene I realized that I could picture the dialogue being spoken in real life by real adults. It was more honest than most other movies, and it had humor and heart that most movies of this budget and genre don't. Some of the attempts at humor fell flat, but a lot of it was actually...funny.<br /><br />When Eve (Tyra Banks) is turned from a doll to a human being, she thinks she's the best at everything. She is then reminded, however, that the goal is to try your best, not to be the best, and that you can still be a role model and not be perfect. Eve also brings a little wisdom with her when she shows the people around her that life is about happiness and sweetness and simplicity, and that when adults get caught up in petty disagreements and entangled in their "demanding" lives, they are only doing it to themselves. Life is too short not to be happy and not to sweat the small stuff and to savor the moment.<br /><br />This is just what I took out of this movie. Everyone has their own interpretation depending on where they are in their lives, and I think this was the right time to see this movie. <br /><br />Don't skip this one!<br /><br />7/10
