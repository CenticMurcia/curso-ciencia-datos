I had never heard of this movie, but it appeared on cable and when I saw the cast, I figured "how bad could it be?". I thought it was terrific. Nothing of great dramatic or historical significance, of course, but who cares? Denzel is his usual infinitely watchable self, Val Kilmer is quirky with yet another interesting dialect and Adam Goldberg is fantastic. All three are smooth, assured and entertaining. A lot of posters and reviewers talked about how "unbelievable" the science fiction aspect of the plot was, but that never bothers me. Once I figure out what I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief about, I just do so and enjoy what the filmmakers are doing. I actually found this particular sci-fi plot quite intriguing and really liked having to try to follow its twists and turns through the action.<br /><br />As has been said before, this is definitely a Sci Fi/ Film Noir/Action/Romance. How many of those have you come across? Highly recommended. Big fun and smart besides.
