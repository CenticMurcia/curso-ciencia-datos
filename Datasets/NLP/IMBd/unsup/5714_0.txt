Tex Avery spoof of the movie the Jazz Singer. (The main character's name is Owl Jolson). Four owls are born to a music conductor. 3 show promise of operatic/symphonic greatness, but the fourth wants to sing jazz. Dad kicks him out so he decides to go audition on the radio. Enjoyable. Rating, out of cartoons, 9 out of 10.
