To be honest I cannot elaborate on this one, as I only saw the first half hour of the movie. Com√©dia de Deus for me is the only movie that I ever ran away from, after some short debating with my two companions, leaving the other two spectators the cinema to themselves (I still sometimes wonder whether they managed to sit it out). The first half hour (fair is fair) is the most bewildering piece of fiction I ever saw, combining the utter idiocy of, say, the Police Academy series with the astounding 'la-di-dah, oh, what great art I'm making'-attitude of films as "Ulysses's Gaze".<br /><br />Worst first half hour ever, but hey, maybe the rest was good. Go check yourself, though, because I've seen the last of this one.
