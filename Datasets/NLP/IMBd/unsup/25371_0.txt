Considering that I love sci-fi and horror films from the 1950s, it is very surprising that I rate this film as low as I do. It just happens that of a string of these type movies had by Universal, this is about the dullest one.<br /><br />I group of scientists are exploring when they stumble upon a huge crack that leads to underground caverns. When they descend into them, they are captured by the subterranean people. Because they have lived under ground since ancient times and are look much like albinos, as it turns out their civilization was swallowed into the earth along with them.<br /><br />At first, everything seems just peachy, but later these underground people turn out to be major jerks who keep incredibly ugly creatures as slaves. They beat the poor mole-like things and when the scientist complain, the ancient dudes attack. However, the above ground people assist the mole people to fight back against their evil overlords and they return back to the surface.<br /><br />Aside from a less than inspiring script with few things to scare you, the acting and direction are pretty dull as well. It is amazing that a film called MOLE PEOPLE could be as static and uninteresting as this one was.
