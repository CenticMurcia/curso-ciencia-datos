If you enjoy "B" movies with "C" attitude then this movie is for you. While the plot is OK, it is predictable. The writing loosely reminds me of Kevin Smith's style. I am by no means comparing Kevin Smith to these writers so don't get your hopes up. The special effects are limited. This movie was done on a budget and it shows. The DVD box compares this movie to Shaun of the Dead. I don't think so. There are some funny parts though. Despite all of this movie's shortcomings, I did like it. This movie compares to "Children of the Dead" for so many reasons. I don't regret renting this move. IF you enjoy low budget horror films, give this one a try. It is a lot better than a lot of films I have rented.
