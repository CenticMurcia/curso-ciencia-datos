As a long-standing WC fan, I suppose I have a little bias here, but story has always been the largest draw in a game to me. The fact that Chris Roberts and company decided to use live actors IN 1993 shows that they care about story and wanted to make it interesting to watch as well as to play. The actors themselves are no slouches when it comes to acting, and have been in several top-of-the-line feature films.<br /><br />Granted, the plot is a familiar one, but when coupled with the WC plot as a whole, it takes on a whole new meaning, and real actors are just what was needed to bring that out.<br /><br />The spaceflight is top-notch... for 1994. Don't expect to see anything even close to today's 3D accelerated colorfests, but do expect to be entertained and challenged.<br /><br />Entertainment is, after all, what we're after here, isn't it?
