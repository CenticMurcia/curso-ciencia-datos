I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is a good example of what is wrong with many new movies today. First, the plot is seriously screwed up. The entire movie is totally unbelievable and abysmal-tastic. (A trip to the Bahamas? Uhhh...) I really wonder about who-the-hell-ever wrote the script. The only thing the movie actually succeeded in doing was showing off Jennifer Love Hewitt's body. This dumb attempt to sell the film quickly becomes stupid and laughably pitiful-licious. The movie's ending was drivel and did *nothing* to explain what had been going on, not to mention how the evil fisherman (ahem) keeps coming back. They could have used the best actors in the world (which they certainly did not), and the "story" still would have dragged this down. So, to sum it up: the acting is beyond stupid, the plot is terrible, and the entire movie is, all-in-all, quite absurd. There are many things that could have been done better, but weren't. I Still Know screams "not good enough." Rent it if you want a few laughs, but personally I pity anyone who could take this seriously. Like they say, "been there, done that." And who in the hell think "Ben Willis - the lamest and most insane horror villain to come along in decades!" - ah, forget it!
