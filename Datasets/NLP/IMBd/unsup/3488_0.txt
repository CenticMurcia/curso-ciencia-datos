Reign of Fire *could* have been an excellent movie, but as it stands, it's only decent.<br /><br />What we have here? An excellent, not quite often seen premise and overall not that bad idea, and excellent special effects to supplement that. And then they slap a boring, ordinary plot and bad logic on top of that. Oh dear.<br /><br />The plot definitely could have been better - it really doesn't take that much brainwork to guess the ending. It starts nicely enough, no problem with that, but once the Great Plan to Rescue Everybody starts... sheesh. the latter half of the movie is very very ordinary. In the beginning, the transition to the opening to the main plot is rather sketchy and is probably the most potential-wasting part after the ending. Then there were some things about ecology and biology that didn't make too much sense. And Americans who didn't make whole lot of sense either, of course.<br /><br />But even after all this stuff, I *still* thought the movie was neat enough. The movie was, even with its ordinary plot, surprisingly watchable. The bad parts didn't annoy me, they sometimes managed to amuse, which is always a good sign in my book... The setting is still fairly interesting.<br /><br />If you're not expecting a great movie, it's definitely a good way to waste one and half hours. If you're expecting the sci-fi movie of the century, stay *far* away.<br /><br />Wasn't sure whether this was 7/10 or 8/10. Settled for 7.5 and rounded that up just because I like dragon movies in general.
