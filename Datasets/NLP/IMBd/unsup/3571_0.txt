This is the story of a perfume counter saleswoman who puts a Christmas List in Santa's mailbox at the store she works in. Her wishes begin to come true, but they all have a slight twist to them when they do. This is a movie that manages to intertwine Christmas, fantasy, romance, and realism. Mimi Rogers does a superb job in the role she plays. This movie even throws in the "guy gets the girl and they live happily ever after" at the end for us hopeless romantics. Wish it was out on video or DVD, I would love to have a copy of it to keep with all the other Christmas Classics.
