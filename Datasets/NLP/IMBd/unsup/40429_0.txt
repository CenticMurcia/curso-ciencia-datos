I have to agree with other comments that list this show as cruel and ridiculous. I've seen them dress people that live in Miami beach in the same wool clothes that someone in nyc would wear. They are not conscious of climate differences or different styles for different cities. They impose the nyc style on everyone that is forced into the show. I'm sure it's good drama, but how useful is a wool skirt in Miami on a 20 year old club kid? Fashion is not about what you wear to the office every day but utilizing a personal style and self expression. I'd love to remake their wardrobes and mock them. I'm so sick of her pointy toed shoes. It's absolutely ridiculous and suppose someone isn't working in a corporate clone setting, this makes their fashion rules silly and obsolete. I'd like to see an actual fashion designer and someone with a demographic and climatic sense dress these people. Palm Springs, Miami, LA, Charleston, SC would not be wearing nyc fashion. It makes no sense. Clinton isn't as rude as Stacy but these two twits are annoying and ridiculous. It makes me nuts to see the show.
