This is the best caper film since "Topkapi". It's smart as a whip, has a great cast, and never takes itself too seriously. I had a great time watching great actors like Redford, Poitier, Ben Kingsley, etc., just enjoying being in a great popcorn movie. There's deeper meanings in it, if you want them, or you can just sit back and let "Sneakers" take you for a great ride. It's a really, really good movie.
