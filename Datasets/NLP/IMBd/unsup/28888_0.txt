Very original format. Wasted no time in moving with the flow of real moving story. Not predictable at all. Got hooked watching TV and was surprised. Back to basics movie; touches the soul.<br /><br />I was surprised to not have heard of Irene Dunne. Beautiful actress who played this part with natural skill. Cary Grant was also very convincing.
