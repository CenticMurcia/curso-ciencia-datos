So, when you hear that Trey Parker of South Park fame wrote, directed and starred in a comedy set in the world of porn you had to think this would be a movie that had the potential to be excruciatingly bad. Then as you watch it you may be pleasantly surprised for the first half hour or so and think this isn't so bad. But then as the movie drags on you'll find yourself thinking that, yeah, this is pretty bad after all. But it could have been worse.<br /><br />Plot really is not important here as the movie's only goal is to make you laugh, which it manages to do only sporadically. Anyhow the plot such as it is, features Parker as devout Mormon missionary Joe Young, who through a series of unlikely occurrences finds himself starring as "superhero" Orgazmo in the most successful porn film of all time. Orgazmo, whose weapon immobilizes enemies by giving them orgasms, has a sidekick, Choda Boy, who runs around with a dildo attached to his head. Yes, the cheese factor in this movie is off the charts. And while some of this cheese is initially good for a laugh eventually it all wears very thin. Maybe the porn world is just too bizarre but the whole thing comes off as incredibly awkward and forced. They're trying too hard to be funny and they're not succeeding. Matters are not helped by some less than stellar acting, most notably from Parker who as a live action actor...well, let's just say he's really good in his cartoon. Here, not so much. The rest of the cast is not much better. When Ron Jeremy gives the most convincing performance in your movie you've got problems. And yes, this movie has problems. All in all, it's pretty bad but you get the feeling it could have been a lot worse.
