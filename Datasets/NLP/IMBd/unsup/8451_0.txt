To describe my relation to Hook in just a few words: A fantastic movie, even though I've never been fascinated by the Peter Pan stories. I'm 19 years old and I saw this movie eleven years ago (1992) and I still love it after over a dozen viewings. The story, the way it looks, the characters (especially how they've developed since the "main" Pan story), the feeling. In my opinion, "Hook" is a competent fairytale, not to mention VERY well done! In my top ten.
