This arrived at my house through Blockbuster, although I never remember choosing the title.<br /><br />"What the heck? I'll give it a try," I thought. I like b-movies, horror films and most anything by independent production companies. First of all, the movie was completely disjointed and flowed like a stopped-up septic tank. The acting was trifling, which is OK most of the time, but it made no sense. I wish there was something I could defend about the film, but I had to turn it off 30 minutes or so into it.<br /><br />The subject matter didn't bother me in the least and I can certainly appreciate inventiveness and shock value when done well. The crappy, bald skull caps with zit attachments were actually a distraction. Of course defenders of this film will say "You just don't get it" or "You couldn't do any better." To the "I couldn't do any better" crowd they're probably right, but I don't have to. I'm not a filmmaker, nor do I pass myself off as one.<br /><br />For those who enjoyed it, I'm glad they could find some value in "Acne" that I couldn't, after all diversity is what makes the world go 'round.
