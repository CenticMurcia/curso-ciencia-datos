Eric Stoltz does well in this role as Rocky Dennis, a high school boy with incurable neuro-fibromatosis.<br /><br />Cher as his mother, and Estelle Getty and Richard Dysart as her long-suffering parents; she is a rebel/Hell's Angel (apparently this was also true) and fights an uphill battle to give Rocky some kind of life while he still has the chance.<br /><br />While it requires some suspension of disbelief, I think people may not have liked this movie because it makes them uncomfortable. It was difficult to watch when it first came out. Laura Dern also has a good role as Rocky's friend. There are some good scenes between her and Stoltz. Also some scenes where he is with his dog (I admit I am partial to animals!).<br /><br />This is a good story because it is based on truth, and Stoltz does a good job of creating a sympathetic, moving character. 8/10.
