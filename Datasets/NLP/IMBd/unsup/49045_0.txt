I had to give this film a star rating. I wish I could give it none.<br /><br />It was so painful to watch. I bought it on DVD since I last saw it when I was a kid and I thought that it could make me laugh. Oh how wrong I was...It was a waste of Â£4...Which I could have bought a much better movie for.<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen is the only good part about this, oh and Griffith. Nielsen hasn't been in any descent stuff recently though. I want that to change though since hes outstanding and very underrated. Lets hope someone realises this before he ends up like Lloyd Bridges...He too was a great actor who was reduced to being letter-boxed as a slapstick comedian-actor.<br /><br />I strongly urge against buying this unless you have a defect which allows you to enjoy such trash.
