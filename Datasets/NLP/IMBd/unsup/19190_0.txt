Dashing Douglas Fairbanks (as Don Cesar de Vega) is the son of the legendary "Zorro", in this spectacular sequel to Mr. Fairbanks' own "The Mark of Zorro" (1920) *********. The younger Fairbanks has been sent to Spain, where he cracks his whip, and soaks up local color. There, he falls in love with pretty Mary Astor (as Dolores de Muro); watch out for the great introduction to Ms. Astor's character, as Fairbanks places wings on her silhouette. You know trouble is brewing when dastardly rival Donald Crisp (as Don Sebastian) is spurned by "belle of the Archduke's ball" Astor. In a fit of anger, Mr. Crisp assassinates Archduke Paul (as Warner Oland), and frames Fairbanks for the killing. Then, Fairbanks fakes his own suicide, and sets out to prove his innocence; eventually, he receives help from father "Zorro" (Fairbanks, in a dual role).<br /><br />"Don Q, Son of Zorro" is a tremendous sequel, from Fairbanks and company, who wisely viewed follow-ups as a chance to equal, or improve upon, earlier hits. Not surprisingly, it lacks the spontaneity of the earlier film, and it is, perhaps, a little too long. However, the overall production is superior, and the storyline refreshingly unique; as "Don Q", and his story, are quite different than the original "Zorro". Crisp is very helpful, as both villain and director. And, Henry Sharp's photography is top notch.<br /><br />The cast is terrific: alongside the aforementioned, you have Fairbanks regular Charles Stevens (as Robledo) in one of his more showy roles, otherwise humanitarian Jean Hersholt (as Don Fabrique) playing Crisp's blackmailing nemesis, famous sibling Lottie Pickford (as Lola), and Albert MacQuarrie (as Colonel Matsado) gets to ask Fairbanks: "Who the hell are you?"
