When i watched 'The Prince of Egypt' in the theatre, i was godsmacked by the amazing graphics. Dreamworks has made a movie, a cartoon admittedly, but this movie couldn't be made if it weren't a cartoon. This way the movie has no borders or boundries.. and the story is exploited to the fullest.<br /><br />The story reminded me a bit of the Lion King, the cartoon by Disney two years earlier .. also it was about a (sort of) king-to-be which goes away to another place, only to return to the hometown sometime later with a lot of vengeance towards a lot of people. This story is straight from the bible, and what book holds more amazing and involving stories as this ancient book. And this movie is all that. Even believing people, who swear by the bible found the movie excellent.<br /><br />'The Prince of Egypt' is a romantic drama, which draws you in and won't let you go... I described this movie as the best movie i saw in '97, maybe it's a little overrated, but that's how i felt walking out of the movie theatre. Almost whole of hollywood does a voice (Sandra Bullock, Val Kilmer etc.) and with the helping hand of Mr. Spielberg himself, this is a masterpiece not to miss !!!!
