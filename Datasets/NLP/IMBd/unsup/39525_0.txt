Avalanche, Buried Alive, Days of Destruction, Magma, War of the Planets, Volcano in New York, etc, etc, etc. Now this one.<br /><br />My boss loves his b-horrors and especially his b-sci-fi movies. This movie is pretty much the sane as The Day after Tomorrow but even more predictable (and worst effects). The acting wasn't very good but not the worst and just led to the typical plot: Save the world! Now you sci-fi fans might want to see this but seriously, you might want to skip this. This is another typical sci-fi. Seriously there really isn't much point watching this. I know what your thinking. It can't be that bad. The special effects are cheesy. Go try something different and watch Hard Candy or Stay instead. If they don't appeal to you than go back to your Sci-fi's.
