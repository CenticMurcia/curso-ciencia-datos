When i rented this movie, I thought I was in for a classic and memorable horror experience. I mean, everybody's heard of this movie, right, so it would have to be sort of good. WRONG! This movie was so bad it wasn't even laughably bad. When it was supposed to be scary, it wasn't. When it was supposed to be funny, it wasn't. The whole movie is pretty much just a site gag ("Ha Ha! Look at the midget run!") with some sort of poor excuse for a plot. Oompa Loopas are funnier and scarier. Also, it has one of those feel good endings that really makes me hate 90s horror. This movie failed miserably.
