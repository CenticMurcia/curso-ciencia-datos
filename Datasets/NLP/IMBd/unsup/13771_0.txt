Vigilante thriller its not, like the synopsis reads and the front of the video case might suggest with the imageryÂ… though the scene does occur. "Boardwalk" is a well-intended (despite the racial flare and direct moralizing) and at times moving feature thanks hugely by the exceptional performances of seasoned actors Lee Strasberg and Ruth Gordon. The two were simply charming whenever together. Watching the once happy elderly couple, now battling family issues/ health problems (which is the main drama driving the story where there are numerously scattered human interest subplots), but also the changing neighbourhood of Coney Island as young jive talking hoons run wild (which populates mainly the beginning and ending but still feels secondary) is engagingly passionate in its ups and downs. The heartache only grows, where it comes away with a swelteringly damaging climax and the closing shot is particularly haunting in its forced predicament. The suspense is only minor, but it's always compelling. The evocative script is thoughtfully laid out in its exploration of the effects / shake down these central characters find themselves in, as they're stripped to the bone and demoralized, living in a community filled with fear, but still they won't back down and succumb to the turmoil (be it the gangs or their dwindling business). Its love, survival and violence rolled into one. Amongst the sombre air, is still quite a sunny vibe of hope led by the acting. In support roles are agreeable turns by Janet Leigh, Joe Silver, Eddie Barth, Merwin Goldsmith and Kim Delgado. The authentic location work helps cement a realistic edge, while the pacing is rather measured and rather low-scale in its escalating confrontations and violence (which is tamely staged, but gut wrenching since you're thrown right into the acts).
