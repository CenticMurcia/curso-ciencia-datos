Yes, it ignores most of Europe and the rest of the worlds contributions, but for what it is, it's just lovely.<br /><br />It's an introduction to the art of cinematography in American movies, with clips and comments from the greats about American film from birth till 1990 or so, when it was made. Some of the cinematographers are humble and self-effacing, some clearly have large egos, but they all obviously love and care deeply about film and film making.<br /><br />This is a terrific film to show your children, a behind the scenes that is informative rather than salacious or snarky.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
