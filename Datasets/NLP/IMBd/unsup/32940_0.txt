I am Australian, I'll just clear that up first. But I have to say the majority of Australian films are terrible and this is one of them. (spoilers ahead - so if you are crazy and want to see this movie, don't read on).<br /><br />Three words: I hated it. This movie dragged and nothing really happened. The only thing it had going for it was the scenery. There had to be a lot of scenery because there was no script and no real plot. But this is the plot I could put together: Japanese businessman comes to Australia, for some reason that noone knows and we never find out. He gets taken into the desert by an Australian geologist, and she also has no idea who this guy is or what he's doing here. They end up sleeping together and this apparently makes him a better husband to his wife at home...hmmm, I don't understand that one. Then he dies so she takes the dead body across the desert in the back of her 4WD until she can find a morgue. The last half hour or so of the movie is Toni Collette crying. She has nothing else to do because there is no script. It's not really her fault. She did the best she could with what she was given. The scene where she was trying unsuccessfully to put the guy's dead body in the back of the car bordered on comical. <br /><br />My adivse, give it a miss. I don't know how anyone could like it.
