Great comedy.<br /><br />Without being clich√© like "scary movie" which the motto is to lampoon other movies features all the time!!! Also what I found interesting is the comic way the movie speaks about love.There was also a David (Jerry O'Connell)'s quote that called my attention which is something like this: "The worst thing is not to live a life time alone expecting the write woman to marry, but marry the wrong woman and spend the rest of your life with her" Almost every woman in this movie is gorgeous, so if one of them feel curious to know me just contact me by my e-mail. Eventually it is an a good and funny romantic comedy to enjoy.
