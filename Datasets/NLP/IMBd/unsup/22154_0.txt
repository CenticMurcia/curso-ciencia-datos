Yes, we love our football way down in Alabama, and this movie does a decent job of showing that. It's about a high school football team in Alabama, and if you're actually from the South, you might enjoy it a little more than if you're not. It's kind of like being from New York might help you enjoy "Sex and the City" than if you're not.<br /><br />There are tons of University of Alabama references, so if you just can't stand the mighty Crimson Tide, you might want to skip this one. The football coach quotes "Bear" Bryant, and the team wears crimson jerseys. Also, the winner of a big scholarship that the high school gives always uses it to attend Alabama.<br /><br />"Legend" also has a strong Christian theme, but it's not overbearing. It's not like it's trying to convert you -- instead, it's just part of the movie, just like Christianity is a part of Southern towns.<br /><br />Maybe my only minor nitpick is that the Southern accents don't ring true for every character in the movie. Some of the actors sound like they're trying hard to sound like they're from Alabama. Lacey Chabert's accent sounds true, but then again she's originally from Purvis, Miss. However, I'm from the South, so the accents stand out to me. If you're not Southern, you probably won't even notice or care about them.
