Honest to God, halfway through B.E. I thought, "This director has watched too many John Cass. movies." I did not know his daughter directed it until I looked at the box. Lots of scenes with only one or two people on screen does not necessarily make drama. Nora was annoying, not sympathetic,and did not make an ideal victim. You don't get a Purple Heart for self-inflicted wounds. Was that supposed to be an arty ending? I was just glad it was over. On a positive note, I gotta give Zoe C. credit for doing something that was arguably a little risky, although it seemed tailored for film-fest crowd. I went out with a woman like Nora a few times, until I realized she was boring and an emotional black hole. <br /><br />In B.E.II, he dumps her after 2 weeks and swears never to go out with an American woman again.
