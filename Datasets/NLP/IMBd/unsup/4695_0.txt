I remember going to the cinema to watch 'Grease',while 'Gregorys Girl 'was the support. What an anti climax when 'grease' came on while my mind kept flashing back to the wonderful ,previous film i had watched before.<br /><br />Must of watched the film a million and nine times since and never tire from watching what was the sweetest ,funniest and atmospheric film with the greatest soundtrack ever. I loved the end to the film and whenever i had a date with a girl in the eighties and nineties my mind would flashback to a certain clock tower, a white jacket (without the stain),a beret,whistling, horizontal dancing and kissing with numbers.Unfortunately my dates would never hit the heights of Gregorys date but if i was fortunate to get the girl home then without fail the Gregorys video would be shown to what would normally work in my favour. Bella Bella !
