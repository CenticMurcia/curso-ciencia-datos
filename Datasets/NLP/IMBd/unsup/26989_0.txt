Wow. I really don't like this show at all. Letterman is funny once or twice and that band leader is ugly and annoying. Leno is much better and tonight I just swapped to see how stupid this show was and I know its a joke and all, but he made fun of president Gerald Ford's death. That was very mean and very unnecessary. Letterman should not be making fun of someone else's death for his show. I don't see Leno doing that. Also, that band leader, whatever his name is, my god so annoying. I can not stand him nor him and his band singing. It sounds like a whole bunch of cats fighting. They really should not sing every title, it is very irritating. Well, my final rating. 3/10
