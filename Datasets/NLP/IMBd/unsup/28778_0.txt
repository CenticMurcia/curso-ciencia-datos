Arrogant and despicable sleazeball control freak fetish photographer Roger Neale (a nicely slimy portrayal by Joseph Farrell), his perky assistant Maura Holloway (the delightfully spunky Rachael Robbins), amiable, morally uptight lug Sam Rogan (likable Rob Monkiewicz), and three beautiful models -- sweet, naive Bridget (the always adorable Misty Mundae), vacuous Lauren (blonde looker Heidi Kristoffer), and meek Jennifer (fetching brunette C.J. DiMarsico) -- go to a rundown and abandoned old building for a photo shoot. Of course, said building turns out to be haunted by vicious and depraved sadist Rossiter (a deliciously hammy turn by Kevin G. Shinnick). While the premise certainly has promise, alas said promise is severely undermined by writer/director Brett Piper's lackluster execution: the sluggish pace crawls along for the first two thirds of the picture, there's no spooky atmosphere to speak of, the special effects are strictly so-so, and the drab and uneventful script gets bogged down in a dull surplus of insipid talk. Only when Rossiter gets revived in the last third and begins brutally torturing the ladies does this flick finally start cooking, but by then it's too little too late to alleviate the general tedium. The cast do their best with the blah material, both Jon Greathouse's moody score and M.A. Morales' polished cinematography are up to speed, and there's a decent smattering of yummy female nudity (Misty in particular as usual looks quite scrumptious in her birthday suit), but overall this movie is too poky and plodding. A merely passable time-waster.
