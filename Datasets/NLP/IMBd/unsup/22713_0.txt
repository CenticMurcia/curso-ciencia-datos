First, a little rant. Nowadays most stand-up comedians need material that's recent, hot topics, to keep their shows funny. But poking fun at stuff like presidents, politics, Hollywood, etc... is easy. Just mention the words "dumb", "sex", "ugly" and the occasional curse word, and you'll get some cheap laughs. But you're not ready for a timeless classic yet.<br /><br />But, and now for the review part, poking fun at stuff that happens to everyone every day, or stuff that is so simple, you can't almost imagine how to make it funny, that is another trick. A trick the great Richard Pryor, God rest his soul, can pull off with incredible ease. Ever wondered how funny dogs can be? Pryor knows the answer! And thus he delivered a show that is as funny now as it was years ago. Also it has clearly been an inspiration for many, many, many modern stand-up comedians. You can see his influence in live-performances from Eddy Murphy to Robin Williams. And you want to know why? Because he was just that good.<br /><br />Yes, he curses a lot. Yes, he's controversial at times. But if you're easily offended, you're probably not quite the type for this kind of comedy. If you're not easily offended, and want to see perhaps one of the best performances in stand-up comedy ever... See this, you won't regret it!
