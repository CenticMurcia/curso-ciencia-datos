It is American myth that "Apocalypse Now" drove Francis Coppola to the brink of insanity (see "Hearts of Darkness") and he has never been the same. One From the Heart was made following his Boy Gang trilogy, which has also confused many as to "why?" the creator of the Godfather saga would go so far afield.<br /><br />Creative masters simply are different. Sometimes their egos and force of will create incredible works of art which also manage to achieve commercial success and mass appeal. Often times their works succeed as art, but fail at the box office.<br /><br />One From the Heart is homage to the lavish musicals of the 30's, and an expression of Coppola's love of Theater. The sets and effects are beautiful on a large screen. The craft and technical skill is apparent in each shot and throughout the film. Terri Garr and Frederic Forrest are the "everyman" antithesis of Astaire and Rogers. The mix of simplicity and grandeur is not for everyone.<br /><br />I loved the movie. I also understand why most do not. Viewers go to a lavish musical to escape and be entertained. Coppola wants one to view the movie and appreciate his vision and his life, and perhaps experience some of his romantic notions of times gone by. Most people do not want to spend money and opportunity for such notions.
