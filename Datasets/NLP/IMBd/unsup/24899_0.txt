It's always "hit or miss" with old public domain cheapies from studios like Monogram and PRC. This miss had my name on it because madman George Zucco and Last Universal Frankenstein Monster Glenn Strange were featured in its cast.<br /><br />Zucco is the proprietor of a creaky little inn (both he and the Inn are called THE BLACK RAVEN) and during the course of an hour's viewing time he plays host to an assorted group of unusual guests. It's a stormy night in town with thunder crashing and rain flooding the roads, and on top of that the bridge is out. Among the waterlogged patrons seeking shelter are: a formerly wronged business partner of Zucco's who'd like to kill him, a geeky embezzler looking to get away with $50,000 stolen loot, a gangster who's also interested in said loot, a young couple looking to get married behind the back of the girl's objecting old father, and dad himself - who's also hot on their trail.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is that nothing terribly exciting happens despite the effort to make this some sort of mystery. Aside from a little mood, the only things going on here of passing interest are some slapstick (Glenn Strange plays an imbecile who falls down the stairs; the young girl's angry father slaps her would-be bridegroom across his face) and some humorous dialogue (a favorite is Zucco's scolding of Strange: "With your imagination, you could see the Statue of Liberty do the conga!"). <br /><br />In case you couldn't tell by now, this is not a horror film. So you're best going elsewhere if that's what you're looking for. I already knew this going in but it still didn't help.
