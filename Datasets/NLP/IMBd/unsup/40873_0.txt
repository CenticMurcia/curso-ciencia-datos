In fact, counting holes in the ceiling would be healthier for your brain cells than this. The ceiling's holes would show more creativity and humor than the script of this film, and they would act better than the people in it, too. I'd compare this thing to the foul smell of a rotten egg, but it's worse than that. The talentless Friedberg & Seltzer are back from their Date Movie debacle with more trashy, unfunny "spoofs". For example, a bullet bounced off of Superman's eye in his movie; now, the bullet pokes his eye out. Gee is that original and hilarious or what? Not a single joke works, and the only surprise of this movie is that these two hacks keep getting funding to produce flop after flop. <br /><br />This is just so painfully bad. If you ever find a lost DVD of this movie somewhere, leave it there. It's not worth the effort to pick it up.
