This is a terribly lame (and very late) attempt to cash in on The Blair Witch Project. Two wanna-be film makers want to send four "actors" into a supposedly haunted house armed with flashlights and camcorders so they can put together a Blair Witch-like movie.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to the actors (but suspected), the film makers have the house rigged with bad special effects and hidden cameras to capture the mortal terror they are sure to suffer. Unbeknownst to the film makers and the actors, the house is really haunted by the ghost some unknown man who was apparently murdered in the house in 1888. Painfully known to anyone who has watched this film is that there are no scares, no chills, and laughable special effects.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing in this film that hasn't been done before (and done better) which leaves the gratuitous two seconds of nudity as the best part of the film. And those two seconds are certainly not worth the rental fee or the waste of 88 minutes of your life!<br /><br />Bottom line: bad plot + bad acting + no scares = BAD MOVIE
