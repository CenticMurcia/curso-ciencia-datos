I will make a confession to start off with-: I haven't read any of the books, and I really would like to. Putting that aside, The Darling Buds of May is a perfect piece of escapism for a weekend evening. It is endearing. It is funny. And it is easy to like. I see it with my grandmother and she loves it too. Here, there is something for everybody of all ages, humour, charm, fun and maybe even nostalgia.<br /><br />One definite plus is how the show is filmed. The camera work is so fluid and beautiful, and the lighting so bright and perfect. Those images of the English countryside gives a real sense of warmth and endearment to the proceedings, and the scenery in general is breath taking. The main theme is memorable and relaxing to the ears, and the accompanying themes are just as delightful for anybody who watches.<br /><br />The humour in Darling Buds of May is just right. It is never overdone or underplayed-it is just right, and doesn't spoil the show's appeal at all. And the Larkin family! Where do I start? What wonderful, completely likable characters. While not wealthy, they are happy together and supportive of one another and that was a true delight to see. I will admit, I really wanted to be part of the Larkin family.<br /><br />It isn't just the quality of the script that makes the show so much fun. It is also some truly priceless scenes like the cat fight at the strawberry picking and any other situation that the Larkins get into. They live in abandonment and are disregarded by society, yet all of them are such lovable characters, and some of the run ins with the secondary characters are just hilarious.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional from all involved. I am a big fan of David Jason, who has proved himself a talented, funny and versatile actor. He is a sheer delight here as Pop, a character that makes a dull day enormously satisfying just like that. I love Pam Ferris too, and she gives yet another strong performance as Ma. Then you have Welsh beauty Catherine Zeta Jones at her loveliest, and Phillip Franks as Charlie, whose conversion is taken with unusual care and precision.<br /><br />Overall, at 17 I adore the Darling Buds of May. It is perfect for anybody. It is so easy to like, and really relaxing to watch, as well as richly detailing post-war Britain. This is in no way a criticism, but if anything I do wish the show lasted longer. It is perfect entertainment for a dull day or a free weekend evening. Nothing else really to say, other than a must-watch! 10/10 Bethany Cox
