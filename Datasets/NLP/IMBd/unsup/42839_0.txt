During some sort of witchcraft party, a group of young adults all decide to have a s√©ance. They summon the witch using a chant they found in some book, but it seems like nothing happens. But something did happen. The main character is possessed by the witch and goes on a murderous killing spree! Of course, since this was a low-budget film made in the early seventies, all the lines are incredibly cheesy and bad. Lines like "I like girls dumb, but you're pushing it!" and stupid things of that nature are said.<br /><br />I saw this movie because the guy that played Harry was my drama teacher.
