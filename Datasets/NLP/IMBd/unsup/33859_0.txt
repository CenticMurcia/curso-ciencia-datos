We're deep into student film territory with this one. After an apocalypse in which the world just kinda runs right out of oil (yes, you read that right) a group of college students with names culled from the faculty parking lot are besieged by a handful of extras left over from The Road Warrior.<br /><br />The students are lead by a slumming Robert Carridine, and Rider Strong is back from his Mexican spring break adventures in Borderland. Among the cannibals are Michael Madsen and Vinnie Jones, both playing characters who can be out witted by a 12 year old child.<br /><br />This film does for peak oil what The Day After Tomorrow did for climate change - set the cause back about ten years. I'm not sure I want to live in a world where everyone above the Mason-Dixon has moved to Tallahasse. In fact, I'm sure I don't.
