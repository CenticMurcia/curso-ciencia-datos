Wow! Chow Yun Fat IS the man when it comes to action and the director, John Woo, when combined with Chow Yun Fat makes a perfect movie. Starting with a spectacular shoot-out at the beginning, Chow Yun Fat loses his best friend and partner and seeks revenge on the group responsible. His boss doesn't like him, his girlfriend gives the same impression but all he really needs is a gun...or ten!!! The shoot-outs are amazing and the camera angles are just dazzling. The car storage scene where cameras are placed in the cars and characters dive through cars as bullets shred the seats inches behind them is just simply amazing to watch. The final scene is filled with enough firepower to put Die Hard to shame!!! If you love action and don't want martial arts in it, try this film because it is the most stylish, gun crazy film around and I haven't seen a film which comes close to it yet.
