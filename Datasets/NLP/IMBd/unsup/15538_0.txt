Being a long time fan of all which is remotely related to the comic book genre, i feel this has the potential to be as good as Smallville (which in my opinion is one of the best shows on TV today). Justin Hartley makes a good Aquaman much better than the smallville actor, the show has suspense, excitement and has the appeal which makes a viewer want to keep watching time and time again, i would be greatly disappointed if CW or any other television company did not pick it up. It should be and hopefully CW will realise the attention just 1 episode is getting and air it. I think it was a good move from Apple to be able to download this from i- tunes, this grabs peoples attention. Another reason why i would like to see Aquaman on TV is because i don't know how much more they will be able to do with Smallville.
