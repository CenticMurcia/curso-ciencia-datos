The Fail Safe 2000 version simply does not match the 1964 film masterpiece's acting or drama.<br /><br />I'm an USAF veteran who worked with the real Fail Safe system (not the correct name by the way) and the 1964 version rang all too true to me.<br /><br />Henry Fonda's acting was right on target, so to speak, and brought back some memories of a very tense time in world history.<br /><br />The 2000 version just seemed like a half-hearted remake without the compelling drama and performances of the 1964 original film.<br /><br />Food for thought: The USAF command and control authority kept the largest arsenal of weapons in the history of mankind under perfect control for decades--without a glitch--until it was no longer needed after the Soviet Union's collapse. The movie dramatized the effects of accidental --or deliberate--use of nuclear weapons which is commendable. It is not a topic to be taken lightly.
