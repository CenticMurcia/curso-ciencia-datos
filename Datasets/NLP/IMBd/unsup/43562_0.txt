Sadly, this film is a laugh-less failure (minus the very funny Will Ferrell cameo). When I went to see it the theatre was packed (Edwards in San Diego) but the complete lack of laughs and numerous groans from the crowd led to numerous couples walking out on the film. I admit to staying till the end but left the theatre wishing I had rented the hilarious "Zoolander" or the frenetic "Old School" instead. I was extremely disappointed, what a waste of the talent onboard. Many of the skits were taken from other movies ("Zoolander", "Envy", etc). Shame on Warner Brothers and Dimension for giving away all the good laughs and sequences in the trailer and commercials. A D+ is the final grade, and that is being charitable in every capacity possible.
