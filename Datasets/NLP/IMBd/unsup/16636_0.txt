How disappointing. "My Blue Heaven" is incredibly slow-paced and involves very little actual humor. I'm afraid much of the blame must go to Rick Moranis and Joan Cusack, who instead of playing "the straight man" sort of plays goofy unbelievable characters in the straight man role. That's a conflict. The romance I didn't buy at all, the humor comes straight out of kid flicks.<br /><br />I'm not an arty guy. I don't need a whole lotta humor or drama to keep me happy. I mean, I could bear "Sgt. Bilko" and actually enjoyed "All of Me", other Steve Martin flicks on the bad side. But this is not a low-budget film with some pizazz and cult appeal. Skip it.<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- nobody, even if you might think you want to, even on a rainy day<br /><br />-- mobsters in the witness protection program who can't repent<br /><br />I'm forced to give "My Blue Heaven" a 4 out of 10.
