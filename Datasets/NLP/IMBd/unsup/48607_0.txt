I didn't like it at all, it seemed pointless and silly to me. Just having those two random musical numbers seemed daft rather than stylish. That "Cole Porter" song was horrible.<br /><br />The subplot about the strange murder game just petered out, it didn't make any sense to me at all. There was also an strange moment when Nino and Louise suddenly were great pals, walking down the street arm in arm, having only met vaguely before that.<br /><br />It could have been intriguing and fun, but I thought it was fake whimsical and boring.<br /><br />It was the only thing with English subtitles here in Vientiane, but I wish I hadn't bothered.
