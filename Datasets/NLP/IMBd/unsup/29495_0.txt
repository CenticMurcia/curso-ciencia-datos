The for-pay movie critics raved about "The Age of Innocence" often granting it their highest ratings. Gushing about the color, soundtrack, nuanced screenplay and understated acting, this was for many the best of 1993, a coup de grace for Mr. Scorsese. Maybe so. Sure, the colors, and their uses were brilliant and clever. The soundtrack and score were very good, likewise the acting. But the pacing of the movie was too slow. I'm told that the movie transports you to 1870s upper class New York. It's just like you were there. So what. The point of movies is to tell a story, but during the telling this viewer nearly fell asleep.
