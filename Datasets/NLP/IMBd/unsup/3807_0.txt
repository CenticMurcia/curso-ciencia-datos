Well. I have to say I saw this film when I was 14-15 and I found it amusing.<br /><br />It is based around a group of teenagers who gather and play an adventure game together. They try to find the ultimate game and finaly they find a very exciting one that sends terrorists to targets.<br /><br />They seem to have full control over this terrorist network indeed.<br /><br />By coincidence they find out that the terrorist acts they plan are executed for real!<br /><br />Nice twist, but the movie is definetly dated and it hasn't age well.
