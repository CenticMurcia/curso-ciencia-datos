I decided to go in to this film somewhat blind as I was only aware that it dealt with the assassination of George W Bush. The idea had some real possibilities and I disagree that it is disgusting to speculate what would occur in such a situation because it could lead to some meaningful conversation. What was disgusting was the acting in this film and how wrong they were in developing the plot.<br /><br />First, I have never seen such poor acting in a film (maybe Karate Kid 3). When they would cut to the interview segments it was almost unbearable to watch. The actress who played the speech writer was so unbelievable and her performance seemed more comedic than serious. Thats not to say the other actors were much better. I would go as far as to say that not one role was cast properly. Another character that deserves mention is the lawyer for the accused. One thing the director did right was not give her much screen time.<br /><br />The other issue I have with this film is how it focused on the investigation of the assassination rather than the political implications. It was impossible to get in to this story. Its obvious that part of this film is an attack on the Patriot Act and its destruction of civil liberties but I feel that this point is lost in this mess of a movie. If there is a valid political statement to be drawn from this film, I don't see how anyone would even care to recognize it.<br /><br />This is a film that should not be viewed by anyone who respects good acting or an interesting story.
