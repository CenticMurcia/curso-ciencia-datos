My Take: Hilarious oddity piece with imaginative special effects and an appealing cast. <br /><br />What a weird way to make a movie! And yet, what a fun and enjoyable film it is. INNERSPACE is a highly enjoyable little film, with some fine nifty special effects and some hilarious performances by Dennis Quaid, Meg Ryan and Martin Short. Not to mention Joe Dante's wacky inventiveness in his direction makes INNERSPACE is fun film for a very fun-loving audience.<br /><br />Quaid plays Tuck Pendelton, a party animal of a scientist who volunteers to be shrunk to microscopic size and injected to the insides of a lab test rabbit. Things get awry when a rival company wrecks havoc in the lab, and one of his colleagues is forced to inject him to hypochondriac Jack Putter (Short) instead. While trying to find his way out of Putter's body, Tuck changes Jack's life, as he becomes his "conscience". On their trail is Victor Eugene Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy) and his group who wants this little science project for themselves. Then on is a combination of various chases, wackiness and secret services.<br /><br />The movie takes the plot of an old B-movie, and brings it back to life, turning it to a fun and highly-spirited sci-fi comedy. It's like Richard Fleischer's classic THE FANTASTIC VOYAGE, but it has its own unique ideas and storyline to set its differences. Dante keeps all in fast pace, and doesn't keep us waiting for something to happen. The characters played by the leads are appealing and the script is filled with genuine laughs, with Short given the most. INNERSPACE is enjoyable entertainment, not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Rating: **** out of 5.
