I liked this film. Well done and interesting but it could never be complete. Wouldn't play to a caring crowd.<br /><br />It was a long time ago in a bar in Minneapolis called the Cabooze that I saw this fellow that I admired so. His band came in a Grayhound and he came in a limo just 20 minutes from show time(10pm)..warm up band was done and he came into the back room office with two young women that couldn't have been more than 14years old tops, flopped himself down on our couch and tells us that unless we pay an additional $2500 for his services he won't go on the stage. I counted out his money, he played two hours for $5000 and left for the big gig in Chicago. The two young women spent the show in the limo and as far as it goes that was it. All hail rock and roll...deliver me from the days of old...Chuck as great as they were I never spent one dollar for your music OR quit telling this story...told ya one day it would bite you in the ass...and these are my teeth
