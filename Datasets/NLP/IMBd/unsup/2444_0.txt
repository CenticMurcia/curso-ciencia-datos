i work as a translator for a local TV station. since it's local, it's criminally underfunded. but it has a program to run. translated, that means it's buying a lot of cheap B-movies. so in my "line of duty", i'm forced to watch a lot of crap. and i mean A LOT. more than anyone who has a choice ever had to. "crash point zero" was one such example. and oh my god, where do you begin? the other reviewers broke it down pretty accurately: from borrowing unused and differently textured shots from other movies (ed wood would've been proud!), to characters driving three (THREE!) distinct cars (one of them blue, two of them red) within a single scene, to the laughable and meaningless dialog, HORRENDOUS acting, and an all-around stench of amateur pointlessness. the list of examples of sheer stupidity in this flick would be higher than burj dubai! i guess 99% of what little budget they had went into the last-scene explosion (the only semi-decent thing in this abomination of a movie) to the detriment of everything else. really, some of this stuff is simply beyond words and has to be seen to be believed. what's astonishing is a feeling that the crew (well, at least most of them - some "actors" have that "what the f*ck am i doing here? hope nobody i know sees this" look on their face) labor under the illusion that they're creating a serious and suspenseful thriller, and obviously take it all very seriously, which is just amazing. i mean, there's nothing wrong in a B-flick that's aware of its "B-ness" and shamelessly flaunts it, but a deluded B-flick that thinks it's something more than it is is just pathetic. granted there are even worse, cheaper and misguidedly serious movies than this ("hyper sonic", for example), this still pretty much redefines the term "a B-movie". if you're done watching your paint dry, rent this and be amazed. really, it's quite a feat.
