If you're looking for a creepy, faux-documentary, rent "The Blair Witch Project". Yes, "Last Project" was made first, but there's a reason it's not as well known. The acting is on the community-college level. The script is film school tripe - plodding, self congratulatory, stupid, without any sense of pacing or urgency. The ending is completely ridiculous, and was painfully embarrassing to watch. The filmmakers did attempt to make a different kind of film, unfortunately their efforts fell flat.
