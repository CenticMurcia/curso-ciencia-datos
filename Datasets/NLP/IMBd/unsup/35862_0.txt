Oh man... and people thought Mortal Kombat 1 was bad. Annihilation makes MK1 look like Schindler's List. This movie is a courageous foray into the nightmarish underworld of utter mindlessness. I only suspend my disbelief so much - then I start becoming frustrated and asking questions like: How the heck does somebody travel through the molten core of the earth in a sailing American Gladiators ball? There is no wind underground. Not even in Raiden's magical tunnels, dude. Sorry. I understand how lots of movies are only capsules for their fight scenes, and I'm okay with that, but the stipulation is that the fight scenes have to be at least kind of cool.<br /><br />I think that this movie may have hurt my physical body. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.
