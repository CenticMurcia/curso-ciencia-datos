I am dumber after having watched this movie. The plot, actors, story, and music all sucked. I know this is a low budget movie, but couldn't they go to some local college and get some people who can actually act. The plot was stupid,slow and really didn't make a lot of sense. The entire time I watched the movie, I made fun of the acting, and was never once scared. The thing that made the most mad was that the cover of the movie jacket had nothing at all to do with the movie. Totally fooled me into spending $4 on this film. The longer I watched, the more convinced I became that this was someone's final project for film making 101. And, I would give them an F!At one point, I thought someone was playing a joke on me, and put the wrong movie in the case. Don't waste your time on this, unless you are a masochist.
