Turetskii Gambit / Turkish Gambit is a good movie, a loyal adaptation of the book by Boris Akunin (Although the makers chose to change the identity of the Turkish spy at the end - obviously to shock the audience already familiar with the book. Worked on me.) The acting, direction and cinematography are all praise-worthy. Close-ups, camera movements, and pans are all cleverly done. Special effects add to the pace of the movie, and the director succeeds in smoothly integrating high-tech tools with traditional storytelling methods. The one thing disappointed me was the omission of a large part of the story describing and narrating the siege of Plevne. The production somewhat fails to emulate the book in that sense, as the siege, related battles and their effects on the Russian army were not portrayed effectively.<br /><br />As a Turk with an interest in Russian history, I particularly enjoyed the film. The costumes, equipment and places looked very authentic. It was the most accurate depiction of Turkey and Turks in a non-Turkish film so far. I thank the gods that it was not a Hollywood movie.<br /><br />(SPOILER) I think, changing the identity of the Turkish Spy is a wise choice for the surprise effect, but it definitely weakens the plot of the story. Original spy (D'Hevrais) had a better background story, better reasons, and a better plan.
