This is the worst movie I have seen in recent memory. Apparently "Unstoppable" was written by a couple dozen drunken monkeys in different parts of the world with no connection at all to one another. I believe the name unstoppable is a description of the migraine one gets after watching this mind numbing stinking pile of trash. Wes- what were you thinking? Wesley Snipes is a far more accomplished actor than to be in this. This must have been a favor to someone or maybe he lost a bet. There was no measurable good quality to the screenplay. One could make out the pauses in the middle of sentences as the cue cards were switched. The special effects were pathetic at best. The acting, even by Snipes, was horrible. There were obvious sections where the film maker wanted to pad the film. I am actually shocked I didn't see a boom in any of the shots. Instead of renting this movie buy some rusty nails and pound them into your noggin. Trust me, it would be much less painful.<br /><br />I just realized what this movie reminded me of. This would have been the perfect role for Gary Busey!!
