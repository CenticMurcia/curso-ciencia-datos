This is one of those rare movies that you can't wait to see a second time because you want to laugh at how bad it was. The acting in the first half of the movie is miserable. Adrian Grenier sounds like a robot through much of the movie. It's almost as though he's (poorly)reading a Teleprompter in many scenes. Joey Laurence Adams shows none of her Chasing Amy charm. Instead, she comes off as annoying and whiny. James Toback tries to play the "mad genius" role as director and has one stroke of brilliance in an amazing acid-trip scene that climaxes with an Al Franken cameo. It is hilarious and the highlight of the movie.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is merely hilariously awful. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Sarah Michelle Geller seems embarrassed to be in the movie in certain parts, especially in the miserable scene at her father's house (her dad happens to be a Mafia boss--the main story line is a college basketball player throwing a game to his girlfriend's father, a mob boss. Brilliant and truly cutting edge!).<br /><br />This movie is a must see for all the wrong reasons.
