Well, the first one was full of clichés and the killer Santa wasn't that scary, but I give it the benefit of the doubt since they were trying to explore deep childhood fears that some of us may have had!<br /><br />But my friends, this sequel!!! To begin with, if you see the 2 movies one after the other like i did, you'll save a lot of your valuable time playing it in fast forward, since this Part 2 has about 40 minutes with footage from the first one. Then we get to the new footage, and... voilá: After a few sips from the leading actor's performance, we get to see him in his most absolute and complete crap acting... well, i can't describe it, not even in my mother tongue. It's so bad U have to see it for yourselves! Take a good look to his evil laughter and to the eyebrows! I believe his eyebrows act better than him! For real!<br /><br />And the plot? Well, the plot is just what you're expecting for! After his parents death, and later his brother's (in the first movie), he became so disturbed that starts killing everyone who crosses his path, or blows his nose to a red handkerchief! He does all this while, in a retarded ape style, keeps repeating: PUNISH! PUNISH!<br /><br />At least take a few minutes to appreciate the eyebrow master in action!
