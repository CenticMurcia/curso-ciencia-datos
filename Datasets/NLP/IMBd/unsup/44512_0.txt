I've always held this movie up as the worst movie I ever saw. But it so totally vanished I was beginning to think I had imagined it or somehow merged two memories together. But no, there it is. "The Visitor". That weird poster that obviously drew us in and yet somehow had nothing to do with anything. I have this strong memory or someone walking down a fire escape with this dramatic music building and building and he hits the street and ...nothing. The scene ends. The movie and the soundtrack felt like they had been cobbled together from outtakes of other movies. When I saw the movie "Bowfinger" where Steve Martin tries to film a movie starring Eddie Murphy without Murphy knowing he was being filmed...THAT'S what this movie was like. I think the crew went around and filmed actors filming other movies.<br /><br />Giving this movie one star is wasting a star. But yet I'd love to see it again just to relive how bad it was.
