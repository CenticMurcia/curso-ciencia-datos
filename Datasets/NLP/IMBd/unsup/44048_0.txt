I understand that this movie strongly supports the truthful concept of social development and evolution through redefining one's self, be it with a group activity, or drugs. I will even go so far as to say that it strongly promotes a "what makes us different makes us special," which is ethically very well. However any shred of ethos that can be derived from this movie is instantly lost when faces with the overwhelming fact that the person telling us this is Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />That being said, i know many will feel entitled to tell me that a lesson learned from anyone is still a lessoned learned, which is true, i suppose, but it is still keanu reeves, and he plays a chain smoking dentist The argument is further broken down into pathos and logos The pathos of this movie is most likely the strongest element, not because it is in anyway strong, but because the logos is poorly executed, there is no logic to this movie. Logically it doesn't make sense. The kid receives hypno-therapy from his dentist? He partakes in a semi-nude drunken orgy with his debate team from alcohol he receives from his teacher? i am sorry, that is just inane.<br /><br />Finally the redeeming pathos, well not thats not true, the pathos is far from redeeming, but it is there, which should count for something. By the end of the movie you do feel as though the kids life has emotionally effected you, you feel for the kid and his family, but that is about it.<br /><br />All in all this movie is a poor attempt to teach us a lesson you either learn in first grade, or never learn, and that is that people are different and what is "popular is decided by the populous."
