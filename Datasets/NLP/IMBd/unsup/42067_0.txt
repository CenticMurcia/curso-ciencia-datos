Wicked Lake is frankly just a horrible and boring movie. The cast of young women is attractive but the characters are too shallow to care about and the so-called psychopaths are just stupid. i truly hate this film and I hope that there is never a sequel to it. very boring junk with a slick poster and DVD cover to lure in audiences. such a waste of time. i can't believe how bad it turned out to be. stay far away from this movie!!!! also there is a scene where a feminine dude literally cries (while running) at the camera for five whole minutes and you my mouth was open the whole time in shock. ughhhh!!!!!!<br /><br />Score: 0.5/10
