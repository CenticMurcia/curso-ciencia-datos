This romantic and somewhat humorous drama fails to arouse much interest. I really enjoyed the rain scenes, otherwise it seems the effort was put together at the last minute. A hard luck woman(Robin Wright Penn)tries to make for a better life while her volatile husband(Sean Penn)spends ten years in the 'looney bin'.<br /><br />There is a lot of wasted talent assembled here:James Gandolfini, Harry Dean Stanton and John Travolta. This movie seems to take too long to deliver its message. Not a very attractive story and the strong language needed for realism gets old very quick.
