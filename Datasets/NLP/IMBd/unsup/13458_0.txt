I have another question about a song in the movie. Right about the time they're talking about Gator punching the cop and showing pictures of him skating when he was a teen, a really awesome punk song is playing in the background and I have no idea who it is. To this date I have downloaded and listened to "Laurie's Lament" by the Vidiots, & "I don't know" by Naked Raygun and neither song is the right one. I'm also familiar with "Space Age Love Song" and that's definitely not it. I think "Surf Beat" by Agent Orange is just an instrumental and this song definitely had lyrics.<br /><br />Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
