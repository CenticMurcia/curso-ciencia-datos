I was bored crapless the other night and turning channels on the movie channels and came across this one.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Irwin Allen and this is one of the few of his films I know nothing about. I'm glad I didn't, this really was one of the bad ones.<br /><br />All I got outa this one was a bunch of once-great actors trying to escape a volcano..and one by one, they die -- except for a few. I just did not care whether these folks lived or died...got off the island or not...oh, my goodness.<br /><br />The special effects are really cheesy, the stories were full of plot holes. Victoria Hammel looked good pre-Hill Street Blues days...and the most exciting part was Ernest Borgnine catching on fire and blindly being led across mountain ledges by older actors who didn't seem to make it either.<br /><br />What a waste.
