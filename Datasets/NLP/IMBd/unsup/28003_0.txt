Lone Scherfig's previous movie, Italiensk for Begyndere, was very praised around Europe and not the least here in Denmark. It was a well directed dogma movie with excellent acting, but when it comes down to it the story was very vague, and I for one did not find that movie very interesting at all.<br /><br />However, Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself is an excellent and beautiful film about the Scottish Wilbur (Jamie Sives) who makes use of every other moment to attempt suicide. It's done with a semi-humouristic twist which makes it not all too sad through the movie, but is still meant to be taken seriously. He moves into his brother's home in a used book store where the brother, Harbour(Adrian Rawlins), must watch over him to keep him alive. As Harbour discovers love in Alice, beautifully played by Shirley Henderson, they become four in the home as Alice and her 9-year-old daughter Mary moves in, and Wilbur discovers love in both of them as well as he gets to see death from a new and unexpected perspective.<br /><br />It was a good choice to make this movie in English, rather than Danish, and the result is an excellent drama which will apply to most people even though they, like me, may not be much for that sort of movies. If you liked Breaking the Waves, Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself should apply to you as well.
