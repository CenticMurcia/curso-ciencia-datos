The only reason I didn't rank it higher was because of the lack of emotion from the little boy. If he really was sean and really did love her, he would stop trying to impose himself into her life when he knew it could never work. I understand that it is PROBABLE that when he asked Clara in the bathroom not to tell Anna he was referring to the letters he dug up. I still believe that he was sean though....the letters he read couldn't have told him where her husband died. That would have been impossible. Did Anna write her dead husband a letter mentioning where he died and then did that letter fall into the hands of Clara??? I don't think so. The only explanation for him knowing where to meet anna was that he died there and remembered the place. Having said that...I hate the selfish bastard. 1-He cheated on his loving wife with psycho (anne heche) 2-He wouldn't leave anna alone even though he knew all he could do was hurt her 3-He was creepy
