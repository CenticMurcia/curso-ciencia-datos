This is my all-time favorite drama! The OST is absolutely amazing. The plot is captivating, the acting is outstanding, and the actors are well fit for their roles! This drama is so colorful and inspiring in every aspect, and it represents, especially to me a different Korea, a different way of life. The storyline displays Korean way of living in the 16th century, and emphasize an ancient culture. The culture of royal court cuisine, traditional medicine and outfits. Dae Jang Geum's determination, courage and kindness make her a model for imitation. A girl that becomes a woman, a chef, a first female royal physician and a mother despite all hardships. Min Jung Ho's devotion and faithfulness throughout the whole drama, make this to be one the best love stories ever!<br /><br />If you have yet to watch this drama, make sure you do so!
