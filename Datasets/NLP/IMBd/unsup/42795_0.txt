I expected a lot from this film, being one of the most ambitious Swedish films ever with tons of local media coverage and a genre I enjoy, but I was disappointed. It looks great and big (at least parts of it), but something is wrong with the acting or the direction (or maybe the script) because you never really get drawn into the story and you don't really care about the characters.<br /><br />Stellan Skarsgård is great (as usual) but it is a very small part, Vincent Perez is OK, I liked Morgan Alling in his role, but both Joakim Nätterqvist and Sofia Helin are really weak.<br /><br />I looked so much forward to this film when it came out (had read the books), but was very disappointed. Did not expect much for the sequel, and it really was not worth much either.
