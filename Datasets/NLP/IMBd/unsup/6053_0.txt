This film is about Cindy Campell, who moves to a new house, to take care of an old woman. Her next door neighbor is Tom Ryan. Suddenly, alien tripods are attacking the world, killing people. Cindy finds out the house she's in is haunted. She finds a ghost boy and he tells her that he knows the way to stop the alien invasion. So Cindy must go to uncover the secret to stop the alien invasion.<br /><br />This is the best Scary Movie film, ever. Maybe the reason is because it's spoofing War of the Worlds (2005). It also spoofs The Grudge, Saw and Saw II, and The Village. Some jokes fall flat but there are about one joke each second, meaning that you'll laugh through the whole movie.<br /><br />There is a LOT of physical jokes, in which I laugh at. Other jokes are smart and some are dumb. If you're one of those people who don't like physical comedies, you won't like this film. In fact, everything in Scary Movie 4 is very different than the other films, except most of the jokes.<br /><br />This is the funniest film, of them all. There are great cameos and the acting by Craig Bierko is great. Anna Faris' performance is decent, as well as Regina Hall. Well, that doesn't matter, in a movie like this, does it? The only thing that matters is if you'll laugh or not. No one cares about the story or the acting. This movie achieves with the hundreds of jokes, they give.<br /><br />What's next to say? Oh, the special effects. Well, spoofing War of the Worlds in a $45 million budget, you'd think the special effects for the tripod is horrible, right? Wrong. In fact, it looks as good as the tripods in War of the Worlds. Isn't it amazing? They took part of the budget in War of the Worlds, which was over $100 million, and used all they got, without going over budget. You would be surprised.<br /><br />If you're looking for a film with great acting and story, stay away from this film. If you're looking for a movie with good jokes, watch this film. This is the best film and it's unique. In my opinion, I really think this is so much different than Scary Movie 3. If you're fans of the film, watch it. You'll enjoy it.
