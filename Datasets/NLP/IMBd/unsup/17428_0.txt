As a fan of Asian horror, I had bought this movie before the American re-make. I was pleasantly scared to the bone by this chiller. Everyone I introduced to this movie found it difficult to watch, because although the gore is toned down, the spookiness is turned up. When i discovered an American re-make was coming out, my first reaction was, "you can't re-make perfection." Just in case I was wrong, I eventually watched the American version and was as disappointed as I thought I would be. So far in the Asian movie re-makes I have yet to see a movie that is as compelling in a thriller or a horror as the Asian version. The real obsessive movie fans will have the Asian films in their collection, not the English copycats. Pulse is an excellent movie if watched in it's true language with subtitles, in the original version.
