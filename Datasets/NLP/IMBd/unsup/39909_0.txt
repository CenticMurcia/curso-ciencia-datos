I plan to ask my shrink why - why? - I watched this entire film (on HBO). I truly think I could've written a better script. I could have directed, edited, acted, rewritten the whole thing.<br /><br />What interests me is how movies like this even make it to HBO or cable? Tom Beringer, arguably the most known actor in the "film" walks (sleeps, really) through his part as the air traffic controller. The other characters are so wooden - they would have been better to have used blow-up dollies - the ones with their mouths totally open as the frightened first-time passengers.<br /><br />Well, enough. I'll never fly again. Or, watch doomed flight movies. This was no "Air Force One" and that at least had Harrison Ford and secret pod escape modules. Bill Clinton himself explained the AF1 was not equipped with such.<br /><br />I still need an answer as to why I watched this entire film. Perhaps I am mentally ill?
