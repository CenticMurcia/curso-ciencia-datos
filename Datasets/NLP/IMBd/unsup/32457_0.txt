This is the worst film I have ever seen since The Blair Witch Project. Words to describe my feelings for this film, PATHETIC, STUPID, PREDICTABLE, PEDANTIC, TRAGICALLY FUNNY WHEN IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE, ETC ETC ETC ETC. The only highlight of the film was Gary Busey's hill-billy character in an otherwise complete waste of film.<br /><br />On the technical aspect of the film I suspect that there was no lighting director involved. I completely lost track of the continuity errors as they were so numerous. The night time shots were made worse by the dark clothing that the costume designer had chosen for the characters.<br /><br />In summary, I would not recommend anybody from this crew be allowed to work in the film industry ever again.
