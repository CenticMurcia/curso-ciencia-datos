Russell Crowe shows what great acting is, in his emotional and dynamic portrayal of the corporate tobacco executive cut loose for knowing too much and having a conscience.<br /><br />Only one flaw appeared in this movie, the casting of the excellent actor Michael Gambon as the villainous tobacco company chairman. He wasn't quite convincing about having a southern accent, a glitch that was slightly distracting to the otherwise intense scenes he appeared in.<br /><br />Otherwise every part in this movie was played to perfection, especially by Crowe and Pacino. A very believable effort by Christopher Plummer as the venerable Mike Wallace, and all the other supporting roles tell a story of truth, morality, and justice in a way that surpasses the run-of-the-mill Hollywood flick.<br /><br />A great movie, one of the best, that would be great even if there were no truth to it.
