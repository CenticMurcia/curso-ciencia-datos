Death Race is an action movie masterclass that stays very true to it's genre. It's fast, brutal and painstakingly brilliant. From the films opener to it's drooling and exceptional ending, Death Race is a man's movie. Jason Stathem, Ian Mcshay and Joan Allen also make this action movie worth watching. Watch for the humour, and believe me there is some, the fast paced story line that develops very quickly but without being rushed and of coarse the thrilling and viscerally brutal action.<br /><br />Jason Ames(Statham) who is wrongly accused for the murder of his wife is forced upon to take part in a deadly race that takes place over three days on a remote island. He and the other in-mates must fight to the death in a brutal style of fast paced explosive action If Ames wins though he is granted his freedom<br /><br />Girls, Guns, Cars and Action. What more could you want!
