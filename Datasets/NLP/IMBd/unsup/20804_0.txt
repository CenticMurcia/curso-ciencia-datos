While the only downside in this cartoon is that Sylvester didn't speak, this is still an classic by the late Chuck Jones. Porky and Sylvester arrive an an run down house (the last that the real estate agent had,) right away the cat gets scared by an bat. Porky loves the house and decides to turn in while Sylvester sleeps in the kitchen. That's where the fun really starts. He gets scared by every little thing and runs to Porky who is trying to sleep. In one scene they're outside and Porky asked Sylvester to closed the window which launches the bed back to the house which was an good gag. Eventually, Porky is fed up with Sylvester and checks it out for himself. The pig gets tied up and gagged and Sylvester runs away. Then his angel arrived and convinces him to remove the mice. Which he did expect 1 who drops an bowling ball on Sylvester's head. Like I said, the downside is that Sylvester is silent but it's still an classic by Chuck Jones. I highly recommend it and its squeal Claws for Alarm. Final Score: an 9 out of 10.
