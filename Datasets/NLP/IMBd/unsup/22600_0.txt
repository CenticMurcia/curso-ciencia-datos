I just saw this film earlier this evening at the Florida Film Festival, & in my 4 years of attending the festival this was one of the best I've ever seen. Character-driven stories such as these can be very difficult to pull off successfully; you will either care about the characters or you won't. This one succeeded in spades. Beautiful dialogue (even the meaningful pauses), sound, editing, characterization, all of it, simply beautiful.<br /><br />After the film ended there was a short Q&A with the director, Eric Byler. When that was over I was able to do something that most of us will never get a chance to do...to shake the director's & thank him for making such a wonderful movie. It was definitely my privilege to have seen this film.
