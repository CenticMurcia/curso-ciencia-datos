We all know Sandra Dee as the cute teenybopper who always gets the handsome dudes. Ah, but here, she shows a different side of herself. Don't get me wrong, she's still cute, but the man whom she gets...he's not what he seems. Maybe it's just his interest in the Necronomicon, but the people of Dunwich consider his family to be a bunch of demons; might they be right? A certain strange ritual might explain everything.<br /><br />OK, so "The Dunwich Horror" might seem sort of silly. But in my opinion, it's impossible not to like (and I don't just mean because of a certain scene with Sandra Dee). The movie has the real feeling of an H.P. Lovecraft story. Along with Dee, Dean Stockwell, Ed Begley Sr, Sam Jaffe and even a very young Talia Shire all do a really neat job with their roles. So watch this movie; it just might save your life.<br /><br />And I tell ya, Sandra Dee really does look hot in that one scene! And who ever would have guessed that Connie Corleone would have had a connection to Satanic rituals?
