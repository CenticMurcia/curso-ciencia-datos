This movie is not worth the time and aggravation that comes with watching it. Jimmy Fallon's considerable talents are not enough to overcome this weak script and poor direction. It is painful to watch, worse that the worst SNL skits you've ever seen. This obviously wasn't a theater movie and it's not one to watch on video or DVD either. The commentary at the end is the only real joke, Duncan Foster is an unknown for good reason. I have to wonder if Jimmy was wanting for cash when he said yes to this flop. That said, if you are an ultimate Fallon fan you may be able to find something entertaining, but I can not begin to guess where. Some movies are so bad that they are good, but this is not one of them. If there was anything to this story it seems to have been destroyed in the editing process.
