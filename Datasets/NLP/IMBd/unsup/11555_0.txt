This is a completely ridiculous film. It kept me in stitches constantly with its off-the-wall plot devices. The overall theme is that slick yuppies are trying to take over the beach, which is the domain of scruffy surfers. By the way, that was kind of the theme of the whole decade. Anyway, their plan is to use an evil brand of soda to transform surfers into mutant surf punks, who will (somehow) fall under the yuppies' control. The zombies are hilarious, spastically breaking bottles over their own heads and eating seaweed washed up on the beach. The scruffy heroes are hilarious in their scruffiness (they have a dog who is trained to snatch bikinis from bathing beauties). The yuppies are hilarious in their slickness (they are all addicted to breath spray).<br /><br />Like a lot of fun movies, you are not going to walk away from this one intellectually enriched. If you like campy, silly films, they don't get much better than "Surf II."
