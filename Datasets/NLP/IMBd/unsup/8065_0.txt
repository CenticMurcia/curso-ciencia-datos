Lelouche's "Rendezvous" movie is IMHO an overrated joke.<br /><br />I watched an AVI, and figured out the timed needed to drive down the Champs Elysees from Arc de Triomphe (timecode 1:32) to Place de la Concorde (2:48): about 70 seconds in a straight line. By measuring the distance on a map of Paris (about 2000m), you'll get the average speed: about 64 mph or 102 km/h, AFAIR.<br /><br />Certainly not a Ferrari at full speed, but probably an ordinary car driven somewhat faster than allowed.<br /><br />In twistier parts of the city, the sound often goes through all gears into 5th, while the visual speeds don't change much. For example at around 05:40, when he is forced to pass a parked truck slowly. It's hard to believe that people get fooled by that.<br /><br />At the beginning, it is stated that "the film was produced without photographic tricks nor changes in camera speed". That is IMHO true. The film is right, but the sound is fake.<br /><br />IMHO, everyone could produce such a flick by recording a normal trip through the village on video, and then adding some exciting sounds generated by a computer racing game.<br /><br />
