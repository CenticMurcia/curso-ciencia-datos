Forget Lock Stock and the rest of Guy Ritchie's overrated rubbish,this is a real British gangster film.Great performances by Hoskins and Mirren and great support from a variety of dodgy looking geezers from TV. Hoskins final speech is electrifying , and deserves to go down in movie history. In conclusion,if you have'nt seen this movie ,get hold of a copy NOW. IT'S THE BUISNESS ********** 10/10
