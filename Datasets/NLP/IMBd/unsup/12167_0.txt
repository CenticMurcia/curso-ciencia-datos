I rarely enjoy erotic films, but really loved this one. Its plot is quite basic the tale of a cop that works too hard and a wife that is neglected. Shannon Whirry as the wife is stunning and captures your attention. Its adult nature is full nudity and soft focus, with plenty of interesting outfits and people doing what is now seen as swinging. It hasn't really dated too badly, the hair is big, the g-strings high legged and the suits a bit 80s. Other than that they had kept it free of really obvious fashion or image disasters of the era.<br /><br />The second film is also quite good and in the third Shannon wasn't included.<br /><br />If you want intelligent eroticism then get Wild Things with Denise Richards, otherwise this will make a fun watch.
