This movie was AWFUL. It was like a horrible combination of The Mummy and the Indiana Jones movies. I'm not kidding when I say this is a stinker. Let's start from the beginning - the opening dialog is apparently there to introduce us to the story of the movie. It's kind of like a prequel, a la "What happened to bring us this far." Except that it's horrifically inaccurate and just plain wrong. They completely change Egyptian mythology, and even who Tut was and where he LIVED for the purposes of this movie. I honestly felt like I was watching an episode of The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. I was left repeating, "WTF?!!" over and over again to myself. Then you meet the main characters of the story. I am utterly astonished that such good actors as Casper Van Dien and Jonathan Hyde are associated with this movie. They both try desperately to work with the crappy material they've been given, and they both fail horribly. I tried very hard, but my ability to suspend disbelief ran away screaming about ten minutes into the movie. At one point I turned to the other person watching the movie with me and said, "It burns! It stings!" This movie is soul-scarringly bad. The only one I can think of that MIGHT be worse is that Sci Fi movie that had the ants from the AMAZON in ALASKA eating a town. That's it. This is beyond bad.
