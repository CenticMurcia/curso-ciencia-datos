Rocky Five is terrible beyond belief. You may think that I am being hard on it but no. It is quite possibly the worst movie ever made and is an embarrassment to be in with the rest of the series, all of which were great movies. But this one, no.<br /><br />After having defeated Drago, Rocky starts experiencing physical problems, mainly shaking beyond belief. After returning home he meets up with his son who seems to have grown by more than five years of age since the last time they saw him. Rocky holds a press conference to announce his retirement but is quickly offered an opportunity to box against a young boxer named Union Caine by a man named George Washington. Rocky says no and returns home. This is where things start to go crazy.<br /><br />Soon it is found out that Paulie gave some guy a blank check signed by Rocky or something and that they lost all their money. So they are forced to move back to Philadelphia. Further issues show up when it is revealed that Rocky has suffered head trauma and further boxing can seriously injure him (watching this movie could also give you head trauma).<br /><br />However Rocky re opens the old boxing gym since Mickey willed it over to Rocky Jr. Now living in the old neighborhood Rocky Jr. begins school and is immediately beaten up by bullies. Rocky meanwhile meets up with a young boxer named Tommy Gunn whom wants Rocky to manage him but Rocky decides he is not a good enough listener. He latter changes his mind and agrees to train Tommy Gunn and begins to spend more time with Tommy than his own son and dissension soon forms between father and son.<br /><br />TOmmy Gunn moves up the ranks. George Washington meanwhile tries to lure Gunn away from Rocky by lavishing wealth and women upon him. Rocky Jr. beats up the bullies that bugged him. Gunn leaves Rocky and immediately battles Union Caine for the heavyweight champion title and wins it. Rocky and Jr. talk and patch things up. After winning the title Gunn is hassled by reporters who argue that him winning the belt is meaningless since he never beat Rocky to obtain it and because Caine was a paper champion.<br /><br />Gunn finds Rocky at a local Bar and challenges him but Rocky says no. Paulie then taunts Gunn but gets beaten up. Rocky then agrees to fight Gunn in the streets. Getting some support from the Spirit of Mickey, Rocky beats Gunn up.<br /><br />The whole concept of Rocky losing everything he got and starting off again where he started from is pretty stupid. Also the way he lost all of his money is really ignorant. And since Paulie is supposedly the reason for them losing so much they STILL LET HIM LIVE WITH THEM!!!! Tommy Gunn is a pretty lame character. ALso a Rocky Movie with no big fight in the ring at the end is a bad idea. Rocky fighting Gunn in the ring at the end would have made this movie a little better, not much, but I guess that idea was not good.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Rocky movies stay away from this one. I got the box set of Rocky from my sister for Christmas one year but I never watch this one. FOr me Rocky five never happened.
