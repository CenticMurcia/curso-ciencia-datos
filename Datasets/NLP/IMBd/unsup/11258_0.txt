I thought that London to Brighton was a great film it starts in London, a pimp called Derek assigns the prostitute Kelly that works for him to find a young girl on the streets to escort the powerful mobster Duncan Allen. Kelly finds the twelve year-old runaway Joanne in the train station, and Derek gives one hundred pounds for her service and the girl accepts. Kelly makes friends with Joanne and takes her to Duncan's mansion. When Joanne cries in the bedroom where she is with Duncan, Kelly runs and helps the girl. At 3:07 AM, a bruised Kelly and the tearful Joanne lock themselves in a public toilet. Kelly asks Joanne to stay there because she will raise some money for them to travel to Brighton. Meanwhile, Duncan's son Stuart Allen calls Derek and asks him to meet him in a night-club. When Derek arrives at the nightclub, Derek calls his friend Chum and they begin to chase the girls. It thought that this was a great and powerful film, which featured a lot of strong violence. 8/10
