Firstly, there is no proper story line ..... just taking a boy meet girl story and putting it in a historical backdrop doesn't make sense at all .... specially when it is not authentic at all ... its predictable and boring ..... more so because of the constant Urdu dialogs which was hard to comprehend ..... many people are saying that the fight sequence portrayed are good but its not worth it ... when you are portraying a vicious battle a little more gore is expected ... not pushing each other and making them fall to the ground ... thats bogus .... i liked the other films of AG they were good ... but this one is worthless ... the only good thing about the movie is aishwarya her ... acting is really good ... hrithik looks misplaced .... and he is often out of sorts if the role doesn't demand his dancing skills ... so it was expected .... if you do want to watch it ... go with your friends and chat your way ... through the movie .. because what happening on screen will not appeal you at all ... for such a stupendously bad story the movie is painfully long ... on the bright side it gives you a lot of time to talk with your friends ..... and carry some medication it might help .. u may need it ... good luck ...
