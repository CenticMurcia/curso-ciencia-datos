It was a beautiful movie. I truly adored it. And my older brother,who doesn't quiet like any romantic movie, liked it too. So ... if you haven't seen this movie yet, then, ... what are you waiting for??? The structure of the movie is original, so you won't get bored. And if you're still not convinced, then you're a very weird person! Well, anyway, for everyone else, if it's a rainy day, you're bored, you don't know what to do, or you're a bit lonely, then just go out and rent this movie, because I'm pretty sure that you'll love it. Watch out if you don't see it! It might just give you bad luck... <br /><br />Love, <br /><br />me
