If you have insomnia and are wary about taking prescription medications, then this CLUNKER of film should do the trick! I rented this on the strength of imdb comments....I should know better when it comes to "psych thrillers" and "horror genres" that my taste doesnt reflect 3/4 of the population. I have no problem when a movie contains an ambiguous ending...BUT...when a director leaves the viewer without even THAT MUCH, the film then becomes a "so whats the point of the whole DAMN THING ANYWAY? I dont buy into the "art house" symbolism crowd either. The acting is okay, the directing is okay, but there isnt enough of a STORY, other than, did he or didnt he?....and if thats all the director was going for...then again I ask...SO WHAT? who CARES?.....and though I have no problems with sex scenes in a movie(as long as there is a reason for it) what was the point of this film to have a minor one....except to "just film a sex scene"...yeah, really original...If you like a story that goes ABSOLUTLEY NOWHERE, then CHASING SLEEP is for you....
