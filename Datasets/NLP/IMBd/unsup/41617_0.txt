Face it-- "Cinderella" has been worn out since the day it was conceived. And since, the world has never forgotten this disgustingly sentimental heap of molly-wash. Julie Andrews gives a non-memorable performance in the title role-- where is the interest with which she has played every other part before and since? Other performers have absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever, where Andrews shows promise. But the reality is, the musical score by the normally-excellent Rodgers and Hammerstein is nothing more than a collection of garbage-riddled ditties wallowing in their own pathos. The only acceptable tune in the whole lot is the "Stepsisters' Lament," which occasionally borders on funny. Sadly, the entire telecast is an exercise in sugar-encrusted romantic tripe that makes James Cameron's "Titanic" look excellent.
