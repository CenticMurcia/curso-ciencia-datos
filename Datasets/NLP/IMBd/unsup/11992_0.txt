I dig this kinda movie way more than the big budget Hollywood horror films, and it's just as spooky. A bunch of masked devil worshippers chasing people around the woods is about the jist of this flick, but there's more to it, with some cool plot twists that I didn't see coming. Some great photography sequences at the rave party scene.
