i enjoyed reading the books more than watching the same tired old animation by rankin bass...fine for kiddies but still below par animation...why they went back to this low grade animation after ralph bakshis fantastic animation in the lord of the rings beats me. and the voice-overs were done by the same people from the hobbit..i think they were way below the voice-overs in the lord of the rings movie .. the hobbit was neat in its time but the return of the king is an unfair adaptation of the remaining 11/2 books ...i heard they are making a live action version of the lord of the rings in 3 parts i hope they use generated effects for some of the characters because midgets arent the same as hobbits ...i look forward to seeing all 3 movies
