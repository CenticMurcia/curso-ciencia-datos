David Mills has given us a fascinating look into a world that's completely unknown to most of us. He's filled this world with interesting, multi-layered characters. Yancey Arias' portrayal of Miguel Cadena is compelling and I truly believe that the character of Miguel has the potential to be one of the most memorable television characters ever created. I, particularly, like the strong female characters portrayed by Angela Alvarado Rosa and Sheryl Lee. Alvarado-Rosa's 'Delia Flores' is smart, dedicated and tough; a worthy adversary for Miguel. Marlene is equally smart, tough and determined to retain her current lifestyle. She's no Carmella Soprano. Not only is she fully aware of every aspect of the business; but as the family lawyer, she is an integral part of it. I sincerely hope this show becomes a regular series. Long may "Kingpin" reign!
