This movie doesn't require much critique. It was the typical, boring, cliched Hollywood action garbage that litter movie channels these days. The family "miraculously" escape death time and time again while the bad guy descends into madness, yadda, yadda. No depth, one dimensional characters. Why is junk like this being funded? It was "watchable", but I knew what was coming around each corner. Could we PLEASE get some intellectual movies?<br /><br />3/10
