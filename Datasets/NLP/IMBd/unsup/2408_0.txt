It's a story of a policeman Jack Mosely (Bruce Willis) who is nearing his service tenure and probably bored by his life and job. He keeps on drinking daily and on the job too, just to pass of his day. One day he is given a routine task of escorting a prisoner (Mos Def) from jail to the magistrate's office so the prisoner can record his testimony. Detective Jack Mosely later on comes to know that this prisoner is suppose to testify against many of the policemen who had done many bad things in the past. He decides to save the man and tries to make it to the magistrate's office in time, the detective risks his own life in the process, as the bad policemen are hell bent not to stop them from reaching the court.<br /><br />The movie has some good moves done by Bruce Willis and the bad men to outwit each other, which keeps you interested in the movie, but at the same time some scenes are too long and take the interest out of their move.<br /><br />Bruce Willis does a great job. Mos Def looks a perfect blend for an innocent looking prisoner who wishes to open a cake bakery one day. Mos Def voice is distinctly different, which suits his role.<br /><br />It's a movie which tries to showcase that if a person decides something he can achieve it, no matter how big the obstacle is. It is the person's determination and grit which helps him to achieve great things. The movie is good but the speed of the movie could have been better as it's a bit slow.<br /><br />http://moviesopinion.blogspot.com/
