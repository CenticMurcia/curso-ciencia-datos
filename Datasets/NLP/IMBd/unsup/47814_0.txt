Yesterday, I watched that movie and in its middle I was wondering: "Something is wrong!Did I get tickets for Charlie's Angels or for the Matrix 4 in female version?!!!.Unfortunately tickets were saying the truth,I was in the right movie...My opinion is that slow motion tricks and all the other stuff belong to Matrix and nowhere else.Charlie's angels, the series!! were more serious from the movies.
