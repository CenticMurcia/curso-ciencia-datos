Honestly, I had a lot of expectations for this movie, because of my fondness for Meryl Streep and Uma Thurman, and I was pretty disappointed. The movie dragged and seemed to go nowhere! I have never seen Ben Younger's other film, but if Prime is any indication of his style, I know I should probably stay away from that one, too! The character development seemed forced and insincere. I did not feel emotionally attached to any of these characters. Throughout the movie, Uma's character, Rafi, keeps telling her therapist how she needs "to put all of herself out there." I kept waiting for some secret or hidden part of her character to be revealed, but, alas, nothing like that ever happened.<br /><br />I could never really tell where the characters were going, what they were going to do and how they felt. For other movies, that might sound exciting and unpredictable, but for Prime, it just felt like nothing was ever happening.<br /><br />If I had to do it all over again, I would pass on Prime.
