The genre of black comedy is today unfortunately lacking in many aspects . To think of black comedies there aren't really many to begin with. Not many worth watching, that is. Other forms of comedy have in recent years gone to the extremes in such a way that the real element of fun is missing in all the sex and secretions. There are of course important comedic factors to make the audiences laugh but in my opinion they have to come from the characters and the writing.<br /><br />In Death Becomes Her Robert Zemeckis brings in a cast extraordinaire to a film that is fresh in ideas and verging on poetic in its writing. The way the film is sculpted leaves only the most essential scenes on the screen, which at the end resonate with each other and become vital like peaces in a thrilling yet dark puzzle. If ever death truly became her, Zemeckis has found the right wardrobe yet. The cast bring their unpeccable goods despite all the visual effects (which still after 14 years look amazing). It must have been difficult to form characters in such an environment but there they are - flesh and not so warm blood. The actors are not TRYING to be funny, they are. Meryl Streep is on fire, never missing a beat as the distraught Madeline Ashton. Goldie Hawn matches her magic scene for scene, and gives a real performance of desperation. Bruce Willis stretches his comedic muscles like never before or after this. Isabella Rosselini is brilliantly cast as the sour and joie de vivre Lisle Von Rhoman. One feels almost ashamed when watching her.<br /><br />What is even still surprising in Death Becomes Her is that there are real motives behind all the actions. Hurting the one you love by using beauty and youth as a weapon, trying to stay young forever, finding happiness - these are big things, and there might have been a serious way to approach it. But then of course the essence of humor would be lost and I would be deprived of hands down one of the best comedies I have ever seen.
