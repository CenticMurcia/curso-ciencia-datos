I thought the film even with the dramatization was compelling, but unfortunately the scriptor and director forgot or ignored the end of the film by simply ending the story with a cute Voice Over, and tracking shot of the young boy running into the fade out. There were basic errors in story telling, and some times you have to give the audience what they want or perceive to want. example: It would have been good to see the doctor meet up with his daughter. It would have been good to see or read a bio of the young boy's life in 2004 as the story was written about his life in 1987. <br /><br />The audience is always right. . .hence the film's pitiful 1.7mill box office.
