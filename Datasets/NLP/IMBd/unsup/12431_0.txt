Very emotional and romantic movie. Real love story, not a Cinderella fairy tale.<br /><br />MSS is about small town people. The main hero has moved to the big city, succeeded in business and had married "the right" woman. But within a day he is forced to come back to his old house, to his ill-minded brother, to the problems and life of different scale. To the old samurai Toshiro Mifune, who lives in the cellar. But there he finally realizes how people from there are dear for him.<br /><br />The main idea is "the life is not just roses, we have to overcome difficulties and always stay human to each other".<br /><br />Lively actors performance and light atmosphere together with an exciting story make this movie a must-watch.
