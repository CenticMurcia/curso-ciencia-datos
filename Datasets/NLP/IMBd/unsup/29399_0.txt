I thought this was a "lost" episode for me in that I had missed one episode in my decades of Trek viewing in repeats with "Court Martial" only seeing that in the 90's (not a favorite)! I was watching this episode now and did not have a clue. However, I have seen it, it was just so bad I didn't set aside enough brain matter to remember it fully. I know I saw it because I remember the alien folding up into a nothing. What I didn't remember was the awesome scene with Scottie getting serious rad's in the jefferies tube and passing out as Spock acts like an a hole, asking why he should say thank you, that was a little over the top as Spock had shown thanks before (I think), but Spock never gave Scottie a break. With that much said, Spock would be my all time worse Captain to be serving under don't you think? "Hey Mr Spock, how about some liberty call on board that planet that loves to please?" Mr Spock answers, "The Federation is not paying you to enjoy yourself so get back to work!" Anyway, this episode is really lame in that it has no moral message like "Let This Be Your Last Battlefield", it's just a lady with superpowers and limited dialog screwing with the Enterprise, and despite Scottie's and Spock's very cool moment this episode sucks cheese whiz. 4 of 10, season three is starting to look lame like everyone said (but there were some good episodes before this one!).
