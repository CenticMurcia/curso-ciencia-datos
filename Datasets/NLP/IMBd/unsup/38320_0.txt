How can you mix slap-stick/Laurel and Hardy comedy and mean Pusher/Bleeder<br /><br />violence? That simply doesn't work for me! Ole Thestrup and Fritz Helmuth are simply too stupid and pinheaded - especially Ole Thestrup. The hunting scene along with the final get-even scene are just too stupid and unrealistic... Apart from that, I like the story, the acting (especially Mads Mikkelsen) and the the dialog. Still I can't quite figure out how it's possible to get lost in a forest near Frederica when driving from Copenhagen to Barcalona? It's motorway all the way!? I'm looking forward to seeing the Hollywood version...
