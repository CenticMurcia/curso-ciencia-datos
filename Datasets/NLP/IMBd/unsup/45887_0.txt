This movie was just plain bad. But since I'm bothering to write this, I should go into more detail than that, right? This movie was tacky and offensive, all the more tragic because of the hilarity potential of Robin Williams and the likability potential of Mandy Moore and Jon Krasinski. Synopsis: Two cuties get together. (Aw, sweet.) Then comes the messed up marital counselling of Moore's bizarro pastor, played by Robin Williams. Williams, in all his ridiculous antics, is aided and abetted by a creepy little kid (sorry, no offense meant to the child actor playing the kid -- I'm sure the creepiness was all in the role) who tries to be cutely precocious, but basically comes off as an annoying, know-it-all, creepy, snot-nosed little brat. I only watched half an hour into the movie because it was so cringe-inducing, distasteful, unfunny and insulting to relationships. I walked out and caught the last half of The Brave One. Unless you are amused by bathroom humour, skip it. You will thank me.
