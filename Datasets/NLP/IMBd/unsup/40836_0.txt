This is a movie conceived and produced by juveniles for juveniles but is it ever funny. The kind of funny that kept me wondering whether everything about it, and I mean EVERYTHING, wasn't meant to be that cheesy. There's really no point in commenting on the dialogue (moronic) or acting (what acting?). I guess the scenery was OK if not for the fact we kept seeing the same scenes ad nauseam. I should say something about the characters though. The premise of the film is that there's two tribes, one of pretty women and beastly men and another of handsome men and ugly women. I guess the women were pretty enough and they were quite shapely. As for the men they all hailed from muscle beach. This was a beefcake fest with the beastly men differentiated from the handsome men primarily by the fact they were hairy. The handsome guys were shaved clean and oiled to boot. These fellas were ready for the Mr. Universe contest. So the bottom line is: could you spend an hour and 11 minutes doing something better? Absolutely, positively without a doubt. But if you do chose to see it you'll find yourself chuckling uncontrollably and that's not such a bad thing, is it?
