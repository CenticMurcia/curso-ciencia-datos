There I was, watching this film, and a scene happens about ten minutes in roughly, where Considine's character confronts a man in a pub. His acting turned the hairs on the back of my neck upwards, and I was glued to the film all the way to the end from then on.<br /><br />I haven't seen a film like this before. It is essentially a revenge movie, but done on a low budget, with a non-star cast, but it was terrific. It just goes to show that you don't need special effects for a good film that keeps you glued. Look how crap The Phantom Menace was, and then look at Twelve Angry Men, and how amazing the script was.<br /><br />The script to this film is good, but the reason for watching it, and liking it is Paddy Considine. He was scary, and put on one of the finest performances I've ever seen in cinema.
