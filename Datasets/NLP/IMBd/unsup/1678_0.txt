"Roberta" was out of circulation for many years because of an inferior MGM remake "Lovely to Look At" (1952) - the studio did not want competition between the two films. Astaire and Rogers had been such a success in "Flying Down to Rio", that today the true stars of the film are almost forgotten (Gene Raymond and Dolores Del Rio) and they also shone in "The Gay Divorcée" (1934). RKO had bought "Roberta", as a vehicle for Irene Dunne. It had been a mild Broadway success for Jerome Kern and Fred Astaire's part was a composite of the roles played by Bob Hope and George Murphy. Ginger's part had been played by Lyda Roberti.<br /><br />When Huck Haines and his band are stranded in Paris his pal John (Randolph Scott) looks up his aunt (Helen Wesley) to see if she can help them out. She is the creator of Roberta Fashion House - the most exclusive designs in Paris. Her lovely designer Stephanie (Irene Dunne) is having trouble with Tanka (Ginger Rogers) and because she works in a cabaret, John thinks Tanka could get Huck and his band a job. Huck soon discovers that Tanka is his old friend from back in Indiana - Lizzie Gatz!!! Tanka gets them a job so they will keep her secret.<br /><br />The sparkling "I'll Be Hard to Handle" is first introduced by Ginger singing in a mock foreign accent, then she and Fred execute a joyous tap dance that is part of a rehearsal. Aunt Roberta is very sick but she always gets Stephanie to sing to her - this time the haunting "Yesterdays". She dies in her sleep and John inherits the dress shop. He wants Stephanie to have the shop but she will only go into partnership with him. John has definite ideas about what he likes and doesn't like.<br /><br />Delightfully wicked Claire Dodd plays Sophie, John's snooty fiancée. She arrives in Paris as soon as she hears he has an inheritance. She is looking for a dress to impress John and by mistake sees a dress that John has rejected as too vulgar. Stephanie tries to dissuade her from buying it but Sophie is adamant. John is disgusted when he sees it on her and they break up for the last time. He is also angry at Stephanie for selling the dress (which she did under duress).<br /><br />"I Won't Dance" starts off with a sizzling piano solo by Fred Astaire, followed by an equally sizzling solo dance by Mr. Astaire. Ravishing Irene Dunne sings the beautiful "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" with balalaika accompaniment. With both John and Stephanie staying away, the business starts to run down. Stephanie comes back to save the day and puts on a musical fashion show.<br /><br />To the tune of "Lovely to Look At" models parade the gowns (there is even a young Lucille Ball in a beautiful feathered cape!!!) Stephanie is back in another beautiful gown, singing the gorgeous "Lovely to Look At". Fred and Ginger then dance to "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes". John thinks Stephanie is married to Ladislaw - that's why she is a princess. Stephanie declares she was born a princess and Ladislaw is her cousin!!! Everything ends happily with Fred and Ginger dancing to "I Won't Dance".<br /><br />"When you dance you're charming and so gentle/Especially when you're doing "The Continental"!!!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
