Everyone who has read the book will agree with me, the movie is rubbish: There is no magic, Aslan is 'just' a lion. The books have a lot of room for your own imagination: anthropomorphic animals and especially Aslan are just things you can't film. And if you can, you're one hell of a Filmer, this one just couldn't.<br /><br />I quote C.S. Lewis himself in a letter from him to producer Lance Sieveking: 'But I am absolutely opposed  adamant isn't in it!  to a TV version. Anthropomorphic animals, when taken out of narrative into actual visibility, always turn into buffoonery or nightmare. At least, with photography. Cartoons (if only Disney did not combine so much vulgarity with his genius!) would be another matter. A human, pantomime, Aslan would be to me blasphemy'<br /><br />Nowadays, because of technology, animals don't turn into buffoonery like C.S. Lewis says, but he is still right about Aslan.<br /><br />There is no spirit in this movie!
