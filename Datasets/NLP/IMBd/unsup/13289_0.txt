analyzing Miike's flicks is somewhat akin to analyzing David Lynch or Stan Brakhage(sic?). He himself seems to feel that something is right, rather then have it all worked out in his mind logically. This can result in junky, rough work, as Izo is at times, and also touch a pure cinematic form of pure feeling, that what was shown could not be done any other way. Izo is this also. Having said this I found Izo to be one of the most clearly defined of Miike's movies that i've seen (admittedly only six or seven). I felt rather clearly spoken to, both in image and dialog. I wont go into this because of the sheer amount of what is there, and I always believe in people seeing movies blind, not looking for any particular preconceived message. I'll just say this felt like the truest movie I've seen of Miike's, the purest in feeling and heart, and also, by far, the most relevant and poignant.
