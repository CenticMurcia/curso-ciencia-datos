1st watched 5/7/2005 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Penelope Buitenhuis): Disguised as a sex flick, this thriller goes to ridiculous proportions with it's main psycho character as he goes on a killing spree with those who have contact with the main female character, Allison. I won't give away too much of the rest of the plot for those who attempt to watch this, but basically the murderer isn't himself. Who is he then, you ask? He's another person, of course(OK, I think I've already said too much). But anyway back to the review. The acting and writing is subpar in this movie, which is a good reason that it will stay on the "B" movie shelf at your local video outlet for as long as it lives there. Avoid it unless you just have to watch Andrea Roth, who plays Allison take a few showers and have rough sex a couple of times.
