This film is about a married female writer who is sexually drawn to a mysterious couple who are also writers.<br /><br />I had high hopes for "Henry & June" due to the positive comments, but I found it terribly dull. The so called plot is simply an excuse to provide grounds for one sex scene after another. This collection of pointless scenes stretch over two hours, I felt I could not bear it anymore. It is made worse by the emotionless delivery of most of the lines, particularly by Ana√Øs and Hugo. It sounds like they are trying so hard to create the perfect accent, but end up sounding cold and mechanical instead. Henry Miller's fake balding scalp and his thinning side hair look so fake that they become eyesores.
