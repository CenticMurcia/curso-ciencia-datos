So after seeing Lost Highway and finding it brilliant I wanted to see more of Lynch. This one had a rating of 7 so I check it out (as I tend to avoid movies with an IMDb rating of less than 7). <br /><br />I was disappointed. The creepiness of Big Tuna, Texas was about a 7, but most of the rest of the movie was a 2 at most. The acting is generally poor and the ending of this movie is just plain stupid.<br /><br />The only other good thing about this movie is Powermad. It's too bad they didn't continue. What a great, technical, speed metal band they were.<br /><br />I was left thinking about Lost Highway for days. This one I hope to forget.
