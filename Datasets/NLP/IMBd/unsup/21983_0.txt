i think that over the past year or so Disney has made a lot of really mature and enjoyable Disney movies and this was no exception. at first i didn't think this movie would be very good. everyone was talking about the fact that it was a simple life rip off and i didn't really know if i should side with that or not, but after seeing it i have found its nothing at all like the t.v. show. the acting from both girls were great and though i was just a little disappointed with the ending it didn't change my mind at all that this was a very respectable movie, and it definitely stood out as being "original" in "disney channel original movie". very well done to aly and amanda, i love the song "On The Ride" as well
