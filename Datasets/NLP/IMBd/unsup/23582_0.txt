This first, silent version of The Lost World is the best one for dinosaur fans as it has more dinosaurs in it than any other. I have two VHS copies of this, an hour long version and the restored copy, which lasts for about 100 minutes.<br /><br />Professor Challenger leads a party into an uncharted part of the Amazon where prehistoric monsters still live. When there, they explore the land and see the many dinosaurs that roam it. They then decide to try and capture one of these alive and bring it back to London! They manage this and bring back a Brontosaurus, but it escapes and goes on the rampage through London, brings down Tower Bridge and then escapes down the Thames.<br /><br />The stop-motion dinosaurs are done excellently by Willis O'Brien and also include Allosaurus, Tricertops and Pteranodon.<br /><br />The cast includes Wallace Beery as Chellenger, Bessie Love and Lewis Stone.<br /><br />This movie is a must see, especially if you are a fan of dinosaur movies like myself. Excellent.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
