Well, I was told that this is a 'hentai' with a good story. After seeing it, I just couldn't stop laughing because it is just too stupid even for a pornographic film. The positive characters are just too stupid, the villains are evil because they have just one face, et cetera. And also this series makes the prequels boring. It has so much flashbacks that even that small 'story' becomes boring, long and stupid. If it is possible... After a few episodes even the 'actions become long and boring, because everything is just repeated, and I think that there is nothing that could possibly make me believe this is a horror. The fantasy stuff is just that we see a lot of pentagrams everywhere, with runes around them. This stuff never made anything a fantasy or horror... I wish someday somebody could really show me an enjoyable and entertaining hentai!
