James Woods delivers a sensationally intense, wired and riveting performance as shrewd, sleazy and blithely amoral maverick loose cannon Detective Lloyd Hopkins, who obsessively investigates a series of vicious homicides that have been going on for fifteen years. Lloyd's pursuit of the serial killer puts his job on the line and pushes him over the edge. Tightly written and directed by James B. Harris (who previously worked with Woods on the outstanding prison movie "Fast-Walking"), with crisp cinematography by Steve Dubin, a harsh, gritty tone, unflinchingly raw and profane dialogue, a jazzy, shivery score by Michel Colombier, a tense and exciting climactic showdown between Hopkins and the killer, some seriously ugly violence (the murder sites are truly nasty), and a shockingly brutal and nihilistic ending, this bang-up little sleeper makes for an extremely gripping and suspenseful viewing experience. Woods effortlessly carries the picture with his usual arresting blend of live-wire energy and hard-boiled charisma. The supporting cast are likewise on the money excellent: Charles Durning as Lloyd's loyal and protective partner Dutch Peltz, Lesley Ann Warren as a touchy feminist poet, Charles Haid as corrupt Deputy Sheriff Delbert "Whitey" Haines, Raymond J. Barry as stern, no-nonsense Captain Fred Gaffney, Randi Brooks as brassy hooker and drug dealer Joanie Pratt, Steven Lambert as the killer, and Jan McGill as Lloyd's fed-up wife Jen. A worthy 80's noir thriller winner.
