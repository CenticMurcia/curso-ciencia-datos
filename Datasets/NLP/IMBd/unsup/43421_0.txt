I apologize if this critique is quite harsh, but I think American Adobo actually set back the progress that filipino influenced films could have had in the United States. This came out in California months after another Fil-Am film, The Debut arrived in Los Angeles. If it had any semblance of success in the US, it was likely because people were still hyped by the previous film, and did not realize that American Adobo was produced by Philippine filmmakers. As a result, the film came across as "too long", "overly dramatic", "difficult to follow", and "unbelievable story lines for drama". One must first look at Philippine culture to realize that in the Archipelago, there is a tendency to believe that "more is better". THis is manifested in the length of Philippine speeches, concerts, or recognition in any form. From the gay addition involving a son flying back to the Philippines to retrieve inadvertently sent photographs, to the eternally single "old maid" who married the fireman who saved her life after she trashed her apartment, the story lines are incomplete, dragging, and with the multiple plots make for a very confusing follow.<br /><br />However, there are parts that Americans will find funny simply because they are Philippine farce, and as such make absolutely no sense. For example, a female character gets so frustrated at a Mah Jong game, that she goes on a "roid rage", which in turn results in everyone leaving the house.<br /><br />FIlipinos who observe gay culture in their media would be delighted to see Christopher de Leon engage in an on screen kiss with another character in the movie.
