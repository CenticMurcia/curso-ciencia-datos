Michael Pitt can't act PLEASE make him stop trying! He is absolutely horrible - if his last name weren't Pitt he would have been blessedly out of a job years ago.<br /><br />And what's up with his bizarre diction in this film? What kind of accent is he trying to imitate? He doesn't even look natural simply sitting and for the love of God someone get the boy some lip balm!<br /><br />The book was fabulous - the film is a waste of celluloid and only encourages Pitt to continue seeking work as an actor as opposed to something useful, like a job as a waiter... which I probably wouldn't believe him capable of either!
