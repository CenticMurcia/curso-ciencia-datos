He certainly has mastered his style of making movies, the Hitchock-ian manner which looks so full of details and carefully planned, but God save this director's soul for using such poor looking fake blood, it's in all of his movies. The color is so incredibly fake it's just bad, especially when you have a movie as gory as this one. The acting is good, I liked the attractively stunning Amy Irving, the story was interesting as hell and kept me wondering what was going to happen, the script was above average (incredible even), some scenes (the one where Mrs Irving's character escapes from the psychic school) were absolutely amazing and overall it was a very entertaining movie. But the ending, as with so many De Palma movies, just came on to quickly, left too many questions unanswered (one of them being why the baddies did the experiments on Robin in the first place) and just felt over-rushed in every sense of the word. Do recommend a view. 7/10
