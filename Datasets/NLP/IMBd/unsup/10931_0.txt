I have always like this movie for its upbeat music and Kevin Bacon. But the big mystery is Lori Singer hasn't done anything since about 1995 and really nothing much since this movie. Reading her biography one can understand that she is extremely talented especially in music, but it's a shame that she didn't continue to do more feature films. She is a beautiful woman. Yeah when I watched the movie last night I saw the big snow capped mountains in two scenes and wondered what mid west town is this? Yes you could say that there is some cheese in the movie, but it is entertaining if not predictable. Watching Dirty Dancing twenty years later gives you that same feeling.
