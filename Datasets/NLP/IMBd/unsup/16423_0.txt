I'm voting 10 for all the wrong reasons. The Prodigal was completely enjoyable as a comedy. What's the point of lighting the metal point of a spear before you stab someone? They do it here. Do vultures really attack living human beings? They do here. I agree with all the reviewers who say that Lana was too old to play this role. And poor Purdom, always wincing whether the sun was out or not. His bad posture and dull line readings. The funniest part is when the big battle is going on at night in the streets and Louis Calhern is casually driving his chariot home from the saloon totally oblivious to whats going on around him. The mute slave climbs up Louie's horses, does an about face and throws a knife straight into Louie's neck. Priceless! The Medved/Dreyfus book The Worst Movies of All Time featured Solomon and Sheba starring Yul Brynner and Gina Lollobrigita. I guess they missed The Prodigal.
