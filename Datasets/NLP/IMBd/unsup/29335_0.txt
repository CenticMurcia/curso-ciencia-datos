this is not a movie. it's nothing, absolutely nothing. don't waste money on this garbage, don't waste your time, keep away your children. this "movie" is one big mistake. i've seen the worst "actors" in the world, a so called "director", a so called writer. i've seen everything that has nothing to do with the idea of film. and do you know what's the worst thing about this "movie"? in 2003 it was the most popular film in Romania. it was first place in box office by the tickets sold in cinemas across country. for the people all over the world: don't put all the Romanians together. some of us are more intelligent than "garcea si oltenii" fans.
