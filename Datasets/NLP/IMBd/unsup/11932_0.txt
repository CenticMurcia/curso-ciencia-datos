I am here however to stun you all. As bad as Species 3 was, Species 4 is actually kinda fun. Thats right Species 4: The Awakening actually has some merits. Great special FX, good acting and even the expected low grade shooting styles have been stepped up. This is an MGM SciFi movie not a LionsGate SciFi movie. You can interpret that however you like.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is a young woman discovers she's actually the genetic crossbreed between human and alien. She discovers her loving uncle is in fact the man who made her, and they set off on a cross country trek to Mexico to find out why she is sick. Species is one of those franchises that has gone down the toilet very steeply as of recently and I am happy to say that although #4 is nowhere near as good as the first film was it is night and day better then Species 3. Its action packed, the FX are nicely done and their is a good enough body count to keep you horror hungry horror fans happy.<br /><br />Species 4 has a cast of B actors who do a great job at carrying the story and the level of CHEESE in the plot and characters was kept to a bare minimum making for overall a well put together made for TV sci-fi horror film. I think that folks who like SciFi Network films will love this movie and people who hate them will actually say 'Hey this ain't half bad'.
