Okay, let me start with the bold statement that everybody is wrong when it comes to the supposed "best of anime," namely, Ghost in the Shell and Akira. These are the freak-show Stanley Kubrick works of anime, and more than likely scare the HELL out of newcomers to this wonderful art form. My approach? Start 'em on some Obari. Preferably Fatal Fury (Garou Densetsu in Japan) or the infamous Gowcaizer. Sure, there's a lot of bouncing boobs and the lion's share of violence, but it's actually a pretty cool 90-minute thrill ride. I mean, wouldn't you rather see an armored hero plow a villain into the ground and blast him through some buildings than see some kid start literally exploding? Tell me, who watches that kind of sick sh-t and actually enjoys it? And where are they? Normal, plain old people like myself don't want cerebral movies. We want enjoyable movies. And Gowcaizer, while low on plot, certainly is enjoyable.
