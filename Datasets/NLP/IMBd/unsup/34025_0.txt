Fabio Testi (Four of the Apocalypse, Revolver) plays the aptly named character of Fabio, an undercover cop who's on assignment to bust a group of drug peddlers in this lesser Enzo G. Castellari directed film. I make the aforementioned statement comparably to the director's other films off course, as this one is still quite watchable in it's own right. Testi is always watchable, but this one just isn't one of my favorite films in the 'italian crime' genre. It came off, to me anyway, as a tad dated and more then a tad more cartoonish.<br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />Eye Candy: Patrizia Webley gets topless; Sherry Buchanan shows off boobs & bush
