One of the most childish films i've seen recently. From the beginning you get to see how full of cliches and stupidity this movie really is. And i'm not necessarily talking about the story, which could've lead to some interesting plot, but about the way the movie goes on and the clear intentions of the director. This is the classic tale for a kid, when you try to teach him the importance of being yourself, not what you wish to be, and the "meaningless" of trying to change. And the ending is absolutely awfull and stupid. Still some good gags now and then. Vote: 4 out of 10.
