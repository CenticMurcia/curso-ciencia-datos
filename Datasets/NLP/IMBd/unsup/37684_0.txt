I love Zombie films, shame no one seems to know how to make them anymore<br /><br />Black and Hispanic gangs go bang, bang, with a penis replacement and use words like hoe and other stereo typical so called black gangster related sayings and while they try, listening people? I said TRY to act,like gangsters, they just turn this into what looks like a low budget zombie? film, or is it a home movie made by a 10 year old using a single 1/8" CCD home video camera? Not sure hard to tell really. <br /><br />The coloring was so drained it was almost monochrome most of the time. It's only when I saw so many credits at the end I realised the 10 year old directing the film must have a lot of friends, who also must have seen the Australian film called Undead which used similar opening well sort of, but was one heck of a lot better, in fact it was good.<br /><br />Or did adults make this mess, I don't know, on the credits it looks like they had a large film crew, which makes me wonder how the hell this turned out to be such a load of pooh, 0/10 try again no gold stars for you. Films are Built on story lines people not just crappy acting and a few visual effects.
