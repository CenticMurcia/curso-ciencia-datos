This film is abysmal. The plot revolves around an Indian family living in New Jersey and the problems each of them face in integrating their traditional Indian values with fast paced American culture.<br /><br />This film is a complete void for me; I simply don't understand who this movie is aimed at. If it is aimed at first generation immigrants, then it would only scare them by preying on traditional fears of westernization. If it is for Indians who have grown up in America, it alienates them through portrayals of mindless sheep who simply follow a "white" mentality. If it is for an American population who want to understand the Indian mindset, then the complete lack of realism only serves to marginalize Indians with outdated images of false stereotypes.<br /><br />There are some superb films that exist about Indians living outside India (e.g. East is East, Bhaji on the Beach), watch one of those. Please don't waste your time on this tripe.
