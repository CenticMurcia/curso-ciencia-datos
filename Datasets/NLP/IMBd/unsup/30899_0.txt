Being a big fan cheesy 80's movies an Italian haunted house movie sounded like it'd be right up my alley. unfortunately this movie lacked everything a good b-rated horror movie should have; not much gore (I mean why else would somebody wanna watch an Italian horror flick), no naked babes, and on top of that it wasn't scary in the least. Basically the only thing it had going for it was the cool creepy music. Maybe if you absolutely can't stand clowns it might creep you out a little bit but otherwise i'd recommend avoiding this.<br /><br />GHOSTHOUSE starts off promising with a couple decent deaths but it gets boring real quick. Nothing happens for the majority of the movie and when it does pick back up towards the end it's still pretty lame. It was so boring it took me three tries to finally finish it without falling asleep. I don't usually care about plot or acting but if i'm watching a horror movie i expect the victims to try to at least pretend to be scared. Not even a chick getting cut in half by guillotine can save this one especially since you barely get to see it. I'll give it 3 stars outta 10 because that's about how many scenes caught my attention. If you're looking for a good cheesy Italian horror flickthat delivers the goods check out PIECES or DEMONS instead.
