Despite all the great talent corralled together for this film, it is a resounding dud. Warren Beatty tries to be another Cary Grant but he just doesn't have the latter's charm, elegance, and class. Annette Benning is affecting, but together the two don't put much passion or urgency in their supposedly torrid affair. About the only reason to watch this movie is to catch a brief glimpse of 86 year-old Katharine Hepburn, and this is hardly her best work. Aficionados of this genre would be better of tracking down the film on which it was based, "An Affair to Remember" (1957), with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, itself a Technicolor remake of the black-and-white "Love Affair" (1939).
