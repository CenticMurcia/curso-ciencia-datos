How anybody could rate this movie highly is beyond me. The acting is atrocious. As others have said, from the first scene on, the main character can't seem to stand and spend most of his time crawling around whining. In fact he's only able to stand long enough to yell at someone (usually the female lead) then falls down again. For those that don't speak Japanese, the dialog consists of either mindless blabbering or pathetic pissing and moaning (usually by the main character).<br /><br />The whole point of these disaster movies is to put people in a tough (but interesting) situation and watch them deal with it. In this case the completely impotent main characters refuse to do anything at all and only get through each strange encounter by combination of sheer luck, clumbsiness and "movie magic." Honestly, this movie would be better if Hollywood redid it and put Mr. Bean in the lead.<br /><br />Disaster movies do not always require a well-refined plot as they are often more about action and/or character dynamics but this film has absolutely NO PLOT. Nothing is explained at all. The other characters act completely randomly and there is no decent action thanks to the limp-wristed main characters.
