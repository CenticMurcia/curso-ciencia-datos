You'd think that with all of the money that Tonka was making selling Gobots they could come up with new and better ideas than Rock Lords. I was almost 10 when this movie came out and frankly I didn't really see what all of the fuss was about. A transforming rock shtick that was probably done because Tonka running a bit low on ideas. I can't even begin to tell everyone how disappointing this movie was to me. Maybe it was because I was a preteen and I really didn't care or it could have been because I was getting into other things. <br /><br />If I had the chance to compare this movie to the Transformers movie I'd have said that the Transformers would have won hands down. The Transformers movie was nowhere near as violent as this movie was and even then at least the writers of the Transformers movie waited until somewhere near the middle before they even started killing off characters. In this movie we see a character being killed within the first five minutes of the movie.<br /><br />Needless to say if I had 1000 monkeys on 1000 computers they could come up with a better idea than this.
