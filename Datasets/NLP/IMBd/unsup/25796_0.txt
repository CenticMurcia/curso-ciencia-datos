Run do not walk from this terrible disappointing excuse for a movie!<br /><br />If you want to see a real piece of cinema about Nuclear War, then get yourself a copy of one of the following: American movies "The Day after" & "Testament" or the British films "War Game" or "Threads".<br /><br />Miracle Mile has to be the worst Nuclear War Movie to ever be made.<br /><br />Unrealistic, Terrible effects, None existent plotlines, Just terrible...... If it comes on TV and the other channels offer nothing then just maybe watch it.... Of course Im sure you have QVC!<br /><br />
