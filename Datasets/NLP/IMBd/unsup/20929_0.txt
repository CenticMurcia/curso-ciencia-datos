a surprising hit of a movie Jim Carrey's big breakthrough. In this movie he plays the character Ace Ventura who's an eccentric popper who finds animals for people. When the Miami Dolphin's dolphin is kidnapped they hire Ace to find the animal. This movie is one of the funniest movies ever! It also helped Courtney Cox's career a lot, you must see this if you don't have a stick stuck somewhere hehe and if you like to laugh 8 out of 10!
