I think INFOFREAKO summed this up quite superbly. Couldn't have said it better myself except to add a comment about the direction.<br /><br />I am by no means an expert on matters of direction/film making. However I've watched a lot of movies in my time, a large portion of which would be listed as non-mainstream/alternative whatever you should wish to call them.<br /><br />But never before have I witnessed so subtle a touch by a director. It's as if he isn't present. It's phenomenal. The way you're allowed to just *be* with the movie. To interact with it, by yourself, without being guided or steered anywhere. Nothing deliberate or obvious or....or.... it's very difficult to describe. It just felt like one was left alone in the environment of the movie to experience what was taking place, subjectively and without interference.<br /><br />The only director I can say who has anything similar in his prowess (that I am aware of) is Scorsese, with whom it turns out Cassavetes developed the idea for the story of the movie some time before making it.<br /><br />This is a work of genius in my opinion. Nothing else quite like it.<br /><br />Watch it.... you've nothing to lose and a *hell* of a lot to gain.
