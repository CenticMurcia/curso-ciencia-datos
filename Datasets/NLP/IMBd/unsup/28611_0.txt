I completely agree with all of your comments. However, did you have any idea that the director is Richard Chamberlain's long-time partner? Do you think it may have been extremely difficult for Mr. Rabbett to direct his lover of over 25-years with an opposite sex partner? Do you think that it must be difficult for Mr. Chamberlain to act with an opposite-sex partner on-screen in front of his very own partner who is directing him in a movie? Perhaps this is why he chooses these types of romantic roles - because he is such a superior actor and is so comfortable in the role of an attractive, sexy, leading male (and always has going back to his Dr. Kildare years). Perhaps this just goes to prove what a truly wonderful and skilled actor that Richard Chamberlain is in the entire scope of reality. When you take into consideration that this man hid his homosexuality for over thirty years, giving no clues of such to his fans while taking on very macho, leading male, and romantic roles in Hollywood, it proves what a truly remarkable, gifted, and wonderful performer Richard Chamberlain is and what a true inspiration he is to the acting community. He should be commended for his lifetime achievements and for coming out of the closet. His book "Shattered Love" written at the age of 69 is a candid discussion of his anguish of hiding his sexuality to protect his image during his long career in Hollywood.
