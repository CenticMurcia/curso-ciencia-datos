I agree with the previous poster that this movie is not very believable. The problem is that I get the feeling this person doesn't realize the intended audience and never read the book. While not a faithful adaptation of the children's book, it did a fantastic job of capturing my imagination as a young child and creating new wonderful adventures in my mind. There isn't a museum or gallery that I attend without thinking about Claudia and wanting to hide out and create a wonderful adventure for myself. Yes almost 30 years after I read the book and saw the movie, I still have fond memories that are obviously lasting a lifetime. A job well done. (on the flip side, avoid the 1995 made for TV version).
