I had not seen this flick since I was a lad renting any movie i could get my mitts on. I recently watched it on movies for men! and enjoyed it as a passable time waster. Two cowboy buddies go from blowing up banks in the old west to fighting in the Great War. The action is what we want and luckily thats what you get with tons of explosions and some cool aerial dogfights against a humongous zeppelin. There are real planes used over the lush British countryside but a lot of scenes are back projections and do not convince but are fun. This is a boys own B movie with derring do at the forefront. The Germans are boo hiss and the cowboys gung-ho. It reportedly had a Â£12million budget. The film is full of inventive ideas but doesn't hold together to well. The cast does okay with a secondary role for Nicolos Lyndhurst(Only fools and horses) as Chalky. If your a B movie fan of the eighties chops away. It would make a nice double bill with Biggles - Adventures In Time.
