Well, I think just about everyone agrees Rachel McLish had a much better bodybuilding career than an acting one. In this Class B action film, she's the female equivalent of Arnold in his first action movie, "Conan The Barbarian." Of course, Arnold made an incredible career out of his acting and has gone on to bigger and better things. This was it for Rachel, acting- wise. Oh, well, at least she was a two-time Ms. Olympia winner.<br /><br />To McLish's credit, she looked good in the film which was made when she was about 40 years of age. How many 40-year-olds do you know are in the shape this woman was here? And, in her defense, the person who wrote the dialog for this film didn't help her out much. The screenplay is really lame. Not many actresses would look good with dialog this dumb.<br /><br />Basically, what we have here is another simple revenge tale, and not one that is well done. Not recommended.
