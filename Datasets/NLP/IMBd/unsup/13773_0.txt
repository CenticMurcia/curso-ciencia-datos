Stephen Verona co-wrote and directed this story about an elderly married couple living in a decaying New York neighborhood near Coney Island who refuse to relocate despite escalating crime and racial tensions. Low-budget film from I.T.C. doesn't have an exploitation gimmick (on the level of, say, "Death Wish") to lean on, therefore it didn't reach many audiences. Both Lee Strasberg and Ruth Gordon do first-rate work, but the glumness of the concept and Verona's need for his slim plot to come full circle to make a point results in a very depressing experience. Janet Leigh has a smaller role as the couple's daughter, and her eagerness with this dramatic material is heightened by Verona's unsubtle handling (it isn't one of her better performances). The picture stays in the mind through a few pointed scenes and images, but "Boardwalk" is too static to make a greater impact. *1/2 from ****
