I cannot believe anybody but dull-witted Hanna Montana fans might like this stupidity. I actually thought the commercial for this movie was better than the movie.<br /><br />1. How does a guy who is afraid of heights catch a freshly-cut-off flying thumb thrown from a dying homosexual from 30 feet below? I was expecting the token gay lisper to say "Nice catch!" before slipping into the liquid....<br /><br />2. How many times have YOU been been bit on the butt by a wild rat while crapping in the desert? <br /><br />3. At least the talking computer didn't say, "Dave, I feel it!" <br /><br />4. Do eagles frequently drop bloody rats on groups of soldiers? <br /><br />5. Was the dark-haired female scientist a sapling from the tree of Algore? Because she was about as wooden.<br /><br />Why is it that Hollywood chooses to remake perfectly good movies and then make them worse when they do? I think they are smart enough to stay away from certain sacrosanct material, such as Casablanca (can you imagine the all-black soul version starring Eddie Murphy as Sam, Ilsa, Rick, and Laslo?), Gone With The Wind (although that stupid sequel Scarlett was bad enough to try), etc. But why even do these idiotic remakes? Have these writers really run out of ideas? Did someone put alcohol in their blood surrogate? <br /><br />How many unnecessary "luv" sequences are there in this movie? " To boldly go where no man has gone before" oral sex preview; wooden actress and lead scientist; reporter dude and pothead desert chick; even the "don't ask, don't tell" gay reference about not having a date.... come ON! Can you possibly make a movie without gratuitous sexual ANYTHING in it, unless it is the weather report? AND did you notice that the two heroes who die-- the gay guy and the Chinese guy-- are our E-N-E-M-I-E-S? One for the homophobes, one for the xenophobes!!!! The only redeeming feature of this movie were the very cool forward-looking computers.
