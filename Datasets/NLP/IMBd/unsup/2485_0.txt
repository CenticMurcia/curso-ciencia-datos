A Hammer vampire movie directed by Jimmy Sangster, let me get through this proper review as quickly as possible before getting to the main reason I love this movie and rate it so highly.<br /><br />It's not the best Hammer movie and the tale, all about an infernal clan who can avoid death and then feed off the blood of the living, is nothing that unique. The setting (an all-girl school) is enjoyable enough for male viewers and the cast, for it's time, even throws is something to keep the ladies happy in the presence of dapper Michael Johnson. Others appearing include Ralph Bates, Barbara Jefford and the very pretty Suzanna Leigh.<br /><br />But they are not the reason for me wanting to see this movie for years and years. Oh no, not at all. That dubious honour belongs to the one and only Yutte Stensgaard. A woman so beautiful that I pined for her long before my young mind knew quite what I was pining for (having only seen her in pictures and never managing to have caught her on screen). Her acting skills are quite, quite bad and she doesn't have much in the way of actual personality but, good grief, Yutte remains one of the loveliest women I have ever lusted after in movie form and is absolutely the right choice for a film with this very title. Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder but it's my eye and my decision to rate this particular Hammer horror a 7/10 based on little more than my enjoyment of the woman I have been smitten with for many, many years.<br /><br />See this if you like: The Vampire Lovers, Twins Of Evil, The Hunger.
