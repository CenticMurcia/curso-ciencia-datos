Although not an original Stephen King story, but based on characters created by Stephen King, this old school vampire movie is Larry Cohen's sequel to Tobe Hooper's "Salem's Lot", and it's a very good horror movie in it's own right. The special effects and make-up art are pretty neat, and NOT done with computers. Of course you must be a fan of low budget horror movies to enjoy a movie like this. The players, especially Michael Moriarty, did a great job. There are no holes in the plot, it's a good vampire story, and you can have a good laugh too now and then. For instance, when Joe Weber asks his son if he can drive a car, Jeremy answers "Yes, I often borrowed Allen's Mercedes". If you payed attention earlier on, you saw Jeremy's stepfather Allen in a bumped up Mercedes. Very nice, I enjoyed it a lot.
