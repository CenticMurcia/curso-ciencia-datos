They say that MANOS is the worst movie that MST3k has ever shown, I beg to differ. I'm not just saying this to get it through that this movie is a piece of trash, I actually mean everything I'm going to say. This movie is so awful it's unbelievable. I never thought anyone could make a movie that I actually hated as much as this heap of garbage. There is absolutely nothing scary at all, except the fact J.P. Simon made this as a serious film. The acting, dubbing, directing, dialogue, producing, editing, anything you can say about this is in the poorest quality. They couldn't even use the right opening credits for the re-release, they had to use choppy scenes of "The Galaxy Invader" for no reason at all. Why would anyone in their right mind actually want to see this without Joel and the bots? Who would want to see this in its uncut, subtitled version? Who would want to see this at all. Scene for scene, much worse than "Plan 9..."
