This is one of those little obscure and ridiculous yet fun horror movies from the eighties.The basics.Someone is going around committing horrid murders,turns out it's a gang of strange creatures that live underneath the Golden Gate bridge.What are these creatures?Why are they there?Well that is never answered.They are either humanoid or zombie looking.You have one that looks like a zombie solider,a weird apeman looking thing,a strange Native American monster and a few others.It also just so happens these creatures can be killed with water(why would something that is endangered by water live under a bridge?)and a group of teens know this and decide to stop them.That about sums up the plot of Neon Maniacs.<br /><br />The film itself has the bad acting and ridiculous plot you would expect from this kind of movie but it is pretty entertaining and pretty original compared to a lot of the horror at the time.The Neon Maniacs themselves were pretty interesting as well.It even has a few parts that will probably make you jump.If you can find it and want some pointless entertainment I'd recommend this one.
