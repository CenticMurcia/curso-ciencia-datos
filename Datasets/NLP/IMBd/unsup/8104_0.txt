This was a great British film that deserves a good pat on the back. Not only did the film put together such a wonderfully presented cast that went together so realistically, so precise(including the sexy Joseph Fiennes), but it was a fantastic film with an original and laughable plot (which is better than seeing the same story over and over again). A great film that I enjoyed immensely.
