This movie is horrible. Avoid it. The storyline sucks, and the only redeeming quality would have been seeing Neve Campbell nude, and even those scenes are UTTERLY disappointing. A pathetic attempt for Neve to revive her career. I guess this was supposed to be "artsy", but it missed on that level as well. If Neve was going to do a nude scene, she should have done that in "Wild Things", but apparently she refused to do that. Even the sex scenes are about as erotic as watching grass grow. Do yourself a favor, and don't waste the money even for a rental (as I did). This movie is a complete clunker, and was quite frankly boring. The cameos by such "has-been stars" as Mike Tyson, and Lori Singer make absolutely no sense and add nothing to the story (if you can call it that) whatsoever! One star out of 10.
