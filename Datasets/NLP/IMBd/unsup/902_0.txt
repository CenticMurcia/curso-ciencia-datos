A bunch of film makers are headed to a remote island to shoot some sort of love story movie. SPOILERS AHEAD! There are the actors and actresses, the director, the screenwriter, and the producer. The film crew was going to get there. One of the actors is found boiled to death in a swimming pool (apparently, this wasn't an accident). This scares the filmmakers. Then, on the day when the filmmakers come, the ship that the filmmakers are on explodes, killing everyone on board, and leaving the filmmakers trapped on the island along with the killer. The killer seems to have a fetish for this rock song. Its like Boil Me! Burn Me! Saw Me! Chop Me! Nail Me!Stab Me! Each murder is related to the song. The beginning has a women shot on the same island as the filmmakers are. You don't know who she is, why she's there, or why she was killed. This is a good movie but the killer is so obvious. It's revealed at the end but it's obvious half way through. One very disgusting chainsaw murder made me feel sick.
