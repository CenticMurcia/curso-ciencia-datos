When you watch you WILL cheer for the babysitter and the husband. The wife is a horrible beast of a woman. This should be kind of a cult movie if nothing else. You will hate her for minute one. The cheating husband is likable. There is one saving spot in the movie when you think "I wish he would do this or that to that witch and HE DOES".<br /><br />I am watching this right now with about 20 or so minutes left and do not know the outcome. I just hope it is that he leaves his wife, sues for full custody of his kid and builds a life a with the babysitter.<br /><br />That is my hope... which is a lot to ask in the last 20 minutes of the movie.
