I suspected a movie about a soldier trying to find his courage in the civil war, filmed during (and reflecting the values of) the fifties, was not going to be very good. But I'll rent anything. I found it bewildering and narratively weak. Somehow the movie chooses not to deal with the fact that Henry is fighting for the wrong side morally and historically. So his heroic effort to win big for the South never really became my own goal.<br /><br />I couldn't find my interest in his skimpy story if I had a civil war ree-enacter sitting next to me. Scene after scene of Audie trying to pull it together, and it can only end one way. ...in his triumph over his wussiness. Gee that's deep. <br /><br />Because Huston made so many movies, his fifty/fifty hit-miss ratio produced a lot of hits. But the list of duds is equally impressive; Annie, Moby Dick, Key Largo... but nothing is as abhorrent as Reflections in a Golden Eye.
