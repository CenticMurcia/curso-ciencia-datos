Well I had heard this show was on at various time over the past couple of years. It was interesting seeing it. I do know Brian somewhat and know he has a "sketchy" past. What I didn't see in the show, ( and it may be mentioned in his book - which I haven't read) is where is his actual first wife? Pam isn't wife number one, he was married before to a girl named Sherrie. He has two kids with her named Candy and BJ. Where are they? TLC, do a follow up and investigate him a little more. Don't focus on the polygamy, see what kind of con-artist this guy really is. It's a shame Pam has to put up with this guy, and the other's as well. What a crock!
