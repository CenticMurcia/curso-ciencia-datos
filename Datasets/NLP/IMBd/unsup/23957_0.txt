It's a very good and rare old style kungfu movie with a slightly slow start after the first fight scene with Lau, but gets a lot better very quickly. Lau Kar is a real kungfu practitioner for many years with knowledge and experience in this particular style of kungfu, so you will see rare footage of fight scenes you've never seen before and more realistic than a lot of other good movies. With funny bits that actually make you laugh, and a variety of scenes all splashed together to make a very good movie, But most of all, everyones in it for the fighting scenes if you like kungfu movies I guess, and thats the reason why it's one of my favorite's. it's more traditional and I would recommend it to any persons collection.
