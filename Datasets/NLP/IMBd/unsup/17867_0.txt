I've ready some comments by other IMDB users that have disliked this movie. I don't want to spoil the movie for you, if you in fact am reading this but have yet to watch this movie.<br /><br />I loved the movie. This is NOT your standard slasher-type-horror movie. Go watch the movie for yourself. Have an open mind and remember, you're watching it for entertainment. (ie. don't nitpick every little detail)
