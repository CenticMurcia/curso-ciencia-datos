OK, OK I'll tell you. Pretentious. Predictable. Preposterous. Exhibit A: cop finds out his pretty but sulky witness has attempted suicide several times, turns around and leaves her alone in his flat with his one and only gun, then goes after a serial killer without any weapon, gets mauled in the process, survives the ordeal, chases the killer a second time, this time still without any weapon... And just when you think it can't get any dumber than this, well, that's exhibit A, and as Picard puts it, "Plenty of letters left in in the alphabet"<br /><br />A thinking person's movie? I suppose it could be. I suspect a lot of people who spend their working hours thinking actually like to switch off their brains when they come home after a hard thinking day's work.
