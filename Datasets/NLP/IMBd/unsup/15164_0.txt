The Beastmaster himself, Marc Singer (presumably having now lost his telepathic affinity with animals and subsequently washed up and looking like a right scruffy old sod here!) headlines in this action(less) entry as maverick cop (yep, clich√© territory, full steam ahead!) Mike Justice, a man who doesn't play by the rules.....etc. etc........yawn. To be fair, Singer puts in a decent performance as always and is additionally backed up by a good assembled cast which includes the consistently excellent Steve Railsbeck and the perpetually menacing looking Tommy Lister but sadly, none of them are given anything of remote interest to do here in what amounts to be an entirely bland and predictable effort. If the truth be told, if not for the high level of violence, swearing and some brief nudity, I would have sworn this was a mundane made for TV movie. Oh well........you have been warned.
