This movie did more to explain, use, and get characters out of, time travel paradoxes then anything I have ever seen on the screen. This movie BLEW ME AWAY with how it handled what had seemed like a goofy premise when the flick had come out. I have now watched it from beginning to end on three occasions, and it continues to blow me away. The casting of the father and son in 1969 and the present day are great, and watching the son unfold with every change in the past is wonderful. Why this movie didn't even get nominated for a Hugo Award (the awards given by the World SF convention each year) amazes me- it should have won the award.
