Ode to Billy Joe is a great coming of age movie about a young man who obviously has homosexual tendencies in the early seventies. This of course was unheard of then but is celebrated in our modern age. Robbie Benson (Billy Joe) was not raped as others would like for you to believe, but rather explored his true feelings. Many individuals have used alcohol and drugs to try to escape their feelings about the way they truly feel. Sadly sometimes they go to extremes to hide their true self as demonstrated in the ending of this great American classic. It is sad that this is a reality for some individuals who don't have the support that they need to live a wonderful and happy life.
