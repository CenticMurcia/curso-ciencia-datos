OMG this film was so awful that it was funny! The dialogue was the poorest I've ever seen! The acting was even worse! The director - where was he?<br /><br />It's not surprising that the writer and director John McBrearty has only worked on this film, and no other! the guy hasn't a clue! nor has his wife who co wrote this piece of trash!<br /><br />However if you want a pi$$ take out of a film, and have a few laughs along the way, then watch it purely for this purpose alone! I managed 30 minutes and that was just because I was in shock!
