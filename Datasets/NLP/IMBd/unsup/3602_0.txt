wow! i was quite pleasantly surprised by this film. Andrea Bianchi, known by most for his enjoyable, but goofy BURIAL GROUND/LE NOTTI DEL TERRORE directed this exellent gory and sexy thriller.<br /><br />a woman dies during an abortion, so the doctor takes her back to her house and sticks her in the bathtub. soon after, the doctor as well as her fellow employees at the albatross fashion studio are murdered by a motorcycle helmet wearing killer. the lovely Edwidge Fenench, a veteran of the giallo, tries to solve the puzzle before she herself is murdered.<br /><br />this film is quite stylish, and compared to most gialli, it moves along at a brisk pace. gory murders and full frontal nudity keep the viewer interested, and the story is fairly easy to follow, and almost plausible. the comic relief, which in my opinion Dario Argento is terrible at, but insist on putting in damn near all his films, is actually funny here. a fat guy who can only get it up with a blow up doll, and the ending where Edwidge says that she doesn't have to worry about getting pregnant because she takes the pill, then her boyfriend says they shouldn't risk it .....<br /><br />i would highly recommend this film to trashy film fans.
