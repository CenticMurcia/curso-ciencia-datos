I think that this is the best computer game ever made. It was very hard to stop playing this game when once started. Really liked this game because of the great story. This is absolutly a game for people who like mystery and adventure. A lot of great puzzles also, so you have to use your brain very much.<br /><br />You play as a P.I named Tex Murphy in the year 2042(or something like that). You're hired to find a man named Thomas Malloy... but that is just the beginning...everything becomes more complicated than that...<br /><br />
