A sheriff(John Schneider, really stuck with some corner one liners when he blasts the monsters)must contend with several large crocodiles which are eating locals. His past lady-love, Helen(Sarah Lafleur), an animal conservationist, along with an egotistical wealthy hunter(Sam McMurray)and his sidekick Ahmed(Joe Holt)will assist the sheriff in his duties to take each croc out. They try to pry knowledge about these crocs from Sadie Bickerman(Cloris Leachman, the only thing that works in this film is her nasty loathsome character who loves the crocs more than people)who loves her "babies" and seems unwilling to give them jack squat. Making matters worse is that the sheriff's son(Chad Collins), and his love-interest Kerri(Alice Ziegler)are fending for their lives after a couple of the crocs devoured their high school pals.<br /><br />Leave it to the always reliable Sci-Fi Channel to drop another rotten giant monster movie of low quality in our laps..this one having the misfortune of being a sequel to the entertaining B-movie that came out year back from writer David E Kelley and director Steve Minor. While that film had a very enjoyable cast consisting of Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt & especially scene-stealing Betty White(..Chloris plays Betty's sister in the sequel), this sequel has no-names with limited ability to even convey a minuscule of charm. It could be because the dialogue is so laughable and special effects so poor. How can anyone, much less Schneider proclaim the quip, "Afterwhile, Crocodile!"and make it work?
