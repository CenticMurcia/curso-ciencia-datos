This is the best epic movie of all times until now.Great actors,beautiful music and very good work from the director.I have seen this movie almost 50 times and i never get bored to watch it.It takes away from this world.It takes you to other places that only in our fantasy we can see.This movie is not just a fantastic story about King Arthur,it also contains very good messages for those who can see them.The higher you go - the farther you'll fall!The only thing that i can not understand is why all of the actors(expect Helen Mirren)did not continue with great movies after that and they just move aside making movies(BAD movies),that no one knows.
