Wow, see this film as soon as you can and as many times as you can! It is worth it just to see Black Flag's punk rock supper star Henry Rollins in this now cult classic. This film kills and puts your mind on a stick to shock and awe you into submission. It is the perfect date-movie if you don't like bugs and you do like blood, booze and boobs. John Gulager is the next Alfred Hitchcock for the Y-Generation. This film marks the return to the screen of the Director's brilliant Father, Clu Gulager, it is as if "The Last Picture Show" met "Phantasim" on No-Doz & DMT. This film has more depth then "The Blair Witch Project" or "Shawn of the Dead" and it's just as brutal and sick as "Jacob's Ladder" but funnier then the fire extinguisher scene in the French film "Irr√©versible". This is the vomit-fest magic roller coaster ride that horror fans still go to the front row of a theater to see. So enjoy this well crafted vis-queen splattered masterpiece that the Director, Production Designer, Cast and Crew worked so hard on. Remember that this movie was made with the added stress of a reality television show looking over their shoulders. Ultimately though it is the performance of Diane Goldner, the real heroin of both this film and the TV show, that made this the first big hit of "Project Green Light" and I eagerly await her return... in the up coming "Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds" (still in production) as the Biker Queen this time instead of the Harley Mom in "Feast"(2005).
