Dil Chahta Hai was an amazing movie for me when I first saw it...and it's still one of my favorites. It deals with the youth in India, the transitions they go through, their love lives and most of all, friendship. Farhan Akhtar is brilliant, and this will always be one of his master pieces, no matter how many movies he makes in the future. The movie starts with the present, with Dimple Kapadia being admitted in the hospital, and then a flashback sets in. Farhan Akhtar has created the characters of the three main protagonists with a lot attention to detail and thus, has created characters that the youth in India can relate to. The protagonists are not extra-ordinary heroes, nor are they spoilt brats. They are just normal young Indians with new ideas raised in affluent families. They have the right blend of traditions and modernity. The movie consists of a strong plot, good characters who are believable and yet, interesting. The songs of the movie are excellent too. The picturizations and script is great. Overall, a well done movie with good acting from all the main actors - Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Akshaye Khanna, Preity Zinta, Sonali Kulkarni and the ever beautiful Dimple Kapadia. A must watch for anyone.
