SCREEEEEEEEEEEEECH!!!!! SLOW DOWN NOW!!!!! The trailers for this movie made it look like a suspensful mystery/thriller, but it sure as hell wasn't that. This film had the plot similar to that of a movie of the week, and that exactly what I felt like I was watching. When I think about it, there was no way to market this film, it just is so flat and un-interesting. Talent was wasted, so was money. This same movie could have been made for 3 million without doubt. It simply is trash, I was sucked in by previews promising a suspense ride. Cheap Hollywood trick to bring in the money, it is Hollywood trash.
