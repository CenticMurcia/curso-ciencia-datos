Ever since the first time I saw this movie, I have loved it. Even considering it was a low budget movie it was still a very good story and very well acted. I even like the roaches. My favorite part of course is the Landmaster vehicles it was and still is one of coolest movie vehicles ever made. There was even a Saturday morning TV show called "Ark II" (1976) TV-Series 1976-1979 that used the same concept for their vehicle and there have been other movies that used the same basic design for their stuff. some people don't like the ending, but I for one thought it is just fine, when you consider other movies like The Day After Tomorrow (2004) the ending is fine. I for always watch this movie whenever it on TV. One of the cool things is to watch two actors Jan-Michael Vincent who of course did Airwolf and George Peppard who was also on TV about the time doing The A-Team both in the movie is awesome. If you like, sci-fi flicks that entertaining then watch this movie and make up your mind.
