Meryl Streep is always an amazing actress but there is no depth to her character nor to anyone else's. She plays a sadistic, bitchy boss who makes impossible demands to a young woman who gets the impossible done out of nothing more than fear. If there is determination to make it (or as Streep's character infers because they are so alike) it is not apparent. There is almost no plot. Even the NY Times had an article stating that no one in the real fashion world would dress like these people. No plot, no character development and no real fashion. It was a big disappointment. It was unclear if Streep's superficial relationship with her children was because she had no life outside of the magazine or because she was indeed that superficial.
