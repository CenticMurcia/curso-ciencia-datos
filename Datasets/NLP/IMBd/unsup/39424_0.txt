My suggestion to anyone who is going to see this movie: Expect it to SUCK! The movie will in fact turn out a lot better if you keep that thought in mind. I actually to some extent enjoyed this movie, it was a perfect way to waste some unneeded time. And it most certainly was MUCH BETTER than Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, and I thought it was going to be worse since it was a Direct-to-DVD. It had its moments, some funny bits, many Stupid scenes, and it kind of gave me a Kentucky Fried Movie or Robot Chicken feel, but definitely not as good as either.<br /><br />Remember to think negatively and the movie isn't as bad as you think.
