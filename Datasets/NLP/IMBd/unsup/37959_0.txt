Recently I saw this movie at the San Diego Latino Film Festival and I didn't like it. the thing is that I didn't care for the story (if there is one) for me it's was way too boring. First of all Maria Conchita Alonso is a famous for just being famous, but she is NOT a good actress or worst yet she is not an actress And I don't get Kuno Becker I never liked him when he used to do telenovelas and I don't like him now, he's not handsome or talented or nothing at all. So don't waste your money with this movie, it's not worth it, I think it's time for the latinos to do other kind of movies, something we can all feel proud, and stay away from this kind of stories that are just boring
