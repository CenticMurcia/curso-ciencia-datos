okay what made me mad was her utter lack of common sense. Have wolves harassing you? build a huge circle of fire wood surrounding your camp, keep the fire burning that way you will not only deter the diabolical doggies but also provide smoke for rescuers to see. Thirsty? if they can eat the dogs then why not go ahead and drink the blood. Then towards the end I guess she is just tired of dragging him and dogs looking at her so what does she do to her beloved new husband, who when they are rescued could lead a normal life with what there able to do with prosthetics these days...smothers him for no apparent reason just as a helicopter is in the distance. Also the stupidity of climbing a precarious cliff and leaning way out holding a shaky rock on the most narrow ledge of the climb not even halfway up to wave your cell phone around is begging for disaster. I thought this may be a decent survivalst movie, but your much better off watching man vs. wild episodes.
