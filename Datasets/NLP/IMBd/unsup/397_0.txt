This ride was made in 1987, and therefore is based entirely on the original Trilogy. Anyone who expects anything from the much later added first three episodes obviously can't be very bright. This ride was WAY ahead of its time when it was new, and is still a great ride and lots of fun.<br /><br />As to why there would be no Jedi Knight, Sith Lord or light saber fight, well, this ride is called "Star TOURS." The entire gist of the ride is that you are on a space tour bus. R2D2 is co-pilot, and many of the other original Star Wars characters are throughout the ride which includes the waiting area.<br /><br />REX basically takes the passengers of his ship on a trip around the Death Star almost exactly identical to that of Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars movie. Anyone who doesn't get that, obviously can't be that big of a Star Wars fan, although you definitely don't need to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy this simlulator.
