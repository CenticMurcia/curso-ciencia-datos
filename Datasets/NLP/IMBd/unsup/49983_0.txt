A group of young American tourists visit Ireland to experience magic mushrooms. Their Irish guide, Jake (I don't claim to be an expert on the Irish accent butÂ…was that an Irish accent?!) takes them deep into the woods to hunt for the psychedelic fungi and enjoy them as nature intended. Before they even make it to the camping spot their vehicle hits an animal and they run into two creepy redneck types. When they reach the intended spot, one of the first things their buddy Jake does is take away their cell phones. After regaling his group with some creepy local legend stories over some tasty mushroom tea they are off to do some hunting. Although warned to not consume the Death Head mushroom one of the female characters does exactly that. Each character has their own unique "trip". Some of these episodes are actually pretty entertaining. Meanwhile our death head shroom girl is freaking right out and having vividly horrific visions of her friend's deaths. Then we get into this whole dodgy is it real or isn't real scenario. In the end, which many will see before it comes, is a very lame and empty conclusion. The group spends a lot of time bickering, and don't seem as though they should eat dinner together never mind traveling half way across the freaking world to do mushrooms. The characters are disposable and you really don't care who dies next. The deaths are pretty unimaginative particularly considering the whole stoned aspect. They really could have gotten more creative here. And as I mentioned the ending is just so weak. The landscape is lovely, the production value is decent and there is some gore. It had some potential but it failed to deliver.
