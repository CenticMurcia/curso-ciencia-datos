I really like this movie, it reminded me of "Demon Knight" and it's just as great as "Demon Knight." I really think that Corey Feldman is a sexy and cool dude! He's really cool in this film, and he was cooler from "The Lost Boys" and I think he's still the Prince of Scary Movies. He's also really good looking in his older age, I betcha all the girls, even his wife thought he's till good looking. Dennis Miller could be funny or should I say, "Damn Funny!" Thank you for the comment. I do believe that they should continue on doing the scary tales from the crypt.<br /><br />Signed, element_pharaohs
