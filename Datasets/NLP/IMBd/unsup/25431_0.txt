Obviously the only people who have something sooooo against this movie are the people from iowa. Did you people see this movie in the true story section of the library or something? What gives you the idea that the film was not supposed to be fictional?! This is one of the funniest "whiteboy" comedy's of the 90's. I am white and did not find this movie offensive or degrading at all! I think this is a good example for the "wannabe" gangstas out there!GET REAL!
