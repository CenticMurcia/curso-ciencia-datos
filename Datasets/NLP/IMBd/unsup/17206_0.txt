One of the all time great nostalgia films presents a bigger than life look back to the early 60s. Its hard to view this movie 20-20 given the widely viewed subsequent series Happy Days which, while excellent, lacked the excitement and charm offered in the film. The soundtrack is wonderful and the Wolfman clearly demonstrates that a good voice can be hit you more directly than visuals given that you don't see it coming. I would have preferred it if Lucas has continued in this direction rather than become overly enamored with special effects in his subsequent films. Harrison Ford was fine as a young actor, although his acting skills did develop considerably in later years.
