Should have been used in this travesty. It had a huge beginning extremely short middle and a short end. It was written so badly you couldn't even tell what was going on. also the whole alternative reality thing has been used so much in Sci fi its not funny and this had no right to use it!. Tim allen was terrible in this and martin short was a dork!. again it had a 90 percent of kids in it. and abigail breslin only had 1 line in it lol she is the biggest thing in Hollywood and they give her brother who cant act even if you gave him a billion dollars to. the only person in this film i liked was......hmmm im trying to think......nope cant think. so this Christmas i advise you to watch the snow melt or if you really need to watch a good Christmas comedy movie watch national lampoons Christmas vacation.
