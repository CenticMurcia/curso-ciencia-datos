A rare, perfect, and hilarious movie that uses every comic device; two of the funniest moments are when a young Broderick Crawford and later Edward G. get hit by a car. Besides the starring roles of Robinson, Wyman, Brophy, and Crawford, you'll find Jack Carson and Anthony Quinn (very scary as a really mean felon!) in supporting roles. Even the character parts are played by the most recognizable character actors in Hollywood: Harry Davenport, one of the Founders of Actors Equity, John Qualen (Casablanca, The Searchers, and a thousand more films) Grant Mitchell, Andrew Tombes, George Meeker, William Hopper (Paul Drake of Perry Mason fame), and a very young Jackie Gleason. Even the Uncredited roles were played by actors like Lucien Littlefield, Pat O'Malley, and Ziegfeld Girl Kitty Kelly.<br /><br />Woody Allen used this plot as the basis for his "Curse of the Jade Scorpion," also a very funny movie, but too long, too loose, and not as perfectly perfect as "Larceny, Inc."
