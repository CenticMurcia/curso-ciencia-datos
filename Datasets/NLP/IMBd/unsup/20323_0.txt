This film deserves far more attention.<br /><br />The acting is quite believable, the cinematography is excellent, and this is far from an amateur-grade straight to video production. Though some parts are genuinely funny, this is *not* a comedy, and it's not horror in the conventional sense. If I were forced to package it into a easily-digestible category I'd call it a modern fable.<br /><br />The film obviously borrows heavily from Greenaway-- his favorite themes, the artistic composition of shots, even a Nymanesque minimalistic score all betray this influence. Conceptually, it's very similar to Masamura's "Blind Beast." See this film. I gave this film a 10 not because it's perfect, but because the pitifully low rating nearly made me overlook it.
