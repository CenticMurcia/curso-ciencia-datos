I was hesitant for a sequel to the shocking Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, which was both graphically and psychologically disturbing. It seems that the shock and psychology of the first gave way to boring dialogues and less-than-effective acting. Perhaps the producers were hoping to cash in on the cult-following of the first "Henry".
