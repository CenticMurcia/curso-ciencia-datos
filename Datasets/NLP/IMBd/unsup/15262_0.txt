This Charley Chase short has a rather silly plot but because the film was written so well and Chase did a great job pulling it off, the whole things works very well indeed.<br /><br />The film begins with Charley being asked by his friends to come over to play poker, but Charley is a bit henpecked and refuses--though he really did want to play. The next day, he and a friend are golfing and Charley tells a big fib to explain his great golf shot--he says he hypnotized the ball! The friend doesn't believe it a bit and demands Charley hypnotize him as well. While Charley is doing his spiel, a stray ball hits the friend in the head--knocking him unconscious. As a result, he and Charley both think Charley has the power to hypnotize! Later, Charley decides to try out his new-found powers by hypnotizing his wife. Unbeknownst to him, his wife was the one who hit the golf ball and knew that Charley was no hypnotist, but decides to pretend to be under his power to teach him a lesson. Charley tells her under "hypnosis" that she is "good time girl who would let him go play poker". Once "awakened", she does tell Charley to go out and play poker AND she proceeds to act like the life of the party! Ultimately, this culminates with her going to a nightclub and Charley thinks she is still hypnotized--however, try as he might, he cannot awaken her! This is a cute little comedy short and one of the better Chase films. See it and have a laugh.
