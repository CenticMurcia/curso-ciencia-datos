Having just recently returned back from South Korea, teaching grade school English for 2.5 years, I can relate to the predicaments the characters have in this film for their reasons in wanting to learn the English language.<br /><br />I especially loved the performance of actress Lee Na-Young in the role of Candy, and found it to be absolutely hilarious. As an attractive actress and a popular commercial model, it's so far-out seeing her dressed-down and wearing plain makeup to portray this hopelessly out-of-luck, clumsy girl, who has to learn English so that she could communicate with western customers who arrive at her office with their problems when it comes to their monthly bills.<br /><br />There's also a romantic subplot -- more of a romantic triangle -- with Candy pining after a guy named Elvis in her English class, who Elvis in turn is trying to go after his Australian English instructor Cathy. Elvis also has problems of his own, because his interest in learning English is to better communicate with his long-lost sister, who was given up for adoption in America due to his poor family finances many years before...<br /><br />You can totally tell that this film is the first, and probably the only one of its kind in South Korea, highlighting the recent English craze, where adults want to learn English to better improve their business English when it comes to international business, and students learning English through expensive English academies so that they could either study abroad/or live domestically and enter top-notch universities.<br /><br />Even in the DVD supplements, you get a whole variety of fun-filled quizzes about the film, cast/crew/director interviews, and even reactions from Korean fans and Korean celebrities who attended the premiere of this film.<br /><br />As I make my plans to return to South Korea for another tour of duty of "English Curriculum," I can refer to this film for its hilarity and hijinks in the everyday world of the difficulties of mastering another language.<br /><br />This is a very funny film that I highly recommend, and for originality it gets a grade of 9/10 from me. :)
