<br /><br />A strong beginning segues clumsily into a dark and confusing middle.<br /><br />- Plot devices spring up out of thin air, with little rhyme or reason. EG, the powerful daddy, the buddy with nautical connections, ad nauseam.<br /><br />- For most of the film, the lead actors seem to swallow the majority of their lines, which are anyway spoken so low as to be unintelligible. If I hadn't had closed captioning, I wouldn't have understood half the dialogue. Is this a thing with "artsy-house" films?<br /><br />- Does Gabriel Byrne have narcolepsy here, or does he simply wish he were in a more intelligent movie?<br /><br />Too bad, if it had kept up with the strong beginning, this could have been an excellent film. What a waste of talents like Robert Loggia and Bob Peck.<br /><br />Summary: better than any sleeping pill.<br /><br />
