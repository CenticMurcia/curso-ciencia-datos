I've never enjoyed romance as a genre, but ever since I saw this movie ages ago, I've been enamored of it. Tom Hanks is absolutely adorable (moreso than in Big, in my opinion), and although I almost always have more respect for the male than the female character in movie relationships, Daryl Hannah manages to be whimsically charming and a perfect match for Hanks. Its sweetness is unadulterated by awkwardness, unlikeable characters or cliche, as the majority of romance flicks are. All but guaranteed to reach the most hidden soft spot in almost everybody, and with enough clever wittiness for the rest.
