I first watched 'Tokyo Cowboy' at a film festival in Troms√∏, Norway, and at that time considered it one of the best films I have ever seen. Now, 12 years later, I have gotten the DVD (after a lot of struggle...) and re-watched it. The conclusion is the same, in spite of the many films I have seen in these 12 years. This is a top-ten for me. Delightful story which combines humor and depth. The much-more-talked-about 'Lost in Translation' does not come up to this one, but 'Translation' is of course not a bad movie.<br /><br />One could say that the wisdom of 'Tokyo Cowboy' is a bit simple and obvious, yet these themes one cannot discuss and dwell over enough. To find oneself in this complex world, "the road in my heart" as the main character puts it, will never go out-of-date. Highly recommended, watch it! You will not be disappointed.
