Jack Stone is following in his father's footsteps. His trade is to find "missing heirs", that is those people who inherit money from relatives they never heard of, etc. Jack's take is a third of the cash. But, the IRS is not his friend. It seems Jack only filed a return the year he work for Mickey Dee's and has not bothered to submit a tax form since. He asks a longtime friend for help and dollar bills but is given a by-the-book accountant instead, a man named Everett (Wallace Shawn). While Jack is snooping around, trying to find a particular wealthy heir, Everett is trying to make sense of the man's financial records. Both of them land in way over their heads, as unsavory characters wish to stop them. Will it end well? This was a silly movie that started off nicely but ran out of horsepower very early. Yes, Shawn is one of the most delightful character actors to ever grace the screen and he tries very, very hard to make the material work. However, the rest of the cast is as uneven, although Jack is handsome and there is a lovely lady in the film, too. It is the script that bombs. It has more loose ends and hairpin turns than anyone can imagine and the dialogue is most mundane, too. The production values are not high, either. If you like Wallace Shawn, sit down for the first half of the film and enjoy a few moments. But, don't feel compelled to finish it. This is a forgettable film for all but the most undemanding of viewers.
