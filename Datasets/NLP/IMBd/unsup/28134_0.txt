The only reason this film should not receive a 1(awful) is because the story is so grotesque it draws you in till the very end. After that it is nothing more than a snuff film hidden amongst dramas and horror flicks. The acting is poor except for the mother which only stands out for portraying insanity to the extreme.<br /><br />What surprises me the most is that this movie was playing on standard cable in the middle of the afternoon during the summer. When selecting this movie to air they should have picked a more appropriate time, say at night when all kids should be asleep. It received an R rating for a reason. Parents be warned this is not for children.
