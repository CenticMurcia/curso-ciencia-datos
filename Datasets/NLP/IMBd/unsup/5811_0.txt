Another 48 Hrs. starts as two vicious killer bikers Willie Hancock (David Anthony Marshall) & Cherry Ganz (Andrew Divoff) ride into San Francisco looking to carry out a hit on Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) who is soon to be released from prison. Meanwhile detective Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) for the past four years has been trying to discover the identity of a powerful drugs dealer known as the Iceman, after a shoot out with one of the Iceman's men Jack finds a picture of Reggie & figures he can help him find the Iceman. Reggie is released from prison & a hit is made on him but he survives while Cherry Ganz decides to kill Jack to avenge his brother's death but a bullet proof vest saves him, Reggie & Jack have no choice but to work together to unmask the Iceman & stay alive long enough to do it...<br /><br />Directed by Walter Hill who returns from the original 48 Hrs. I actually think Another 48 Hrs. is a better film than it's predecessor on just about every level. The script by Jeb Stuart, John Fasano & Larry Gross is a more balanced film, it moves along at a tighter pace, the action scenes are better, it still has plenty of amusing one-liners but has thankfully dropped the racist overtones & there's just more going on. From the problems Jack has with internal affairs to Reggie having to pay someone off who kept him alive in jail & from the mysterious identity of the Iceman to the fact that Reggie is now a free man & doesn't have to work with Jack just make Another 48 Hrs. slightly better than the original. On the down side it's nothing particularly new or original & while it's not a complete rehash of the original it can feel pretty similar at times & there's just so many buddy buddy cop flicks out there Another 48 Hrs. has sort of gotten lost in the crowd somewhat. Personally I liked it, it has plenty of bad language, one-liners, decent set-pieces & fights & a bit of mystery surrounding the plot although it's not that hard to work it out.<br /><br />Director Hill does alright but the film looks & feels a lot like the first, the action scenes are well handled & it's suitably profanity ridden. Brion James has said in an interview that Another 48 Hrs. ran for something 140 minutes originally & that Paramount cut huge chunks out of it including a lot of footage with him in it which I find very easy to believe, James name is third in the opening credits yet he comes across as a glorified extra. Interestingly James is third in the opening credits while Murphy & Nolte come first & second although unlike the first film Murphy is now credited first & Nolte second which says something all on it's own. The violence isn't too strong here, some gory gunshot wounds a & some punch ups is as violent as it gets but at least it's a solid 'R' rather than a 'PG'.<br /><br />Apparently this made near $20,000,000 in it's opening weekend which I would imagine is a decent amount even for films released today so it's maybe a bit puzzling a third 48 Hrs. flick wasn't forthcoming. It's well made with that big budget Hollywood feel & look to it, again set in San Francisco it was again like the original partly shot in Los Angeles. The acting is good with the two leads having a good on screen chemistry & Murphy in foul mouthed mode is pretty funny to listen too, Nolte is alright but seems to be going through the motions somewhat.<br /><br />Another 48 Hrs. is a throughly enjoyable 90's action flick full of bad language & violence of the sort they just don't seem to make anymore which is a shame but there you go. I think it's a slight improvement on the original & a solid action flick in it's own right, worth a watch for sure.
