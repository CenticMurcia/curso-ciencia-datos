Yes, everyone, Rick Moranis is pretty funny. Steve Martin- pretty funny. The plant's voice- pretty funny. None of them funny enough. There is pretty much one part of the movie that actually makes you laugh, rather than asking you to laugh as charity. This is the Bill Murray cameo, in which he goes contrary to everyone else's reactions to a dentist, is hysterical, and makes one marvel at how a part with little or no lines can be that funny. However, I suggest you mute the television whenever they start singing. Whoever plays Audrey, combined with Rick Moranis, sounds like cats being tortured. Whenever a musical number finished, I would sigh with relief that a moment of horror was over. It's good enough to watch if you are planning on performing in the musical, but not a good leisure activity.
