That 80's show was so promising! That 70's show was a lot much too teenage (not that I didn't like it though) but the 80's one was soooo more adult! There was no Kelso like (the basic dumbass) they didn't play much on the "foreigner" side of "their Fez". And Tuesday guys!!! God I wish they kept going on with them! Starting with this unbelievable quote: (Tuesday):"So I'm punk. Deal with it!" (Corey): "You're not punk! You're retro! See, punk was like 6 years ago, and I know. I was at a Sex Pistols concert while you were listening to the Bay city Rollers in your Barbie jammies!" Oh! vlam! in your face !!! Seriously this show could have lasted more if Americans had my sense of humour (ahaha! Yeah I'm getting a little magelomaniacal so what?) Please someone must have really liked this show as much as I still do?
