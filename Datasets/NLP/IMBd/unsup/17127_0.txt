For the last decade the Turkish cinema has been just churning out low-down comedies like Kahpe Bizans and Gora. This movie which has been called the Turkish Cinema Paradiso is one of those rare smart examples out of Turkish cinema.In the 60s in a small Anatolian village Recep and Mehmet are two youngsters, working as apprentices in a small town near their village. Recep helps a watermelon vendor, while Mehmet works with a barber. Crazily in love with cinema, they spend their evenings trying to make a makeshift film projector. One day, Recep meets a widow with two daughters who lives in the town and has come to pick unripe watermelons for her cows. Frequently visiting their home from then on to have tea or breakfast, Recep starts liking the elder daughter, Nihal. As for the girl, she is disturbed by having a peasant boy around the house and treats him as rudely as she can though she is also pretty much interested in catching attention of Recep. Her younger sister Guler, on the other hand, likes Recep, but the feeling is not mutual in that case.Towards the end of the movie we see the watermelon vendor selling all of his product by telling a one-liner: If you build up your ship out of watermelon you will sink down fast.Recept cannot be together with Nihal either because they turns out to have moved before he opens his feelings. So much to dream so little to realize!Impressive but not perfect! The two young actors look artificial at some points though their general performance is satisfactory enough! nevertheless this movie deserves acclaim on the grounds that it's not a potboiler produced out of commercial concerns!
