This movie's got plenty of star power there. Henry Winkler of "Happy Days"; Shelly Long of "Cheers" fame; Michael Keaton way before "Beetlejuice" and "Batman". He was a total riot! Winkler plays Chuck Lumley, a lowly morgue attendant who used to work for Wall Street got stuck doing the night shift with a very wild and outlandish partner named Bill "Blaze" Blazejowski(Keaton) who happens to be businessman wannabe. Lumley has a next door neighbor named Belinda Keaton(Long) who happens to be a prostitute. She and several others needed a way to make the money, while avoid two pimps who taking more than their shares of the profits. The two morgue attendants decide to turn the city morgue into the ultimate brothel. They made the prostitutes dreams come true with items they can only imagine having. Lumley and Blaze call themselves, "Love Brokers", and it worked. The competition starts to heat up, and they get the surprise they'll never forget. Especially when the other's gun goes off prematurely on his foot! Though Lumley had a low key, but when Belinda came into his life, he became stronger and puts his foot down on those who pushed his aside. This movie delivers a sense of bolster, and self-assurance. It's a lot of fun, I enjoyed it very well. 3 out of 5 stars!
