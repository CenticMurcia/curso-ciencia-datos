This movie is among the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen ( and believe me I've seen some real -reel? turkeys). The script appears to have been written by mentally disturbed monkeys the night before shooting (probably while they were getting stoned). The plot would have been mildly amusing for a ten minute skit on SNL, but was painful to sit through for any longer than that. Bill Murray has, in prior films, had moments of comedic brilliance but unfortunately this was not one of them. Murray,Wilson, Blanchette, Goldbloom, Huston, a stellar cast with no where to go and nothing to work with - what a waste of talent and time. The inane dialog and indifferent acting compliment the non-script, incoherent plot, and undisciplined direction. Anderson & Murray ought to be ashamed. I want my money back!
