Polish Vampire in Burbank is the story of a reluctant vampire Dupah (Mark Pirro) who has never sucked blood from a victim before. Up until now his father and sister go out on the hunt and bring him back left over blood, so they decide it is time to send Dupah out to start feeding himself. He lines up a victim Delores Lane (Lori Sutton) on his first night out but falls in love with her and respects her too much to bite her.<br /><br />This film is so clever and witty that I was laughing aloud the entire time. The film was ahead of it's time and I think it couldbe more appreciated now than it ever was as the humor is not outdated at all. The clever writing and the funny dialogue when the story associates Dupah's first bite which losing ones virginity, like when he is scared to bite someone and says what if my fangs are too small.<br /><br />Very well acted by the entire cast, especially by Pirro who was the last minute replacement for original lead Eddie Deezen. Pirro used the footage he shot with Deezen and created a new character in flashbacks with him and also provides quite a few voices for some of the characters who were not available for adr recording. This film is a landmark and I believe created it all in terms of no-budget film-making. It was essentially made on the run and grossed $500,000 with an outlay of just $2,500. Brilliant!
