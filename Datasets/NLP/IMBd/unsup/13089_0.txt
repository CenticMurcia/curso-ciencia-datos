Despite my girlfriend dragging me to its advanced screening in NYC, I was most pleasantly surprised with "Waltzing Anna." Sure, it is a great chick flick, but it was actually more than that. It turned out to be a very well-written comedy with a nice dramatic edge. Artie Lange, Howard Stern's side kick, was hysterical and played well with the female lead who I immediately recognized from "Entourage" as E's girlfriend. The male lead was very convincing as an ethically challenged Doctor. I'm sure we'll be hearing more from him very soon with his top notch performance. With appearances by J. Eddie Peck from "All My Children" and the old Judge from the Clint Eastwood spaghetti-westerns, the cast was of great support to a funny script that was well shot. If you enjoyed "Hitch," you will most certainly find "Waltzing Anna" well worth your while. It will remind you of "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" meets "Patch Adams!"
