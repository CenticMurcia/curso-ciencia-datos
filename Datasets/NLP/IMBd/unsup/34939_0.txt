The sequel to the movie "Romancing the Stone", was for me just not very good at all. Where as Stone was a well-paced, funny action movie in this one there are many periods of dullness. Danny DeVito is the only highlight to this one, as once again his character is great. The plot really kills this one though as it just isn't as fun as the originals. It involves some sort of ruler of a Middle Eastern country who wants Joan Wilder to write about him or something. She agrees and parts company with Jack Coltan. For some reason the ruler tries to kill Jack, by blowing up his boat, and this only sends Jack after them. Once in the country Joan begins to realize that the ruler is not as good a guy as he wants her to think. She runs into a guy called the Jewel of the Nile who I think is supposed to be the real ruler of the country. Meanwhile Jack and DeVito's character learn of the Jewel of the Nile from this people and mistakenly think it is some kind of real jewel worth money like in the first movie. Some good sequences here and there, but really nothing all that great. A good scene involving a jet and anther with Jack and Joan hung over a pit are pretty good and for me the highlights of this one. This movie just didn't appeal to me though like the first one...who knows; maybe I prefer jungles to desert.
