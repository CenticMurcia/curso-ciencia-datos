This movie is by far one of the best urban crime dramas i've seen. Omar Epps is a great actor, but the show stealer has gotta be Tupac, his performance is so realistic. Bishop is one of my favourite bad guys in these kind of movies. this movie is the perfect example of Ernest R. Dickerson's skill for making movies in this mould. The scene where Bishop guns down Radamez is a thrilling scene. But the best has gotta be when Q(Epps) fights Bishop on the rooftop. Tupac's expressions are scary in some ways because of the things he does to his friends. Omar Epps is one of the most under-rated actors i've ever heard of, he plays the good guy pretty well, and kicks Bishop's ass in it. Of course this movie has one flaw, the ending is kinda dead. Where Q, after failing to save Bishop from falling to his death is told, he's got all the juice now, he just shakes his head and it shows a flashback from when Bishop was his friend, we wanna know if Q and Steel get away with robbing the liquor store!
