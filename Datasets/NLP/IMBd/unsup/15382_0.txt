I can't believe that "Kingpin" is getting thumped in the ratings by the usual sludge that nets like Fox dumb us down with every night. I think "Kingpin" is simply too hip and too ethnic for the masses. Well, it's their loss. I think the show is riveting, intriguing and I'm really looking forward to the next episode, but I am disappointed that "Kingpin" is just a six episode miniseries as opposed to twelve or more. BTW, Marlene is somewhat of a babe, but I wish she'd quit giving Miguel advice because he is obviously the most cerebral and wise of all those competing for domination of the cartel. Since NBC owns Bravo now, maybe they'll continue new eps. of "Kingpin" on Bravo next season if the ratings merit it. That would definitely bring some life to a network that most certainly needs it.<br /><br />Mark
