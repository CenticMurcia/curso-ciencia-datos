Watched it on TV, started to wonder why others liked the explosions. Just a bad movie all around. They must have a lot of money in Hollywood to go ahead with this movie. I would like to read plots of movies that did not make the cut because they must be really horrible if this movie got made.<br /><br />'The Postman' was a great action flick next to this.
