Where to begin on this pile of dog plop? The DVD cover, that's a good spot. The DVD cover has a picture of a giant ape, an ancient temple and three big helicopters. One, the ape looks nothing like the DVD cover and there is no sign of the Helicopters or the ancient temple. So right off the bat the movie lies to us, lie number two. The DVD box claims that this movie and King Kong was based on the lost world. There were no big monkeys in the Lost World. Now that we are done exposing the lies of the box let's move on to the movie itself. The CG is a joke, the story doesn't make any sense. If they were over South America, how did they get on an island? Bruce Boxleitner played a Government agent looking for a downed military plane with a nuke in it. Once they find it, what does he call in PLANES! When he knows full well from his own experience that planes don't work there. That was just stupid. SPOILER WARNING, Bruce Boxleitner blows up the nuke killing the big monkey. Leaving two people trapped there with no hope of rescue. It's stupid, it's deceitful, it's just a waste of your time. But the one I truly feel sorry for is Bruce Boxleitner. He's better this this pile of puke. Bruce, what the hell were you thinking? THE NOOSE!
