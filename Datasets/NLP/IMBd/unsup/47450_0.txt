I would compare this film with a painful root canal I once had...but I wouldn't want to insult my dentist.<br /><br />I base my opinion on the following...the film contains:<br /><br />- bad acting (and to wit; bad casting) - bad writing - bad camera work - bad directing - bad editing<br /><br />and BAD accents. I noticed Catherine Charlton was listed as the dialogue coach. she also worked with Angelina Jolie on a number of films. this explains a lot.<br /><br />if forced to say something nice, I'd have to say that there are nice horsies in the film. yay for nice horsies!<br /><br />the director of this film, Reverge Anselm, also wrote and directed the execrable "Stateside". I'd appreciate it if he would never be involved in making a film ever again.
