Hmm, where have I seen this before? A lonely spinster blossoms after finding love, but nobly sacrifices it in the end. Unfortunately, "Winter Meeting" is no "Now Voyager". I don't care how many cigarettes Bette Davis smokes! <br /><br />At first I was intrigued by how mismatched Susan (Bette Davis) and Slick (Jim Davis) are. She's a cosmopolitan intellectual, very much in control of her emotions, her every movement purposeful. He's a small-town boy, speaking bluntly, quick to indulge his feelings and impulses, and towering over her with his gangly, awkward frame. It could've been an interesting story of opposites attracting, and learning from each other - each supplying what the other lacks. Except, I never quite believed his attraction to her, and it seems she was the one who did most of the learning and changing. Sure, he got something out of their affair too - but it was primarily the knowledge that he helped *her*, thus giving him the confidence to become a priest and help other people. I don't think that counts.<br /><br />I disliked the scene where Slick lectured Susan on her inability to forgive her mother. If MY mother cheated on my father with countless men, then left my dad and literally drove him to madness and suicide - well, gee, I don't think I'd forgive her either! For someone accused of lacking compassion, Susan is surprisingly forgiving of Slick, however. She's only a little offended that this man she just met is judging her and blaming her for supposedly driving her mother away - You see, Susan wasn't as loving and tolerant as she "should" have been. (Reminiscent of "The Philadelphia Story", where a daughter is held responsible for her father's philandering, and has to learn to forgive his failings and give him more affection so he won't feel the need to stray. I didn't like this twisted "moral" in that movie, and I don't like it here either).<br /><br />Besides, where does this guy get off being so high and mighty and, well, *preachy* when he's far from perfect himself? If he was so dedicated to becoming a priest and abstaining from sex/marriage, he shouldn't have pursued this woman so aggressively and led her on. Big dumb oaf. Slick's feelings don't appear to run very deep, so I just can't see this movie the way we're meant to - as a bittersweet tale of soulmates who can't be together - oh what a tragedy! Rather, Slick had a nice holiday/sex-spree ...um, I mean, crisis of faith... before knuckling down to work. He's not hurting. Susan on the other hand... should be feeling very used. I worry about her. After all, heartbreak-induced insanity and suicide *does* run in her family.<br /><br />Bottomline: Slow, soapy, unsatisfying romance drivel.
