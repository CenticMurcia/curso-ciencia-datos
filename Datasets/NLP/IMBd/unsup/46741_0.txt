In fact I would never waste time to write on such a bad film. But since the director Steve Miner had a place on all horror movie lovers' memory by directing "Friday the 13th" 2 and 3, I want to say a few words. After all those years without shooting a blockbuster, Miner gets a cast which is above average, gets a decent budget, he also gets the name "Day of the Dead" (being a remake of George Romero's original one from 1985). The sorry thing is that he blew this chance. The main reason being that; Romero's original film has been affecting all horror movie makers for years, describing some standards for this genre. Everyone is familiar with this realm. Yet, Miner successfully lacked a single spark of unique interpretation, let alone adding anything original. Result: Nothing will thrill you, unless you are 12...period! Which reminds me my new opinion again: I think less movies should be made. The more they make, the less we care...
