This is a very good example of what a documentary of a musician should be: music, private life, beliefs, we really have the illusion of entering in her life. The difference with Truth Or Dare and this latter shows how much Madonna has changed in this last decade. But let's talk about the documentary: it opens with the pop star choosing her dancers and it's a very good beginning. Then there's a bit of politics: she asks her troupe not to vote for Bush and even Moore is interviewed during a live show of hers. The political part it's very short indeed while a lot of space is given to the artist's new belief: the Kaballah. The final part shows us Madonna in Isral talking in front of an audience of the importance of peace and the need of a better future for all those children with guns in their hands. The movie ends with two boys of two different religions holding their hands. It's very touching. There are of course some performances ( but not too much ): the stunning and stylish Vogue, the strong anti-war American Life, the moving Lament and Mother And Father and much more. Of course some Madonna detractors would find it pedant and pretentious, but the artist gives us a lot of beautiful and meaningful messages with this documentary and every one has seen it, has the impression that if we want we can make a better world. Really worths!
