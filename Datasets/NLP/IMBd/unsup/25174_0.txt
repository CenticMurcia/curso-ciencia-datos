The film opens with this hot chick stripping down completely nude and starting to take a bath. I thought, "Oh boy, here we go." A few seconds later she hears something outside. She says, "Who's there?" and runs outside the room (scantily clad, mind you) to see who it is.<br /><br />She's chased outside by a homicidal maniac and runs through the woods, her robe falling off and revealing more pointless nudity. Finally she lures the monster into a circle of gunfire from a SWAT team who finally manage to kill Jason (apparently repetitive gunshots make him implode on impact).<br /><br />Then this balding man pats the half-naked girl -- who is now revealed to be a brainy cop -- on the back and says something like, "Good work, Sergeant, we'll get a promotion for you!" Meanwhile she's standing around naked with only a robe.<br /><br />For a moment I thought to myself, "This is either going to be the worst movie ever made, or a clever parody of its predecessors." I mean, either the whole nudity part with the female cop was just there for the sake of nudity, or it was a parody of the fact that every "Friday the 13th" movie has at least one scene of gratuitous female flesh.<br /><br />Unfortunately my first assumption was correct. This is an awful movie. It only gets worse and worse as time goes on. It's entertaining, sure, in a so-bad-it's-hilarious kind of way. The characters are all clich√©d to the point of nausea and the killing scenes are so standard it's like doing a paint-by-numbers, it's already mapped out for you ahead of time.<br /><br />This isn't the worst film ever but it's certainly a very bad, cheesy, poorly acted, amateurish title in the "Jason" series and the fact that it was indeed NOT the last "Friday the 13th" film is rather ironic in itself.
