I can't believe people actually take this movie seriously. This has got to be one of the out and out dumbest films I've ever seen, if not ever made. Willem Dafoe prancing about to classical music, unbelievably stupid gunfights, horrible dialogue, Willem Dafoe cross-dressing. This is really a heap of garbage. And I love bad movies. In fact I like watching you're average B-movie trash more than the boring mainstream crap put out by the big studios. But, this movie is incredibly bad. If it was regarded as a "so bad its good" movie, I would praise it up and down. But, to watch it in the context of your friends telling you that it is a legitimate good film makes it one of the worst pieces of junk ever. I seriously can't believe that many of my own friends, who otherwise have good taste, consider this a good film. This is crap, and that's all it is.
