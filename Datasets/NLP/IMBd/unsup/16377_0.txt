This movie is by far one of the all time greats. It is pure genius fom start to finish. This film will have you in stitches from start to finish. Set in the American civil war, Johnny Gray goes on a one man mission to get his beloved train and girlfriend back after both are stolen at a routine stop. Buster plays a wonderful part with some outstanding stunts. Unfortunately this film is out of it's era and finds itself hard to be appreciated in todays society. Still a worthy watch though.
