Just read the last post on here and the person who posted it was saying how much they would love to own the DVD. Well, I got it,3 disc boxset,off ebay and it came from Australia,costing me a mere Â£21. So I just thought I would share this info with you as I had previously tried for years to get hold of this fantastic little known miniseries without success.Remembered watching it when it originally aired on BBC in 88/89 and since then it has always stuck in the back of my mind as aone of those "Must own" series. But now you know from someone who physically has it, it IS available on DVD. If ebay don't have it for sale,a trawl through the net may be in order but to be honest I would have paid twice as much to get hold of this. If I had any gripe with the series it was probably the absolute bad luck that befalls Mr Eastwick throughout his life seems to be never-ending.As smart as the ending is,I couldn't help but feel gutted for him at the way events had panned out and hoped it would give a happy ending.You will just have to watch all 8 hours of it if you have never seen it before to find out what happens. Like the previous entry said,have a box of hankies ready.I hope this helps any prospective owners out.
