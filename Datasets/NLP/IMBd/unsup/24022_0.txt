Because the original, with Caine as Carter, was so good, I thought that this would be an interesting update. Change the country to the U.S. and Seattle becomes the city "up north." <br /><br />Stallone mumbles his way through the movie. Plot is impossible to follow. No need for the teen-age daughter to have her dark secrets. Evidently the story is supposed to lead us to a Bill Gates type. Not good.<br /><br />Good to see Michael Caine though.<br /><br />I own the original. Would never watch this again. In the original Caine was shot for his troubles. Stallone should be shot for botching up a terrific idea.
