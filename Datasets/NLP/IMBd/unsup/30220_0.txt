the plot is not enough to justify a 90 minutes movie but for a 20 minutes television sketch. The actress Candela pe√±a does it very good, but actor camara doesn't fits with the fisic-du-role for a porno star. The funny situations are better achieved than the dramatic ones.<br /><br />The first half you expect for a lot of possibilities the subject could be developed, but it never does. When the sign "the end" comes, you think that something is missing, it's not possible an ending like that, maybe the deadline are the only explanation for such a sudden end, when you're still waiting for something that justify the movie.<br /><br />The recreation of the seventies atmosphere is achieved, and the music helps to that goal. You can see it, if you want a light comedy without many pretensions.
