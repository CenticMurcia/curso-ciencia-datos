viewed movie as NO GOOD DEED: I found the plot to be somewhat plausible, however, there were many errors in the movie. Samuel L. Jackson (character Jack Friar) is believable, though not one of his better movies. Milla Jovovich (character Erin) is an extremely shallow character. Jack Friar is looking for a blond-haired, blue-eyed male, and Doug Hutchison (character Hoop) thinks it is him -- however, Hoop is dyed blonde-haired with brown eyes. Poor cinematography in rain storm -- view of characters inside a car through side mirrors in a torrential downpour -- I have never seen a vehicle with clear side mirrors in a rain storm. Another very poor item is the Canadian border crossing is shown as Sudbury. This is an insult to Canadian viewers -- Sudbury is at least a 9 hour drive NORTH of the US-Canadian border. Shame on producers -- filming in Montreal Quebec and didn't know enough of Ontario's geography to be at least plausible. Sorely disappointed that Samuel L. Jackson would let his good name be associated with such a poor quality movie.
