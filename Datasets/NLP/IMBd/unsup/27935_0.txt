After watching the slick and creative promos and finding out about the gargantuan star cast, my expectations for this movie were sky-high. Having six/seven different stories, you can't judge the movie as a whole. The first story was extremely scary and had very effectively used great sound effects. The Vivek-Nana story was interesting. Saif's story was very creepy and freaky. Aftab's was cute and shocking. Not to mention, Aftab was awesome in his brief role. Now the other two stories went a wee bit overboard. The homework story made absolutely no sense (well, neither did the others), but this one wasn't scary. Now, Shilpa's story was just crossing the limits. It was absolutely ridiculous! What reaction am I supposed to get after seeing people turn into apples? Come on, man! It would have been better if there were a couple of the tracks in the movie. They were really good and would have given a break. The ending was absolutely stupid. This movie was more bizarre than anything else. Sound effects were amazing, and this was a technically excellent movie. By the end, I had had enough of these weird stories. Maybe next time, there should be a more realistic story(ies)line.
