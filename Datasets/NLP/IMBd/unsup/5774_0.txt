Hello there, I just did come home from visiting my parents.<br /><br />When at my parents house,"Blessed Stranger"just started. Normally I disgust pulp movies.. so I also was thinking of this movie the first minute. What actually made me keep watching was the score/soundtrack. Even after 10 minutes the music mesmerized me, it sounded like "Hans Zimmer's - Gladiator,(Lisa Gerrard). I had to leave already after 30 minutes but those 30 minutes of movie where enough for me to understand that "Blessed Stranger" is NOT a pulp movie. It is not over-acted and the characters are for "real". I am going to hunt for that OST! SO, anyone who can help me with that?? Just let me know. Cheers and thank for you minute.<br /><br />Bye . Peter
