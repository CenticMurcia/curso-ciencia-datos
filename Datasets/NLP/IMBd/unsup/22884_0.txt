This film made a huge impact on me when I saw it as a child. The relationship between the two protagonists was realistically portrayed and helped me have a more mature attitude to love and the sacrifices it may involve, as I was growing up. The beautiful songs 'Sunshine on my Shoulders' and 'My Sweet Lady' (sung by John Denver) stayed with me long after the film vanished off circuit. Many images from the film persist in my memory too. It was an authentic representation of the effect of a terminal disease on loved ones, and although a tear-jerker, ended with hope. I also learned that cats can sense death - a useful fact I guess.
