Good film comedy is having just enough of a plot to hang some jokes on. In that respect `A Man Called Sarge' definitely qualifies as a good comedy. However it also qualifies as a good comedy for another reason: it's genuinely funny. It's not clever funny, or deeply thought provoking funny, it's good old fashioned throw a bunch of jokes against the wall and see what sticks funny where you can see that the cast was having a good time making the film and as a result the audience has a good time watching it.<br /><br />Will it ever be considered amongst the all-time great comedies? No it won't, but it's definitely a good way to kill an hour and a Â½.
