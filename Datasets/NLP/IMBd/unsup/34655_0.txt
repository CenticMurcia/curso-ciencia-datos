Oh boy...this has got to be one of the biggest turkeys I've seen lately.<br /><br />Apparently, this is supposed to be a serious thriller, but I found it hard to take it seriously for a single moment. First, the entire cast is acting extremely poorly (the accents of the main characters are incredibly fake, and just about every single performance is over the top). Characters act in totally unbelievable ways (the famous nazi hunter isn't the least bit interested when somebody tells him about a serious nazi plot, the apparently calm and sophisticated Dr. Mengele nearly strangles somebody to death for no reason) and just about everything else, up to the overly dramatic score, is exaggerated. <br /><br />Secondly, there simply isn't enough plot to fill a two hour movie with (it can be summed up in a single sentence), resulting in a very slow movie with gives you plently of time to reflect on how utterly silly and far-fetched the story is. To make matters even worse, the flimsy plot is over-explained to the last detail, ruining any mystery there might have been.<br /><br />"The Boys From Brazil" is an overblown, exaggerated thriller that I really couldn't take seriously for one moment. Slow moving, poorly acted and silly in the extreme, I think it can only be enjoyed as camp.<br /><br />*1/2 out of *****
