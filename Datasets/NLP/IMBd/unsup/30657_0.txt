I have completely enjoyed every single movie that Paul Hogan was in. He is a comic genius. I find it unbelievable that this particular movie is not available on DVD. His movies are not slap stick or like anything else I've seen. The things his characters do is just incredibly funny. Even years later when I remember something he did I can't help but laugh. This particular movie was funny as well as heartwarming. When he picked the fight with the guy in the wheel chair I thought I would bust a gut. But, he was just trying to prove a point. When he was shot with the gun loaded with blanks you start to worry, will he do something stupid and end up dead, or is he really an angel. My all time Hogan favorite. It has everything, romance, comedy, and will bring tears to tour eyes. I can't wait to find this movie on DVD.
