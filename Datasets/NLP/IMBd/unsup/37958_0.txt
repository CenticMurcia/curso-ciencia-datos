Another formulaic and soppy dino-quest with absolutely awful songs. The insistent preaching of the series is thankfully toned down, with the emphasis on a slightly more exciting adventure that recycles the perils of the previous films, like falling rocks and sheer drops. A villainous crocodile and bird add a mildly dark tone, to not much effect. It's all slightly something or mildly something; without the sophistication and layers that make, say, Pixar's films so engaging for all ages, this is strictly kids' stuff, and curiously old-fashioned to boot. I suppose an hour of pleasant entertainment won't do them any harm, but make sure they clean their teeth afterwards.
