This was a wonderful movie. Primarily due to Dorian Normand's wonderful performance as Snitch #2. My wife and I led an 8 week discussion group with some of our friends. There some heated battles resulting in several law suits and a divorce. However, everyone agreed on one thing: the plot followed the wrong hometown hero. Snitch #2's emotional growth receives almost no attention at all. He, of course, is instantly lovable, yet almost unknowable. Nonetheless, the year and a half I spent writing redrafts of the script in which Snitch #2 receives the recognition that he deserves was one of the best times of my life. No studios nor independent film makers were interested, but I felt like I had made a difference. I saw this movie in the afternoon. That evening I watched a performance of The Cherry Orchard with Peter O'Toole and Emma Thompson. I left at intermission.
