I was simply enchanted by seeing this movie. From the beginning till the end, it captivated me. And I must note that Belgian (not French: Belgian, it is quite not the same!) cinema is the best one: remember "Man Bites Dog" (French Title: "C'est arrivé près de chez vous", means "it occurred just near your home")! The authors, worthy heirs of Jacques Tati ("Les Vacances de M. Hulot"/"M. Hulot's Holidays", "Mon Oncle"/"My uncle", ...) , give us a movie full of poetry and refined humor. It is pure fantasy, all you got to do is to let you go to it! Go and see this movie, quickly, and if it does not play in a theatre near you, come and visit Paris or Bruxelles... You'll be able to see it!
