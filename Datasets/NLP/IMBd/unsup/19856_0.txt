Not bad not good this movie is a 1001 rip-off of Stranger in the House and many other to date, but with a twist. the actors act like there acting in quicksand also it remind me of Home Alone 15 years later... All in all it o.k to watch if you have nothing to do and I do mean nothing.. One more thing if you're Brandon Lee fan, the main actor could pass for his long lost brother bad-actor-Lee... Bruce Lee be glad this guy isn't your son.....
