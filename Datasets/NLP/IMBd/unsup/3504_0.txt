I'm fine with filmmakers adapting books to the screen and doing what they need to do to make the source material cinematic. But I'm always mystified by filmmakers who adapt a book to the screen and change so much that it's nearly a completely different story. I wonder why they wanted to adapt the book in the first place if they felt that so much of it was inadequate.<br /><br />This is a terrible adaptation of the wonderful Graham Greene novel, that even a dynamic performance from Maggie Smith in the title role cannot save. George Cukor directs this film like it's a relic from a different decade. Yes, the main character is stodgy and stuffy but that doesn't mean the movie has to be. And by the time the ending has rolled around, all vestiges of the source material have vanished completely, an unforgivable crime in my opinion when working with an author as great as Greene.<br /><br />Grade: D
