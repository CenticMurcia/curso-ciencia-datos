I am in Greece Europe and watching EVERY episode, I am a strong woman with a career, I'm 34, about to get married and FINALLY a show SHOWS how it is for a woman, and the way she has to deal with things.<br /><br />FINALLY something that does not betray my intelligence as sex in the city did, of which i maybe ever saw 3 episodes- couldn't stand it. (it was a ridiculous show... such as desperate housewives is)<br /><br />FINALLY something that feels real and not from a different world. It is VERY natural, I love Brooke Shields and Lindsay Price and Raver, they are just ... one of a kind, EACH of them. The photography,...real, perfect, inspired.. I hate Brooke's husband in the show but again,(his character is pictured somehow like having a low IQ, which of course is something that can happen in life and shows her making a compromise - am sure she somehow is wishing deep inside shed have a husband that is more active from the start and not this "sorry", "shyish" boy-man that wakes up suddenly to realize he wasn't taking care of himself and blaming everybody else!.<br /><br />THIS is the first time i think this has been portrayed by a man in a sitcom, i mean in this honest way - a man, in the position a woman usually is/or was, after her kids grew up and shes there suddenly having no plans in life, being angry that she didn't foresee this day coming - because she didn't take time to work or achieve her personal goals, in order to take care the rest of the family. <br /><br />So convenient for men to look away from this wonderful story. <br /><br />Oh Lindseys man, he is also in this difficult situation. finally men with feelings, but like they are in reality. not all the same and flat like in other sitcom or movies. the casting Couldn't be better..... (again except Brookes husband which every time i see him somehow, i feel he is overacting the role.. but it might also be that i hate whiny men/roles and this is maybe the point in his role)<br /><br />so many feelings... it would be TOTALLY be a shame to cut the show.<br /><br />thanks for reading my thoughts... I love lipstick jungle couldn't live without it.<br /><br />oh ,. and Lindsey price in her role..... the most beautiful charismatic role / woman / visual.. replaces all the fake and empty Barbie dreams i maybe once had as a little girl.<br /><br />KEEP THIS SHOW ALIVE PLEASE!!! I love it. ..
