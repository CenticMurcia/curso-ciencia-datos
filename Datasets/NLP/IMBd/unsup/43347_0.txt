I have seen a lot of Indian movies which were copied from some real good Hollywood movies. Some though they were copies of Hollywood movies but still worth a watch. Like Kante (a mixture of Usual Suspect, Reservoir Dogs and heat), Musafir (a mixture of Confidence and U-Turn) and a lot of other titles. But this movies which is one of the most pathetic copy of Snatch. Most of these B rated directors they go to a DVD store, watch the movies and translate it in there own language to make a new movie. Well anybody who has not seen this movie i will suggest don't waste your money. If you have seen snatch and liked it you will be really disappointed to watch this. Somebody should inform Guy Richie about this mockery. I definitely believe that most of the actors in this movies have seen Snatch what i can't understand is how do they agree to such a non-sense. Well only one more thing for everybody in bollywood They should try to do some original work cox that's what they are good at. Stop ripping others ideas and embarrassing yourself by making such crap.
