If your after a comedy - this might be your cup of tea.<br /><br />If your after a high quality 'fake-o-mentry' or mockumentry horror... this isn't one of them either. I'm not sure the footage itself even knows what it is.<br /><br />In the 1970's a great 'fake horror doco' was made called "Cannibal Holocaust" - the latter is a great example of how these shows in this genre should be made.<br /><br />In the 'so called' films defense it is strangely engaging - but in a bad way. In a way like when you are really bored and find yourself watching "days of our lives" just cos the 'over acting' is quite odd.<br /><br />This is what it is - Odd.<br /><br />If you love films - do not go out of your way to see this. It may even offend you its that bad.<br /><br />If you stumble upon this on TV at 3AM and you cant sleep, then you might find yourself getting through half of it before you get bored and fall asleep.
