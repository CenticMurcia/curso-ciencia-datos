Jennifer Ehle was sparkling in "Pride and Prejudice." Jeremy Northam was simply wonderful in "The Winslow Boy." With actors of this caliber, this film had to have a lot going for it. Even those who were critical of the movie spoke of the wonderful sequences involving these two. I was eager to see it.<br /><br />It is with bitter disappointment, however, that I must report that this flick is a piece of trash. The scenes between Ehle and Northam had no depth or tenderness or real passion; they consisted of hackneyed and unsubtle latter-day cinematic lust--voracious open-mouthed kissing and soft-porn humping. Lust can be entertaining if it's done with originality; this was tasteless and awful.<br /><br />Ehle and Northam have sullied their craft; they should be ashamed.<br /><br />As for the modern part of the romance, I was unnerved by the effeminate appearance of the male lead. Aren't there any masculine men left in Hollywood?<br /><br />The plot was kind of interesting; with a better script and a more imaginative director, it might have worked.<br /><br />1/10
