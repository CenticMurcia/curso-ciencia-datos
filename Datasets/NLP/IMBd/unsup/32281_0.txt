I just watched this film. The story itself was explained in the others comments, so i wont focus on that. Let me just begin somewhere else. For starters, the lead actors are very beautiful, lots of sex scenes. The main actor reminds a bit on Tom Cruise from Top gun, and the lead actress a bit to Paz Vega. I predict those two, will star in Hollywood films very soon. It would probably be rated NC-17 in USA, or at least a very hard R. Especially because of the pubic hairs, lots of graphic sex scenes, penis shown etc, hard swearings...The story is good, nice and funny dialogs, great swearings. I have watched this movie on DVD, and just for the fun of it i watched it with English subtitles on, and i must say they were beautifully done. I laughed a lot there. I bet the Americans are not use to that kinda talk... Of course some of the swearing cant really be translated into English. Lets face it, we use some of the most juicy swearings in the whole world (probably). I watched the movie in the dark, lights off, and sound almost to the max. Cinematography was beautiful, DD.5.1 worked perfectly, maybe only a corny Hollywood ending would made me feel better, but if i think back on the movie, the one that is there, stands much better.
