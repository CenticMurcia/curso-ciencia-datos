Living in New York City at the time of this film, and doing more than a few performances there, around the corner from my apartment at 4th & LaFayette Streets, I often wonder how films like "Old Enough" get made. I mean, where do they start and how do they develop? I'm sure that this is a great 'coming of age' film, but where does the inspiration start and why doesn't IMDb have pictures of the lead character {they only seem to have pictures of A list people}.<br /><br />Strange, I don't remember any "Old Enough" before I wrote "Old Enough" which you can find under /Artists/TerryJames/Lyrics/OldEnough/OldEnough.html which John Hughes used in "Home Alone." Like IMDb, there seemed to be a lack of listing the song credits here too.<br /><br />But make it worth your while to go see this film, it's worth it.<br /><br />I just love "original" ideas!
