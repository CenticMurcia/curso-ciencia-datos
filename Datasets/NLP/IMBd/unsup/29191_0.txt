The ability to acknowledge the absurd and question the norm is extremely important in societies. I don't think the point of this film is so much to learn something, but to unlearn a few things. I can't believe that Bunuel was able to create such vividly bizarre sequences that laugh in the face of conventions, and still manage to contain all those random sequences in one film that kept my interest for an hour and forty five minutes. What an incredible feat. I am certainly glad that there aren't too many Bunuels out there. I don't know how often I could watch films like "The Phantom of Liberty" before it got old and uninteresting, but I'm glad that there was someone out there to accomplish what Bunuel did. I would definitely say "The Phantom of Liberty" is very much a film worth watching at least once by everyone.
