This is known as not only one of the badly made futuristic science-fiction action adventures, but as one of the biggest box office flops, I had to see why. Basically, it is the year 3000, and Earth has become overrun by the alien race from the planet Psychlo, making the humans an endangered species. The aliens, led by the powerful Terl (Razzie winning and nominated John Travolta), are stripping the Earth of all its natural resources, and the humans seem the only species capable of helping, in slavery. Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Razzie winning Barry Pepper) is the only human that seems to want to do something to change the world back to what is supposedly used to be and that everyone left has forgotten. Terl, as human security chief, with deputy Ker (Razzie nominated Forest Whitaker) try to keep an eye on the human slaves, but it is obvious Terl wants to get off the planet with any scheme he can come up with. Tyler and fellow humans manage to go beneath the Earth to find the truth behind the rise of the Psychlos, and he leads his fellow men to fight for their freedom. Also starring Kim Coates as Carlo, Richard Tyson as Robert the Fox, Sabine Karsenti as Chrissie, Michael Byrne as Parson Staffer, Sean Hewitt as Heywood and Razzie winning Kelly Preston as Chirk. The acting ability isn't good enough, and the special effects and make-up look a little cheap, a big waste of millions, I got into it a tiny, but I certainly wouldn't see it again, it is awful. It won the Razzies for Worst Director for Roger Christian, Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple for Travolta with anyone sharing the screen with him, Worst Screenplay, Worst 'Drama' of Our First 25 Years and Worst Film of the Decade. Pretty poor!
