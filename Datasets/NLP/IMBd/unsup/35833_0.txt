As I watched this (actually half watched, half fast forwarded), I couldn't help but think it had to be written by a woman. Five attractive females, in various stages of undress, sitting in a (Romanian) sauna discussing sexual fantasies. Sounds like a winner but never got off the ground.<br /><br />Women discussing there experiences being ravaged by aliens could have been extremely hot, but its all too "chicky". Too much time spent talking about their "feelings", and so-called "erotic" scenes that play too soft - a lot of cutting away on the good parts, nothing explicit, no pink, not even much "boobage" (disappointing, as the actresses are well-endowed and not the standard plastic b-movie chicks), not enough skin, not enough heat (save one half-a** solo scene, they never get it on in the sauna!), too much talking and nothing went anywhere. Imagine scenes with them being examined, nude, on stainless steel tables, or forced to breed, or being fondled and probed. Alas, we got none of that, just some cheesy Harlequine romance-type female blathering.<br /><br />The movie could/should have been half as long. Any coincidence most of these actresses, despite looking good, never made another movie? Check it out only if you get it dirt cheap.
