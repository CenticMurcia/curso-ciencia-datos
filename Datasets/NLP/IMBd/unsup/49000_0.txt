As a real fan of Tremors 1 I made the mistake to trust all the good reviews on this site. But believe me guys: This one has nothing to offer (well - except a realy strange resurection scene). Unfortunately I bought the DVD. DonÂ´t even rent it even if you feel greedy on a monster movie - watch Tremors No. 1 instead or get "Octalus" or whatever else there is on the shelve.
