If it's got Michael Ironside in it, it's definitely going to be bad. He plays a scientist who is drilling a hole 7 miles deep in Manhattan to tap into an underground magma flow for an energy source. On the other side, you've got a tunnel digger and a geologist who just happens to be the tunnel digger's ex-wife and when they meet in the movie for the first time, you've got the sappy music for them. It's got the usual bureaucrats who won't listen to the scientists who are trying to warn of a impending disaster, FBI agents who get all ultra paranoid thinking it's all terrorism and the mandatory love interest. If you're a fan of the show Mystery Science Theater 3000, then this bad movie is for you.
