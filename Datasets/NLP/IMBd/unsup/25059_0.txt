What a great, indie-comedy debut. A funny portrayal of love, lust and well threesomes. A combination of Kevin Smith's Clerk's and American Pie, this film definitely deserves all the praise it can get. Strong cast, script and nice cinematography. The temptations of bachelorhood's are displayed in a way that any normal sex-obsessed guy would want them to be, and you can really "identify" with the character of Drew Wicks...well, most of us can at least. A hilarious cameo from Ginger Lynn Allen just tops this film off for me, and is one of the funniest films I've seen for it's while. Basically, I urge everyone to go and buy or rent or watch of whatever this film. It's one of the best debut films you'll see this year!
