This makes B movies look like blockbusters. It's one of those stupid college prank movies that is just bad. Laughably bad would mean at least there are laughs.<br /><br />The horrific acting, incredibly inane script is bad enough. But the over the top characters are so lame. I'm so glad I only caught a portion of this movie. I watched it because I liked Dean Cameron in an old TV show and was curious to see what he had done since then. What a disaster. Unless you are 7 years old with a very low IQ, you will not believe what a total car wreck this movie is and will wonder how it was ever funded.<br /><br />This movie breeds a whole new low in the intelligence scale. Cameron unfortunately is smarmy and no matter how fearful a situation is, he is the same wisecracking jokester because we all know that he isn't ever going to be hurt so he can be the obnoxious cavalier buffoon. Wow. This is stupid defined.<br /><br />
