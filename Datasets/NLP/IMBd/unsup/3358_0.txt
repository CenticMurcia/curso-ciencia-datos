... ruined nearly every scene in this film; the sound track was just too loud and never seemed to let up. Problem #2 was the fragmented quality of the storytelling; we're constantly skipping backwards and forwards in time and cutting from one set of characters to another with just brief snatches of dialogue, so that no scene has a chance to build and it becomes extremely difficult to follow the complicated story. Problem #3 was the swooping, restlessly moving camera. In some types of films this fluid camera work might add a bit of style; here it simply erased any sense of period atmosphere or charm. A good Miss Marple movie, I'd suggest, ought to be old-fashioned, restrained, even a little stodgy; this new version of "Nemesis" feels too modern and (thanks to the wandering camera and that operatic music) vaguely psychedelic, or at least dreamlike, in style -- leaving this viewer with a bit of a headache. I miss the Marples of Joan Hickson and Margaret Rutherford.
