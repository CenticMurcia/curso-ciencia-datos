First off let me say this film is awful.I would really like to know what made Olivier and Peck and Mason star in this rubbish not to mention the bad performances given by practically everyone in this film the only saving grace is Gregory Peck who plays the Nazi doctor as a powerful man who is seriously deluded and full of his own self importance.The plot basically is this Dr Mengler is alive and well in Brazil and is being tracked down by a Jewish man played by Lawrence Olivier who is part of a group who have formed to bring Nazi war criminals to justice,Mengler has cloned Hitler and placed the young boys with foster families and is now tracking them down to tell them the truth about their backgrounds.However save yourself buying this on DVD and just watch it if it comes on TV it is watchable but it is not a good film.
