a fabulous and sometimes painfully honest portrayal of life for a modern twenty-something man who happens to be asian american. this film is about a lot of things: sexual dysfunction, hazy identities, repressed desire, and everything else complicated and meaningful.<br /><br />anyone who doesn't get the real truth behind the portrayals here should take an honest second look and gauge the film outside of their own bitterness at the issues underlying it. this is an important film for american cinema, let alone asian-american cinema.
