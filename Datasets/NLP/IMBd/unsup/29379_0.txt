Too long, tedious, boring, mind-numbing, poorly-written, gag-me-with-an-adolescent- fantasy piece of crap. I love many movies which are commonly referred to as Chick Flicks, but this hunk of junk is too much for me. The soundtrack is pretty good. I don't know how I can stretch my comments to 10 lines. I did read that Kevin Costner's part was originally written for Steve McQueen, and he may've been able to pull it off. Note that K.C. has Steve's haircut. This is a demonstration that celebrity in one area doesn't necessarily to talent in another area. The film needs a female lead who can act, and ol' Whitney ain't the gal for the job.
