This is the first movie in the new Wallanderseries and is based on the book with the same name. And it went completely wrong.The policemen/woman in this film behaves like morons and I can't understand how they did make it trough police academy. Embarrassing mistakes and on top of it all a ridiculous plot aiming to please some minorities in society (they can'not have gained anything by this) I don't blame the actors or the photo - but everything else stinks! I feel also there is a lack of flow in this picture that easily could have been avoided by lengthening/cutting i the right places. Next episodes must be far superior if √ç'm going to watch this series.
