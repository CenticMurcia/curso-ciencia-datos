I can't even begin to describe how truly bad this thing was.<br /><br />I've seen most of the 15 minute episodes on Adult Swim, so I had an idea of what to expect. I've even found some of the shorts on AS to be funny. <br /><br />This thing, however, appeared to have been thrown together by a bunch of Delta House rejects after a night of waaaay too much tequila. I think I may have finally found a candidate to unseat 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' as the worst movie EVER created. If a friend offers to loan you a copy of the 'ATHF Colon Movie', accept it, then punch them in the face and burn the DVD.<br /><br />Is there any way to give it 0 out of 10 stars?
