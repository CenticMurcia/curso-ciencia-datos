I don't know what movie other people who thought this followed the book were seeing, but it did NOT! The book is fresh in my mind, as I finished reading it a mere 20 hours before watching the so-called movie version, and the only thing this movie had in common w/the book was the fact that there was a creature in it! How to begin? Lesse...(1) Victor knew Henry from CHILDHOOD, not from school, as the movie would have you believe. (2) Victor's mother died from ILLNESS, not childbirth! (3) Elizabeth NEVER followed Victor to school and his Professor did NOT die! (4) Where was the creature's long, flowing, black hair?! (5) Justine's end was NOT via lynch-mob! (5) Too many of the occurrences took place in the wrong places! What happened to the hut in the small town, for instance? (6) Felix's family was all wrong; his fianc√©e did come from overseas, but the other woman was his sister! (7) Victor did NOT just decide not to make the female creature because the creature chose his mother's body! Victor was actually only moments away from bringing a female creature to life and he tore her body apart! (8) What happened to Henry's death? (9) Don't even get me started on the whole Elizabeth reanimated thing! (10) The ending was wrong! Victor died of bad health and the creature jumped off the ship, off to kill himself! (11) The beginning was wrong, too! The monster passed by the ship first, on a sledge. THEN Victor approached, also on a sledge, NOT on foot! (12-50) Just too much to name! Now, I know that movie's always take artistic license, but this one just took too much; it wasn't even recognizable as the same story as the one I had just read. Mary Shelley's name should have been nowhere near this tragedy! And if you loved the book, stay far far away from this massacre of a "movie"!
