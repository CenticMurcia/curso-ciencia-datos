This is one of the few movies I have seen from beginning to end and then seeing it on MST 3000. Watching it this way first allowed me to see some of the more gruesome parts the show edited. As it stands I don't rate this a one, I give it a three. The problem with this movie is not the worms per se, which apparently go on the attack because a power line is down (that happens all the time, and I have yet to see killer worms) it is the thoroughly unlikeable characters. This is set in the south so everyone revs up the southern accent to intolerable levels (I live here and I have yet to hear anyone sound that southern) then there is Mic who is from New York. Why the heck is he in Georgia you ask? He is antiquing. And they want you to believe he would be interested in the girl. Oh and don't get me started on the sheriff. The stereotypical sheriff of the south who is more interested in sex than solving crimes. Actually the most likable character I thought was Roger. Sure he becomes crazy, but he was generally a nice fellow till Mic kept advancing on the girl. Oh, and the character of Mr. Beardsly is also very impressive in his brief stint on the film. So should you watch? Go ahead, it isn't totally bad, and there are some pretty gross scenes on the straight version.
