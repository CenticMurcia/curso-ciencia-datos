Why do we suffer?Do we need to?Cant we just pray to god and try to be a good person?Takva is looking for the answer of those questions.Muharrem is a very loyalty man to all.He immigrated from Algeria but after his parents death,he started to live alone.He works for the man which his father also used to.He prays a lot and he just tries to be a good people.He is one of the members of a well known sect.He always attends to the ceremony of the sect and one day the leader of the sect asks him if he can work for sect.Muharrem accepts it and starts to do material businesses of the sect.After that his life turns to a tragedy.Because he is not good at accounting and starts to have sin which he hadn't before.He also sees some unwanted dreams which are sexual.he thinks thats the punishment of life to him.The leader doesn't does not understand his situation and muharrem gets lost in the darkness of his soul.All the things are meaningless for him anymore.At the last sequence of the movie,he follows the hero of his dreams under the rain and he faces with the fact.The hero of his nightmare is his leader's daughter..
