I totally disagree with Oarch's comments about this film. This is so called foreign non-understanding of Balcan humor. If you ever watched other Balcan(Ex Yugoslavian) movie, you'll notice a lot very good actors, who make this movie even better with their brilliant act. Maybe the story isn't so tuned and exciting, but you'll have a lot to laugh about in hour and half. Special credit for funny part in this movie goes to Lazar Ristovski and Bogdan Diklic as two cops, who's luck is not on their side. Also Branko Djuric takes credits for his part, but best elements of this movie are dialogs, which represents tradition and a way of living in Balcan countries. <br /><br />If you like Balkan humor, then you should not miss this one.
