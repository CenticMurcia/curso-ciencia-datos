"Particles of Truth" is a dull, uninspiring film with a weak storyline. The film is about Lilli a washed up artist with bad hair. She is at most unlikeable in appearance and personality. Throughout the film, Lilli is depressed and unkempt. We see why she is so: Her parents were drugged out hippie commune like folks with no direction in life and her love life stinks. Throughout the movie, Lilli meets Morrison a man who suffers from ocd. There is a possibility of a romance for Lilli and Morrison. But their scenes lack chemistry and passion. In a later scene, Lilli sees her dying father. They reconnect briefly and the film ends meaninglessly.
