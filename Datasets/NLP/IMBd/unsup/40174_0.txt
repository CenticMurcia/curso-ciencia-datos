The first half hour of this film wasn't bad at all & I thought it was another ridiculous IMDB rating. Unfortunately it degenerated into a farce and the 3.5 rating ended pretty justified. I don't want to waste much time on this but two scenes were particularly poor & deserve comment. The Russian roulette & Bomber climbing out on the side of the plane, were both laughable (in the wrong ways) in the extreme. The ending was pretty atrotious too. I had trouble also working out how plan of the 'Evil Savage' linked in with the Bermuda Triangle type section, and what control (if any Savage had over that). Also the deaths of the other original survivors & the kidnapping of the girls' father seemed to be glaized over so quick they went unnoticed.<br /><br />An ok start but awful last hour.<br /><br />3/10
