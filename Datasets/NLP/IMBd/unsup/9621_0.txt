The reason this silent film is still viewed today and enjoyed, is simply because the director of this film was Sidney Franklin who was a very famous director during the 20's 30's and 40's. His famous film was, "The Good Earth",1937, a story written by Pearl Buck, and received large audience attendance. Of course, Greta Garbo,(Lillie Sterling), looked very sexy and rather young and having an old looking husband, who was Lewis Stone,(John Sterling), who loved and adored everything about Lillie. Things go smoothly for a while in the jungle, but a two legged gigolo decides to have some fun with young and hot looking Lillie. It is great entertainment if you like the old time Classics and great acting and directors.
