This movie makes you laugh when Chris (Will Smith) is having one of his worse days ever, chasing a gypsy in the middle of the road, getting hit by a car, running after a crazy guy, running from a cabbie without paying him and finally, finally when he has the greatest day of his life it makes you cry.<br /><br />If you, ever in your life have struggled and against many odds and discouragements achieved something, then you will know what the underlying beauty of the movie is.<br /><br />Will Smith is brilliant. He might not get an Oscar because of Idi Amin (Whitaker in LKFS should get it) but he is at his best. You will feel for him every minute, you will feel his pain and yeah you will enjoy his happiness. His son was good too. But its Will Smith all the way.<br /><br />A very nice movie
