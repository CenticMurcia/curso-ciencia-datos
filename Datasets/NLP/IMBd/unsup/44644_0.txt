Why is it that so many movie companies, insist on producing so many DTV sequels now a days?. Bring It on Again is a prime example of why people detest DTV movies. It's lazy,it's amateurish,not only that there is not one character you can root for in the film. I was in the video store the other day and figured on renting it,since I'd just finished the 1st,but something told me not to waste my precious money,and just view it online instead. I made the right decision,Bring It On Again wasn't worthy of my money at all. This was clearly a movie to cash in on the success of the original,only they replaced a likable cast,with a bunch of whiny snobs,who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag!. The 1st one was far from a classic,but at least it had a sense of energy and a hint of likability,this Dosen't have any of those traits. Anne Judson-Yager|Whittier| is supposed to be our heroine,our darling so to speak,yet she's almost as whiny and disposable as Tina and Marni,so how on earth is a sequel gonna work like this,when there is no one to root for?. What's even worse is this turkey produced 3 more unrelated sequels,that nobody really wanted. The Cheerleading sequences are average at best,except for one excellent one at the very end,I will admit that was very well done.<br /><br />Bring It On Again is a reason why I detest DTV Sequels,or even sequels in general. It's got no heart,no creativity,and most importantly it's downright dull.<br /><br />Performances. Anne Judson-Yager. I read a review that said Anne looked like a poor woman's Reese Witherspoon,to be honest? That fits her perfectly. She can't act worth a lick,she's very unsympathetic,whiny and was almost as bad as the villainous. Bree Turner gives a typical B*tch performance. It was adequate I suppose. Bethany Joy Galeotti known for her One Tree Hill fame,certainly didn't show any of that here,I wanted to slap her one. Faune A. Chambers plays the best friend adequately,she was less annoying then Yager at least.<br /><br />Bottom Line. Bring It On Again is a waste of film. I had to go through 80 minutes of torture to get one decent cheerleading sequence,let me tell you it isn't worth it my friends. I would advise you to avoid this sequel,unless your a die hard cheerleader fan. Now I just have 3 more sequels to go!,Uggh.<br /><br />3/10
