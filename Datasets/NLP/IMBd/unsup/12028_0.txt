Although I wished it had included all of the songs from the opera, this production was still a good way to get acquainted with the "Yeomen of the Guard." The sets and costumes were very well-done. Missing from this performance were both of Fairfax's solos, as well as "when a wooer goes a-wooing", "strange adventure" and the duet "Rapture, rapture."<br /><br />Joel Gray is a very nimble Jack Point. My favorite portrayal was Alfred Marks as Wilfrid Shadbolt. His duet with Gray, "hereupon we've both agreed," was my favorite number. Elizabeth Gale made a very touching Elsie, singing with a lot of emotion. Fairfax did the most he could with his role, considering both of his solos were left out.
