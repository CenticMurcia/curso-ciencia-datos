There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said in the previous 52 reviews of Chopping Mall, but the more Roger Corman films you've seen, the more you'll enjoy it. Others have noted the fine cast, but a good cast bears repeating, as a much better film once said: Paul Bartel, the always sexy Mary Woronov, Dick Miller, Gerrit Graham, and the inimitable Mel Welles (playing a grumpy chef) are all here to distract us from the limp special effects and threadbare screenplay. But there's more: from the poster promoting Lost Empire to the scenes from Corman's Attack of the Crab Monsters (which, by the way, REALLY NEEDS TO BE ON DVD), there's fun to be had for cinematic trainspotters. Heck, the mall gun shop (how many of those are there??) is called Peckinpah's! Misleading title aside, Chopping Mall is manna from heaven for bad movie mavens.
