1st watched 2/12/2007 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Sam Newfield): Complex story, but hammy-acting and silly songs make this major attempt to bring to the screen a serious story with midgets(or should I say the "vertically-challenged") a failure. The story revolves around the bad guy in town named Bat Haines, who is fooling everybody and plotting two families against each other by stealing each other's calves and then setting it up so that each one blames the other. He even has the sheriff eating out of his hand and bully's everyone else to see things his way. If you haven't guessed yet, he is "the Terror of Tiny Town." Enter the hero, the young son of the Lawson clan, who tries to fix things and stirs up a little romeo & juliet style romance on the side with a niece in the other family. Well, as you can guess, all things work out in the end and we get to hear one of the silly songs(there are about 4 songs in the movie and all are pretty silly) to close out the movie. This actually was a grand attempt to make a Hollywood picture with only the little ones but the mediocre acting stands out, sadly.
