The movie Contagion was a well thought out story that had below average acting and corny elements. The actual plot of the movie was great. The President of the United States is shot with the ebola virus by terrorists and the disease will spread like wildfire if time runs out. By listening to that plot, one would think that suspense keep the viewer anxious throughout the whole movie. However, the acting is so bad that it is hard to take the movie seriously. In addition, there are several effects that unsuccessfully add drama. For example, the President refuses to take the antidote provided by the terrorist cause he does not believe in it, the nurse tells Dr. Landis to tell her daughter she was "the light of her life" before she dies, and randomly the screen shows what hour it is since the virus was shot into the President. None of these attempts to add drama or suspense made me hold on to the edge of my seat. The bottom line was that this movie did not reach its potential. With the story line, it could have been a great science fiction; however, the bad acting and the lack of development make this a below average film even for a science fiction.
