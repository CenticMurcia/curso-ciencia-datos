(WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS!)<br /><br />>>Pros: The constant, shameless T&A scenes; decent action scenes; nicely animated<br /><br />>>Cons: The constant, shameless T&A scenes; no point to this movie<br /><br />>>Plot summary: Based on a video game that only appeared in America on the hard-as-hell-to-find, overly expensive, and now-defunct SNK Neo-Geo video game console, Voltage Fighters! Gowcaizer: The Movie is about a group of Japanese high school students with superpowers that must stop some kind of weird, evil force from destroying the world. That's about all the plot I could get out of this film.<br /><br />>>Review: If you're an adolescent teenage boy who just went through puberty, you're gonna love this movie. The film's sole purpose is to just show off the female characters' bodies, and they do with great gusto. They wear little to no clothing, and they have huge breasts that seem to bounce in every direction. Also, the 2 main female characters, Karin and Shaia, don't seem to be very bright. Gowcaizer was produced and directed by Masami Ohbari, best known for his great work on Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture, but Ohbari didn't even come close to living up to Fatal Fury: TMP with this film. Masami Ohbari was also the creator and producer behind the Gowcaizer game. Anyway, the animation in this anime is pretty good, and the fight scenes are decent. They're reminiscent of that of Dragon Ball Z, but they don't get nearly over the top as what goes on DBZ. As for Gowcaizer's flaws, one thing I didn't like about this film was the incest romance between a brother and sister. Also, this film doesn't really make any since at all, and it doesn't try to either. This is just a below-average anime film that was made just to satisfy some type of pornographic lust, and that's pretty much it.<br /><br />>>My last 2 cents: (None this time)<br /><br />>>My rating: 4 out of 10
