This is the anime that got me introduced to anime in the first place, and it is stylistically brilliant.<br /><br />The story takes place in the year 2071 and follows the adventures of the crew aboard the spaceship "Bebop" as they travel the solar system. They are bounty hunters or as the slang of their era refers to them as "Cowboys". Most of the episodes are episodic but there is also a main plot arc running through the series. The "Bebop" crew consist of Spike Spiegel, a former member of the Red Dragon crime syndicate who is haunted by a past love triangle between former syndicate partner ,Vicious, and a mysterious woman named Julia. Faye Valentine, an amnesic, who was awakened from a cryogenic slumber, her past is a mystery but is slowly un raveled during the course of the series, she is also running from Debt collectors after being scammed upon being awakened from her cryogenic state. And the "Bebop" captain and founder Jet Black, a former ISSP officer who was betrayed by his long time partner. They are also joined in their exploits by a computer genius and master hacker from earth known as Edward, a wacky teenage girl, and a welsh corgi named Ein. Each episode usually revolves around the crew hunting down bounty's trying to get enough money in order to survive and to keep the ship going. Meanwhile the plot for each character develops as we find out more about their past.<br /><br />The show is stylistic, in fact one of the reasons i was drawn to it from the first episode was because of that very stylistic nature. Watching the bar scene I was reminded of Desperado, instantly i was hooked. The show also has a great soundtrack. Thumbs way up
