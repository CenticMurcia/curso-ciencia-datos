The reason I chose to rate this movie so low is because I couldn't understand a word of it. I do NOT recommend this film to anyone unless he/she can speak fluent Spanish. And speak it well. If you can't, you won't get the jokes.....TRUST ME. I assume it was a funny show because I saw people in the audience laughing their heads off. Thankfully, I rented it for a dollar instead of buying it. I just couldn't enjoy it. They would tell part of the joke in English, and then the punchline in Spanish. However, the movie was set up good and it was cool watching one of them drive on stage in a low-rider. But all this movie did was feed me Mexican food that I couldn't pronounce. So I didn't eat it. I would take a Spanish class before partaking of this movie.
