i thought simerson was as much as a bastard as ever, sharpe hasn't lost his touch with the Lady's. all in all its great. i wish they'd make another series out of it.it was very good if you watch it you will not be wasting your time.full of adventure action and fun.it will have to be bought when it comes out on DVD.the bad guy was ever so slightly insane.on to pickersmith wasn't he awful? the french having honour i would never have thought it after the first lot.man singing at the end was so cool it brought so many memoires from the last episode when they were at waterloo.long live sharpe the french couldn't kill neither will any one else.
