This movie was minimal in just about everything--characterization, scenery, excitement, depth, meaning. I could see the ending coming from the moment the protagonist voiced his desire for someone to kill him. Like someone already said, we never figure out why he wants to die. He drives through the suburbs in an SUV, being creepy and annoying in the most mundane way possible. Why do we care? I cared more about the poor people who would not kill him despite the promised reward than this bland character. Of course, these people were only featured for a few minutes each. Also, are we supposed to view the idea that life is valuable for the little things like the "taste of cherry" as unique and thought-provoking?
