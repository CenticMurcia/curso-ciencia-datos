I try not to be too negative when I comment on films so I shall start with the good points.<br /><br />This film did some things well, particularly the jump shocks and setting up the atmosphere with the Black Brothers and the Lonely Twin, but the dialogue was pretty rank and unbelievable (no teenager in the history of the world has ever talked like that) and the ending twist was pulled out of a hat, in an illogical way, that the film had at no point built up to.<br /><br />The acting was variable, with the background characters done well, which was to be expected, given who was playing them, and the teenage characters varying from well done (Jake) to not so good (Lisa).<br /><br />The directing was, again, variable, as I said previously, the jump shocks were very well done, but the director seemed a little too fond of the shaky cam effect at other points. While I understand the reasoning to this, with the exception of the drowning scene, I don't think it added much to the film.
