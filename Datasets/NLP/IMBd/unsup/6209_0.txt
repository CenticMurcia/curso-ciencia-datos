This is a comedy drama based on a true story, the nudity obviously is quite essential to the story, but there isn't a complete comparison to The Full Monty. It is 1999, and Chris Harper (Golden Globe nominated Dame Helen Mirren) and Annie Clarke (Julie Walters) are members of the Knapely (Yorkshire, England) Women's Institute, and every year they produce a calendar based on the local scenes. After Annie's husband John (John Alderton) dies of leukemia, Chris comes up with an idea that also relates to John's love of sunflowers, and expressing yourself (or whatever), to pose for a nude calendar. Each individual member poses hiding their breasts behind something, or facing away showing their bottoms. Soon enough they get the pictures printed onto proper calendars, and all they need is permission from the Women's Institute board, but really it's their local president Marie (Little Britain's Geraldine James), who says OK, well actually "Oh, sod it. Go on then." Chris and Annie weren't expecting the calendars to sell out so quickly, but they also weren't expecting to go to Hollywood! In the end, after their American promotion, and a bit of banter they return of England, and it says that they have raised a lot of money for a leukemia charity, and to buy a sofa dedicated to John.
