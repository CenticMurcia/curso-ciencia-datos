Do not pass this off simply as a children's movie. Few notice looking at the movie poster that "Bicentennial Man" was actually written by Isaac Asimov, biochemist, Columbia graduate, and noted science fiction author. The film is actually much deeper in meaning than trailers suggested, posing the question of what it truly means to be human. This notion is tied in with a heartwarming story and the perfect cast of actors, making the movie accessible to all audiences.
