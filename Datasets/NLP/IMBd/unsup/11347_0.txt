This movie is everything that the first movie should have been.<br /><br />I still would have preferred to not have Damodar back, but at least he didn't have blue lipstick this time. Overall, I like the intensity that Bruce Payne brings to his performances, but I still haven't seen a role where he balances that intensity with believability.<br /><br />If you play D&D, you will find moments of every game you've ever played in this movie.<br /><br />I really liked our hero, Sir Baric, and I liked the Barbarian, Lux, and the Rogue. I thought the wizardess was a little weak, as was the cleric.<br /><br />My favorite scene though is one of the closing scenes, where you see the wizardess and the rogue cleaning up the temple of Obad-Hai after receiving major healing there - a really nice gamers' touch I thought.<br /><br />My 6-year old's mouth was hanging open for pretty much the first 10 minutes of the movie, he lost interest once there was a lot of talking, or course, but he really liked the scene where they traverse the tiled floor backwards (a classic D&D staple).<br /><br />I thought that the black dragon-lich looked wonderful, but I would have liked to have seen more about the human lich, and his motivations.<br /><br />An extended DVD version is definitely in order, there were at least 40 minutes of commercials in a 150 minute segment, I would really love to see more of the interactions between the PCs, and more backstory on the Lich, and the council of mages.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best D&D movies yet, although Serenity is pretty close (and it's sci-fi!)
