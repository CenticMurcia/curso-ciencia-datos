I had a tough day busting baddies so I was in a desperate need to chill. I came across this film. The title caught my eye. I will investigate anything "Naked."<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised. I liked the setting -San Francisco. The subject is timely. All these reality shows. Well this one's a doozy, talk about twisted entertainment.<br /><br />Does this picture deliver? For an Indie/low budget production... In spades: bombs, blood, guts and breasts!!<br /><br />The writer/director has an original vision, that's for sure. <br /><br />Definitely worth checking out.
