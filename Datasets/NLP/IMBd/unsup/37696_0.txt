i just finished watching this movie, and i'd have to say that i am disappointed. i was expecting some grand social commentary portrayed through realistic depictions of real-life situations. but i came away with some babble from characters that was really nothing new, and a string of violence seemingly driven by coincidence, stupidity, rage, and hatred. i enjoyed the buildup of the characters, but other than that, i feel the movie did not do anything to depict real situations.<br /><br />the characters were developed. that i enjoyed. but i did not enjoy the fact that they were portrayed as hopped up, revenge-seeking machines. there is a certain amount of senselessness here, and that is what drive this movie to a moot point. maybe the senselessness is supposed to help the viewer understand the way certain events play out. however, again, this does not strike me as anywhere near realistic.<br /><br />shocking: yes. revolutionary in any way: no.<br /><br />but i love the soundtrack. so check that out, at least.
