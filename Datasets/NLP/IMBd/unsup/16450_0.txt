This is listed as Chris Nee's last movie, made in 2001. Does anyone have any idea what happened to him? Just on the evidence in LAST SUMMER, I'd say he's a major talent. I just got a message telling me that my comment is not long enough. Is there a place to ask questions like mine, which hardly requires 10 lines? Just a word about LAST SUMMER. There is tension here provided by the dread that this is going to be a movie about child molestation. It is actually about child maturation. The relationship created by Nee's performance is one of profound love and nurturing without a hint of sexual misbehavior. The ending feels like the end of the young boys hopes for a sane and happy life, given the behavior of the parents, but the impact Nee's character has is so strong, the boy becomes much more than we might have expected in the beginning. A lovely movie.
