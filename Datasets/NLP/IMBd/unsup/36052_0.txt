Well what can I say ....<br /><br />The basis of this melodrama surrounds the individual soldiers, the hazards they face and the decisions they must make. On this level I suppose it's almost bearable.<br /><br />It seems every action is in favour of the military .. from the initial shoot to kill policy at the road block. Luckily enough the plot clears up this mess by showing it was all a set up by the insurgents and they would sacrifice several innocents to get their man through to the twist where the embedded journalists images were misrepresented to make a US soldier the scapegoat in the eyes of the world and the media for the death of two innocents. Could this be any further from the truth when we consider the Media blanket placed during the conflict. So was it Al-Jezeera that aired this ... I think not as CNN, FOX and the like essentially prevented any critical view from any angle as did the so called embedded independent journalists.<br /><br />I certainly not saying these things didn't happen but we seem to be missing a large part of the overall picture. Collateral damage! I feel for the soldiers deployed to Iraq and my heart goes out to the families for their loss but lets not forget the 100,000 Iraqis that have died or around 500,000 due to sanctions prior to the war.<br /><br />It's unrealistic, biased and wholly unconvincing trite. Turning a humanitarian catastrophe into soul-less light entertainment.<br /><br />I hope one day Dubya and Blair pay for their crimes against humanity.
