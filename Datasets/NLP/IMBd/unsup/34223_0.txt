I think this one goes down as the worst horror film of all time. If not the worst film of all time. And I'm really not kidding.<br /><br />I was mislead into watching this piece of garbage when I spotted the cover at a local Hollywood Video rental store. The cover looked promising, and I was thinking this would be something along the lines of "The Shining" but I was so very wrong. And I later noticed that on the cover, a critic (must've been a dumb one at that) quoted this "The scariest horror film since The Shinning". Yes, "The SHINNING".<br /><br />This film is basically about a couple who move into a cracker jack box hotel room at some cheap seaside hotel, and they begin to see weird stuff and it's somehow related to the hotel's past.<br /><br />The only thing remotely memorable about this film is Angus Scrimm's performance (well known as The Tall Man from "Phantasm"), but other than that, the rest of the film is just complete and utter trash. I will say this film created a sense of claustrophobia, 99% of it took place in that tiny hotel room, but it was just plain awful. Terrible acting, extremely weak script, nothing scary at all, really bad cinematography, etc. I'd say this is even way below you're average B-horror film. Avoid at all costs, unless you want to laugh and make fun of it for the hour and a half. Even then, I don't think sitting through it is even worth the laughter. 1/10.
