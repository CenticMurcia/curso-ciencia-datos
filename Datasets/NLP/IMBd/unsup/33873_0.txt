From last years 8 films to die for this is the story of group of people who have survived after society has collapsed on itself when the gas ran out. Not long after rescuing a young girl the survivors who have been living in a hospital find themselves stalked by a group of cannibals. Slow and not very clever end of the world tale that has a couple of nice twists sprinkled through it. (unfortunately the twists would give away details so I can't really discuss them.) Regrettably outside of the twists the film doesn't offer much else. Its too leisurely paced to build terror and the film suffers from chasms of broken internal logic-chief among them why would a group of people live in a place that had no defenses, or even a locked door. Its a mess. Despite having flaws it is watchable, though its probably best watched while doing something else (I'm guessing that you'll probably fall asleep if you watch it straight). 4 out of 10
