i honestly expected something a little less amateur and experimental as this film seems to be... it even had the bonus of adding some of the original film's actors, but it simply went wrong.<br /><br />poor dialogues, poor acting and very very poor makeup... the first 10 minutes can't mistake you, it's going to be that bad! there's no likable characters, Allan (the main character (???))can't even gather sympathy nor pity, he's simply loathsome and all the other characters... well, envy and hate can't justify their behaviour and we're left with no explanation for their actions.<br /><br />watch it for yourselves, if you can...
