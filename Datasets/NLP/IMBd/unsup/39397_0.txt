At film festivals there are times when one is forced to watch absolutely bad films.This happens as a particular time slot is booked for a bad film.If there are no other films on other slots,one is inevitably forced to experience a lousy film.This is also the case with British film called "Rag Tale".I encountered this film in 2006 at Women's International Film Festival Film de Femmes Creteil,France. There are many reasons why Irish director Mary McGukian must be blamed for making an absolutely bad film.This is a film which does not make any sense.No one knows for sure whether it is a thriller or a drama.The acting is so horrible that one can claim that at any given day amateur theater actors would give better performances.Malcolm Mcdowell has been wasted in this film.He appears as an actor who is forced to work beyond his glorious days.American films would be a great choice if somebody has to watch better films about print journalism.Rag tale is a silly story which has neither head nor tail.
