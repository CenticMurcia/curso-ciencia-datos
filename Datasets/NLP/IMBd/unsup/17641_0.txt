Unfortunately, this movie is a totally missed opportunity. At first, it looked really interesting. A team of mercenaries was going to Texas to take on some right wing white trash people. It showed a lot of promise when the leader of the mercenaries was doing his recruiting of different characters. With people like Robert Davi, Ralph Moeller and Roddy Piper, this is going to be fun at the end, I thought. But no. The movie just goes on and on without nothing really happening except boring dialogue and lots of preparations. <br /><br />Take Roddy Piper, for example. Almost all he does here is being a driver. Really disappointing. And Ralph Moeller, who is some sort of a fighting champion in the beginning, never fights again in the movie. He is totally under-utilized, and only talks and delivers a few gunshots near the end. The guy was great in Best of the Best 2, so I just don't understand what he was doing here.<br /><br />The last action scene that the whole movie was building up on is just terrible and utter trash. I guess this movie got killed off because of the budget, and overall it must have been braindead people being responsible for this. One of the right wing guys even speaks with an accent!!!<br /><br />Stay away from this, unless you have to watch every action movie ever made.
