This movie was just crazy, because I think that they could have made this movie a little better. I didn't like how made the courtroom look. It look like they took a Star Wars Saucer and called it a "courtroom". I think that Left Behind was 10 times better than this "movie". Whoever looks at this movie is:<br /><br />a) highly depressed b)Doesn't have a life<br /><br />If anything I think that the movie before this, "Tribulation" was better. It actually had me glued to the set. The part that I liked was when The Antichrist (Franco Macalausso) was bragging about his history (being Lucifer, having a throne in heaven with God, and how he thought he was better than God). Really I think the Left Behind Trilogy is better than this series.
