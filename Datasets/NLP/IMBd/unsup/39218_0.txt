I probably would not have rented this movie many because of the string of stinker movies recently released with John Travolta. However, I was born and raised in Harrisburg and I remember the Lottery Scam. Plus my mother, who is not a movie buff like myself, was asking about the movie and whether she should watch it. After viewing it, I let her know this was the worse piece of trash that could ever be put out on movie.<br /><br />First, maybe I was still kind of young (but it happened while I was in HS) and I just don't remember any kind of nudie bar involved in the movie. I'm not some sort of prude that needs to have all the nudity removed from their movie, but there was absolutely no need for this any nudity in this movie to move the plot along. Plus it's a major disappointment to see a good director like Nora Eprhron (Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry met Sally) to have to use such tactics in her movie. Sure, we wanted to make Tim Roth look like a bad guy from the seamy under-society of Harrisburg. However, there are many ways it could have been done without the nudity. Tim is such an excellent actor he could have ran a Florist Shop and still come off as the bad guy.<br /><br />What really embarrassed me was just how bad this movie made Harrisburg look. I know Harrisburg isn't the first small city/town/location to have a bad movie associated with it, but the advertising made such a big deal that the movie was in Harrisburg. Heck Girl, Interrupted had major parts of the movie filmed in Harrisburg, it was a decent film but you didn't know it was filmed there by any of the ads. (Found out through IMDB).<br /><br />It was just a weak plot, I'd hate to say it was bad acting because there were so many good actors associated with the movie. But as the old saying goes "Garbage In, Garbage Out"....doesn't matter how good the actor is if the script is horrible.<br /><br />So please, if you watch this movie, please don't pass judgement on those of us from (or formly from) Harrisburg. No where is there any Denny's that has valet parking and preferred seating for it's weather folks, I think you have to drive to Reading to find the closest nudie bar and in general we're all pretty smart, well-educated folks.<br /><br />
