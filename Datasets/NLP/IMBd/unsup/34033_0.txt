I have never read any of Bret Easton-Elis' books but apparently he wrote American Psycho and that movie was very good. This one isn't.<br /><br />A "capable" but frankly D-list cast plod their way through this dire script with little enthusiasm. For those that didn't know apparently LA/Hollywood has a dark side to it and the inhabitants spend their time doing drugs and having casual sex (I thought they spent their time going to bible class and singing Kumbaya with the smurfs). I suspect they realised early on it was a turkey and just did their job as quickly as possible. The late Brad Renfro was the best of the bunch.<br /><br />A few subplots intertwine (badly) and nothing of any consequence happens whatsoever. Apparently the book is quite different and has vampires in it or something so god knows what the screenwriters were thinking here because there's no undead chomping on the lifeless actors faces, although this actually would have made the movie vaguely interesting.<br /><br />I would tell you what happened, but frankly I don't really know myself because the whole thing is so disjointed. Did I mention the script is AWFUL! I don't know if the writers really suck or if the book is just rubbish but there is no story or point to anything that happens.<br /><br />A few people have speculated on some kind of "AIDS being spread amongst the characters" sub-plot, but there is no real evidence to base this on any more than there's a sub-text in Teenwolf that predicted the current global financial crisis. Apparently in the book it's made clear the girl that dies at the end had cancer anyway, so this is probably just people looking for something more to this film than there actually is. Which wouldn't be hard.<br /><br />If you were involved in writing, producing or directing this movie please don't ever create anything for film ever again as you are terrible. Thanks!
