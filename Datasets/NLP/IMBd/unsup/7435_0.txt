Saw the rating of 6/10 on here and decided to give this a try. Bad mistake!<br /><br />I thought this was the worst serial killer movie I have ever seen. You know it's a bad sign when the serial killer seems more sane than the lead character.<br /><br />The lead character was not very bright nor likable, and I spent most of the movie hoping for her demise.<br /><br />Just because it's loosely based off a real life event does not mean it should become a movie.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this movie at all.
