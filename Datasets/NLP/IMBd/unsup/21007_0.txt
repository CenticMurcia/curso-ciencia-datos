It just disappoints me how many bad comments people are making about this movie. Sure, some of the animation is crappy, but hey, try to look on the brighter side of it people! This movie isn't THAT bad! It's actually one of my favorite sequels, and not to mention Disney's very FIRST sequel. It should be treated with more respect, same with Aladdin and the King of Thieves (excellent movie!)
