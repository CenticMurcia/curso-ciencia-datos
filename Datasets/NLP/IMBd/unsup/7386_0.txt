Great movie to be enjoyed by all the family (just watch out for some cursing and a little blood)! There were plot twists and edge of your seat moments that were not predictable! It was funny and suspenseful and had other good qualities that we look for in a movie. My kids were intrigued all the way through, and so was I. We really thought that Reiley McClendon did an excellent job! Also, Tom Sizemore and Stephen Baldwin added a great duo. However, a better describing title was the original title "Fly Boys". Another movie we liked by this producer was Princess of Thieves (starring Kiera Knightley), which you may want to watch also. I hope you like this movie. We did!
