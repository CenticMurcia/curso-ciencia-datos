This film starts good. It leaves you wondering until it all starts to make sense. Unfortunately most of the most interesting characters get killed too early. There is some suspense and some strong music. Many parts of the film are more gut wrenching than suspenseful. This movie is mostly grim and depressing especially in the last half. You walk out feeling kind of down and a little sick. Even Milla is a little over rated. She is not that pretty with a weird nose. She has very little personality either. And all the graphic cuts and bruises are a real turnoff.<br /><br />She is no comparison to Angelina Jolie, the Mummy star, or even the excellent lead actress in Ghosts of Mars. I should say the other brunette female lead in the film who was also in Fast and Furious and Girl Fighter is very good with a powerful personality. But the "I want to kiss you bit.." line is stupid. I much preferred John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. But you need to like Carpenter to like that film. Resident Evil is just more depressing than it needs to be. <br /><br />
