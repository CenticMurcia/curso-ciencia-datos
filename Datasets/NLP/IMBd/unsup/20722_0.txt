It didn't knock my socks off with insight, but I liked it. Willis' crying was far more realistic than either of the women's in the movie - I could feel his pain. The ending satisfies, dialogue is good and I loved the flashbacks. As a struggling single mother, though, it is hard to feel empathy for the rich lady who cries about having to be "responsible for everything" when she lives in a big fancy house, doesn't have to work out of the home, and has a husband who is too much fun. Seems the issues could have been more obviously painful, but maybe those are the things rich people have to complain about - hard to find reasons when the heros look like Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis, neither are unfaithful, and they have no money worries, huh? But, I liked it.
