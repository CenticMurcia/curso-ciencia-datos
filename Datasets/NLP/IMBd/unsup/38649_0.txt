This self-obsessed Hollywood piece of crap is barely worth seeing. If you're a shallow, worthless Hollywood cult worshiper, you may find this lousy piece of cinematic trash worthy viewing because you hear the name of someone who knows somebody who knows someone who once may have heard of you mentioned. If you're not totally irredeemable, you'll avoid this worthless waste of celluloid like the plague. Jim Jarmusch has made decent, worthy films before (Dead Man especially) but this ain't one of em. Sad to say, I laughed at the cheaper shots in this film. Doesn't mean the film's worthwhile. Avoid. Avoid. There's a reason that RZA, GZA, Tom Waits, and Iggy Pop aren't movie stars. Seems like Jim called everybody he knew and said, please help me make a movie on your names, cause I can't make it on my talent. Lame, failure, pathetic... You'll have more fun becoming intimate with a vinyl doll, all things considered. ~spoiler~ There is no plot whatsoever in this flaccid piece of gutter streamer.
