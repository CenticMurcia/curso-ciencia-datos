"Jason Goes to Hell" is the ninth and so-called final "Friday" which finally has Sean Cunningham back as producer. This sequel is known for it's less than traditional take on the admirably repetitive series in which Jason is ambushed and blown to pieces in the first five minutes. That's sure a devastating kick in the nuts for us Voorhees fans, but no need to fret - his psychotic soul ends up possessing the coroner who uncontrollably devours the throbbing heart and roars like freaking Godzilla. Now in his new form, the J-man sets out after his only remaining family members who are the only ones capable of killing him for good. Though Jason himself only appears throughout a very small portion of the movie, this is a very decent sequel and a nice change of pace for the franchise, giving it a good ending (before "Jason X" came along, that is). The death scenes are memorably nasty, especially that naked chick getting slit from the torso - up in the tent! I guess that was more rod than she could handle! That's what you get for sexing it up in a F13 flick! tsk tsk! Also dug Jason's method for body swapping - the ol' slug down the throat. That sorry bastard melting all over everything is a kick ass scene as well. Even if you weren't enough of a fan to sit through all of the previous sequels give this one a chance for it's wonderfully bloody demises and the different, almost supernatural way Jason gets his dirty deeds done. He may be in hell, but you just can't keep a good machete wielding man-child undead carcass with a hockey mask down!
