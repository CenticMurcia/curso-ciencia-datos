Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) used to be a once sensitive, quiet guy and then has become a big jerk who is a big shot photographer now. He treats girls like a dish and once he has his way with a girl he finds attractive, he is on his way with no strings attached. His brother Paul (Breckin Meyer) wedding is this weekend and it so happens that an old fling from his childhood Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner) is there. As uncomfortable as that might be he is taken back in the past to show where he went wrong and what needs to happen to change his life around.<br /><br />Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas) I think looks a lot like McConaughey and is fun to see them together in a movie. Some people I have talked to said McConaughey has lost his touch in this movie, but I think just the opposite and is still a great actor. He is getting older and I think still has some good movies to do in him. When movies flash back to the past it is kind of fun because it tells something about a character that you might not know or shows what got them to the point they are at now. My favorite thing about this movie was it shows you to change you life around when something is not going right or that life isn't what you expected. Also check out Garner in her latest movie, "The Invention of Lying" when that comes out on video soon.
