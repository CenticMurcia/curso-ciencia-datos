The opening scenes gave hope... but those hopes were soon diminished. The explosion at the gas station made you believe that this would be packed with the action expected to carry such a lame script. It also appeared that there were multiple crews working on the set because there was a clear difference in the film quality between scenes. Some were very clear and framed well while others were 'over cranked' and too soft. Shooting night for day is so obvious and such a bad idea that it distracted from the scene many times. A.J. Buckley is the only reason to sit through this disaster. He was awesome! Sorbos stunt double for the horse riding scene was so obviously shorter and fatter with a terrible wig on that it made me laugh. The final scene was nice...lot's of really good explosions and good action but that wasn't enough to make you not regret wasting a coupon on this rental.
