This movie is pretty sad, the animation is terrible, especially when compared with a lot of stuff that was coming out of Japan at the same time(Vampire Hunter D). For some reason all the vignettes seem to have a really weak plot that involves either gratuitous violence or naked cartoon women with lots of t&a. Not to mention that the device used to interlink the stories is a glowing green orb that is the source of all evil in the universe, again not that impressive. Granted that many anime films seem to find a way to show quite a bit of naked people and violence, at least they do so with an engaging and intersting plot that contains the viewers interest rather than being something that looks like it was written by some blocked eighth grader looking to show naked women and lots of blood.
