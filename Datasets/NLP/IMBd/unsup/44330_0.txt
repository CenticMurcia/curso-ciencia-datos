By this time (1975) the humour of the double entendre was wearing thin - every line had been done over and over in previous Carry On movies, plus most of the original Carry On team had either passed away or just passed on appearing in this shocker. (Unfortunately, this wasn't the worst as Carry On Emmannuel was to follow and finally kill off the Carry On franchise.) Kenneth Williams can only flare his enormous nostrils so much before you want to stuff them with carrots. He wrote in his diary: "...it's the worst script I've ever read." "...it is unfunny and is mostly concerned with heavily contrived slapstick. Don't know why on earth they offer it to me." So, if it's a rainy winter's afternoon, you're not feeling well, there's nothing on any other TV channel and you PC is broken, then watch this... it'll pass the time. Otherwise, go do something else!
