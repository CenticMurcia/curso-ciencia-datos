Based on characters created by Stephen King is as good as it gets. Sorry, but this story is too similar to THE THING starring Kurt Russell to get very excited over. I did like the setting of the snow bound radio shack and the sounds of the harsh weather. Missing people return as the undead and the lurking evil is traced back to the half brother of one of the Marine rescue squad landing in the cold arctic.<br /><br />Faith Ford is adequate in this non-comedic role and is the most talented of the cast that also features Max Perlich, Clayton Rohner, Jennifer O'Dell and Daminan Chapa. If the weather has you trapped in you might appreciate more. Not a total waste of time, but close.
