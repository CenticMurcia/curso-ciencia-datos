This was my first experience of early John Waters movies and I found it pretty quality. Though quality is not something that one might immediately associate with the film owing to the extreme low budget and various goofs, it has a lot going for it. Divine and David Lochary put in fine performances and Mink Stole is also awesome with the rest of the cast effective too. The script, although dated, is often very funny and draws some fine characters, making the craziness that goes down pretty involving even while the technical ineptitude is offputting. The ineptitude doesn't matter too much as it is quite amusing, and the film has a few very memorable scenes that make one forget all about the shortcomings. Though I didn't find the film as demented as I expected it to be there are still moments that could cause a fair amount of offense. Personally I thought them to be sheer genius. I would definitely recommend this, mostly to grindhouse/cult weirdness fans.
