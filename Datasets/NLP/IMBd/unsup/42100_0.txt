When I read the jacket on the videotape, it sounded like an interesting story. A guy's sister is raped and he can't get over it and continues looking for her assailant. However, that really isn't what the movie was about. While it is true she is raped and he talks about finding her attacker, so much of the movie just seems banal and pointless. Along the way, we are shown a variety of naked women and images that MIGHT be true (or a dream or who knows),...but none of it really adds up to anything. While some might find it surreal and artsy, I just found it boring and a real drag. It's a shame, too, as the movie stars Gerard Depardieu--his talents are pretty much wasted, as anyone could have sleep-walked through the movie as they had his character do.
