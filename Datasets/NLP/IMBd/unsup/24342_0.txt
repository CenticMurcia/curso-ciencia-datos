This is a film that even now I have fond memories of, and can apreciate as a classic. The animation is not superb, and neigther is the story. However, it is strangely aplicable as a social commentary about American society. The story, although almsot laughable, is quite fun to enjoy. The cast of characters seems almost a marketing sceme of the mid-80's, but what children's TV program can claim not to be such? If for no other reason sit back enjoy the silliness, and just care.
