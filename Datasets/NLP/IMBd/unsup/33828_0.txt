Why do all movie Quakers have paper thin convictions to their morals? If this had been a movie about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, they would have him gunning down racists by the second reel. If they approached the life of Ghandi the way this movie treats Quakers, Ghandi would have been bombing churches.<br /><br />I am an atheist, but if there are any people on the face of the earth who do not kill, no matter the circumstances, it is the Quakers. If you were to believe this movie, Quakers are blood thirsty zombies out to seek revenge on anyone who crosses them.<br /><br />EVERY PRINT OF THIS FILM SHOULD BE DESTROYED.
