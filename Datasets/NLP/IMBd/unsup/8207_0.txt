This movie is well written and there are some quite entertaining jokes from the main characters Brodie and T.S. such as their argument over where in mall a cookie stand is. The story "flows" well and the characters are interesting and likable but I reckon that the characters of Jay and Silent Bob are the highlight of the movie. Their attempts to dismantle the stage by "exploiting its weakness" are genius. There is some sex type content, not very much however and its quite mild (I think) but I think it could have done without it, however that's just me I like my intercourse scenes absent and visible mammary glands blurred. If you are anything like my brother however (who is the total opposite in that area), you will enjoy these bits. Overall a very funny movie with some great jokes and well devised humour.
