i was lucky enough to have seen the show when it was originally broadcast. I have been looking for a copy of this show either on VHS or Video Disc. But have not been able to achieve my goal. Anyway, I remember that I was impacted, I fell in love with Liza that very first time, what a woman, Energy, Charisma, strength, voice. I remember watching her sing every song, I used to know all the lyrics of all her songs, and even remember some of the steps. It was the best show I ever saw, and actually have not been able to see another show like that. I've seen Madonna or Cher live, but they can't compare with Liza and her voice. I saw her live years later here on my hometown, she is still great, but I think that this is her best concert ever.
