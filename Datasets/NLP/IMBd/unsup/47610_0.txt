I have recently enjoyed watching some cartoons that have been pulled from circulation because they offend modern sensibilities. Some of them are actually pretty good cartoons with material that only offends annoyingly politically correct people (you know, the ones who think all humor is somehow evil and offensive). However, even with my love of free speech and hatred of things "p.c.", I certainly do understand why this film was yanked from general viewing. Bugs Bunny's nemesis in this film is a very, very offensively drawn and voiced Black character. And while almost all the film he really acted no different from Elmer Fudd, at the very end, Bugs tricked the guy by getting him to 'shoot dice'--a typically sad and obnoxious stereotype from the 1940s that claimed Black people were lazy and all they wanted to do was gamble!! This is just awful and considering that this isn't a wonderful cartoon apart from that, it is no great loss to the world that it can only be found by combing the internet. Even if this film had NOT been banned by Time-Warner, it would still be very skipable, as it's far from the best material from the era.
