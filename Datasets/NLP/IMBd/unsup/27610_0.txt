This movie ROCKS This movie is great. It is so funny that I couldn't believe it at all, not even a little bit.<br /><br />If you watch this film you will discover it is all about two little men with curly hair who go off on an adventure. When they rob a bank they quite rightly get put in a prison, where all they can dream of is to escape to a life of luxury in some other small town. They are allowed out to join a horse-burgling competition and have lots of fun.<br /><br />This movie is so funny, like killing a wasp right in the face, or when your chickens have gone walkabout. There is even a big fat man who sings beautifully LOL! My favourite part was when they escape from the prison BECAUSE THEY ARE DRESSED AS CLOWNS! The two men who play the two men are very funny. When they speak, amusing little speech comes out (so you can hear them). The one with orange hair looks like a cat LOL and he is the funniest little man since that other guy I like.
