I don't know if I would still think this movie was worth 8 or not. I have tried to find it for years, to view it as an adult and see if I would like it as much! I can't imagine how it was stuck into anybodies lineup. The letters must have come pouring in from all the far right fundamentalists! It seemed to be a TV movie way ahead of the pack with it's sensitive angle, from son's perspective. Nobody was a bad guy. I was following Scott Jacoby's career at the time and thought he did a great job! While portraying homosexuals was a brave career move (back then) for both Hal and Martin, I thought Scott stole the show! I think this may have been the best thing he did as an actor.
