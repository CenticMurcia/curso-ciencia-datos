I just don't get it. Most Jules Verne books, which I adore, are written like movie scripts. It is just so easy to figure out what a film faithful to a Verne book would look like. Just get a few good actors and a good director, a few special effects and there you go.<br /><br />But not with this and most adaptations from Jules Verne books. 2 long books are utterly betrayed. Everything is changed, from the type of aircraft, from what happens to it, from the characters that end up in it, from why people decided to get into such a canon ball in the first place when, in the original story, nobody was supposed to fly in it. The witty and amusing Michel Ardan is gone and replaced by a woman stowaway...<br /><br />Utter drivel. Just read the original and do the film in your head, it is so much better.
