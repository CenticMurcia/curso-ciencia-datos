I still remember this movie through the eyes of a 12 year old girl and while I may not be a good critic of quality acting & scripts, I do know that this movie has haunted me since I was 12. It must have had some good qualities but the only other reviews I've read criticized it. I started going to movies with my mother when I was 3 and of the thousands I've seen, this is one of my all time favorites.
