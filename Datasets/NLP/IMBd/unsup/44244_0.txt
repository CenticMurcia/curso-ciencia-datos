Sylvester Stallone stars as Ray Quick, a professional hitman hired by May Munro (Sharon Stone) who wants revenge for her parent's murder, in this overblown and sub-par actioner which stands out only for James Woods' performance as a crooked FBI agent. Other then that though, the movie is hideous and hideously dull.
