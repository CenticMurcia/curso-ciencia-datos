I am sorry, but it is a SIN that this film is not getting more recognition. It literally is one of the greatest movies about the art of dance EVER MADE. I mean, people, this is an awesome film about the ART of movement in its rawest most creative stage and there has never been a film like it.<br /><br />Please don't miss it.<br /><br />And also don't miss the Ab soundtrack CD.<br /><br />The use of music in the film is truly exceptional and not overwhelming.<br /><br />The documentary style is clever (even if it is a little hazy on detail and maybe stretches a few truths).<br /><br />And finally, please bring some children to see this so they can see the "other side".<br /><br />Secret political message of the film: why are we spending money in IRAQ when there is so much need here?
