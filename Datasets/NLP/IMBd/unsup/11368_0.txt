Watched at face value, this movie was decent. The jokes were sporadic enough to keep the otherwise monotonous story interesting. As this was a low budget, low production, small time movie, the expectations should not be too high.<br /><br />As for the past comments on stereotypes and lack of plot, this movie was designed to be a spoof of the Bruce Lee/martial arts movies at the time. Yune's character is unable to live up to the stereotypes which have been given to him through Hollywood (eg. Bruce Lee's machismo) and struggles with his identity. As an Asian American, Yune cannot live up to the macho Asian image yet is rejected (possibly as a threat) by the so called "real" white Americans.<br /><br />Unlike Hollywood movies, Yune's character is a regular Asian American male, neither hyper-masculine, feminized, asexual (by his many vulgar jokes), or a confused foreigner (Long Duk Dong). Though not overtly pursed, there seems to be some attraction by Pam Huntington's character towards Yune.<br /><br />Yune's character follows no stereotype, and is instead just a regular Asian American male. In the process, he is able to attract the attention of a white female as well as receive an on-screen kiss Â– something Bruce Lee, Jet Li (as was cut out of Romeo Must Die), and the apparently three dimensional Jackie Chan have all been unable to achieve in mainstream American media. If this movie ever had the chance to become Hollywood, all the above would have been undoubtedly cut.<br /><br />For the movie's failure to live up to preconceived images and stereotypes of males of Asian descent, alone, I give it an 8/10.<br /><br />As for previous comments on how one should not draw conclusions from a comedy movie, one should not draw conclusions from any movie at all.
