I watched this movie because I'm a fan of Ethan Hawke. Sad to say, there was little good about it. Frank Whaley always looked strained trying to get his part right, while Ethan appeared relaxed and natural. That's the difference between a want-a-be and an outstanding actor. The high light of the movie was when Ethan Hawke, playing an inept grocery store stocking clerk, kept dumping his load of boxes off the dolly. The part played by Whaley was of a loser want-a-be stand-up comic who could not make the grade and was never funny. The pathetic Whaley character was a thief (stole from his employer), drunk (what he stole was beer), argumentative individual (couldn't hold a job), and general misfit. As to the movie itself, it was a drag, repetitive in its plot with only the local changing. In other words, the plot was recycled every few minutes. In general slow and predictable, a bore to watch, and if you haven't seen it yet, don't waste your time.
