I toke it from local video rent on DVD and i wasted my money. The first one was better. It wasn't very good, but better than this one.<br /><br />First of all the story was pretty unclear, the characters was flat, the picture was bad. Entire story is focused in one room, school and very small street. The dialog was flat (even worse than a soap opera). Same things i can say about acting to. It wasn't clear enough why those creatures chasing lead character (i forgot her name), why they killed all her past boyfriends, what did it want from her? Questions, questions and questions without answers.
