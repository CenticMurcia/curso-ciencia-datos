I recently saw the original 1979 version of this film, where the screenplay, and professional consultation were done by the author herself. This remake, although it had quality actors, left out the critical material which made the original film (and the book) so unique, leaving this as another Hollywood rehash. James Caan and Lucas Haas both are wonderful in other projects, but they were given nothing to work with in this film. Rather than compare apples and oranges, I simply recommend people forget this film, and search for the 1979 Public Television Production-the first film ever made by PBS, and still the most requested item ever for PBS. Bruce Davison and Margaret Avery are wonderful, and if you realize the limited budget they worked with, you would be proud of that film.
