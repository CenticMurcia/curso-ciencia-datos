This has to be one of my favorite movies. My husband and I watch this and we both end up in tears (at different points) and can identify with the characters. We appreciate each other more (at least for a little while) after watching this movie. Marriage is not easy and the road that this couple travels together hits home with us. When feeling like things are getting too hard and giving up would just be easier, watching this movie puts things into perspective. Do I think that this movie is good for people having marriage difficulties? Maybe. But I do think that this is a good movie for anyone who has ever been married, or wants to be married, or is married. The fact that this movie has Bruce Willis in it was an added bonus, I mean, how can you go wrong with him in a movie?
