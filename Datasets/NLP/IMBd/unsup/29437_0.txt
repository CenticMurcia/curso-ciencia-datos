Loads of erotic thrillers do release & usually those movies have nothing much to offer, but 'Original Sin' is not only among a good erotic thriller, but also is a genuine thrilling flick. Wealthy Cuban Coffee merchant Luis Vergas (Banderas) advertises for a US wife. Julia Russell (Jolie), from Delaware, as a reply, sends her photograph & when he finally meets Julia on their wedding day, he is left breathless by her beauty & smoldering sexuality. But Julia may not be who she claims: first a private eye (Thomas Jane) shows up on behalf of Julia's sister, then the sister herself. By now, Luis has given has wife access to bank accounts, and when she runs with his cash, he pursues her, with the help of Downs, the P.I., perhaps to kill her. Nothing much can be revealed about the story & it actually is not a suspense flick, rather it is filled with thrilling moments. Director Michael Cristofer already gave the viewers 'Body Shot' & now he offers audience an erotic thriller, which has been presented in a very beautiful way. His direction is filled with emotions & thrills. The performances are good, Banderas & Jolie do share a perfect chemistry, both of them look dashing together. The performance by Jolie & Banderas is awesome. The love making scenes have been shot well & are shocking as well, & they are sensual & seducing as well. Thomas Jane was also fine, as a supporting character. The background score is very impressive & the song during the end credit is absolutely beautiful. The work of cinematography has been done in an amazing way. An absolutely fine thriller, with some sensual, seductive & thrilling moments in the movie, along with great chemistry of Banderas & Jolie.
