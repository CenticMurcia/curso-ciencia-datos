Despite a slow start, this movie gradually builds momentum as you become engrossed in the lives of its' characters. The leads Katt,Busey,and Vincent are all strong. They carry their roles of young surfer bums to mature adults very well. Bear's surfer guru and Vincent's veteran surfing legend are standouts. A good reflection of 60's and 70's moods and changes. Director Milius is a good storyteller.
