I hope I would be sleeping. What A waste of good young talent. Ben Affleck and Courtney Love should be ashamed of theirselves. The plot is very loose, the characters boring and the photography just adds insult to injury. The only thing good is the closing credits with the new Blondie song. (Trust me, buy the record rather than waiting around to hearit. Better memories!)
