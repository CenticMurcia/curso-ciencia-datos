I felt like I was...stuck in traffic. Hard to sit through. As much as you<br /><br />are not supposed to like Ben Affleck's character, his acting is flat<br /><br />too. His character has not depth and either does his performance.<br /><br />Hmm, which came first...chicken or egg here? The story idea is<br /><br />great, but it does not clip along at a good pace like a story taking<br /><br />place in a day like this one should to feel right. I could not sit<br /><br />through this movie. I left almost at the predictable end and got a<br /><br />latte.
