I went into this movie hardly knowing anything about the story. I should have done more research. <br /><br />I suppose it's a laudable effort, but it falls flat completely, in my opinion. <br /><br />The budding romance between the old prof (Kingsley) and the young hot Cruz is just okay. She's obviously a sexy woman, but seeing her in that situation with the professor made her seem less appealing, not more. <br /><br />Another thing that really bothered me about this movie was the pretentious classical music that was throughout. It became unbearable after a while, I must say.<br /><br />Negatives: Trite story acted out with no passion or innovation. Positives: Cruz is beautiful and intriguing but that's not enough to make this even mildly entertaining.
