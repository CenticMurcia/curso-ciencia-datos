This movie has a wonderful quality that would bring any distant family together. My children and I loved watching it together. It's nice to have a movie finally come out that everyone can enjoy. I highly recommend seeing it. Emma Thompson is so endearing. Colin Firth is such a lost soul trying to avoid everything and everyone around him. Angela Landsbury is so over the top, but very funny. Together they make such an interesting trio. The love, the comedy, the magic, and the unbelievable happy ending make it more than just a fairy tale, they make it a story that makes you wish that it was all happening to you. For children, it sets their minds imaginations into over-drive. It sends them to a place that lets their minds run free to believe in everything on the big screen in front of them. For just an adult, I would say, it would be less special, as apposed to an adult who has children to watch get engaged with this magical movie.
