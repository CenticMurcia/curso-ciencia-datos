I saw this ages ago, having recently watched on video. Normally I find comedies not worth watching twice, but Innerspace still made me laugh - even after all this time!!<br /><br />Martin Short's character Jack Putter was great. He was a wimpy nerd, perfect to be injected in the butt by the doc carrying Dennis Quaid. I liked the part where his face was changed to the Cowboy's and back again. Very funny!!<br /><br />Meg Ryan was a bit of a pain-in-the-butt (no pun intended), tho I think she should've married Jack, he was the cuter one!!! Dennis Quaid was great in this movie also, even confined to a teeny tiny pod floating around in Martins insides.<br /><br />The inside-the-body SFX were cool. The scenes where Dennis had to escape the heart, plus the parts where he gets to see thru Martin's eyes etc really made good effects. It makes you wonder how you'd feel if that happened to you, Martin's reactions are priceless!!!<br /><br />The bad guys provided plenty of comic relief, I like Cowboy's sleez and the big thug who fainted every time he saw something 'horrible'. The scene where Martin's hanging off the back of the truck was rather cool.<br /><br />I recommend this flick to anyone who likes sci fi, comedy, romance, action, adventure! Because this movie has the lot!!<br /><br />I give this flick 9 out of 10.
