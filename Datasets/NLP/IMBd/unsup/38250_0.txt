1st watched 12/12/2003 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Gary Fleder): Andy G. is pretty, but it doesn't make the movie any good. This movie with Andy Garcia isn't quite sure what it wants to be from the beginning to the end. Is it a black comedy? Nope. Is it a Love Story? Nope. Is it a crime thriller? Nope. Is it a good guy always wins, story? Nope. What the movie is about is a bunch of old crooks, getting back together for one more job and it ends up going bad and then they are hunted down by the mobster who gave them the job. There are some interesting character actors who do good in their roles mainly because they don't take themselves or their characters too seriously. Specifically, Mister Shhhh played by Steve Buscemi and Critical Bill played by Treat Williams. A wasted narrator(Jack Warden) walks us thru the story like we're talking about some "classic" people but we're really only talking about gangsters who were out for a buck. Garcia seems to be giggling inside thru parts of this movie which takes away any semblance of reality and of course he gets a pretty girl but other than this there isn't much else to be said about this good title, but poor movie.
