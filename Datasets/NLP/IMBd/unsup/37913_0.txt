Caught this during Showtime's free-view as the first of what (I hope) was an unintentional Ben Affleck Marathon, as this stinker was followed by another stinker (The Third Wheel), then one more for sh*ts and giggles (Reindeer Games). Why a Lifetime Razzie has so far eluded Benjy's talentless clutches is beyond me! As one of the posters said, just when you think he can't sink any lower, he does!<br /><br />You'd think Jack A-Hole would figure out how his minions REALLY think of him when they haul him to that dentist! Au contraire! After beating the crap out of the guy who beat the crap out of him, he goes back to the SAME DENTIST when he should be hauling the clown into court for making him look like Tom Cruise's retarded cousin! And some people wonder why this turkey was shelved for 2 years!<br /><br />The female characters are even more loathsome than their male counterparts. Barbi is a Dragon Lady racist clich√©! And like the rotten cherry on top, Mrs. Jack A-Hole and Dragon Lady duke it out in one room over his precious journal while the wife of a client he is desperate to land insists on aping Sharon Stone in another room while his Top Client (over whom Jack A-Hole kicked Mrs. Jack A-Hole out of the house) drops in to beg forgiveness! That whirring sound you hear is Preston Sturges spinning in his grave!<br /><br />So who winds up running things after Mr. and Mrs. Jack A-Hole kiss and make up in the fish tank? (I kid you not!) Why, the token lesbian of course, who has more cojones in her pinkie than all the men in the movie put together! 'Nuff said!
