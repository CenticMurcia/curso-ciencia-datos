Whether SubZero is the best Batman movie that is up for debate, but it is a long, long way from being the worst. The problem is really that it was released so close to Batman and Robin, but as far as I am concerned SubZero completely blows Batman and Robin out of the water. Apart from the colourful costumes and sets, Batman and Robin for me failed on characterisation, scripting and acting-George Clooney was completely wrong for Batman and Arnold Schwarznegger's Freeze didn't come close to the complex character he is in the comic books. SubZero, while not as ambitious as Mask of the Phantasm is a very good film. True, the secondary characters could've done with more development, but it is compensated by top notch animation, a good music score, surprisingly mature scripting and a compelling enough story, that is quite action packed, and the ending was very poignant to say the least. The voice acting and characterisations were exemplary. Batman is more a side character to Robin, but Kevin Conroy ensures he is his dark and brooding self like Batman should be. Robin here is quite heroic here and Barbara aka Batgirl is really beautiful. What made the film though was Freeze himself. While still chilling and ambitious, he is also sympathetic and loves his wife to death. Michael Ansara conveyed that perfectly. In conclusion, pretty darn good for a Batman film. 9/10 Bethany Cox
