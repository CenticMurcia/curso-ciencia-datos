Following a troika of greats with "Rushmore", "The Royal Tenenbaums" and "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou", Wes Anderson extended it with "The Darjeeling Limited". This one has brothers Peter (Adrien Brody), Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and Francis (Owen Wilson) traveling together on a train through India for a "spiritual journey". The dysfunctional family is clearly Wes Anderson's specialty, and he doesn't disappoint. Especially impressive is the scene showing the brothers before the trip to India (I liked how the scene throws the audience off).<br /><br />Are dysfunctional families becoming a cliché in Anderson's movies? Well, suspense was a cliché in Alfred Hitchcock's films, and Hitch made great use of it. Wes Anderson has made another good film here, and I recommend it. Part of the point is that, despite these people's problems, they're well-meaning. I can see the brothers as a branch of the brood in "The Royal Tenenbaums", with the luggage representing the emotional baggage with which the father left them (and then what they do to the luggage at the end).<br /><br />Anyway, a really good one. Anderson so far hasn't made a bad movie, and so I hope that he doesn't disappoint with "Fantastic Mr. Fox" (currently in production). Also starring Waris Ahluwalia, Amara Karan, Barbet Schroeder, Wallace Wolodarsky, Anjelica Huston, Natalie Portman, Irfan Khan and Bill Murray.
