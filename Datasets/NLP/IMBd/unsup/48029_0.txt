I AM NOT LYNNE BATES MY NAME IS RITCHIE LYNNE IS MY MOM IM JUST USING HER ACCOUNT! This is, without a doubt, the worst film ever made. I'm 12, and I have seen my share of cheesy comedies, Good Burger, Heavyweights and the rest. After seeing Good Burger I thought to myself "It cant get any more worse than this!". I was wrong. Terribly wrong. Slappy and the Stinkers is the worst family movie ever, I am even ashamed to say I have a watched-once-only VHS copy of it in my wardrobe that I got for my 9th birthday. The good thing is that it only lasts 76 minutes, IMDb have the running time wrong! I cannot list all the bad points, as there are so many obvious cheesy kid movie catches in it. In one scene, a man slips on a skateboard, crashes into a crowd of people, LITERALLY flies across the room, and lands in a large aquarium tank, and emerges with a octopus that looks its right out of "The adventures of Timmy the Tooth" stuck to his face! Give me a break! I really can't explain just how crap it is, you have to see it to believe it. Snap up a copy quick, it'll be in the 99cent video bin with Good Burger!
