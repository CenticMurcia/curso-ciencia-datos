the movie and it's consistency with,the reality of such kind of religion originated community, is marvelous since you feel familiar most of the stages with the man you recognize which is rigidly religious.It is rare and very difficult to create such kind of complicated film especially for a director which had directed only moderate TV series in Turkey.He surpassed the expectation thanks to his talent and observation.Besides director, the casting and performance of the actors is impressive since they really overcame the difficulty of the performing the characters who are rare in community and which differs from society by small details.The way pilot flows is satisfactory but on the other hand,the simplicity of some parts of the movie, especially in final minutes,does not meet the expectation of the audience which expects the ultimate end.The issue director criticize is imagined untouchable for the conservative parts of society.according to me we should congratulate the courageous and objective view of director.it is a good film for whom are open minded and opposing.
