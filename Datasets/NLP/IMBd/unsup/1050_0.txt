I must admit that if seeing Paul in mid rant were my only knowledge of him I would share other's concerns about his teaching methods. But let's face it, he was playing to the camera and 6-9 months worth of interactions were condensed down to the most entertaining cursing sessions. You could see the counter balance to the rants, in the end sequences there was much affection expressed all around.<br /><br />But, lets focus on the film here; it is funny, moving and shows what kids can do when expectations are high. Go and see this film, if you like to see kids amaze you, and surpass their teacher.<br /><br />Rock school is not for all kids, it has been a source of great growth - both musical and personal for one of my kids, but I know that it would not be the right fit for his sibling. So for those of you who are stuck on why any parent would pay to submit their child to this "abuse", I would say that in reality many different wonderful teachers ( including Paul) are involved with this school and just as this movie will enhance an evening, this school is enhancing many lives.
