This film is about a lot of things- I think the primary motif and theme is the male body- the three brothers wear slim fitting, 60's or 70's style suits and accessories, and are often shown in little more than a pair of boxers or light cotton pajamas. They run in slow motion; they place themselves physically close to one another even when they are in conflict; and Jason Schwartzman's love scene with "Rita" is visually PG (no nudity, no obvious humping) - but when he licks his fingers and puts them "somewhere" down below the camera frame, he participates in one of the more sensual sex scenes I have seen. Moreover, the brothers save the three Indian boys from the river and must grasp onto them physically, bodily - this contact is essential. The father of the one dead boy also washes and oils his son's corpse. The film is about heterosexual, intimate, male-male contact- how men can become close to one another physically, emotionally, and spiritually without any suspicions of homosexual undercurrent. This male-male friendship - maybe bro-love? - is the rock upon which the shifting visual sands of the movie comes to rest. Women disrupt, but bring joy - brotherhood is difficult, it is not a choice, but it is somehow far deeper than romantic love. The film is beautiful - pure, sensual, deadpan, intentionally eccentric Wes Anderson - but betraying, as always, an emotional impulse towards the "family romance" - the inimitable love between family members that respect one another.
