This movie is splendid. It tells the story of lives, basically. The ups and down of a family. It could be the story of my life, or it could be of yours.<br /><br />The action takes place in Italy, and the movie goes side by side with its protagonists. In six hours, it tells the story of their lives. An involving, mesmerizing and "real" story. Not softened, it actually looks real.<br /><br />The action is very well fitted into some of Italy most important events, and the characters have connection with it all, somehow. I admire the script, the labyrinthic action, which is not confusing at all, but is perfectly mixed together. The puzzle, once completed, is beautiful. Like someone said in the movie: "Everything is beautiful".<br /><br />It has a great cinematography, but pretty discrete. Our eyes and attention are focused on the plot, and not on fantastic camera movements, or a "music video" type editing.<br /><br />It's a sober, and excellent movie. One that sticked to my head, like no one did a "long" time ago.<br /><br />And don't get fooled by it's length. You'll dive into the screen, and time just seems to fly. Really.<br /><br />Don't miss it.
