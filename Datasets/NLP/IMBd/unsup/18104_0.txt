VITUS is a Swiss film,that has just been released to DVD from playing in ONLY a handful of theatres from July to October 2007. This my friends is a crying shame, they release violent, hate filled films in 2000 theatres,<br /><br />VITUS is a simple but yet complex tale of a child prodigy, a musical genius,whose IQ is 180. Our young hero would prefer to be a normal every day lad who loves playing the piano.<br /><br />As I said this lad is a genius, & how he achieves his goal is just wonderful.<br /><br />Swiss directer Fredi Murer directed with great care,Peter Luisi & Lukas B. Suters very intelligent screenplay.<br /><br />Vitus is played by Fabrizio Bursoni as a delightful precocious 6 year old then by TEO GHEORGHIU when he is 12.<br /><br />Teo himself is a very gifted piano player, who has appeared in concert halls in Europe & in the US. A bright future ahead for this young virtuoso. He is also a very good actor.<br /><br />The director picked the right lad for this role..<br /><br />Julika Jenkins & Uri Jucker are pitch perfect as the caring parents of this gifted young lad.<br /><br />The only known actor in the cast is BRUNO GANZ, one of Europe & Germany's finest & best actors,playing Vitus's grandfather. He is a grandfather every lad & girl wishes they had. PURE PERFECTION.<br /><br />He should be nominated for a supporting actor Oscar or Golden Globe,/ but he will not, because so few have seen the wonderful movie. The film should be nominated in many categories as well.<br /><br />SHAME ON YOU Hollywood---YOU LET THIS ONE SLIP BY. This is an excellent family film with superb classical music,played by a real 12 year old piano virtuoso. It may be boring for the wee ones,but not for older children.<br /><br />There are many very humorous moments,very few sad ones & a few exciting ones.<br /><br />I loved this film SO WILL YOU<br /><br />Ratings **** (out of 4) 97 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)
