Dick Powell is a down on his luck musician/singer from Brooklyn who's looking for some kind of work at Priscilla Lane's dude ranch. She signs him on as a new singing cowboy although Powell has a deathly fear of anything on four legs. Visiting talent agents Pat O'Brien and Ronald Reagan hear Powell and immediately want to manage him. All of this ain't sitting too well with Dick Foran, Lane's sweetheart. Powell is moving in on him in the talent and love departments.<br /><br />Cowboy from Brooklyn is so typical of the wonderful entertaining nonsense that movies used to be about. But Dick Powell by this time was desperately trying to broaden his image. It was being continually cast in these kind of films that made Powell leave Warner Brothers two years later after his contract was up.<br /><br />Pat O'Brien made six features with Powell, more than anyone else except James Cagney. By this time he was playing fast talking press agents, managers, etc. in his sleep. He too would leave Warner Brothers in two years for greener pastures. <br /><br />Ronald Reagan before he left for even greener pastures said that the two best friends he made at Warner Brothers were Pat O'Brien and Dick Powell. He described both as being inordinately patient and kind with a new player just getting started. He never forgot the encouragement both gave him in his career.<br /><br />Dick Foran in Boy Meets Girl showed he had some hidden comedy talents in burlesquing his singing cowboy image. He does it again here, deliberately singing offkey and flat to contrast with Powell's tenor. Not too many performers would let themselves be deliberately upstaged like that. At the time he was the singing cowboy star at Warner Brothers and he too would be leaving them shortly.<br /><br />The gimmick here is how Powell turns into what O'Brien built him up as. It's pretty funny I have to say and here's a hint. Think Road to Rio.
