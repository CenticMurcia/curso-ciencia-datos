Just saw this movie. The acting was good, the plot boring, and where was the suspense, thriller, or horror in this movie. It seems to have been made as a TV movie for the ABC Family channel, or Disney channel. A very safe movie. Courtney is a very good actress, she moved the movie along, but deserves a better vehicle and scrip. I can not say more without giving away the ending, but there were so many holes in the plot, and not believable situations, that it was hard to even suspend disbelief. For an after school movie might have been nice, but the synopsis, and other comments supporting this movie on Netflix were misleading. I was hoping to see something scary, or suspenseful, instead, I was wishing for the movie to end.
