A great one from the early Chuck Jones era. Of all the Merrie Melodies of the prewar period, this is one of the best. Just hum the first few bars, everyone knows the song! How many other songs from the 30's get instant recognition? The dancing is cute and I am amazed how good the singer is. I didn't realize it was Butch from the Little Rascals before! If you are fans of old movies and early TV, the other voices were all character actors from that time. <br /><br />The Chicken Lady with the Betty Boop voice is an unsung hero of early animation, usually uncredited - Cookie in the Buddy toons and the original Petunia Pig.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fave of mine - Rated A
