Thinking about what the movie implies, it's small wonder that director Cy Endfield was blacklisted during the McCarthy 1950's. This is a particularly hard-hitting and suspenseful depiction of an ordinary man (Frank Lovejoy) down on his luck as he tries to provide for his family and hold on to his self-respect at the same time. His desperation finally leads to a life of crime, under the influence of a preening small-time crook (LLoyd Bridges)-- (notice how cleverly Bridges bends Lovejoy to his will in the pivotal bowling alley scene and thereafter). <br /><br />Really harrowing scenes, especially the last sequence, which I believe has no equal in angry mob realism. Expert acting, especially from Bridges who was an interesting performer in this part of his career. But most notable for Katherine Locke's truly exotic performance as Hazel, the manicurist. Never has a paste-on smile or cheap hair adornment conveyed as much lower-class longing as here, her car ride with Lovejoy furnishing enough material for a dozen feminist tracts.<br /><br />Film is damaged by several preachy scenes and voice-overs, attempting to smooth-over the highly disturbing visuals. I'm sure these were not Endfield's choice, but were inserted as concessions to the production code of the time. Script is based on actual event in San Jose, CA, in 1933, while vivid depiction of college boys from local parochial college leading the charge is also based on fact. Loss of social conscience filmmakers like Endfield shows how much was lost during Hollywood purges, and why cold war audiences got 15 years thereafter of Rock and Doris fluff along with Tennessee Williams escapism.<br /><br />Highly recommended to those with a strong stomach.
