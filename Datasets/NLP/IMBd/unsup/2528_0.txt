I've seen this flick probably 6-8 times; Gaynor, Streisand and of course Garland; not a contest; Garland kicks butt!!; I love this story; but, it should have been done once; maybe with March and Garland if possible. but, Judy shines and this movie forever made her a star; Lawford is weak in the Garland version; Gaynor is fine; Streisand embarrasses; and the performance of the year, Garland. Too bad, we couldn't have a Judy, Frederic et all.; The perfect American Movie; Why must Lawford be given any laurels for this? I was embarrassed for him; Was he drunk? :) Too much Rat Pack perhaps; anyway, Judy lives forever in my Gay heart and this made her a star; <br /><br />(Correction; For all of you who realized that Mason not Lawford played Judy's husband Norman Maine; I apologize; sorry; and, Good Catch. :)
