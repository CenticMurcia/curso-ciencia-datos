I enjoyed this flick. Sure it wasn't the best movie made and it surely would not win an award, but it was a fun film. There are a couple of the Godzilla movies in the 90's I liked more, but this one did not disappoint. The dubbing is rather good for everyone except the guy who is trying to kill Godzilla. He sounds a bit to deep voiced and at one point when he laughs he goes "Ha, Ha, Ha", but other than him the dubbing is good. There is also a bit of dead zone where godzilla isn't around between godzilla's first encounter the flying saucer and the final battle, but it is not to bad. Also, they kind of ignore the movie Godzilla vs. Destroyah even though they show Godzilla's son taking over the reigns this fact is ignored and all the characters from the 90 films are ignored as well. All and all it is a fun movie and there is a good battle at the end.
