I still love the Flintstones cartoon. A reminder of a younger, some would say simpler time in my life. This movie, on the other hand, is a reminder of a younger, some might say less intelligent time in my life. I watched this movie tonight for the first time in about six or seven years. First of all, I don't know how Halle Berry went from this movie to an Oscar winning actress. As far as the story goes, there are not really any complaints. Its expected to be simple, and I can respect that. The problem with this movie, which is essentially eye candy(well it was back then), is the acting. John Goodman, who has made some fine turns in films like "Fallen" and "The Big Lebowski", is just bad. It seems to me that he is doing his best Jackie Gleason impression, and its really not all that good. Rosie O'Donnell gives a stiff, and yet somehow melodramatic performance. Don't ask me how thats possible. Rick Moranis is just annoying as Barnie. Elizabeth Perkins is extremely one dimensional and fails to capture the fire of a cartoon character. In all fairness, this is also the fault of bad direction. All in all, I'm glad I'm older now because I can see the errors of my ways, and the errors of others ways as well. If you're over six, avoid this movie like the plague because its just bad. 4 out of 10.
