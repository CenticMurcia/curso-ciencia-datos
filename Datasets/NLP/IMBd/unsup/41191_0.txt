"Amerika" had potential, but squandered it in a storyline that made no sense and in characters that made even less sense.<br /><br />I watched this miniseries when it was broadcast, and taped it thinking it would be something worth keeping. I've never been inclined to view those tapes, because the non-sequitors were annoying the first time through.<br /><br />This was a dreadful production. It isn't obscure because it was controversial, it's obscure because it's dreadful. The Russians are in charge, but why does that mean there is no running water? I kept waiting for the story to go somewhere, for Kris Kristopherson to start acting (never happened!), for some character, somewhere to make me care what happened to them.<br /><br />This miniseries is not a suppressed gem. It's a well-ignored waste of time, talent, and potential.
