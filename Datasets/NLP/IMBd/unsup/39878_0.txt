Sure the plot in general is kind of like an Indiana Jones film but that is where the similarities end. Dolph does a good enough job acting, but the other actors are just plain awful. William Shriver who plays Mr. Chambers may be one of the worst actors I have ever seen, just plain awkward. The story is very simple and there is lots of down time between any semblance of action which is pretty obviously there just to waste time.<br /><br />The action sequences were very poorly done and quite unoriginal. Luckily I did not pay for it or I would be very disappointed so this is not even worth your time for a rental. I really don't think anybody who isn't a die-hard Dolph fan would even have any chance of enjoying this movie. If this is the best movie parts Dolph can get, then even his straight to video career is going to be over very soon. The production value is much worse than any other straight to video movies starring himself or Wesley Snipes or Seagal or Van Damme and so is the entertainment value. Just stay away and watch one of the 50,000 movies that are better than this drivel.
