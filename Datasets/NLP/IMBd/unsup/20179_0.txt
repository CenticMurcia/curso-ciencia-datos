My one and only reservation about "White Rabbit" is that having an episode so focused on Jack when he was already given plenty of screen time in the previous episodes and especially in the Pilot was perhaps a bit unfair to many other characters. And yet, "White Rabbit" proves its value by laying the groundwork for a lot of the themes that will be dominant in the future: Jack's leader role; the Jack-Locke "man of science, man of faith" dynamic (the dialogue in this scene is particularly well-written); father-son relationship problems; ghostly manifestations on the island (already introduced in "Walkabout", but now made more clear), specifically connected to the characters; flashbacks that go back to the character's childhood; the realization that the survivors will probably have to stay there for a long time; etc. It is admirable how these 5 first episodes just build onto each other, essentially telling one long story. ***1/2 out of 4.
