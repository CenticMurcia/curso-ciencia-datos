Footloose is one of the most definite 80's musical/drama movies. came out in 1984 one year after "Flashdance" and became his male answer. Kevin Bacon is responsible to all the "Dirty dancing" in the movie as the leading actor and in a rule that evident gave him his big breakthrough and chance to become the high respected actor that he is right now.<br /><br />Chris Penn ( R I P ) as "The New Kid At School" Bacon best friend and the one that understand him the most. Sara Jessica Parker from "Sex And The City" in a minor rule in addition to John Lithgow from "3rd Rock From The Sun" as the protected reverend that does everything he can to avoid from Bacon to enter his "Wild" life style habit and ideas into the other teenager and violate the quite in his peaceful town. <br /><br />the movie also has excellent soundtracks from some of the best songs of the decade like "Holding Out For A Hero" of Bonnie Tyler ,and "Let's Hear It For The Boy" of Deniece Williams .<br /><br />good acting from all the actors and actress in the cheesy spirit of the 80's.well done very recommended. 8/10.
