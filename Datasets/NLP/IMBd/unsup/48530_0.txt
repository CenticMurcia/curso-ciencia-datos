The people who made this film must must really be in love with Anna Faris to think that 90 minutes of her making scrunchy faces was a movie. She is fun to watch for her physical comedy, but that was the only thing I enjoyed watching this. I thought the writing was poor and the actors miscast. Adrian Brody with dreadlocks? John Krasinski as an introvert? Danny Trejo showed up and didn't even get to do anything badass.<br /><br />Was the movie trying to be clever by having pot dealers talk economics and putting in undertones of existentialism and communist dogma? Or was it supposed to be mindless fun as other reviewers suggested? The end result is that it doesn't work either way.<br /><br />Here's my spoiler: a girl gets stoned, effs things up, runs from place to place meeting people and getting into situations meant to be ironic, and continues to screw things up until finally she is arrested and sentenced to community service.<br /><br />I didn't think any of the situations she ended up in were clever, and the settings were very mundane--unforgivable for a movie that is meant to be a journey or a "day in the life." I should have felt more transported, but not once did I wish I was there or in her place. I did laugh a few times, but overall it adds up to one I won't watch again.
