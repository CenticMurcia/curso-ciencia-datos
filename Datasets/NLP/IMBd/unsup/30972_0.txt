I saw Clean Shaven about ten years ago and it has always stayed in my mind not least because it committed to celluloid one of the most toe-curling scenes I have ever witnessed but because it managed to portray a man who is mentally broken. It did this in a most effective way. So much so that I have always kept an eye out for anything by Lodge Kerrigan since. Ten years later with two more films(one destroyed) under his belt the director has put together what on the surface seems an almost paper thin storyline but is in fact an intense and gripping film about a man coping with the loss of his daughter. Throughout Kerrigan puts the camera in Damien Lewis's face which builds up a claustrophobic atmosphere that does not let up at any point. There are some intensely powerful moments and these are unbearably moving. Kerrigan allows us to think that possibly William Keane has imagined the daughter although my own opinion is that she is real. Damien Lewis goes to a place that must have been very uncomfortable for him and manages to give us a glimpse into the life of a very damaged and haunted man. Trapped by a moment in time Keane re-lives it over and over in a mindless cycle that makes no sense to anyone but him. For me the most moving scene was the scene at the ice rink. It makes me wonder how many people are really damaged by something and occasionally that psychosis flares up and takes over. I thought Keane was an exhaustingly powerful film with scenes that will stay with me for a long time. Above all else I shall remember the face of William Keane looking off camera just at the moment he thinks he glimpses something, perhaps a little girl, his little girl. Then nothing.
