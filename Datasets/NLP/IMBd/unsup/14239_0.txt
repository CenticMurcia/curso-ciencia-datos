I enjoyed the acting and the plot... but the rest kept reminding me that I should not spend much time in front of a TV. Perhaps it's a big step for modern Russian movie industry, but am I wrong for desiring a movie that is _done_ better?<br /><br />I agree with those who commented that movie looks unrealistic and sound is barely comprehensible. What are those colorful costumes in so perfect clean/ironed/etc condition every day for both Russian and Turkish soldiers? Is that a war or a parade?<br /><br />Now the sound - it's mostly muffled and is quite colorless. I'm feeling really bad for those who spent their energy playing there.<br /><br />A few things look odd in the context of the war story. Maybe it's just my personal perception. Harry-Potter-like effects when Fandorin goes into his memories, looks plain over-done to me. The way the machine (which looks like a train) is shown reminds me about some comedy, and not so much about a war story - again, odd in the context. I'm OK to have bright and fun side in a war move... but not to the level of comics.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these things take away a lot from the overall feeling of otherwise great movie.
