Most reviews of this film will explain why this film is better than the original American film "Fingers." But instead of watching "The Beat that my Heart Skipped" to see a rare French remake of an American film, watch this film to see one of the most gripping acting performances of the last several years. Romain Duris, playing a very different character than he did in "L'Auberge espagnole," is absolutely phenomenal: he takes a role that could be (based on the plot summary) corny and sentimental and makes it gritty and believable.<br /><br />While you're watching, notice all the unusual camera angles that highlight the general feeling of instability that the main character is experiencing.<br /><br />Who knew that beating people up with frying pans and playing Bach could be so compatible?
