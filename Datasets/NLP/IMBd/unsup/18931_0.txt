This is a very strange film - so strange that if you don't know the story beforehand, it won't make any sence at all. It is filmed uniquely (lost of special camera effects), using minimal intertitles. The subject matter is racy, to say the least, and you get to see plenty of skin from beautiful people. is it a fantastic movie? not especially, but worth seeing.
