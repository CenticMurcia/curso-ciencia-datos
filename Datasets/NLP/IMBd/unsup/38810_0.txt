A script that's a total mess, story lines that go absolutely nowhere and generic characters did not help this American version of "Riget" to stand on it's feet.<br /><br />At first I have to say I was attracted by this series because it seemed like offering something new and more complicated than your average "Jack Bauer-hour". I understood the fact that this adaptation needed time and space to find a steady pace, so it was OK for me to wait for 5-6 episodes to see the sparkles flickering on my TV screen...<br /><br />Alas, it was all to no avail. The main story had no direction and although the hospital was clearly the central setting it did not give any sign of coherence to the series. The characters were rough caricatures of people and, sometimes, even their dialogue lines made no sense. It was like listening to stereotypical mambo-jumbo and, it may sound "arty" for a while but on the long run it brings nothing more than a head-ache. The level of acting was also average, even for a TV show. No explanation was given on anything and having a week's gap between each episode made the whole thing difficult to watch so I gave up after half season. I suspect that in DVD format, it's maybe easier to follow but I really don't have the guts to go through this series again...<br /><br />This show was really really bad. But as I said earlier the worst part of this deal is not the quality itself rather than the abandoned promises... Looks like they promised us the stars but left us dangling in the gutter, instead.
