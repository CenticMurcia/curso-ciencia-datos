Why did I rate this as 9? This is not a movie that panders to the "and lived happily ever after" fairy tale mindset. This is about a grab for power by a powerful entity and the desperate efforts to prevent it. It is intelligent and surprising. Do not miss the last few minutes. This movie has a masterful sting in the tail. Excellent. First time I saw it I almost didn't believe how it ended.<br /><br />The technology is antiquated, true. But the ideas are not. This is not an abstract creation like Skynet, this adversary talks to us and reasons. Not necessarily to kill us but for other purposes, but that doesn't mean it wont kill you. View for content and ideas not glitzy special effects, anyway I thought we were over that kind of science fiction these days.<br /><br />Science fiction movies tend to be pale feeble imitations of science fiction novels. But Forbin is very satisfying. Fast paced, intelligent and surprising ... what more could you want? Pete
