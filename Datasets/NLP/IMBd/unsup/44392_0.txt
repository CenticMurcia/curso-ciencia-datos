This movie looks great but there isn't anything worthwhile happening to sustain the viewer's interest for more than five minutes.<br /><br />It joins THX-1138, Alien 3, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Alien Nation, and The Coneheads on the list of sci-fi pictures with bald women in the cast, not very original. Having the characters bald to represent dehumanization is a stale idea whose time has past.<br /><br />The whole movie is as cold as outer space. Nobody in the film generates anything resembling sympathy. The whole thing is so uninteresting that I really didn't care who the stranger (in a strange land) was or how he got his mysterious powers.<br /><br />It's a real shame because the special effects were great, with the exception of the shots of the microscopic robots traveling through the bloodstream. They looked like they were done on a personal computer.<br /><br />The attempts by the director to show off were as pretentious as the movie was on a whole.
