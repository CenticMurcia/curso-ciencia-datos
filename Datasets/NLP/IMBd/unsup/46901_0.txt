This ''film'' is seemingly a collection of unrelated scenes strung together by three different directors who must have hated each other and the business of film-making . Faith Clift the lead actress looks and acts like a dead zombie who's been lobotomized and then drugged , Charles (Richard) Moll , with the ever changing wigs looks and sounds lost , Marc Lawerence in a dual role is horrible in both ''roles'' and finally Robert Bristol the prissy Satan rep on earth is about as scary as whipped cream . The nightmare however does end , but only after you've suffered a wasted 70 or so mins of this mess .Fans of bad films will enjoy this , it could also be used as an example of how not to make a film .
