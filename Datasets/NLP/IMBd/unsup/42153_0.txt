Proof that anyone with a video camera and enough desire can compete with the big boys. It's good to see that any schlub can now get his message out there rather than all the power in the hands of the elite. That being said, why anyone would have such a fixation on a human being they hardly know was disturbing. I'm glad that Drew Barrymore didn't seemed bothered by it, maybe she was relieved as she might have felt this guy wasn't a potential danger to her after meeting him. Watching him trying to get into shape in the time he had was ridiculous. A major problem I had with the movie though was I couldn't tell if the main character was gay or not, which created a lot of distracting dissonance.
