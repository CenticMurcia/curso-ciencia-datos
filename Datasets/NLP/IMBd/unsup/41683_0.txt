At first glance, Take the Lead looks like it will take the "Inspirational light drama" genre to a new level. But a lack strong story structure and a reliance on clichés undermine it.<br /><br />Antonio Bandaress plays his role well. He is every bit the suave cool dance teacher one would expect to reach out to inner-city kids. However, except for a couple of the kids the other cast members are fairly mediocre. The movie also has decent dialog. Most of it is convincing and fits the characters.<br /><br />Take the Lead has more interesting direction than most movies of its type. There are some interesting shots. But that is not enough to save some of the more clichéd scenes. Also, the proper emotion is present in some of the grittier scenes showing the kids home lives.<br /><br />The movie is hindered by its lack of plot. It opens by setting up its premise reasonably well. But then it descends into random dance lessons and struggles at home with the kids. Those type of scenes are not enough to hold interest, in my opinion.<br /><br />Take the Lead will appeal to fans of dance and light dramas. Others will believe it to be territory that has been explored one too many times. Be cautious when deciding whether or not to spend time on this film.
