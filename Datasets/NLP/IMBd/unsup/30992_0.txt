In Keane, director Lodge Kerrigan shows us a world we often try to avoid, the world of poverty and mental illness. Damian Lewis is riveting as the title character. Keane is a man who is struggling to be normal in spite of his illness, isolation and the loss of his child. We see Keane's life with all it's ugly and often self-destructive details that include drug use, violence, and anonymous sex. But somehow Kerrigan and Lewis make us pity Keane. The scenes that show interaction between Keene and the young girl he befriends are both terrifying and touching. The film is intense, exciting, scary and brilliant. This is an important movie and both Lodge Kerrigan and Damian Lewis deserve recognition for creating this incredible movie.
