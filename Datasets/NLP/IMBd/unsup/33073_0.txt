WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.<br /><br />Alright, when I saw this movie on the shelves at my bro-in-law's mother's house, I figured it would be pretty good and asked to borrow it. I've seen some REALLY great shark movies, but then some that were not so great and with my knowledge of shark films, this looked decent... my knowledge was never so wrong. This movie is a TOTAL waste of time to watch. Supposively it's about these two people who get stranded out in the middle of the water and they both die, so someone is just going to predict what happened out there. Here are the reasons why I didn't like this movie:<br /><br />1. If they both died, that means someone just took a complete stab in the dark at what probably happened out there while they were missing, which in the end really made me mad, because that is also what I predicted was going to happen, and if they both didn't die in the "true events", I think it was a poor choice making them both die in this movie.<br /><br />2. The sharks that surrounded them while they were afloat would have ripped them to shreds at the first sight of food - THEY WOULDN'T SWIM AROUND FOR DAYS AND NOT TRY TO EAT THEM. I mean, I know humans can never know what animals are exactly thinking which is why I love animal attack films, but come on, when an animal's hungry, IT'S GOING TO EAT, we know THAT much for sure.<br /><br />3. This movie was BORING, BORING, BORING, because most of the time you're watching it, they are just floating in the water not doing anything and it's completely pathetic!!!!! I know they were probably trying to build up suspense and such, but they did an extremely poor job of doing so.<br /><br />There, so that's why this movie is so so horrible!!!! It's not the worst film ever, but by God it's pretty well near it! I'm sorry I wasted my time on it...
