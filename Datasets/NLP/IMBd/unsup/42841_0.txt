College English professor Steve (Director Brett Kelly) plans to propose to his occult-loving, vegetarian girlfriend (and one time student) Amy (Caitlin Delaney). So after he accidentally kills her (in a ridiculous way), he chooses to bring her back with the help of the incantation books she conveniently owned to mixed results. They drive to an out of the way cabin in order to wait for her to 'get better'. But when his friends show up to party at the cabin, Steve has to keep them from figuring out that Amy's now a zombie. Fortunately, his friends seem to be as brain dead as Amy is all dead.<br /><br />This silly little low-budget number was extremely stupid, yet I cracked a smile once or twice despite myself. Of the three Brett Kelly films I've seen thus far(the Bonesetter Returns, Final Curtain & The Feral Man), I feel it's safe to say that I enjoyed this one the most by far. Not to say that the film is flawless (it has many MANY of them) just that it had a fun atmosphere to it so I could overlook most of them.<br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />Where i saw it: Instant Netflix viewing
