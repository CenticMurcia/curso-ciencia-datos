I remembered it starred with Robert Goulet. It was like a play version of the story. I am 44 and I can still hear the sounds of "Brigadoon, Brigadoon" and "This was a real nice clambake, ..." I have seen Robert Goulet in several plays , Camelot, and Man of LaMancha. I would like to see this earlier work.
