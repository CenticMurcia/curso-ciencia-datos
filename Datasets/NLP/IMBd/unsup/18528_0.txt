Ten minutes in I was wondering if the National Organization of Women was still around; want to apprise them of this film--in ways that frequently clench my teeth continuous reduction of women to cheesecake in order to generate men's interests. Maybe shouldn't be too hard of the filmmaker(s); they did throw in token smart gal, who's also token the black and 50+ normal looking Kelly McGillis; both serving to placate women who would get mad if not for their presence. Well neither worked for a certain 40 plus black woman. God again wish there was a minus rating scale. <br /><br />Few films in my life have I seen women horribly relegated to the ranks of gorgeous but mindless scenery. Wouldn't be surprised a pervert was a major participant in the production of this tripe. Majority of women are showing bare midriffs and in brief thongs and screaming fear these babes (and dullard chauvinists littering the film a little less) takes away from developing the story above a Girls Gone Wild eatery for monster with male eaten to cover up the obvious. It takes place in fun in sun Hawaii--we know. Do we need that overly long scene of fashion photographer working on his ideas with bikini gals? No! Thank God the token black was also the token girl dressed modestly. Sadly she's the only one attempting carrying the film--granted coming of as a precocious little girl but everyone in this acts immature--even the actress as the deviating female; no one's acting.<br /><br />And finally that super-grating supergator, what does this writer think of him? Well just said it--Grating. EAT in blur, first EATING chomp spurts blood, run after hapless victims to EAT--There's no rudimentary problem solving, no cleverly out-thinking prey! And the people don't think of a way to get it dead that's imaginative--Solution's straight from 1st Jaws movie as is the opening scene setting up the storyline.<br /><br />There, my long warning and here's my final shorter one. Avoid this.
