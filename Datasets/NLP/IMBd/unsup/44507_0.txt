Though incoherent, The Visitor has potential to be a really good movie. The main negative point was the music score, I mean come on you can at least find a decent composer. The other was the acting of the little possessed girl. At sometimes it was good but sometimes she was trying too hard.<br /><br />However the Visitor does have some positive points. The acting of the adult leads is decent, for the time the special effects were not that bad, and the last 30 minutes are quite suspenseful. One might find that his/her pulse races in the climax. All in all The Visitor is a passable time killer, that is incoherent, yet very fun to watch. Give it a chance. Rating: **1/4(music keeps it from getting **1/2) out of ****
