I'd heard it wasn't a good movie, but I rented it anyway because I ran out of options at the local video rental. Bad call. Rob Reiner, who usually is good at making catchy comedies, fails miserably this time around.<br /><br />It's a shame because it tends to taint all the quirky, fun memories that the delightful "When Harry Met Sally..." offered a decade ago. Bad script, bad direction, bad acting equals bad movie. Every acting "effort" in this movie pretty much sucks, but special mention must go to Rita Wilson (AKA Mrs. Hanks). I had no idea she was this bad. I'd never seen her in a movie before and now I know why.
