What a horrible movie. I had this on my list of DVD's to own. I finally bought it. If only you could return purchased movies for store credit.<br /><br />Movie starts out fine. Whether it's slow or not as other have said, it keeps my interest...as I thought it was going to be a good movie. This was nothing but a horrible attempt at...something...I just don't know what. Oh wait, I know...spend your money on this movie so I make a profit by making the cover eye catching and the summary interesting.<br /><br />The characters acting was fine. I like Ron Perlman. But there lacked a feasible plot with unanswered questions. In fact, the plot was nothing less than leaving you laughing. When you find out what was going on, I was left speechless. Speechless as in...you have got to be kidding me!<br /><br />I swear, either these quotes by the reviewers are made up...or they don't know a thing about a horror movie. One guy is quoted as saying on the cover, "the scariest movie of the year." Yeah, remember the name Bob Strauss from the LA Daily News and never listen to his reviews. I bet he is would say cotton candy is scary too. What a joke. There was nothing scary about this movie at all. Horror? No freakin way.<br /><br />Seriously, I don't know it got as high of a rating number as it does on here. Cannibal Holocaust has a better rating than this movie.<br /><br />The Last Winter ranks up as one of the most horrible movies I've seen...right under Next with Nicolas Cage. I'd rather watch reruns of Mork and Mindy. And I hate Robin Williams.
