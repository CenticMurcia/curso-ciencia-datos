I've seen Michael Shannon in too many movies to mention, but he may get his due this year with an Oscar nomination for Revolutionary Road. This indie, shot in the State I spent a lot of my growing up years in, is an excellent performance for him. Most of the others in this movie about family tension and revenge are new to acting.<br /><br />Wars between families and clans are nothing new. There are the famous Hatfields and McCoys, and I just watched L' HÃ©ritage (The Legacy) that had the same subject. Here, a daddy left three sons and went off to start a new family. They come together at the funeral, but the abandoned clan set off a feud when they dissed the old man.<br /><br />It was a slow movie, with a few fights, and it verged on exploding, but family wins out and bloodshed is minimal.
