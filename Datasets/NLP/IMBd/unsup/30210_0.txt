this movie is just some scene taped together with no story line (at least i could find it) the leading male with a monologue that made no sense how you looked at it the comedy in the movie was one clich√© after another stuff we seen over a million times like white guy teaching black history(SEEN IT IN 'HOW HIGH')not funny and what is with the badly dubbed music scenes this a perfect example of go home and do it over also why is the leading male living in a crack house if hes loaded its a low budget movie there's no lieing in that but that doesn't mean that the movie it selve needs to be crap everything is cheap in this move including the script
