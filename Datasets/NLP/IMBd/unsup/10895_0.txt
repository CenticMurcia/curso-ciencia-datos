Anyone who has sat through the low budget adaptations of popular authors such as Dean Koontz, Stephen King or the cheap "near adaptation but not so close as to get sued" made for TV films will LOVE this. The series is set in a hospital which is built upon a gateway to hell, which Garth Marenghi's character opened once a short while ago with a friend with a dubious background. That's about it for the plot without spoiling it. It is such a good parody, so accurate that it has the author who has "written more books than he has read" appears as the main character, writing, producing, and also having his best producer friend appear as the hard nosed hospital director (with disastrous consequences). There is a parody of everything in this from Brian De Palma's "The Fury" (I haven't ever blown up but I think I have a good idea what it's like!!?) to Phantasm (Except the flying orb is replaced with a rabid stapler(I'm serious it works)). This will not appeal to the masses but will be a big hit with the people that make cult hits, hits. The creators ARE the target audience so they know exactly what you want. I haven't been this excited or entertaining since Evil Dead. I would give the filmmakers 10/10 for effort and 8/10 for the result. Well done Channel Four.
