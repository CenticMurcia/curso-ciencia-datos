I simply can't see why this film has scored such a high rating. I'm generally in agreement with a lot of people's opinions on films, so when I was recommended this as being a simply awesome film I had to watch it.<br /><br />What I experienced was film with a plot line so thin it was painful, characters with no real 'character' about them (which may well have been the point) and a bizarre use of flitting back and forth throughout the plot.<br /><br />I mean what is this film about? Retribution? Friendship? Perhaps, but it seemed to go on for a very long time with me wondering exactly if we were going to get to a point...<br /><br />All in all, worth a watch if you're someone who appreciates obscure films that seem to strain a non-existent theme. Hey, perhaps I missed the point but thats the beauty of opinion.
