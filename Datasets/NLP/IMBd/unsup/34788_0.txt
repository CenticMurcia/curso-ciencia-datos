The first entry in the endless series is surprisingly light on the smutty humour and harmless innuendo that later became the franchise's stock in trade. Future Doctor Who William Hartnell is the army sergeant on the verge of retirement who makes a wager that his platoon will come out on top when their training is complete. Predictably, the recruits are instead totally useless and shamble through their exercises, which makes the film a curious forerunner to the 'Police Academy' movies. The ever-annoying Bob Monkhouse aside, the cast are likable enough, in particular Kenneth Connor (always my favourite Carry On-er) as a hypochondriac chased by canteen lady Dora Bryan; and Charles Hawtrey, who has a whale of a time as usual. Unfortunately the movie is flat, pretty dull at times and not very funny. Which is a bit of a drawback.
