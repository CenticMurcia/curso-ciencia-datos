The Lost World 1925 is a great film.It's a classic. I'm 14 years old writing this review.Not much teenagers watch silent movies, but I do. I'm familiar with The Lost World 1960 and The Lost World 2001,both of which I enjoyed. I always wanted to see the first film version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic tale. This film has likable characters and of course, a likable storyline with a good dose of humour. The dinosaurs are good for their time. We see: Brontosaurus(or Apatosaurus as it is known now)Allosaurus,Triceratops,Tyrannosaurus Rex and more. Wallace Beery plays a good George Challenger,and all the other actors too. Accompaynying Challenger is, Paula White, John Roxton,Edward Malone and Sumerlee. The ending is also great.They bring a brontosaurus back to London and it runs amok, it also destroys Tower Bridge. This film is considered influential on films like "King Kong" and "Jurassic Park" both of which are brilliant. Although, this film has had so many versions.The one I bought runs for 63 minutes.I was hoping to get to one that runs for 93 minutes.My verdict of this film: 4 stars out of 5 stars, ****/*****
