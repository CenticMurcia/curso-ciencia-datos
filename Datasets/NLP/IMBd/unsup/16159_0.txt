Truly a horrible movie. Except for one thing: Donna D. looked incredible. I couldn't get enough of her and her three sizes too small t-shirts. With that said though, this was one lame horror movie with no substance, flair, or even good gore/special effects. Don't waste your time with this one. Unless of course you're a Donna fan..........
