I saw a screening of this movie in Tucson, Arizona, and have been watching Amazon to see when I would be able to buy it. Already reserved my copy! The subject matter (snuff films) is totally sick, but what better vehicle to launch a horror/suspense film. <br /><br />John Savage did a great job as the totally creep guy, especially in his first scene where he describes what he does, but I won't spoil you by saying more. Pinchot conveys how slimy he is so well that you want to shower after his scenes. For an independent film, the quality of the acting is a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />What I really liked is that Raine (director/co-writer) doesn't dumb it down, but he plays the story out, making the viewer figure out what's going on. The direction is downright creepy, and the shots and angles keep you on edge until the last minute. The idea of shooting a shot through another camera was brilliant, and made it even more unsettling. This is one of those movies where the second time through will be better than the first. <br /><br />Best part - the very last line is worth the wait!
