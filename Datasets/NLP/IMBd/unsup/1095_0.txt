This is a great movie. I used to watch it as a kid when I went to my grandparents house (i'm not that old, heh). Just a fast paced movie with action all the way through. If you've seen any Jackie Chan movie, you'll know that he likes to be funny even when he's performing the stylized fight scenes. The great thing about Chan, is that a) All his own stunts, and b) no wire fighting. Yep, this is the real stuff.<br /><br />This movie was filmed when practical CG was still a little sketchy. In the scenes with both Boomer and Ma, You can tell that there's only real Jackie. If you look hard enough, you can see the little fuzzies around the CG Chan.<br /><br />But yeah, this is like all of Chan's more recent films: A few good guys against an evil coorporation/gang. Nothing new here. Jackie Chan's just a fun guy!
