It really sheds some bright light on predators in the school system. Great Movie. I first watched this movie when I was like 12. I have always liked movies like this. Lifetime Movies are the best thing ever. The scene where Nicole and Gary are in the locker room I think is well done. You can really feel the emotion from the two actors. I wish this movie was played more often. Movies like this don't come around often. Nicole Tom gives a great performance, and GARY Cole does great also. Where has Nicole Tom been? I haven't seen her in ages. I also love her brother and Older sister(the young and the restless). I definitely recommend this movies to viewers of all ages. 10 stars
