OK, so he's not a perfect stranger by the end of the movie. We do learn just a little about him. But nonetheless, you feel more or less the way you would if protocol required that you attend the wake of someone you had not even a passing acquaintance with. Respectful in the face of Death, duly serious, yes, but also somewhat bored and hoping you can get away quickly.<br /><br />Still, the spectacle of a man so intent on suicide, and finding it surprisingly difficult, was rather interesting. I would not have regretted seeing this movie, were it not for the ending, which scotches everything, making you wonder why you've wasted your time.
