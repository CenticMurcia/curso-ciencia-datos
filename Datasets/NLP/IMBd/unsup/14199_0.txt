I'm sorry folks, but the premise of The Night of the Generals was way too hard for me to swallow. I would have hoped that Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif who were so good together in Lawrence of Arabia could have found a better joint project than this.<br /><br />In my former working days at New York State Crime Victims Board, I got to learn first hand about the importance the police attach to murdered prostitutes. I did a couple of claims involving the victims of serial killer Joel Rifkin who if you remember was the postal worker who targeted working girls. Death certificates had to be amended to declare some of these dead women homicide victims. You don't declare them homicide victims no one has to look into their deaths.<br /><br />That's how it is in peacetime America. I refuse to believe that in Nazi Germany at war, a Wehrmacht major like Omar Sharif, attached to their equivalent of the Judge Advocate's Office spends four years of World War II, trying to tie General Peter O'Toole to the murder of a prostitute. Having a taste for sadism and homicide didn't exactly disqualify you for a lot of work in Nazi Germany. I'm not sure what Sharif was trying to prove and I can't believe his superiors didn't give him other cases.<br /><br />Sharif's hunt for O'Toole is worked into the story of the bomb plot to kill Hitler after the Normandy invasion. A whole lot of other players like Joanna Pettet, Coral Browne, Donald Pleasance and Tom Courtenay are along for the ride here.<br /><br />Better they all missed this particular bus.
