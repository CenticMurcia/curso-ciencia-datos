This has to be one of the all time best crazy fun movies that I have ever seen. The cast is excellent and the quality of the props and scenery are also excellent to watch. I don't speak Spanish and therefore the sub-titles are great. I saw this show on local TV and am now going to purchase a DVD copy as its an excellent library addition. I missed the first 10 minutes of the show and I am eager to watch the entire movie and I am sure there are so many bits that I missed whilst watching it on TV, watching this show over and over will be a treat. I hope you enjoy it as well and it brings a smile to your face and makes your day happy. I'm my opinion its a pity that all the Hollywood hype means that a lot of sub-standard USA shows make it to the big time in the box office. This Mortadelo movie proves the world is a bigger and better place than just Hollywood. Thanks. Bill.
