Macbeth, the comedy is exactly what the Shakespearean community needs , a little mickey take that doesn't take itself so god damn seriously... it was great to see Allison and the cast stir up the Holy of holies... Well done, I laughed a lot and didn't miss the original script one bit.... bassyb, new york
