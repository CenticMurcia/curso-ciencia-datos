It's the only word i can use to describe this movie. Although I have seen this movie hundreds of times, I can not get past Andrew Knott's performance. I must admit being young the first time i saw the movie i had a huge crush on Dicken! I was just WAITING for him and mary to fall in love! I am always disappointed at the end! Anyways, I just think that Andrew Knott's performance was outstanding, he did a great job in Black Beauty as well and I am surprised that he has not been extremely successful. I have it a 10!
