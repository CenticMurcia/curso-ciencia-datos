"The I Inside" is an excellent psychological thriller which will linger with you days after you see it. Simon (Ryan Phillippe) wakes up in a hospital with no memory of how he got there and no memory of the last two years of his life. Early on he meets Claire, whom he doesn't remember and Anna, a wife he doesn't know he had. Simon is also not aware his brother Peter is dead. The last thing Simon remembers is that he went to see his brother in 2000 and that he had an auto accident that evening.<br /><br />Thus begins a tale of past and present as Simon relives the experiences of 2000 and 2002, discovering along the way he can change change past and present.<br /><br />Some have compared this to "Memento," but the story is really closer in spirit to an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode, titled "Shadow Play" and the play "Steambath," with touches of "Mulholland Drive" and "The Sixth Sense" though lacking the emotional wallop or terror of the others. Nonetheless, "The I Inside" is a great psychological suspense film and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />WARNING: SPOILERS<br /><br />Some seem confused about the nature of Mr. Travati, Simon's wisecracking hospital roommate" and the reason for the "2002". Simon saw "Mr. Travati" walking down the passageway of the hospital, hooked to an IV bottle, when he was brought after the car accident. Simon is DEAD, and his conscious integrated Travati, Anna and the emergency room doctors into his illusion, in order to give cohesiveness to the illusion that he was still alive and experiencing "time travel." The "2002" was actually 20:02, military time (8:02 PM), when the emergency room doctor called Simon's death.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />This movie was released directly to cable, where, fortunately, there should be a big audience for it. I predict "The I Inside" will become a cult film and is certainly worthy of a "9".
