This movie is brilliant.<br /><br />If you like thoughtfully paced humor in the vein of Bill Forsythe (Comfort and Joy) this movie is for you. Great cast, great screen play...and deft humor.<br /><br />It is the story of Renzo Parachi (Michael Riley), who leads a dull and quite life...and likes it that way. He works at the local brewery's bottling plant and plays goalie for the company hockey team. He also drives a cab at night, where he picks up a fare who will change his life - Robbie Coltrane as Alonzo Turner.<br /><br />Within minutes Alonzo has insinuated himself into Renzo's life...and suddenly this quiet, unassuming man discovers that everyone wants something from him. His boss at the factory will do anything to transform the hockey team into winners...the girl at the ice rink will do anything for his chastity...and Lonzo will stop at nothing to get what he wants.<br /><br />A move not to be missed. Unfortunately, and criminally, it is not available on DVD in the U.S. Yet Ishtar is. Go figure.
