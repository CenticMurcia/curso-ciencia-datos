"Twin Falls, Idaho" is a very well made film with unusual depth and complex emotional content. It is absolutely a must see for anyone wanting more than your usual Hollywood fodder and fluff. A different sort of Love Story and a gritty look at a uniquely off-center topic. <br /><br />The Characters are often somewhat surreal, but not to the point of being ridiculous or unbelievable, this said same surrealism serves to make the imagery and story all the more powerful. The Hopeful and "Best of Humanity" themes and messages underlying the main story are clear to anyone that watches this fine piece of work. <br /><br />Casting and Cinematography are exceptional. And the stand out performance without a doubt goes to the lovely Michele Hicks as Penny as well as fine performances by Mark and Michael Polish as the Twins. One of the Best Films I have seen in quite a long time.
