Prag is not only a good feature with a tense atmosphere between two people who are breaking up. It is also a very well shot production (by DoP JÃ¸rgen Johansson) who has exploited the Digital Intermediate post production route to the hilt but in a very subtle way. Almost every shot has been treated with advanced secondary color corrections and windows. Red's and blue's are emphasized while most of the images remain slightly desaturated. The shooting format is s35 (3-perf.) flat stretched to 2:35 scope for the cinema release. The television version is 1:78 (16:9) retaining full height aspect ration. Enjoy this production hopefully digitally projected or on HD DVD.
