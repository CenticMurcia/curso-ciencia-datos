I like to MST3K this movie. Drives my roomie crazy. She takes Lifetime movies seriously.<br /><br />Totally a guilty pleasure movie. Cheesy and funny. What makes it even better is imagining SD rehearsing her lines, actually taking the job seriously--"What's my motivation? What would Lorie do?" Wm. Devane is not my idea of a sexy sexy older man for a younger girl--Powers Boothe woulda been totally good in that role. Or Craig T. Nelson. Or Bruce Boxleitner. Or any other members of the Male Lead Pantheon of Planet Lifetime.<br /><br />The whole daughter thing near the end came out of nowhere. <br /><br />I've got way too much time on my hands.
