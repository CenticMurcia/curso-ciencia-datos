I agree with the other posters on this title, it is truly dreadful. The lesbian sex is not arousing and very dull. I'm not very sure what this film is about because there is not much of a continuous story. Robin Sydney is gorgeous and the only part that I enjoyed in the film. She is killed early on so we don't see much of her. Terrible settings and bad camera angles. I didn't care about any of the characters and the acting was horrendous. Everyone involved should best leave it off their resume and I am still angry for wasting the time and cash to see it. How this got a distribution is truly a shock. The poster is awesome but the movie isn't.
