This was an action-filled movie that my boys (ages 8 and 11) loved! They related well to the two boys in the movie. The boys were believable and authentic. They especially like that there was no "lovey-dovey stuff" in it. I was a little concerned with the occasional swearing and violence. But, it wasn't the young boys that swore, so that helped. It is far better than "Stand By Me" since the boys in this movie are better role-models. Yet, this movie still shows the themes of the struggles of growing up and making choices. Also, the adults in the movie (for the most part) are not shown as stupid or oblivious people. The best part is that the theme of loyalty and friendship comes through with "flying colors"!
