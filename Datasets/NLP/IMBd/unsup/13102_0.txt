I seen the mini series when aired on British TV and i enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />Sam Neill was brilliant as William Lowell Kane my mother would have to disagree as she liked Peter Strauss as Abel Rosnovski as she had a soft spot for him as an actor.<br /><br />I have now bought volume 1 & 2 on VHS.<br /><br />But i can not find the volume 3on VHS any where if anyone knows where i can obtain it i would love to hear from you.<br /><br />I would also like to find the 3 volumes on DVD also.<br /><br />As the videos are for my mum who also loved the mini series.<br /><br />And watch it once again.
