Like all the haters, I to thought Flash Gordon was pretty bad in the beginning. The "Hawkmen" episode just about lost me, but I have a high tolerance for cheese.<br /><br />Then something unexpected happened--the show got better! The writers figured out who the characters were and came up with some plot lines that are actually interesting. Now the characters are fun to watch and I am genuinely interested in how the story progresses. They've struck the right balance between humor, camp, and drama as to be reminiscent of earlier seasons of SG-1. Flash Gordon has moved from a show I watched because nothing else was on to a show I look forward to every week. What a difference a few episodes can make (specifically the "Til Death" episode).<br /><br />If you haven't seen it since the first few episodes, take a look at it now. I hope this one gets a second season.
