You might expect a made-for-TV remake of a 1950's exploitation flick to be a camp spoof but instead it turns out to be a rather enjoyable, if simplistic, prison movie.<br /><br />The tone is little uneven, with some of the older actors playing up the melodrama while the younger cast members take it all seriously, but the result is an enjoyable genre romp. Pre-Friends Matt LeBlanc plays the bad-boy teen Vince who leads innocent schoolgirl Donna (Aimee Graham) astray and gives an insight to how his career might have developed if he hadn't been forever entwined with the character of Joey. The most surprising aspect is the tender lesbian love scene between Donna and Carmen (Teresa DiSpina). Fairly explicit and very erotic it is the outstanding scene in the film and totally unexpected in a US TV drama.<br /><br />It's is true to say to say that the story is fairly shallow and trite but this is pulp fiction not Shakespeare and the film is never less than entertaining. This review is based on the version aired on UK television with a running time of around 6 minutes less than the 85 minutes shown at IMDb.
