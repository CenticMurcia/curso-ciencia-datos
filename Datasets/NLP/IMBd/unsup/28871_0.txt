I bought this film on DVD in a local secondhand DVD shop,ours being region 2,i was surprised that you can not get this on region 1 area or region 0 which a lot of modern dvds are now,i suppose if you really look around you will find them.I thought the film was very good for 1954,the photography was good,the horse riding scenes on the cliffs were exciting,and the music was good,it was subtle and gradually built up to a climax,but never became to intense,the film was quite atmospheric almost as if you were with them,the directing was clever.the characters were interesting,five very different types of people all brought together.However i think i am the only female so far to wright a comment on this film ,and my point of view may differ.What i see is that the female character is acting in a very paranoid and agitated way ,and is trying to distance her self from them,which is how you would react if you were a woman travelling with four men you don't know,to her the enemies may not just be the Indian's in the mountains.The scene in where she is riding her horse and she looks round because she can hear Hooker and Friske laughing,believing it must be about her, says it all.I mean ,every time she makes a move to go anywhere one of them follows her,i don't think it has occurred to them that she may just want to go to the toilet,the only ulterior motive i can see her having is get me out of this uncomfortable situation,thats why she wanted to stay behind and stoke the fire,she was probably thinking give me some space.A good intriguing film any way.
