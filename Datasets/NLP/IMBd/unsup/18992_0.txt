I've seen a lot of documentary films on the pageant industry, but i found "Five Days To Fame" to be really entertaining and you really got a sense of the drama that happened during the competition. I certainly didn't expect that it would be this good! I thought the direction, filming, editing and music were outstanding. One of things that I liked about the way this was done, was how you really got a chance to see how the judging was done. It certainly was an eye opening insight into the judging, because I came away with sense that these judges were certainly not qualified to be in that position. It was a great insight in to the behind the scenes of the pageant. I highly recommend this film, especially if you're a fan of beauty pageants.
