A decent film powered along by an astonishing performance by Robert Duvall. Other than him though it's frankly a little dull with only the scenery adding any comfort. Duvall stars as a wayward preacher who, after one too many run-ins with his ex-wife and her new lover, finds himself on the run and wanted for murder. He ends up in a tiny village in the middle of nowhere and begins to rebuild his life knowing full well that the Police will close in on him eventually. You feel very much for Duvall because you can see the power and belief of his character and the self-destructive streak that results. It's also probably the best religious film ever made due to it's generally pro-Christianity atmosphere but also it's unwillingness to shirk from the fact that we are all, at the end of the day, merely human. This balanced perspective allows it to not be to depressing or to sugar-coated. Still, it drags a little in places and the lack of any real supporting characters puts too much emphasis on Duvall. He's great don't get me wrong, but a little more exploration of those around him wouldn't have gone amiss.
