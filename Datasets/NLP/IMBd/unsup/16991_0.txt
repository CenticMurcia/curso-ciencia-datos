Broken Arrow is one of those stupid action movies, which do not respect the spectators' IQ.The directing was awful and the script completely unintelligent with some huge mistakes. The only thing that makes the film worthwhile to be seen is John Travolta's great acting. The music also (composed by Hans Zimmer) is very good.
