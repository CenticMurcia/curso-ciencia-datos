"House of 1000 Corpses" by Rob Zombie is a great horror/comedy film, thought so the day I saw it in the movie theater. Please don't argue the moot point that it's a remake of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and therefore unoriginal... us horror aficionados realize it's a homage to cheesy 70s horror films and borrows heavily from many horror/slasher films from the past 30 years. It's still damn good and fine piece of film-making. To leave the audience with such a lasting impression of your main character that they remember your villain after the movie ends is a great feat... to make such an impression that the audience breathes life into that character every Halloween and costumed convention is amazing. Zombie did the latter with EVERY character in "House" which is almost unheard of... just say the names and you can picture the face: Otis, Baby, Captain Spaulding, Tiny, Mother Firefly, Dr. Satan, Grandpa, RJ... even Goober ("that's G. Ober"). Not as technically good as "Devil's Rejects" but truly a horror classic. If you think otherwise and want to discuss it with me, buy me a drink and get ready for the long haul.
