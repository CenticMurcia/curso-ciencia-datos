Really really bad movie .... I'll restrict my comments to two areas...... the movie begins with the death of a 20 year old girl, fiance of Joe (Jake G), and the daughter of Ben (Justin Hoffman) and Jo Jo (Susan Sarandon) (line from the movie.... Jo Jo says to Joe "Isn't it the t*ts that we have the same name."), and ..... and they act as if they've just returned from the supermarket .... and this persists for as long as I was able to take the movie .... "ok, our daughter is gone, so, uh, what's on TV tonite?".......The other thing in Jake G ..... this guy has one expression, and it's like "Where are my shoes?" .... regardless of the situation he looks lost and confused... either he really is an idiot or he simply cannot act, take your pick. I had to bail after about 30 minutes, this thing is a terrible assault on ones sensibilities.
