I will make this brief. <br /><br />This is a decent movie. Is it completely groundbreaking? No. Will you enjoy it? <br /><br />I DID.<br /><br />There are ton of people on here talking about how it doesn't make sense, theorizing about the ending...comparing it to Butterfly Effect/The Jacket/... yadda yadda.<br /><br />If you have half a brain in your head, you will at least think this movie is worth watching. The end is NOT hard to figure out. There really AREN'T any massive plot holes. Its just a good psychological thriller... with a hint of sci-fi/horror. The acting is 85% good. <br /><br />This movie will not change your life. But. If you are like me and you have seen almost everything else the world of cinema has to offer.... this movie really isn't as bad as a lot of what is out there.<br /><br />Oh. P.S. The fact that every time a movie like this comes out... people compare it to THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT... makes me want to vomit. <br /><br />Butterfly Effect = 2 stars. The I Inside = 7 stars.
