I don't have enough words to say how terrible and how boring this slasher movie is. The movie try to get back to Christmas horror that have been made before with more taste, like Black Christmas. A sorority house where girls that looks more like thirty years old prostitutes than college coeds have organized a party for Christmas is invaded by a crazy killer masked like Santa Claus. After the worst series of murders in a slasher movie and after dialogues and love scenes that are really bad, the movie ends with a "surprise" ending that is too silly to be credible. Avoid like the plague<br /><br />
