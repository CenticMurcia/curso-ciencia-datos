Like the Valentine's Day this episode is charming fun. You can't beat a cool Vince Guaraldi soundtrack, wry Charles Schulz humor and the earnest kid's voice actors not to mention some great catch the Beethoven references. This will not disappoint and has much to offer on so many levels. I have not seen it in years, but it cracks me up as much now as it did then. It even has some commentary on modern commercialism which is always heartening. While not as classic as the Christmas and Haloween episodes, it is up there with some of the best, certainly better than the ones which post-dated Vince Guaraldi death. Keep it on the shelf and bring it out in the spring. It will be a tradition you will be proud of!
