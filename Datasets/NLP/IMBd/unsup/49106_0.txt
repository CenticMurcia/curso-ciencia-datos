I, like several others, was inspired to write my first review because of this film's blatant failure to deliver.<br /><br />Having been treacherously lured into watching this film by some of my "friends" with the premise of its potent quality, I was genuinely shocked at how disappointing and frankly boring it was.<br /><br />Let us clarify something. What constitutes a "good" or "bad" movie is quite relative. However, *all* good movies share basic elements that provide the foundation for making them good. Superior movies introduce these elements with such dynamic tension and intensity that it truly sets them apart from inferior movies. For example, some of these elements can be "conflict" or "character progression" or even "resolution of said conflict through a character's progression" (the possibilities are endless!) This movie was lacking these elements. The plot is so terribly vacant that there is simply no conflict. Nearly all the events are unjustified or left unexplained.<br /><br />What begins as a somewhat interesting premise turns flat and dull early on. The big "shock" being that the two conflicted sides of Good and Evil are not so different is quite clich√© and ordinary by today's standards. Decent movies that have touched on this idea at least possessed the ability to convey that message indirectly with added tension and development of suspense, where as this movie has its characters simply blurting out this intended message because the incoherent plot fails to do so.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the large scale conflicts are not felt. There is no clear dispute between good and evil. There are no more than four or five characters for each Dark or Light whom have absolutely no character development or substance and constantly give the impression of always being replaceable. The "big" apocalyptic event is simply solved by a 29 Year old virgin saying, "I did it." Ummm...WHAT?!?!? It doesn't make sense. It really doesn't.<br /><br />There are so many smaller plot holes that are never answered its ridiculous. At the end of this movie I find myself asking, "What was the point?"
