I genuinely enjoyed this movie. A previous comment said something to the effect of an observation that cliches riddle certain parts, but I think it's important to note that this was written in the 1920s, when perhaps those cliches were not quite so pervasive. And the ending isn't nearly as cliche as I would expect from that era.<br /><br />Samuel L Jackson delivers a worthy performance as Jack, adding his signature personality to the role while still maintaining the spirit of the character.<br /><br />Milla is good looking as usual, and like all her other movies, gets naked for a minute. Her performance is decent.<br /><br />I'd give this movie a 7 out of 10<br /><br />WARNING, SPOILER FOLLOWS.<br /><br />what REALLY sells me on this movie is the direction it takes. I think you sort of have to put yourself into the 1920s mindset that women are women, and the real character to watch is the hero. IF you do that, then Erin is what a woman was classically considered to be; dependant, in search of a man, hedging her bets to be with the man most apt to provide for her.<br /><br />Then the story is really about Jack and the decisions he has to make; conflict between his desire for Erin and his honorable, uncompromising personality. Whereas most western movies have the hero triumph over evil, giving him the kingdom and the girl in the process as a reward, here there is a twist; the hero defeats the villain, but chooses not to take the kingdom OR the girl, choosing instead to maintain his honor.<br /><br />In this regard, the story mimics many classic works of samurai fiction, for example, where the hero denies his own desires in the name of a personal moral code. Also, what is not cliche is the movie's acknowledgement that the real world rarely rewards good character, and the path of virtue and honor is usually a lonely one. The ending is surprising, sad, and lonely, yet somehow gratifying and assuring.
