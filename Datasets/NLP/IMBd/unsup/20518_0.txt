I gave it a 10 because so many people gave it 1. <br /><br />I just don't believe it. Come on, if it's not a remake of a French movie, people won't be so picky. Or maybe they just hate their favorite being remade? I got the opposite view, if one movie is good, I'd like to see it again with a total different direct and casts. <br /><br />Girls (except the lead character) are hot, though they could be hotter to get it a R rate. <br /><br />Car chases are decent. The airport race in the beginning and the beemers got Trapped on a bridge under construction in the end are fair acknowledgements to the 1998 movie.<br /><br />Jimmy Fallon is seldom seen on big screen, but in this movie he's just hilarious. I'd like to see him in more comedies.
