Jakob the Liar is not a great film, but it is worth watching. The only bad thing about it is the fact that it's too sad. Although the movie has some light parts in it, it's not light enough to replace all the killings and the executions in the movie. Robin Williams gives a great performance and so does every single actor in the movie. I've just watched the movie and didn't see one actor that wasn't acting good. Hannah Taylor Gordon also gives a great performance and I think she will become a great actress. If you haven't seen Jakob the Liar, you should, although it is very sad.
