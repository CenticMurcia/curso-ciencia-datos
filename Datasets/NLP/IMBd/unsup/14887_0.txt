The idea for this movie was inspired. As a Democrat, I am a engaged in global humanitarian issues. While I can relate to the movie's premise, the implementation fell WELL short of anything close to being a good movie.<br /><br />The plot included every lame cinematic device to hook the emotions of the audience. In doing so, it was pandering and insulting. It tried at points to be a Dr. Zhivago epic, but only showed to expose the failure of the director and the actors to achieve anything close to an epic story.<br /><br />My heart is with the intent of the movie, but it falls so incredibly short that the result is merely a B-movie propaganda piece.
