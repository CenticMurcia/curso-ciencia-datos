Some of it's a bit hokey, but if you're a Star Trek The Next Generation fan, or any of the newer Star Trek variations, you'll enjoy this.<br /><br />It's worth the price of admission. I don't want to say anything about it so I don't spoil it for anyone. But, don't miss it if you're out there. It's fun and as realistic as they can make it.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect. And I think that's the best way for people to enjoy it the most. Simply walk into it. See all the planning and behind the scenes stuff for all the Star Trek generations. Then, just plan on enjoying the "experience".
