When I entered this one, I thought it would be another Kate Hudson/Matthew McConaughey, Richard Gere/Julia Roberts,Diane Lane, wuvvy-duvvey-cutesy-wootsy boring predictable love movie.<br /><br />I was completely wrong. We've all seen movies that involve time travel and this one is near the top.<br /><br />It shows the reality of a relationship between two individuals who have to deal with the negative effects of time travel in a close relationship.<br /><br />This movie had me near tears at the end, which is truly sad since I haven't cried since the movie Beaches.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that I found myself trying to figure out this mans time travel and if it made sense. There are a few loose ends left untied.<br /><br />Other than that, the two leads were solid and the movie is entertaining. I wouldn't rush out to see it, but it is definitely worth renting.
