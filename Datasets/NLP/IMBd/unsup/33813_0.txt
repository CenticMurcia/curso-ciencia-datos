The same title explains it: "No debes estar aqui"-"You must not be here". Obviously, the director is trying to advice us, because the film is so bad that when I went out from the theatre I thought: "I shouldn't have come". The film is supposed to be an Internet-basis thriller, but it does not have suspense, horror or anything interesting.
