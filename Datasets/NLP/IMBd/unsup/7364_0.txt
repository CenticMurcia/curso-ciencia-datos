I really thought this movie was great. I took my grandparents to it as it was released to the cinemas. I am not sure if it has been released publicly or just because it was filmed where I presently live. It cracks me up that with all the phenomenal scenery - it was attributed to Arizona. (It was actually filmed in Southern Utah(Hurricane) - I went to the school they attended - its been torn down since) I was fascinated by the fact I had never HEARD of this movie.It was outstanding. Action packed - thrilling - touching - and yet realistic. It was awesome to see the reaction of children in the theater as well - they seem to feel along with the boys! THis was perfect for all ages - young to old - and impressive from start to finish. This may have been one of the best movies I have seen all year!
