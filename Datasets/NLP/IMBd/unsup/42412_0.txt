One thing I remember when home video rental took off was people would hire films they`d never heard of , the only way you`d get an idea of what the film was like was reading the blurb on the back which often wouldn`t do justice as to how bad the film was , and let me say no blurb could ever do justice as to how awful THE MAD FOXES is. The plot outline on the back gave the impression that it`s an action thriller but doesn`t state it`s badly dubbed by people who are half asleep , or that the evil bikers are a bunch of 40 something overweight men most of whom seem to have a problem riding a motorcycle , or the fact that THE MAD FOXES doesn`t really have a plot . Worst of all the blurb doesn`t point out most of the running time is taken up with hardcore explicit sex scenes !!!!!!! The video company who released this might have mentioned how much rumpo there was going to be in this movie as either a selling point or as a warning that it`s not exactly a family film . Not only did I have the misfortune of watching this I had the misfortune of watching it with my parents and my dad had the sense of turning it off just as another sex scene was about to raise its head , namely the scene in the woods where the hero shoots at concorde and his girlfriend decides to undo his trousers , so I never found out how the film ended . I have to admit though I am curious as to how the film ended . Did the bikers turn up to fight the hero or did the film end on a massive sex session ?
