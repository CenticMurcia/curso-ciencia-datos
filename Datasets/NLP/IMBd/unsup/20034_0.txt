The episode concentrates mostly on Cartman and Butters, and how Cartman's scheming mind and tendency to over-think things creates his own downfall. At the same time Butters' confusion and inability to understand people brings about a wonderfully innocent resolution to his situation Â— contrasted with Cartman's 'somewhat controversial' eventual humiliation.<br /><br />The storyline promotes tolerance of homosexuality and ridicules the religious right's idea of 'conversion camps' ("A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are put together; that sounds like a good idea.") Cartman's continued intolerance of Jews and homosexuality, and his strange fascination for art photography with Butters in degrading situations, gives him something of the air of a deranged Nazi, who is finally reduced to running crying to his mother. There is also a rather nice scene where the police officer patiently tries to take Cartman seriously, as Cartman reports the loss of the photograph of himself in a compromising situation and expects the police to help.<br /><br />The penultimate scene, where Bradley is contemplating suicide and Butters saves him with a speech promoting tolerance, despite not really understanding what is going on, is one of the finest scenes in the show's history. A cynical show would have had Bradley die as a cheap joke, but when it becomes clear he will be all right it feels genuinely touching and far more rewarding. This is followed by the camp leader declaring ridiculously that "By the power of Christ we have saved this child." Sheer genius.
