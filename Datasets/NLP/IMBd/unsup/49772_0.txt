5 star is good for it really it didn't seem like it wood be even a worth watch but it is. this was categorized as a scary movie..........to a 10 yr old he may pee his pants but i don't think it should for the later,this i would say because the ghosts in the movie(a Totally GRUDGE MOVIE RIP-OFF)are shown a lot of times in daytime.......that totally ruins it.....we can clearly see the white powder on the ghosts..............and lot of the movie is 'The Shining' 's RIP-Off.........i don't remember whats scenes are but some like when the kid rides the3 wheeler bicycle and the camera follows him like the same way in the shining......and the background music too was playing same.....DAMN!!!!,i would also say that the story is bit like the the shining.i didn't like the ending and the twist ain't that good too if u see the movie then i am sure ur gonna realize the fault that the director made (u will have to pay attention to know more faults .....there are a lot of faults) .....the ghosts die becoz the tree burns down becoz they wre living there but at the final shot they show that kid has become a ghost........how the hell did he get away ????i mean he should have died too after the tree burn down .it could have been better too bad it had to end like this......................The Whole movie could have been a better . but ill still rate it a worth watching film for its effort.........u don't get to see that lot scary movies in bollywood ,u get movies with stupid fake stunts with no good plot.
