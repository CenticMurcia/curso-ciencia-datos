I checked out the DVD at my library because I liked Benji, but I hated this film. The background noise is way louder than it should have been. The background noise was so loud that it was louder than the people talking. A lot of the movie is people talking in Greek without any subtitles. The characters were so boring and the background noise so loud that I didn't understand the plot. I don't know what the point of the tattoo on Benji's paw is and I don't know who the British man and woman are. The plot was boring also. Most of what I saw was Benji exploring the city, stealing food, and getting to know a dog. This is the only dog movie that I have seen that I don't like.
