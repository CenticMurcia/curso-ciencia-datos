In yet another Seduction Cinema soft-core parody, Dildo Baggins (Misty Mundae, because she can NEVER not be in a Seduction Cinema movie *rolls eyes*) along with fellow Throbbit lesbian lovers, Horny and Spam go off to destroy the evil G-string, after drunk perverted Smirnof, the Wizard presents that quest to them. Wackiness, in the form of dumb jokes, unerotic sex, and more dumb puns, ensues. Terry West will never be confused with Orsen Wells, hell, he'll never get confused with Lloyd Kaufman even, but this "Lord of the Rings" parody is still his clear best, and yes I know that's a bit of a back-handed compliment. I chuckled a few times, but groaned more and not in the good way.<br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: almost hour long documentary; 37 minute Behind the scenes featurette; a lame music video; and the usual Seduction Cinema trailers <br /><br />Eye Candy: everyone gets fully nude multiple times<br /><br />Easter Eggs: highlight the tree for more behind the scenes footage; highlight the head for an interview with John Link
