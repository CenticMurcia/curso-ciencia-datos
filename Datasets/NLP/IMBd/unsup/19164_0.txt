Everyone should definitely watch this movie. It changed my life. It's a constant reminder to "make your life extraordinary," because often, we all get caught up in the daily routine of life and what "we're supposed to be doing" and we forget to live life to its fullest.<br /><br />This movie will make your inner-child come out. I would especially recommend it if you are into romanticism and authors such as Thoreau. The poetry exposed in Dead Poets Society is some of the greatest in history, so if you're a literature geek, you should also watch this movie. <br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 20.
