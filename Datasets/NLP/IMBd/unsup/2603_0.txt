OK, I'm an avid DVD watcher like probably so many of you all out there, 3 nights ago I was watching Tommy Boy, a marvelous piece of comedy film, that's both full of laughs and full of heart. After watching it I jumped on IMDb to get some info and ideas for my next movie. Looking through Chris Farley movie's I came across Almost Heroes, have seen most of Farley's (all the pre Happy Gilmore films with Sandler and Spade) I thought why not, and directed by Chris Guest, I love his mockumentary's like Spinal Tap and Mighty Wind I really thought it would be a combo that couldn't let me down. Yet sitting through this film really surprised me how you can have so many greats working on such a dull film. Perry is just shocking, and I don't know about you but is permanently type cast in my eye as Chandler from friends. I don't like him, I wont ever like him. But yet he isn't something to fear away from the movie because of. No he's just the icing on the cake to a pretty shonky movie all round. The script was dull, the jokes were slow, there was no real solid comedy timing used. Most of all I'm just shocked and amazed that Guest would allow something just so flat get made. I mean Farley is his usual standard, hes as good as the actors around him. You cant help that. But Guest has written some real clever comedy over the years. Some that has made me laugh so hard that I've had to pull my self back onto the chair and go, "Hey, Wha Happened?" The jokes used in this film must of been his leftovers. Its the only logical reason. The last Farley film, probably the one he could of done without.
