This is my favorite of John Wayne's b/w movies. The movie is based on a little-known fact: that the town of Demopolis, Alabama was founded by former officers and enlisted men of the Napoleonic French army, and their families. And, the Duke plays John Breen; a member of the Second Kentucky Regiment, just returning from a campaign against pro-British Creek Indians, during the War of 1812.<br /><br />His outfit has marched to the port city of Mobile, to see if they can get a steamboat ride home. But, evidently, they didn't have enough money for the snobbish taste of Blake Randolph (the local shipping magnate). So, they have to resume traveling home on foot. A fact that the regiment keeps reminding the viewer of, via "...that g.d. song" (as my father so hilariously called it)!<br /><br />Enter Fleurette De Marchand (Vera Ralston); the bored debutante daughter of Gen. De Marchand. She lets Breen steal her fiancé's carriage, just to perk up a dull afternoon. And, Breen--who doesn't want to wait until he's discharged in Kentucky, to make a fresh start--now has another reason to stay in Alabama. *Wink-wink! Nudge-nudge!*<br /><br />But, as fate would have it, Fleurette's fiancé IS Blake Randolph! And, what's worse: he's in cahoots with George Hayden, the crooked boss of the riverboat men. *Think "union racketeer." * <br /><br />Their scheme is to let the French develop the wrong land, then steal it out from under them. But, Breen--with the help of Willie Paine (Oliver Hardy, who's surprisingly good without Stan Laurel)--ultimately thwarts the scheme. And, following a great military showdown, wins the girl, as well. <br /><br />In short, this is a great blend of romance, action, and comedy. And, just remember: "Only 600 miles more to go(More to go!). Only 600 miles more to go(MORE TO GO!). "
