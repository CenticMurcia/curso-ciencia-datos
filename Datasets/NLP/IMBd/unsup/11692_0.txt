Amazing film. I guess we all know that our way of life is based on energy and that energy in large part comes from oil. (A *very* large part) I'm not much for writing reviews, and I'm not very good at it, but what an amazing documentary.<br /><br />No sledgehammer over the head, just experts in the oil industry and other fields, talking about the upcoming oil 'peak'.<br /><br />I think we all know how dependent we are on oil, but it takes something like this film to hammer the point home.<br /><br />Anyhow, enough blather from me, rent, buy or view this film. It is *very* important that people understand this issue.<br /><br />(I listed this comment as 'may contain spoilers' for those that think there is no oil crunch coming)
