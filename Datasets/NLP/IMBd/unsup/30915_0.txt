Spoiler Alert<br /><br />I personally quite enjoyed the movie as it does change direction half way through the movie and keeps the audience guessing , whether this was intentional is open to debate. Certainly the reviewers here who believed they knew the ending after 10 mins, I think are conning themselves , they probably saw the trailer or heard it on the grapevine as clearly up to half way through the movie the audience is led to believe that Cage's character is clearly there to stop the disasters from happening or at least try to save some lives , the end of the world does not come into it at all.<br /><br />The biggest problem that I had with the movie is that it simply leaves too many questions unanswered as to the point of various story lines within the movie and this is shown by the various different interpretations by other reviews.<br /><br />I shall ignore the various "believability" of certain actions in the overall storyline as this is a sci fi movie so you will get loads of them e.g. cage just happens to spill his drink and highlight 9/11 but concentrate on the ones that need an explanation:- 1. What was'Lucinda role in this? Apart from the production of the numbers. She could hear the Angels so why was she not picked by the Angels to leave the planet? Why commit suicide, why did she live in the exact place the aliens were picking up the children, why did she never try to warn people of the disasters like Cage character did? 2. What was the role of the stones? They were clearly given to all the children that were to be rescued but what were there purpose? My guess is they were tracking devices , used by the aliens to track the children they wanted but we never find out or were they directional finders for the other children to know where to go? or where all the children kidnapped to get them to the correct location , if so what is the point of the numbers at all? 3. The numbers on the paper that Cage's character used to eventually work out where to go to save his son, was this their primary purpose or was it a fluke that he had the paper and his son just happened to be "chosen" at the same time.<br /><br />4. When Rose died , Cage's character tried to explain to his son at the end that she had died , his son simply stated that she would be OK , how would she be OK , she was dead and why have the stone in her hand when she died , what was its significance? <br /><br />Anyway any answers to these questions would be most welcome.
