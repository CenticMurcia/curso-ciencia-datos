Fred Durst from some music group called 'Limp Bizkit' directed this & it is his first effort. For a first timer he did a first class job.<br /><br />Peter Eckoff wrote this screenplay about some college students in the 1970's at Brown Univ. in Rhode Island. The screenplay is quite intelligent & not the usual college days & nights stuff we usually see.<br /><br />However I felt that the ending was a letdown & to me it hurt MY overall enjoyment of this very well acted & made drama. There are many comic moments BUT this is primarily a drama.<br /><br />Jesse Eisenburg is Charlie & he is just first rate. Jason Ritter who has usually done lighter roles is just magnificent as a confused non conformist & bully. Chris Marquette is there buddy & has most of the funny lines.<br /><br />This is one trio I would like to see again.<br /><br />Eva Amurri is also first rate as a love interest.the entire cast are all first rate.<br /><br />This is another low budget film that only had a very short USA run in March 2009. & released to DVD 3 months later.<br /><br />This is a darn good film,I just did not care for the ending. See it, you may or may not agree with me on the ending, BUT I feel you all will like it. It also is a wee bit overlong.<br /><br />Ratings: *** (out of 4) 84 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 100)
