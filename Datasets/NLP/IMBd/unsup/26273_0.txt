Low-budget, unknown movie with very bad actors. It looks like Scream without suspense, blood and scenario. Josie Bissett's boy could play in a Fisher Price commercial, Josie Bissett could play in Baywatch or Melrose Place(she does), her lover could not play in anything and her lover's wife could play in a South Park realistic movie(she could play Kenny). The story(if I can use this word to describe the scenario) is the following: A man cheats his wife with their son's babysitter. Then, the man learns that the babysitter is pregnant and his wife secretly learns it too. One night, the man and his wife are gone to a party and the babysitter is attacked by two criminals paid by his wife to kill the babysitter. Guess what happens....yes you got it...the babysitter kills the criminals and the man discovers that his wife paid the criminals...woooooo!!!!! Deja-vu all over again? yes, that's right. I give it 1out of 5.
