I rented this movie last night expecting a typical kung-fu film. I was happy to find it was much more of a character drama. The kung-fu action I was expecting was short but, straight to point, it left you wanting more, you could tell Jason Yee knew what he was doing as I found out later in the DVD extras he is a real kung-fu champion. The film has this cool 70's style vibe which made me feel like I was watching an old school classic. In one fight scene there is an excellent homage to the legendary Bruce Lee. Jason Yee really captured the dragon's fire in that scene. In the DVD extras is the making of 'Dark Assassin' which was cool to find out this film was made for $80,000. Wow! It made me respect the film much more as I expect all action films to cost millions of dollars. Jason Yee could be the next action star he really has what it takes. I can't wait to see his next film.
