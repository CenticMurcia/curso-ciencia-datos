I give this movie a 4 for its sheer awfulness. I must preface my "review" by way of noting that I have only seen this movie once (at about age 8, with my parents, at the drive-in). For this memory alone I give the movie an extra point or two. I remember the plot and I remember the secretary mentioned in the previous commentary. I also remember, even as a young child, thinking the plot was really stupid. By no means would anyone consider this a really good movie but it is a really fun movie -- even if it wasn't intended to be funny. No spoilers here as one may consider the whole movie already spoiled. I believe this was on triple bill where diner customers were fed humans as specials of the day based upon the victim's last name (a woman named "Poultry" served up as breast of chicken). Does anyone remember the name of this winner?
