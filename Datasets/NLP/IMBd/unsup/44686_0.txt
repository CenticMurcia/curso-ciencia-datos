The film's opening number "I'm Taking a Shine to You" poses the question - why didn't Ann Miller become a bigger star - she had the looks, personality and the talent. This number is a great introduction to her.Unfortunately, there was no more dancing for Ann until her dazzling tap solo for the "Speak Your Heart" finale.<br /><br />The story is extremely corny. Jack Oakie plays Harry Miller, a talentless songwriter and a pretty unlikable character. Bob Burns is a hillbilly who composes popular songs in his sleep. Unbeknown to him Miller and his off sider (Milton Berle) copy them down and then pass them off as Miller originals. Bob Burns, of course is amazed - wishing he could write songs like that.<br /><br />He falls in love with Ann Miller (who looks young enough to be his daughter) but when she becomes engaged to Kenny Baker, he develops insomnia. So comes the very boring, unfunny part of the film when Milton Berle and Jack Oakie try, by different means to get him to sleep. There was just too much unfunny clowning by Berle.<br /><br />Hermes Pan (obviously between Astaire and Rogers films) made Miller shine - she obviously had the talent from the start of her career and just refined it as she became more of a professional.<br /><br />Jane Froman was also definitely a highlight for me as well. "Speak Your Heart" was a beautiful production number with Jane's soaring vocals and Millers dazzling tap solo. I can only recommend the film for those two performers who rise above the trite storyline with great performances.
