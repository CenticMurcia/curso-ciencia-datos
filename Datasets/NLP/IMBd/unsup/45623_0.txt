So much for this being the thriller to watch if you don't like thrillers. I like all kinds of movies except one: long boring ones. And one of my favourite films is The English Patient! That's how boring this film is. Even Clive Owen thinks it's boring that's why he could hardly be bothered to act during the whole thing. Except when he got so frustrated he just acted angry. Save yourself two looooong hours of trying to stay awake and watch something else. I assure you you won't even care what the 'bad guys' are conspiring to do! I'll concede that the ending was a little exciting but after waiting an hour and a half for it, it just didn't seem worth it. I wish I had spent my evening re-watching the terminator movies and picking plot holes in Terminator Salvation like I had planned.
