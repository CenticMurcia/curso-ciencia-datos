Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness didn't shine in this film, but Sean Connery did. His depiction of Malone, a tough Irish cop, is right on the money. This is the story of Eliot Ness and his small band of men against Alphonse Capone and his empire. The film depicts the "Feds" in some of their raids on Capone's empire. Some of them weren't successful and Ness and crew were the subjects of much ridicule in the press. This is no spoiler, but eventually they got Capone on a tax evasion charge. There is plenty of violence if you like that sort of thing. The film is told almost totally from the law's side, but, in the end, that was the only side that mattered. Robert De Niro shows how great an actor he is and is downright scary as Capone! Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia also star. I don't know how factual this film is, but I truly enjoyed it.
