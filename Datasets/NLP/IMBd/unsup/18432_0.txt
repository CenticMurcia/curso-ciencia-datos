Alex Kingston IS Moll Flanders. Please, forget the cotton-candy version that has Morgan Freeman in the cast (though, I _adore_ Stockard Channing). This is the real thing! We get to see the real, harsh struggles of Moll in this adaptation, and how out of the muck and grime Moll finds herself. There is no happy ending here, you can bet that, but at least you get a real story that is more appropriate to the times. That is worth much more to me than a smiling happy face, in the end. This is a real, gritty film - not cheap. Highly recommended.
