This is a terrible movie. It was a waste of time. I forced myself to watch the whole thing hoping it would get better. It got worse. Don't waste your time. The other reviewers who claim this is a "masterpiece," are art-house critic wannabees who know nothing about film. They have no knowledge about film, but think anything that looks "artsy" must be a classic. There's a difference between those of us who watch "Eraserhead," and those of us who understand "Eraserhead." Those of us who view "Momento," and understand how complex the film is, and watch it again and again. Each viewing of the film brings a new revelation and understanding of the film. If you get this statement, you'll hate this movie.
