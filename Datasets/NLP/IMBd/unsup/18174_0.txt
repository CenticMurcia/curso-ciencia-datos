I have always loved the theme and title sequence to this film. The film itself is only okay at best. The late sixties, early seventies style, lighting and some scenes are descent along the way, but the overall film just doesn't involve the viewer. However, this movie has a great little gem at the beginning with its animated title sequence and theme, which is so different and eerie, yet rockin' at the same time. I used to just rewind the tape and watch the title sequence because it really is interesting and moving. I wish the good parts of the actual film could be put with some scenes and sequences that are as moving and intriguing as the title sequence - then they would have a really memorable film! Instead, there are too many parts that are just bizarre and irritating. I get what they were going for, but some of the sequences were just too prolonged and not connected enough. <br /><br />I did however like much of the lighting in this as it is interesting, hues of purple and blue illuminating back rooms and entering windows. The bizarre color schemes of the creature that appear as attacks of flapping wings are strange, but somewhat effective if only there were more to those shots.
