It seems that all I see are horror movies lately and well . . . I saw a trailer for Shrooms months ago and had decided there and then that I would see it and it would be awesome! Oh how I was wrong! With such a wonderful premise I just can't explain what happened?! Well I can try. The cast did what they could making some slightly interesting, if annoyingly cliché-ridden, characters! However, there were a few very attractive actresses that helped to draw that attention away . . . for a brief second.<br /><br />To be honest I could go on and pick at this film and break the maximum word limit on this because I was so disappointed in the overall quality of horror films and how Shrooms had the potential to break the trend of bog standard cliché ridden horror flicks but no! <br /><br />What's good? One star for each good thing. 1) The cast do the best giving some good performances 2) The talking cow, that's all I'm going to say 3) This is only worth watching if you want a pointless jump fest! <br /><br />What's bad? Follows the typical killing off one person at a time (boring!). After the first few initial jumpy moments, it's really slow and then to top it all off it has the worst ending ever. You just feel cheated as if they ran out of time and thought this will do! This film encourages drugs in a way for all the wrong reasons. In which I would rather get high on mushrooms or whatever, then endure this again! If you want a superior horror film watch 30 Days of Night!
