I had some fun times with this film, even though it does not come close to any of the great werewolf pictures. The films strongest points are its gore and the werewolf suit. The kill scenes are gloriously splattery at times and the werewolf looks very cool for a low budget production. I was dubious of the idea of having it talk, but on the other hand hearing a werewolf rattle off cheesy lines and genuinely enjoy getting up to some carnage if fairly novel. No tortured heroics here, this werewolf is just a mean SOB. Richard Tyson plays the role with gusto and it works well albeit in a cheesy way. The film does try to have a bit more of a plot than just a standard teens trapped by a monster opus and it kinda comes off although it makes the film uneven in tone. There is the odd plot hole in there to chuckle at too. Acting wise, the film is OK. The main character and his girl both do pretty well and it is interesting to see a film with such a weak male lead, whose female pal is considerably tougher than he is. Nice traditional role reversal going on there. Sadly, the girl in it is closer to Bree from Neighbours during her goth phase than a convincing looking tough girl but I'll let that slide because it made me laugh. The teenagers at the beginning are appallingly obnoxious and disposable, but happily they are disposed of. The adults mostly do quite well and there is a brief appearance from David Naughton for horror buffs to chuckle at. The films flaws come chiefly from the tone, which varies between gruesome and joyously politically incorrect and a cheesy almost Scooby Doo or Famous Five vibe when the two leads are investigating the werewolf. Also, the ending could have been somewhat better, though it is still perfectly reasonable. All in all, this is a good weekend booze/popcorn film for undemanding werewolf movie fans, with some fine moments and an overall feeling of fun. Good times.
