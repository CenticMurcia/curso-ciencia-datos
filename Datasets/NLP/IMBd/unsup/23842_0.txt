As a Dutchman it is hard to judge the historical content of the film. What I've seen was very interesting. Considering the fact it is made after a true story it makes it even more special. The film covers many aspects of life in Brazil in the thirties. Although it is often shown in broad lines it's convinces me. It made me think of the class struggle in my own country. In Dutch you say: als je voor een dubbeltje geboren bent wordt je nooit een kwartje (when you are born as a nickel you'll never become a quarter. In a way it is an optimistic movie. Despite of all the setbacks and jail sentences, the main character does not get broken. Madame Satá becomes a real success winning several prices in carnival parades and other events. I truly admire the actors, especially Lázaro Ramos who plays stunning. The camera-work is great. The special effects are modest and well done. The music in the film is beautiful. I really enjoyed this movie. This movie deserves a wide audience.
