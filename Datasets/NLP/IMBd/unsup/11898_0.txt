This movie is truly funny, why does everybody compare the original to the remake? If you want a true comparison the the original was bland, this piece is something else I watched it when it first came out on video and I was with my family and friends , we all laughed and enjoyed it. If you can't see humor in this then you my friend need to lighten up, sure this won't appeal everyone comedy has changed the past decade if a comedy doesn't have any controversial meaning or non stop sex, fart jokes then its not funny but to everyone who can take a joke its a must buy or at least a rental.<br /><br />I recommended this movie to my friends and family and they all enjoyed it, maybe we're from another planet?
