The cover exclaimed "A Clockwork Orange for the 90's". I wish. I wish it was banned like Clockwork (Note: Clockword Orange was banned on video in Australia for quite some time because Kubrick received death threats if he released it on video) Anyway back to the dreadful film. This would have to be the most pathetic excuse of a film that I have ever laid my eyes on. It is sick, depressing, incoherent, and just plain old insultinig on anyone who sees it. Saying that, I urge you to see it, not because it's so bad it's funny, I wish it was like that, but it's so bad that it's woeful. I can't even explain the story.
