This is an objectionable film. Not because its shocking, or depicts anything that hasn't been seen before. But because it believes its saying something important. I keep reading that this film makes us think, makes us examine our own reactions / feelings about watching violence. That simply won't do. Post-Iraq any of us can download real life executions in the space of a few minutes - all of which would incalculably exceed the horror depicted here. Some of us do - usually to profoundly regret it. The premise of this film, or at least of the protagonist / anti-hero of this piece seems wrong. I really doubt people who rent horror movies secretly want to see real life murder; or that if they were to happen upon a film like this they would share any moral culpability for watching what was playing right in front of their noses. Then there's the notion that this rather unlikely not to mention very middle class serial killer thinks that what he is doing is art. Again, I don't object to the idea - I'm really looking forward to reading the Art of Murder by Somoza as soon as I can get hold of it - but this just doesn't make the grade. Besides all serial killers are arse-holes. None of them have anything to say and neither do films about them.
