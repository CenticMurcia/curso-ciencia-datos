Not worthy of any more than one star didn't like it never will and I can't see why anyone would enjoy this movie. anyone out there who hasn't seen it i recommend you do that way if you ever see another bad movie you can say "hey at least it wasn't as bad as the fair haired child" It's worse than that movie Darkness I saw with that girl who played rogue from x-men god that movie was almost as bad as this one. I'm hungry I think I'm gonna make a pizza. Shoot all out OK well Grilled cheese should do me. Ow silly me I'm still typing. Well ya so I spoke my mind and it's up to you the people if you want to listen to my negative criticism. Go on now.
