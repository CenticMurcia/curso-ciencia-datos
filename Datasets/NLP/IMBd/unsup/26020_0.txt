An alright sequel that really stands on its own. This sequel makes little a note to the first one, remember the one with Kevin Bacon. But other then that this movie stands on its own. This movie begins with a crazed invisible man named Michael Griffin(Christian Slater), who is on the war path to get an antidote for him. He will stop at nothing, and kill anyone that gets in his way. His trails lead up to Dr. Maggie Dalton(Laura Reagen), she soon seeks protection with Detective Frank Turner(Peter Facinelli). But a certain government starts to hunt them both, cause they want to cover up what has happened to Griffin. Christian Slater was awesome in his performance has the mad invisible man. Peter Facinelli and Laura Reagen were also good. This movie had a great storyline, and great effects, and not to mention great suspense also.
