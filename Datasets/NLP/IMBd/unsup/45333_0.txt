It is called zombie diaries but actually has no ZOMBIES in it. Hardly a recipe for success. More like disaster. This could have been good. The marketing for this film was copied from Blair Witch Project : Make a cheap badly directed badly acted film and then get a few spin doctors to go on the net to start word of mouth. Set up a zombie walk that co incides with the movie, pay an artist a lot of money to design good looking poster art and talk talk talk it up on the net.<br /><br />The problem with this is that the filmmakers failed the most simple test of the word of mouth method. It actually has to be a good movie to begin with for it to work. You cannot make a success out of over hyped sizzle and a poorly cooked underdone steak.<br /><br />Do Not Waste Your Money !
