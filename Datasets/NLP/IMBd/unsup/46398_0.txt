Well, the story is the typical: the kid that lives miserable, with few friends and tries to do something to be a hero, the day he is able, finds that no one will believe him. The plot is easy to follow, as it is filmed for kids. The action is simple and the characters are totally topical. Most of the jokes are not very funny (but for kids) and the movie is short, in order to do not make them to make a great effort. Despite that, it is not too childish and most adults will be able to watch it without become very bored, as it is a little interesting but, finally, it is a movie for kids and adults will not be very pleased, as happens with other films as Shrek or Ice Age.
