First of all, I do not understand why not a Hungarian girl was playing the role of Lora. It is really disturbing that she is translated back to Hungarian.<br /><br />Furthermore the movie is full of dull stereotypes, cheap jokes. Nice looking artistic girl after three years still suffering from the dead of his over-self-confident boyfriend, who was cheating on her with her best friend. The younger brother brings back her to life.<br /><br />There is everything in it you need to call a movie liberal lesbian, gay club, rabbi, catholic priest quite few blind person.<br /><br />It was a complete waste of time to watch.
