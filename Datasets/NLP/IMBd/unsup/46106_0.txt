I've seldom seen anything as ill-directed and ill-writ as this veritable swarm of locusts. The script serves as an age-biased loaf of stale bitterness regarding ageism, to which any dodgy Benny Hill-script seems vital and fresh; the characters are archetypical in the worst sense of the word, the story never brings anything interesting or lucid to the screen, and there are more chances of you being hit by lightning while reading this than there are comedic lines found in this vapid, turgid and fake implausibility; collect a billion monkeys, tie them to typewriters and I shall pay you 1000 US Dollars if even one of them should come up with anything less comprehensible. Even the soundtrack is horrid. All in all, a waste of time that should serve to never let Colin Nutley direct again; sadly, he does just that over and over.
