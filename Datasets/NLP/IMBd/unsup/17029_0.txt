This movie came out in Belgium in 2003 but I waited to see this wonderful movie until now. The story is simple but the movie is great. Benoît Poelvoorde is playing Bernard, a bank clerk of the greatest dullness. A job he had to take 'cause his wife couldn't stand living with a dual-personality (or as she's called NO personality). So he promises her never to do the man again. His great obsession is the french star Claude François. Bernard is the perfect double of the star, no, resurrection is the better word. When there is a competition 5 years after the Promise, there's a competition for doubles on television and the best claude françois wins 100000 euro (125000 dollar) Bernard wants to compete and starts his old routine but he thinks he IS the star and starts acting on it. The actors are one for one top quality but the star is indeed Benoît Poelvoorde from my beloved country. His splendor, to be able to show a character that you can hate and love at the same time, is remarkable. I really can recommend this one Some pointers for the people oversees (United states): If you don't know claude françois it's easier to look at the movie like Claude = Elvis. Then it's easier to understand the hype If you look carefully: you can notice the original french version of 'my way' by Frank Sinatra or in this case 'comme d'habitude'
