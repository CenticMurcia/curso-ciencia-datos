I first saw this movie when I was 13 and thought it was the most suspenseful, exciting movie I had ever seen.<br /><br />I'm watching it now on AMCTV and am thinking, god, how could any adult have made this or believe it.<br /><br />For example, one of the searchers, says, "It's 70 below down there." OK, if it's 70 below why are these guys hanging around OUTSIDE the plane, shivering while wrapped in one thin blanket, with a fire consisting of two tiny sticks that wouldn't warm an insect. If I was out there at 70 below (which is ridiculous in the first place), I would have a forest fire going.<br /><br />This movie is so overly dramatic it is just not believable on any level. I don't generally care for remakes, but maybe this is a good candidate. Maybe not -- the crash site is probably a strip mall today.<br /><br />Another childhood memory shattered.
