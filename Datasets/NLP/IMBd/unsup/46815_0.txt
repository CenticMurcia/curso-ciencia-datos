I saw a comment on this movie that claims it is the one with the cameo appearance by TV's Scotty from Star Trek. This is incorrect. there were two Knight Rider Spin off movies in the 90s. Both were crappy. This one was made in 1994, knight rider 2010, without any people from the original TV show. It take place in a Mad Max style future where this guy either finds or builds a new kit. In many ways, a blatant and poor rip off of mad max... as the guy drives from place to place in this post apocalyptic future. The earlier one was knight rider 2000... from 1991... equally crappy, this one starred David Hasselhoff and yes... had a silly cameo appearance y James Doohan as himself. Avoid both.
