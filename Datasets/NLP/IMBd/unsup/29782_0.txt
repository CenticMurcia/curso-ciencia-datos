This movie suffers from terminal cuteness.. Even treating such a horrible subject, Gérard Jugnot does what he's been doing for over 20 years : playing and directing average french citizens facing not so ordinary situations(of unemployment in Une epoque formidable, of the sects in Fallait Pas, of being a father of a famous actress in Meilleur espoir Féminin...etc.,etc.). Treating in a comic way a serious subject.<br /><br />This flick is plain silly...a long road to clichéness with an ability to open doors that have already been opened 50 years ago. The germans are bad, sex-crazed people.Deportation is horrible. Every french citizen was pro-german during the war and pro-De Gaulle in 1945. Daaah? The best part is when he's taking the 3 jewish children nearby the swiss border. The french people living there are supposed to have a strong accent (as the kids). But all the adults don't. It is simply both stupid and hilarious (but unintentionally, of course).<br /><br />Because it wants to tell us about a tragic event and deliver a message of hope we're supposed to love the movie? Nah. It just falls flat on every level : ludicrous dialogues, comedy, drama, war, suspense (ooooohhhh, are the poor children going the get caught by the nasty nazi??? Nah.)...everything is over-demonstrative and SO predictable. This tearjerker is a huge success in France where most of the official critics just love that sense of cuteness. It is beyond redemption, really. This movie deserves a slap in the face to wake it up a bit...but no...terminal cuteness indeed.<br /><br />And not even an accurate use of the Scope A.R to higher the note a bit. Pfff.<br /><br />Superwonderscope says : 1
