There's a reason this has never been a hit in the UK - because most of us have a sense of humour more developed than that of a three year old.<br /><br />This is watched on new year's eve by many people in Germany - it's actually a tradition, and they seem to find it absolutely hilarious. I find this completely bizarre, as this is repetitious pap on a par with the Teletubbies. <br /><br />I could barely watch it past the three-minute mark, and didn't laugh once during the entire sketch, so heavens knows how anyone can watch this rubbish every year.<br /><br />It's popularity is utterly, utterly bewildering to me - avoid.
