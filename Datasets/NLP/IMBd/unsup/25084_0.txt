I truly enjoyed this movie. It came and went in the theaters very quickly, much to my disappointment.<br /><br />Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey are excellent as a mismatched pair. They do a superior job convincing us of their relationship -- in my opinion as good as any Tracy/Hepburn team-up.<br /><br />The premise is slightly unbelievable, but if you suspend your disbelief you will really enjoy a fine romance/western/fantasy/adventure.<br /><br />The only knock I have is the excessive use of profanity for no reason.
