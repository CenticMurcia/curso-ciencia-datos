Just saw the entire Species collection over two days, and i was very disappointed over the fourth in the line.<br /><br />After watching the first 15 minutes i sat the player to double time, and i sure didn't regret it. This movie doesn't have anything to offer, beside nude chicks and brainless "horror". Compared to the three other species movies, this is fare worst. If you have seen the movie "From Dusk Till Dawn" you sure don't need to see this one.<br /><br />Lets all hope the line will end here.<br /><br />blah. blah.<br /><br />blah.
