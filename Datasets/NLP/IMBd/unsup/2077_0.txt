I remember seeing this film as a child and getting my mum to tape it so that I could watch it over and over again. I didn't even realise it was Swedish so know it as Peter-No-Tail.<br /><br />It's the story of a cat born without a tail who tries to fit in but gets bullied by the other cats. Things just don't seem to go quite right for him, getting caught in a house fire and being pushed over in a running race. It's actually quite sad and you feel sorry for Peter-No-Tail but it is an excellent film and well worth a watch if you ever get the opportunity to see it. Hopefully it will be released in English someday.
