Well, if your lucky in your life you get to see things that would change your life, Ghandi. Paul Berry covered in jam , hell even Jesus squatting over a candle. However Nothing and i mean NOTHING prepares you for Dream House,<br /><br />The film teases, tickles, licks, makes love to you and then tells you it meant nothing. I watched this film with baited breath, small hotdog in one hand, elton johns masterpiece in the other. And i was blown away but enough about my sex life. The film starts with a man on the edge he is dirty, raw, naked without having to take his clothes off. He builds this house see, a Dream House if you will. The plot basically tells the epic tale of a house falling in love with a man. Not only is this a beautiful story it always breaks down the walls of racism and war. If a man can make love to a brick house why do we have to fight eh. Why?<br /><br />The acting is top class, at one point i stopped the tape and wept, i wept for a long time actually. I pressed play and realised why i was weeping. There not just acting, there living, i read about how the actors got into the characters head by living in the dream house for 9 years prior to filming.<br /><br />There is a lovely moment when the main guy who if he doesn't not land the role of Superman will be a revolt. Anyway he has a go at the house its all done to camera just him an a cup of method acting. I felt his pain i wanted to hold him in my arms and tell him its alright, but i couldn't. This film made me want to hold a man in my arms. Powerful.<br /><br />The diamond in the rough is the real star, voiced by the late Carrey Grant the house comes alive thanks to its above its time special effects and camera tricks that Lord of the rings would kill to know about. <br /><br />Watch this film, live this film, then make love to a man with a beard and scream. Yes don't regret living when you wont even give it a chance.<br /><br />DREAM HOUSE NO<br /><br />DREAM FILM<br /><br />Thank you
