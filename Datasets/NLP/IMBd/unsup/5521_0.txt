I do not understand why this zany, crazy French farce has received such a low rating. I can only assume the viewers do not know what a farce comedy should be like & also the fact that France invented farce comedy hundreds of years ago.<br /><br />One more thing the writers & director gave us 2 years prior,. The magnificent Jean Reno farce ---- THE VISITORS.( about a knight from centuries ago brought back to the 21 st century.)_<br /><br />My Wife Maurice takes place in todays modern Paris. This movie has all the elements of what a farce comedy should be.<br /><br />Mistaken Identities, Unfaithful married & Unmarried people,insane, silly situations., good looking sets & most of all actors who have perfect timing. Also lots of non-raunchy sexual situations.<br /><br />I laughed all the way throughout this comic romp.<br /><br />one minor point,, It would have been even funnier is just a wee bit shorter. The best farces should run only about 90 minutes,<br /><br />Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 92 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10).
