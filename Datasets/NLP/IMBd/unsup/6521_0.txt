It's the worst movie I've ever seen!!! What a stupid and sexist story! I mean, men can xxx with whom and whenever they like, and women doing the same have to be killed??? Oh please...grow up!!!!!!!!! What about the male in that story, who's in bed with the girl who betrays the twin-brother: he excuses him with the words: "well, you're a man, it's not you're fault! She offered herself to you!" WELL SIMBHU, IT'S NOT YOU'RE FAULT! YOU SURE HAD A STUPID EDUCATION!!!!!!!!! Next time, just keep the crazy thoughts in you're brain, don't let it come out in form of such awful movies!!! Or just open your eyes and see the world as it is: men are xxx as well.
