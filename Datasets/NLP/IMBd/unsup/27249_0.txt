This film has a sort of disclaimer at the beginning that says something along the lines of "some may find this offensive". And sure, this is in bad taste, it's sort of a comedy/parody of a Columbine-type incident. Probably what's the most offensive though is the poor production values and the possibly even poorer acting. Of course, the folks that gave us movies like "Airplane" would most likely not touch subject matter like THIS with a 50-foot pole, so we're stuck with Smack & Hellfire (the names of the film makers). We have Carbine High School, and all the fine stereotypes that go there; the jocks, the greasers, the religious nuts, the Goths, the whitey-hating Afro-American, and then the two that don't fit in anywhere, the ones in the black trench coats. Of course you know who they are. There are some mildly amusing bits, like these two ordering a nuclear warhead off the internet using one's drunken mom's credit card, and having it arrive in a big box with NO packing material....! Also a scene where the two misfits go to get guns and there's sort of a musical interlude where topless (but masked) models display the wares, but that's about it really, as far as the parts that were genuinely amusing, because the direction of the film is so inept that most other attempts at humor are pretty low grade, juvenile stuff. With a decent budget and some competent film makers, this might have been at least watchable but as it is, it's borderline excruciating. 4 out of 10.
