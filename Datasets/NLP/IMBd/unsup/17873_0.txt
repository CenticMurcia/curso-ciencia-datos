****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />I just love movies with twists and turns and this one didn't disappoint. A group of people are stranded at a motel by a torrential rainstorm and are soon getting knocked off one by one. Who's the killer???? Just watch for yourself.<br /><br />What a cast! Ray Liotta! John Cusack! John C. McGinley! Rebecca "Where Have I Been?" DeMornay! My one grumble with the cast is the criminal misuse of the wonderfully freaky Jake Busey. Why go through all the trouble to cast someone like him and then only show him for 5 whole minutes!!!! Jeez.....
