First off, I don't want anyone who reads this to think I'm some kind of sonic hater. I have been a sonic fan ever since the old genesis games and I am still a sonic fan.<br /><br />A little over a year ago, I hear that there is a show based on Sonic the hedgehog. Knuckles coming into the show along with other characters seemed very exciting to me. I was thrilled to hear about this. I watched the show from week for a week for a couple of months. I was initially disappointed, but I was hoping that it would get better. It never did.<br /><br />For starters, Sonic and the gang are not supposed to be from another planet that got stranded on Earth. This was never discussed in any previous shows or games. Why is this suddenly a fact? I have always been a Tails fan and I was disgusted to see what his role was in Sonic X. He normally just does nothing except for occasional mechanics. He doesn't even fly or hang around Sonic like he has done everywhere else. He had no purpose. Before this show, he was seen as the cute one. That's no longer true because of Cream. I believe that the only reason he even had a part in this show was because in a Sonic show, you pretty much have to include Tails.<br /><br />Anyways, the story lines made no sense. Such story lines as that race-car driver who always wants to race sonic were simply pointless. Dr.Eggman could have had a good role as the villain, but the writers managed to screw that up as well. I remember one episode he had a chance to kill Tails. He said something similar to "Don't kill him. If you kill him I won't have anything to do." What kind of sense does that make? I've also seen the final story of SA2 repeated into the show, proving how lacking of stories these writers have.<br /><br />I have always loved everything Sonic-related, but I am absolutely disgusted with this lousy excuse for a show. AOSTH might not have been the best show in the world to watch, but at least it was funny. Sonic X was neither funny or exciting.<br /><br />My advice is to avoid this show like the plague. It's a disgrace to the Sonic series.
