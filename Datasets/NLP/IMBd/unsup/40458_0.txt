I didn't understand this movie. Too many cuts in the cinematography made it difficult to watch and comprehend. It does have a nightmarish quality to, although I feel that the fright factor could have have been better. More attention should have been paid to the more important characters instead of dwelling on the minor ones. Better dialogue would have improved this movie tenfold.
