Prince of Darkness is a bad movie from John Carpenter.the whole thing is ridiculous.take the premise,for example.A priest has discovered a long hidden canister containing the liquid form of Satan himself,or rather his son.said canister had been hidden deep within the basement of an ancient church.upon discovering it,said priest decides to call upon physics Prof and students to investigate it.soon,the liquid ends up in most of the students(don't ask) turning then into mindless drones whose only purpose is to aid the son(said liquid)into freeing daddy aka Satan.Anyway,the whole thing is ludicrous even for sci-fi/fantasy/horror.there just isn't any point.Carpenter really misses the mark here.With all due respect to the late,great Donald Pleasence,what was he thinking?the only redeeming feature of this movie is that it is (marginally)less awful than "Slither" and "Lawnmower Man 2".
