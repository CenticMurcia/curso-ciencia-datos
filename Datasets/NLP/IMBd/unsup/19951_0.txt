There is a lot of walking in this movie, that's for sure. But it isn't a thriller, it isn't an action movie - it's a boring piece of work. At time it is hard to understand what's going on. Not that the story is complex - there hardly is a story - but it is hard to understand because it's directed very, very poorly and at an infuriating pace that seems to be wrong for every scene. I felt really disappointed after watching this one. I can't believe they make this kind of crap. The only good thing is that the always enchanting Monica Bellucci once again shows her two best, breathtaking assets. Cassel on the other hand is not that charismatic. But he gets by better than in his awful role as Blueberry. If you like Cassel and Bellucci, you will be better off if you watch Irreversible.
