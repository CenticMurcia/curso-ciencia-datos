It's a dark, stormy and foggy night when a ship transporting prisoners sinks. The survivors (doctors, officers, boat crew and jailbirds) crawl to the shore of a desolate island, find refuge inside a large lighthouse and have to fight off one of the escapees, who happens to be a psychotic killer. He burns up a rescue boat and the communication equipment and stalks the characters with a machete.<br /><br />High-pedigree slasherama from England has the novely of above-average production values and acting and some well-done suspense scenes to go along with some pretty grisly slayings (neck slashings and decapitations being the killer's forte). They just forgot much of a plot, the b/w flashbacks linking the killer to one of the characters doesn't work (what a coincidence!) and it's all so dark, miserable and rainy the whole time. A few good set pieces, but a sense of humor and better-developed characters would have helped.<br /><br />Score: 4 out of 10
