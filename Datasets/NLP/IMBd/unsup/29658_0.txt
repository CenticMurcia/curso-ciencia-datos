Well, with no expectations at all, this movie is surprisingly lovable and touching.<br /><br />Bernie successfully portrays a typical father who overreacts to his daughter's personal life and creates disruptive situations between her and her other half. Ashton's acting is brilliant too, not too much, and acts out the embarrassing emotions well when he went into a black family.<br /><br />What made me sweating in my eyeballs (believe it or not!) is when such a traditional person realizes his fault and admits them to his wife and Ashton. Sure the interracial stuff has added more fun and contradictions to the plot.<br /><br />Meet the parents are good, but sure this movie gives you more. 8.5/10.
