This is one to avoid.The premise sounds interesting and as a film it owes much of its plot theme to David Finchers infinitely superior Se7en.Its an uncomfortable film to watch for all the wrong reasons.The characters are badly realised and the cop on the trail has to be the worst cop ever for the some of the situations he gets himself into.This is a film that will appeal to people when they read the back of the DVD in the rental store but upon putting the disc in your machine you'll realise why you hadn't heard of it before you came across it in the store.Its,save the odd moment,pretty rubbish stuff really and deserves its place in the bargain bin.Watch it you must be don't say i didn't warn you.4/10
