I watched this on TV at Christmas time and really enjoyed it. It's good family entertainment, thought the sword fights were great.<br /><br />Really liked Susie Amy as Valentine, think she was good for the role, and Marcus Jean Pirae was good as well as Villeroi.<br /><br />It wasn't brilliantly written, it was a bit 'storytelling' but the cast was great - Gerard Depardiu didn't do very much though - it seemed as though he was drunk from time to time! <br /><br />The villages and the sets were beautiful and really perfect for the period. It was great to see Michael York back as D'Artagnan!<br /><br />I would recommend this for adults and children, it's an adventure...
