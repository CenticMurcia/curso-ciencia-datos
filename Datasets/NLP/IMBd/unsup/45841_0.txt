Missing in Action (1984) was the first in the Col. Braddock series. Shot in the Phillipines (yes, with Filipinos playing Vietnamese). This Cannon Films Production launched the "bring back the P.o.w.s" genre during the mid 80's. Chuck Norris plays Col. Braddock, an unconventional officer who'll do anything to "bring back the boys that were all but forgotten". Filled with mindless chop-socky and very uninspired action scenes, Missing in Action is a movie for die-hard Chuck Norris fans, lovers of Cannon Films or Grade Z action films. Watch Chuck break international law and defy the laws of logic and realism in Missing In Action!!!<br /><br />Terminally bad Chuck Norris film. But a masterpiece compared to it's nonsensical sequels. Chuck doesn't even dress or have the presence of an officer. I mean who would take this person seriously? Not recommended for viewing unless A.) You and your friends want to watch a bad movie or B.) You're too lazy to change the channel because you lost your remote. If I were you I would get up and change it manually.<br /><br />Not recommended.<br /><br />Filipinos don't even look like Vietnamese people.
