Hello James Lew fans all over the world. Being a huge fan of James myself, I enjoyed this movie tremendously. There is nothing typical about 18 Fingers of Death. It is a fine blend of martial arts and comedy all rolled up into one very funny story full of action. Mr. Lew plays Buford Lee, an unsuccessful actor who is trying to finally make it big with a top notch film but Buford runs into one obstacle after another keeping him from completing his movie. It takes a very special quality to be able to make people laugh, and James performance in this movie definitely shows us he has just that talent and skill. The script is great and the casting superb. There is a star-studded supporting cast with such favorites as Lorenzo Lamas, Pat Morita, Robin Shou and Don "The Dragon" Wilson. 18 Fingers of Death is a fun movie to watch and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.
