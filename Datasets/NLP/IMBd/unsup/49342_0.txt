I am giving the director the benefit of the doubt and assuming he was trying to make some sort of high-minded statement about sexuality, not just trying to revolt me. But the message is extremely muddled.<br /><br />In showing a ludicrous fetish nobody has ever displayed, maybe the film is trying to satirize sexual obsession. Or maybe it is some sort of commentary about pornography or relationships in modern society. Whatever the case, the point is very obscure.<br /><br />With the tone of ironic detachment, I felt I was being held at arm's length throughout the film and given no clue as to how I should feel about the characters. Am I supposed to sympathize with them, pity them? It's hard to do since they show about as much emotion as HAL in 2001. For people who are supposedly engulfed by sexual obsession, they sure are torpid.<br /><br />If I am going to watch extremely graphic sexual perversions, I would prefer them to be in a film that is a little more thoughtful and a lot less pretentious.
