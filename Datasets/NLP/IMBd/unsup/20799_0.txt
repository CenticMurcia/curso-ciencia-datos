How I remember my earliest memory of this from Christmastime of 1972. also how hysterically I was Laughing @ hearing Curly say "Gimme the Ax, the ax,the ax,right in the neck,the neck,the neck."Then seeing it again for the first time in years some time in 1986.This time that I'd first seen it it was also after school & when it was too snowy out to go to my C.C.D.Class.Curly's Skunkskin cap is another interesting & hysterical aspect to give good color to this picture. I was laughing other than this too when Curly had even said to Larry "This Fish looks like Moe." and then Curly said "It is Moe."You've just got to see the rest of it to understand & enjoy it for yourself also including when they're told by the Indians that they had until sundown to leave.They used the cabin for their scenery for "Uncle Tom's Cabin."The film concludes when they use a part of the stage's scenery for a sail @ the end when the girls are being chased by the Indians & have to hop onto the stage coach with the wind blowing the stagecoach away.Coitainly Stephen "Steve" G.
