Dimension have done it again..<br /><br />Epic Movie was epically terrible, Disaster Movie was a disaster, and Date Movie.. I won't even go there. But no film has soiled the once funny 'spoof' format as much as Extreme Movie has.<br /><br />I haven't enjoyed any of the films along this route apart from the original few Scary Movies. However, I was quite looking forward to watching this film, but now wish I hadn't bothered. Not once did Extreme Movie refer to a successful box office movie I have seen before, and I have seen a fair few 'teenage sex comedies'.<br /><br />I wish I could say one good thing about this film but I'm struggling to do so. With no real storyline at all, this film really is ridiculous.. and the ending proves that. Not once did it make me laugh, and not once did I think the film would get any better.<br /><br />The only reason I have given it a 2 is because of the one or two nudity scenes. Even those are pretty crap.
