The Addams Family came out in 91, and it was a huge hit. Then the sequel came out 2 years later in 93, also being a hit. Now number 3 is out, the Addams Family Reunion, a horrribly stupid bad acted(except for Tim Curry and Daryl Hannah) movie. The plot was stupid, the characters were ALL different. Now I know they had to get rid of the kids from the first two, because as you can see Wednesday who was played by Christina Ricci in the first two is now an adult, making movies like Sleeping Hollow. But they could of casted better Wednesdays and Pugsleys for the Reunion, I mean these kids could not act at all and everything thy did was stupid. Uncle Fester who in the first 2 was played by Christopher LLoyd(and brilliantly may I add), now they have some hyper active freak who goes around yelling and screaming like a two year old doing stupid pranks...It was then that it hit me, this new movie was not intended to be a sequel to the previous two. It was supposed to be a movie about the new Fox show "THE NEW ADDAMS FAMILY", and no way related to the old Addams family. This movie was a huge flop and dissapointment and no wonder they decided to put it on video. If they had released it in the theater it would of made absolutely nothing and they would've gone broke. 1/5 stars, it was horribly stupid, and I mean HORRIBLY stupid of a movie to make....
