I don't know why people complain about this film so much, it is easily as good as the other Phantasm Films.<br /><br />This film, as usual, contains brilliant acting from the four leads, especially Reggie Bannister(who is God in the horror film genre, with Bruce Campbell as Jesus), and Angus Scrimm's aging appearance just add to his performance, (let's face it he look old, which is cool for the evil bad guy). The action scenes are excellently staged and the make-up is the best ever.<br /><br />I find all the complaints about this film laughable and stupid.<br /><br />1. Not enough revealed about the Tall Man's origins, despite promises. What do you what? An autobiography, with detailed plans for his world domination (which part 5 promises if it's ever made). What is revealed is enough to show evil comes from good, perhaps a metaphor for the Tall Man's quest for Mike over the ears.<br /><br />2. Lack of action/gore. Rubbish!!!!!!!!! I'm going to sulk over this statement. Reggie (God) Bannnister is one mean Zombie-thing ass kicker. Reggie's entire journey to find Mike goes from one gun battle to another. And as for gore, there's more yellow custard flying around here than an Oscar losers after dinner party.<br /><br />3. Bad script/direction. What a load of sh#te. This is one of Coscarelli's funniest scripts, loaded with wit ('this won't hurt a bit...Well...maybe just a little bit.' person hearing this then screams, priceless). And as for direction we need look no further than scenes featuring the Almighty, sorry Mr Bannister, the Motel Room scene is excellent, especially the end:<br /><br />CREATURE:(ON THE FLOOR)Wait, we aren't finished yet! REG:(RAISING GUN)Sorry baby, but YES WE ARE! (GUN FLIES AT SCREEN AND BLACKOUT CRUNCHING NOISE)<br /><br />4. Finally the end. Another cliff hanger, noting is resolved, no clear winner (again) main characters face death, how will they get out of this? Wait ten years for another installment. What's the problem, this is the best way to end the series if part five never comes - Reg aimlessly fighting for his friend's life, Mike Helpless to prevent his fate and the Tall Man appearing to be the Evil victor, but we know the good guys will win, don't we? This is just the perfect ending as it embodies the entire themes and events of the series. And should it lead to a part five it is also a brilliant cliff hanger.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this film is perfect,the results of part 3's cliff hanger are disappointing, as are the ideas that Mike has about his 'abilities', but it is still a very enjoyable film. The desolated future scene is a Reg (God) send, apparently done without permission or blocking off the street, as are the flashbacks of unused part one scenes, the final one is very effectively haunting.<br /><br />Let's hope this leads to part five, if it's even half as good as this. I saw part three first in 1994/5 on Sky and at the end thought 'Our heroes can't be left like this, Mummy (I was 12) how will they escape?' she told me to wait and see. Six years later I finally know. As good as this, part five would be well worth the wait twice over.<br /><br />
