Yeah, so that was a lame above criticism, but it doesn't matter because this movie hits the pits pretty hard. I could honestly care less if it was low-budget or not and/or original. <br /><br />All I wanted was a decent Action flick and I was disappointed once again by Snipes's choices in film ( the last flick he was in was the DTV "The Marksman" ). He's never been that great throughout his career, but he has every once in awhile he's had a pretty, good leading/ supporting role and this was, unfortunately, one of his duds. <br /><br />Anyway, this movie started getting campy, then got corny, then hit the mediocre level to where it was boring and just too stupid for words. I then turned it off and have USA network to thank for letting me watch it free on cable so I can save my money.
