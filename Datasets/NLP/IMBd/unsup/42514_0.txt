I realize this show is a reality joke that is meant to be funny... however what bothers me is that Kenny cheats in every competition. While this makes for funny TV (sometimes) after 2 or 3 episodes it becomes completely expected by the viewer. So why does Spencer not realize Kenny is cheating in every competition? Honestly, if Kenny did not cheat I would be surprised. So how can all of the competitions be taken seriously? Kenny has staged each one to his advantage and it takes away from the funny random reality show it should be. It is almost a complete insult to viewers to expect us to think that Spencer does not expect Kenny to cheat every single episode.
