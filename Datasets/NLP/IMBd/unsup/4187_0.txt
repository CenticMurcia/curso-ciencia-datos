When Jess Franco adapts a De Sade story for the screen, he tends to put forth a good deal more effort than with the bulk of his other projects. JUSTINE, EUGENIE DE SADE, EUGENIE THE STORY OF HER JOURNEY INTO PERVERSION, EROTISMO and LILIAN are among his very best works, both aesthetically and dramatically. It would seem that his connection with De Sade's writings - particularly those that concern the corruption of innocence (which is to say the majority of De Sade's work) - speak to Franco in a profound way. THE SEXUAL STORY OF O, which is another loose adaptation of De Sade's "Philosophy In The Bedroom", is no exception. <br /><br />The film-making is first rate here. The widescreen camera-work is outstanding, complimented by beautiful looking people (except for the harrowing faces of the antagonists, whom you won't soon forget). The score is moody and affecting as well. I love the way his characters smoke cigarettes; they do it with a degree of style that makes it look appealing, and the way the serpentine smoke rises in symmetrical balance with the players' faces in the frame... amazing.<br /><br />Be warned, however: The pacing is uncommonly deliberate, the level of erotica (simulated this time) is very high and very potent, and the violence - which isn't paraded throughout the narrative - is jarring and disturbing.<br /><br />THE SEXUAL STORY OF O is, for my money, one of Franco's top 10 movies, and that's saying a lot since he made nearly 200 features. The title is obviously an attempt to cash in on the success of THE STORY OF O, but the film itself is nothing short of stunning. Frankly, it amazed me.
