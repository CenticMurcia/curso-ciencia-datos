When I heard the reviews and saw the trailers for this film I decided to skip the cinema and video showings and wait for it to hit TV. It was a wise decision because this is probably one of the worst comedies (and films) I have ever seen. I cannot honestly remember a single decent laugh from myself. I was happy enough with the Naked Gun films when they were first released. The series upon which they were based was hilarious at times. Even the recent Dracula spoof produced the occasional chuckle, but it seems to have gone all pear shaped for Leslie now. How about some original jokes for a change!<br /><br />It begs the question - is this what Americans find funny? Surely by reading the script potential backers would find out just how laughless it is.
