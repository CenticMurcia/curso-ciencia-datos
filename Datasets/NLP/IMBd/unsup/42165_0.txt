There probably was no way to do the multi-leveled story lines justice except maybe in a ten-hour miniseries, but even so, what can account for Mandy Patemkin's daughter never growing older even though he has made three successful films since the start of the movie? Ditto James Olsen's son - both kids stay the same age throughout the picture. What they probably should have done (I hate to remake things as I'm watching them) is told the whole thing through Brad Douriff's eyes. It would have given the audience someone and something to focus on. I did think Elizabeth McGovern was a good choice as Evelyn Nesbit (certainly much better than Joan Collins in the campy 1955 film THE GIRL IN THE RED VELVET SWING)and Harold Rollins was wonderful in a poorly-written part, but Debbie Allen was wasted along with I hate to say it James Cagney, who looked mummified.
