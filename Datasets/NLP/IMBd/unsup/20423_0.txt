I watched the first movie when it released in the cinemas, and although it was highly unrealistic (all the chances he miraculously gets), I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought the movie mixed the highs with the lows believably.<br /><br />There was decent acting, a good story, and as previously mentioned, although a bit far fetched, it made for good watching.<br /><br />However goal 2 had me bored far before the end. It was just the most ridiculous story I have ever seen. From terrible high speed car chases to plain boring sequences, the movie just seemed like an assortment of hundreds of genres, with minimal football.<br /><br />All in all I thought it had tremendous potential had it just stuck to a footballers troubles in his footballing world, rather than try to get stuck in a long boring drama.
