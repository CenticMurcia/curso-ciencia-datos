This movie was the most terrible thing I've seen in my entire life. But it made the funniest MST3K episode I've seen in a long time. However, if you are a big fan of mullets, pedafiles, sketchy old prospectors, hoaky action sequences, bad teeth, hicks, and annoying squirrely kids with high voices...then see this movie!
