One of the best strategy Rpg ever. Heroes of Might and Magic III : Restoration of Erathia its a true fantasy game with a great story, graphics and exceptional music. <br /><br />One of the most entertainment and addict games i ever played, i play Heroes III all over the years, and still hook me in front of a screen playing it for hours. Im suspicious, but in my opinion in many ways Heroes III its much better than Heroes IV.<br /><br />If you like Heroes of Might and Magic III : Restoration of Erathia, i also recommend: Heroes II; Heroes IV; Ages of Wonders ( in my opinion a Heroes of Might and Magic rip off, but still a good game)
