This garbage passes for art! Give me a break! Mickey Rourke plays a disgusting, low-life, club-fighter named Johnny Walker. Rourke's performance shows him spiting on the floor, spitting at people, and generally just waiting to spit. Aside from constant spiting, he blows his nose on the ring canvas and in the dressing room floor. He puts together 5 word phrases and generally struts around waiting to spit or blow his nose. The film has such garbage lines as , " Hey Johnny, you want an apple?" The film is slow moving, dull, and moves at a snail's pace. The fight scenes are overly long and basically show Rourke spiting, making faces, and blowing his nose. There is no romantic spark between Rourke and his love interest Debra Feur. The gist of their interactions is Feur asking Rourke, "Where did you come from?" Homeboy is pure junk. Catch Mickey in the Pope of Greenich Village or The Year of The Dragon.
