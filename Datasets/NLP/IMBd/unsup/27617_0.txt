See this film, and marvel at the comedic pairing of straight laced Gene Wilder, and frantic Richard Pryor. A more bizarre odd couple of comedy I don't think I've ever seen. The dead pan, stiff style of Wilder is dramatically improved when placed alongside the kinetic energy of the street wise, Afrocentric humor of Pryor. Now, while Pryor doesn't need someone to be funny, he's a riot on his own, Wilder and his style seemed to bring out an appreciate of Pryor's approach. This film isn't a gut buster, like watching a football to the groin, but the comedy suffices, and the writing does enough to fill the time of the two leads enough to hash out a plausible, likable film.
