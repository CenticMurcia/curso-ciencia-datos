I must say that it's the best danish picture I've ever seen, even if Festen also was a very good and interesting film. This is a romantic comedy which is as good as the best american and english once, for instance When Harry Met Sally... and Four Weddings And A Funeral. If you like that kind of movies and can accept the danish language =) you will like this movie, Den eneste Ene, too.
