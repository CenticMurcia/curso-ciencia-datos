It is rare to see a Russian movie made so tasteful and visually appealing. I agree that some special effects were overdone and unnecessary, taking away from the overall appeal of the film, but I really hope an English version could come out so I can see it with the rest of my family. While other users complain of the historical inaccuracies of this movie I do not think this is something people should dwell on too much. This movie is for someone who enjoys a movie with beautiful scenery and gripping effects (when they are appropriate). This is truly the best Russian movie that I have ever seen.
