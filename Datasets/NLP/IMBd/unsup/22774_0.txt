"Fulltime Killer" is not quite as good as John Woo's (just plain) "Killer". The super-stylish direction catches your attention, and the flashbacks and changes of focus among the four main characters are confidently and successfully integrated into the narrative. Also all the performances are good. But if you're looking for any qualities like originality, substance or realism you've come to the wrong place. (**1/2)
