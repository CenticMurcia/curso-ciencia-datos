Is Def-Con 4 the worst movie ever made? It's very possible. Whenever you decide to venture into the Science Fiction section of your video store, steer clear of this film. It has a deceptive cover aimed at drawing the uninformed video renter into picking it up. But whatever you do, DO NOT BE FOOLED! The sad thing is that 10 people actually gave this movie a 10 right here at the Internet Movie Database. Here's a much more realistic vote: 1 (only because that's as low as it goes here at the IMDB).
