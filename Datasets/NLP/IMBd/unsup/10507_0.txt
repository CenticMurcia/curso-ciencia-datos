If you have an Elmo fan in your house, and was disappointed to only see him one scene (not speaking) role in 1985's movie Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird, well your little one will not be disappointed. The first movie with the Sesame Street friends for the first time in 14 years. Long time isn't it. As the movie opens, Elmo (Kevin Clash) and his freind Zoe (Fran Brill) has a tug of war on Elmo's blanket ripping, Elmo gets mad at Zoe, and then it winds up in Oscar's (Caroll Spinney) trash can, Elmo jumps into the trash can, and he and his blanked wind up in Grouchland. (Spoiler Warning) And the movie's villian (Mandy Patinkin) steals Elmo's blanket. (Spoiler Warning #2) Every so often, Bert (Frank Oz) yells "Stop the Film". (Spoiler Warning #3) When Elmo's Sesame Street pals learn that Elmo has jumped into Oscar's trash can, some of them, Big Bird, etc jumped in after him. (Spoiler Warning #4) While Elmo makes his way up a mountain to the villian's house. If you ever wondered what does goes on inside Oscar's can, this the movie for you to see. Vanessa L. Williams appears as the Queen of Trash. Note like the earlier Sesame Street movie this is a rare live movie to get a G rating from the MPAA. And if parents don't want thier kids to hear bad language, this is a must watch along with the first movie. So what are you waiting for, rent or buy this movie today, you will be glad you did. Parents will be happy not have to view a movie with kids, but may want to. What would have made this even better if Bert didn't yell "Stop the Film". 10/10
