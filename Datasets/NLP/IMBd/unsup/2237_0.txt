Frank Sinatra, Sterling Hayden, James Gleason, Nancy Gates; these are the stars that make this movie an intense crime drama; the planning of an asassination of the president of the USA from an unsuspecting private home overlooking a small town. I just saw this again on TV and it held my interest to watch Sinatra in all his snarling meanness manipulating everyone. Sterling Hayden plays the sheriff rather stiffly, but macho enough to get himself shot in the arm; James Gleason, always a genius, gets the TV repairman to connect the wires to the table on which the automatic rifle is placed which explodes and starts the gun off (I always love James Gleason); the scene goes so fast you have to zero in on all that happens in that moment. It's all rather predictable and all ends well.
