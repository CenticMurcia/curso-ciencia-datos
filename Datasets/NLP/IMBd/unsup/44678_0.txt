Let me start off by saying that I feel like I've lost about 12 IQ points from watching this movie! Freddie Prinze Jr. and Julia Stiles have absolutely no chemistry together. Also if you were looking for another one of those teeny-bopper movies, this it is not. It seems that they were trying to make it seem like a teen movie, but at the same time make them act like they wanted to be adults. This movie dulls the senses and numbs the mind. Please do not watch this movie.
