In 1999, I was considering a job with Cloud Ten, the company that produced and distributed the movie. The company was planning on making many mainstream Christian movies. Revelation was suppose to be their first big screen blockbuster. They made me watch the movie as part of the interview process. After thirty minutes of watching and another 30 minutes of fast forwarding the tape, I gave up on this movie. I liked the casting but the story and acting was horrible. As part of my application process, I had to write a press release for the movie. I struggled with the content but managed to promote the movie in a positive light in the vain of getting the job. I was offered a contract with Cloud Ten but I rejected the offer for the job because the movie was so bad and I didn't believe the company could achieve their goals of marketing mainstream Christian movies to the general public.<br /><br />Some trivia - the Lalondes often take character names from well known landmarks throughout Southern Ontario close to their Cloud Ten office in St.Catharines Ontario. In Revelations, they took Jeff Fahey's character name (Thorold Stone) from the street name Thorold Stone Road, in Niagara Falls. In Tribulation, they took Gary Busey's character name (Tom Canboro) from another well know street called Canboro Road which runs throughout the Niagara Region.
