What on earth was anyone associated with this project thinking when they made this trash. It has to be the worst film I have ever seen. Their visions of the future are ridiculous and the story line is beyond redemption. The virtual reality date line, despite being a bad idea to start with, is used in the worst possible way in this film. And the first half hour is the most grueling 30 minutes anyone has the displeasure to sit through. Utter rubbish.
