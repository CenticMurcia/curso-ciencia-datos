Marisa Tomei, from this years "Wild Hogs," won an Oscar for her performance in this film. Joe Pesci, in a change from his bad boy gangster image was absolutely hilarious. Add in the Karate Kid (Ralph Maccio) and you have a movie that will have you busting a gut. This was Fred Gwynne's last movie and he was a hoot as the judge that couldn't figure out how to deal with Pesci as he defended the "youts" accused of a crime. The dialog between Pesci and Tomei was snappy throughout and made this one enjoyable experience. Don't look at the obvious errors like the fact that the judge should have known about Pesci's legal status and the tire man, just sit back and enjoy the show.
