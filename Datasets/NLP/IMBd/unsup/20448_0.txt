This is, quite simply, one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. I was so incredibly bored and the cover is so misleading. When I saw what it was that was actually inside the box I couldn't stop laughing. What kind of monster is that? I never knew someone could turn a part of the human anatomy into a monster until I saw this film.<br /><br />The worst moment of the film had to have been at the end. That was one of the worst and stupidest endings I've ever seen. What the hell were they thinking!?<br /><br />I didn't even bother to watch the movie all the way through. I was so bored and annoyed, that I fast forwarded through almost half of the film. I didn't feel like wasting any further of my time on it.<br /><br />Stay away from this!
