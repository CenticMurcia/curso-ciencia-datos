Darna Mana Hai turned out to be a movie you can watch once. It is a ghost movie having 6 stories in one story. 7 youngsters are travelling in a car through an empty road late at night. Suddenly the car has a puncture and leads to 6 of them spotting a lantern in the forest and a cozy place where sone one apparently resides( it is a an open courtyard basically). So they light a fire and start saying ghost stories. The first of the 6 stories was pretty horrific featuring Antramali. One by one the youngsters go to the car and are murdered mysteriously. The second and third horror stories were more of comedies and the movie got less horrific after the initial 20 minutes. There are big bollywood stars featuring in the stories like Vivek Oberoi, Nana Patekar, Shipa Shetty, Saif Khan and many others as well. I was startled atleast 4 times in the movie and scared my friend in the process too. It was a movie which was not as good as I had expected it to be. Yet it is interesting and atleast it is innovative which is what I like about movies.
