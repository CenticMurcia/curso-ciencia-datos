From reading some of the reviews on IMDb, it appears some people understood this movie and some didn't.<br /><br />I caught Swimming Pool by chance. Flipping through the cable channels one evening I came across this movie and immediately became captivated by the beauty of Ludivine Sagnier and the intriguing nature of the storyline. The movie was fairly easy to follow and was obviously about a frustrated writer of serial novels, called Sarah Morton, who took the advice of her publisher, John Bosload, to come up with a fresh idea for a new book while vacationing at the publishers villa in France. Little did Bosload know that the idea for this new book would be hatched from Sarah Morton's imaginative use of the publishers daughter as the main character and involve the publishers own vacation hideaway. The twists and turns that take place in the film are expressive of Sarah Morton's desperation to end a serious creative block.<br /><br />This was an interesting and entertaining movie. Good acting and a decent plot. I enjoyed watching it.
