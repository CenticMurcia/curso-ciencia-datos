Awful is not a strong word in the case of this messy soap opera. While I'm not divulging any secrets of the movie plot (there is no plot to mention), you won't get to see this movie on any wide release or even a small release in the theaters. If they are lucky, a TV sale on LifeTime TV might land in the director's backyard.<br /><br />This movie is like a damaged plane made of parts that cannot fit and it simply doesn't take off. The writer hasn't stop for a second to think of his writing, basically writing the movie and perhaps reading a book on how to write movies at the same time. <br /><br />The director is childish to think she can direct, since any good director would change lines, direct actors to react a certain way and frame the shot so that is not in a constant 3-shot. While the cinematography is beautiful, the story tries very hard. I was actually impressed with the producing because the movie looks very good for a small budget (under $1 mil). But then again, who cares about that when the movie is a total waste of your almost 2 hours, hours that will NEVER come back.
