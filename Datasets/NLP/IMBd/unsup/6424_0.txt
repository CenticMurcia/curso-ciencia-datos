As a Vietnam veteran with 40+ years of demons to deal with, I found enormous relief in this movie -- no political agenda, no concerns about whether the war in Iraq is right or wrong. Simply a superb characterization of the damage war does to people who experience it. This movie is about no war in particular -- every war in general.<br /><br />I don't believe it's possible to always avoid armed conflict. But I certainly do believe that it has to be undertaken for the right reasons, with the support of the international community, in such a way that there is no question that we will succeed and with the clear understanding that no matter how justified, there's going to be enormous collateral damage to the people involved. They need to be honored and cared for. My gratitude to the cast and crew of "In the Valley of Elah". Thank you all. I wish more people could and would see your picture.
