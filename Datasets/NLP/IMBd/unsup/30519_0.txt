I remember playing Treasure of the Rudras when I was 15 years old. It was my first Japanese import game I've played. I say that it's a shame that Rudra did not get released outside of Asia.<br /><br />Graphics (4/5): The graphics, while not as stunning as Bahamut Lagoon's graphics, are still beautifully crafted. Keita Amemiya is a wonderful artist. He can create beautiful (and so ugly they're beautiful) characters. I want to see Amemiya do more games with Square-Enix. And the sprites are animated this time, not stationary like they are in Final Fantasy IV, V and VI. But the weird thing is that the enemies look all tough and terrifying, while your heroes are all chibi and cute looking. It comes off kind of odd to me.<br /><br />Sound (5/5):Rudra has a wonderful soundtrack. Some tunes sound upbeat while others sound just terrifying. The music really suits the game. I can't picture it being done with another soundtrack. Maybe a revamped soundtrack, but keep the songs and composer.<br /><br />Gameplay (3/5): This is the only low point of Rudra. Though the magic system is unique (you can create your own spells), it also has a few flaws in it. One: You can easily overpower your enemies with the "mantras" you learn, making some of the boss battles a little too easy at times. And Two: The heroes don't have their own unique abilities or magic pool. The enemies do, and I think that's just unfair. At least with a possible remake, they could probably fix the game play and give you the option of how challenging the game should be (eg. Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert mode).<br /><br />Story and Characters (5/5): This is where Rudra shines, the story and the characters. Yes, I know it's an ecological plot similar to Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (which was said to be an inspiration for this game, according to Amemiya), but just because there is an anti-pollution theme in a story does not always make it a bad story. Picture Nausicaa with people being possessed by devils, dead coming back to life, god like beings called "Rudras" battling for supremacy and the heroes path to godhood by defeat the four majestic Rudras. If you call that boring, then you might as well be dead.<br /><br />My personal favorite character is Riza, the main heroine of the game. She sets quite a good example for girl gamers, much better than Bratz or Disney Princesses. Riza stands up for what she believes is the right thing, is protective of her friends, is not submissive at all, nor does she pout and act all ditsy and prissy. Yeah, I know Riza is quite busty (look at her official artwork. She has a bust), but there is more to Riza than good looks or big boobs (unlike other game heroines *cough*TifaLockhart*cough*<br /><br />My second favorite would be Surlent, the young blue haired sorcerer. He's very mysterious and enigmatic, plus he's good looking and has a sweet personality. It's just too bad he keeps on getting possessed by evil spirits, so possessed that he needs to get a new body (yes, it's true!).<br /><br />The only characters I dislike are Sion (the one-dimensional Cloud Strife wannabe) and Pipin (a spoiled brat claiming to be a reptilian prince). Other than that, the character development is excellent and both the plot and characters are very memorable.<br /><br />Replay (4/5): Despite it's linear nature, Rudra does have some side quests. There is a lot you can do in this game as well.<br /><br />Overall (4 1/2 out of 5): I recommend Treasure of the Rudras. Despite it's flaws, it is a likable game with a unique plot and intriguing characters. It's up there with Bahamut Lagoon, Seiken Densetsu 3, Final Fantasy IV and Illusion of Gaia as the best Super Famicom RPGs ever made.
