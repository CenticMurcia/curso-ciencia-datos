I just finished the book Peyton Place last night and was excited to get the movie on laserdisc to see how Hollywood interpreted the true to life stories of the numerous characters in the novel. I was horrified to see every female character stripped away of her individuality and independent strength. One character's low-cut dresses and "easy" lifestyle are simply explained away by her admiting it was all to get the boy she loved since she was six to marry her. What happened to Matalious' strong female voices that spoke their mind and came to grips with their own inner strength. A very disappointing outlook even for a 1957 story. I did not expect the novel verbatim but also did not expect an entire whitewash of the true drama in life. See the movie if only to explain why our parents revolted so strongly in the sixties from the morals taught them in the fifties.
