Done in the style of Crash and Boogie Nights, Sunset Strip falls far short of those two recent classics. It's main problem is lack of a coherent story, but even more than that it lacks for the most part characters you could really care about.<br /><br />Mainly because these two were an exception to some of the self indulgent rockstars and wannabes, Sunset Strip was best when it focused on the relationship of Nick Stahl and John Randolph. The eager young kid from the sticks and the oldtimer who once played in the orchestra that scored Gone With The Wind had a real nice poignant resonance to it. The other people there, I never really cared about, there comings and goings and how they all interconnected with one another over a course of 24 hours during a summer day of 1972.<br /><br />I'd see the film for those Stahl and Randolph and go for a pop and popcorn break during the rest.
