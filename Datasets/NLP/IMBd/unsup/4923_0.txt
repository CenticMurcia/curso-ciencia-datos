The first movie from Belgium director Jaco Van Dormael is pure magic. It's what cinema should always be.<br /><br />I've just seen the movie, for the third time, on TV past midnight yesterday and I couldn't close my eyes. Why ? Because Van Dormael knows how to tell a story. Also, you become very attached to all the character, bad and good one.<br /><br />The cinematography give you the impression that you are dreaming. The camera is so light and the colors are so bright so you know that the imagination of Thomas, the "Toto" from the title, is working very hard to remember exactly what happened in his childhood.<br /><br />If you love a good story with a very interesting plot, this is the one.
