Adam Sandler isn't a popular one with the critics thanks to duds like Airheads and Mixed Nuts. And while I enjoy his recent crop of movies, many do not, which I think is a shame. This has a lot of jokes, and while most are funny, some don't come off with good effect. Happy Gilmore is an amateur hockey player renowned for his violent ways. When he is introduced to golf, he uncovers a talent he never knew he had. The supporting cast is good, with Carl Weathers (Predator) superb as Chubbs the one-handed golfing coach. Yet you feel Sandler has to do a bit more to raise a smile. This is funny but at times a bit too lame for it's own good. 7 out of 10.
