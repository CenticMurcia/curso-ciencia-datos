It was rather funny watching Rex Harrison, (Charles Dyer) playing the role as a homosexual considering his real role in life as a womanizer who was dating Carole Landis who killed herself. Richard Burton, (Harry Leeds) who was married to Elizabeth Taylor perform as hairdressers and Harry owning the salon called "Chez". Harry Leeds gives a great performance in this role and gives himself and everyone else class in the way he shows his being gay to his lover Charles Dyer and other people. These men sort of love their mothers, but there is a underlying feeling that they are both seeking a deeper relationship when various problems come between their relationship. Missed this picture and was glad I was able to view a classic from 1970.
