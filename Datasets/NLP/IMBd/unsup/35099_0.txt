A middling horror yarn that gets decent mileage out of a thin story line and a premise that's too silly for words. The feature lacks any semblance of professional polish but manages to convey the backward, clannish atmosphere of a rural Georgia town where flash storms and downed power lines gradually unleash a terrible, crawling menace. A spurned suitor for a girl's affections is scarier than the worms that attack the town with a vengeance. However, this twisted farm lad has his own plans for revenge. The cast isn't distinguished but Fran Higgins, a droll, rustic type, is spirited and has her moments, such as they are. The movie has the usual unexpected shock scenes when the story line drags and the special effects don't really work well at all. Still, this film has its devotees and is regarded by some as a camp classic.
