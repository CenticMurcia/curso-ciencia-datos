This is not an ordinary love story, although love is always lurking in the background. It begins in Budapest in the 1930's and tells the (partially true) story of a restaurant owner, his girlfriend and the pianist who plays in the restaurant.<br /><br />There are so many holocaust and war stories I was not expecting this one to be different, but it certainly is. The charming characters, unpredictable events and surprise ending make this one stand out. The story takes unexpected twists and turns which kept my attention throughout the movie. I was sorry to see it end.<br /><br />I thought that using the title of the featured song, "Gloomy Sunday" as the title of the movie might keep some people from seeing it. If you can forget about the word "gloomy" and enjoy pictures from this period, this is one you should see.
