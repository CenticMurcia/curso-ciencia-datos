What an absolutely hilarious movie! Everyone gave an Oscar winning performance. The facial expressions and body gestures were unbelievably funny. I laughed harder than when I saw "Young Frankenstein" for the first time years ago. I never thought I'd see another movie that would literally have me laughing so hard that tears were running down my cheek. The fact that Robin Williams and Gene Hackman were cast seemed a bit strange to me when I first saw the names of the cast, but they were perfect for the characters they portrayed. One of the most classic examples of the wit and genius performed in this film was when Diane Wiest looks at Gene Hackman when he's saying what a fine "lady" Nathan Lane is, and he's playing a Republican Senator! I would have given the writer and all the actors an Academy for this picture. Hopefully, people will see it for what it is...pure comedic genius at work! Just relax and have fun with it. Don't try to read anything into it that you may think was NOT intentional because it was ALL intentional with extremely dramatic performances, and you know that the cast had a great time making it.You can even see Robin Williams starting to crack up when his "male maid" (Agador) is trying to toss the shrimp into his stew concoction! I'm still waiting for another classic like this one. During these trying days we all need a good laugh. WE ARE FAMILY!!!!
