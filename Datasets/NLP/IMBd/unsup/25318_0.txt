The series is awful and is full of historical inaccuracies and shouldn't be allowed to be marketed at all. Heck, even Mell Gibson could have done a better job with this.<br /><br />Even those who lives in Skane don't understand what the farmers are saying without translations. If you want a more accurate story about Snapphanar see the movie with Edward Persson.<br /><br />And Svart-Stina is some sort of Swedish version of Xena. I was waiting for her to draw two swords at one time or another and kill every Swedish soldier in sight and then begin chanting some spells.<br /><br />Only good thing in this fiasco is Tuva Novotny that actually tries to act her way out of the mess she is in
