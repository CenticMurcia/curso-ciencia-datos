Most people would remember Sonic as the famous video game character that hit consoles in the early 90s. Easily Sega's most famous creation, he went on to appear in future Dreamcast games and became a very famous publicity vehicle for Sega. Most people won't even remember the cartoons - but that is not to say that they aren't food.<br /><br />Though I haven't watched them for years, I can remember that the cartoons were very different from the games. The world was far more zany and far less Earth-like - there were all sorts of new characters not in the games (to name two, Scratch and Grounder), and the episodes actually had plots. Robotnik was probably brought to the screen best as a complete maniac, Sonic was very much like the games - fast and smart, and Tails was the snivelling little sidekick. The best episode was probably "Tails' New Home" as it was unpredictable, quite scary in parts and meaningful - Sonic actually wanted to get rid of Tails for both of their own good. It would be worth putting on your super sonic sneakers and rushing out to buy a copy of this forgotten classic - it is better than some of the trash that we get nowadays.<br /><br />The Sonic TV show is no masterpiece, but it is sure enjoyable and in every bit as classic as a game. Nearly a spiffing job! 8/10
