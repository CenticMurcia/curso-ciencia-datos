This movie can be summed up in one simple word - 'garbage'! The acting was some of the worst I have ever seen. I could have sworn I was watching a high school rendition of some poorly written script. Aside from the 'Coronation Street' style of acting (actually it was worse than that) the plot was disjointed and the only other thing it catered to was to introduce the viewer to an attempt to pull you in and keep you captive 'action movie' style via a full on gun fest and a massive body count! <br /><br />Guns, guns and more guns. The only thing missing was an RPG. Oh wait.... there *was* a grenade - just not rocket propelled. I don't mind a good action flick with some gun work but not at the expense of the story line.<br /><br />If poor storyline, poor acting and 'loads' of bullets flying around is your scene then this is the movie for you. Failing that - give this one a wide berth.
