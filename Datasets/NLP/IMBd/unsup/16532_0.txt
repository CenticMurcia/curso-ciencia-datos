This was another interesting, fast-moving Tarzan film with plenty of action and even a little more humor than normal.<br /><br />The action scenes are hokey (shots of wild animals on a screen in back of the live actors) and even the background scenery is obviously painted but, hey, it's an old film. That I can put up with, but not the vast amount of "darlings" uttered by "Jane" (Maureen O'Sullivan). That gets really annoying<br /><br />However, the rest of the film is very entertaining, very good and even very clever at times. The story is about Tarzan and Jane acquired "boy" (Johnny Sheffield) when the latter was five years old.<br /><br />Overall: entertaining and one of the better Johnny Weissmuller-Tarzan entries.
