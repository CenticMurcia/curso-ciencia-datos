Like many of the comments, it will be considered to be in the top five movies I have watched. Living my life as an identical mirror twin, I could sense the incredible love between them. I watched the movie on TV and there was only one commercial so I was riveted to my couch as I did not want to miss one moment. I did not have a sense of where the story was going at the beginning but the writers took us on a believable journey. Perfect pick for the mother. I am lucky to be channel surfing this night or I would have missed a story that I could so strongly relate to. I will have to do some research to see if the Polish brothers have written or directed any movies since. I wish them both huge success with any projects they tackle in the future. Thank you for sharing a love that I have been fortunate to always know.
