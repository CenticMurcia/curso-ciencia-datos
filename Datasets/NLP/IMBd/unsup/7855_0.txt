I was not expecting Pirates of the Caribbean caliber but I was sure expecting more than Country Bears level. At least the Bears was entertaining for small children to see talking animals. Maybe a talking animal could have helped this movie, but I doubt it. The performances were not that bad but the story was awful. There was virtually no humor and so many plot holes it was incredible. For example (without spoiling anything), characters speak of a curse but I sure never heard anything cursed or saw a curse being given. What curse? Who cursed it? What could break it? Yes, the beginning of the movie shows some of the soon to be ghosts but there is nothing there about a curse.<br /><br />I saw this with my wife and daughter and we were all very disappointed. My son went to Looney Toons and I wish we had gone with him. The trailers for this movie were a much better film. If you get a chance to see this, don't take the chance is my advice.
