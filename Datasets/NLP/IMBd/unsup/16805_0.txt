Absolutely my favorite film. It bombed, but I loved it.. People who rip on this film have no imagination what so ever. Im glad they wasted there time seeing this movie, hell it got watched didnt it? If you know back in 1985 if you saw this movie in the theater i want to hear your comments about the day you saw it, what night, location, and how people reacted to it. If you saw a TV ad or newspaper for this film, Im interesed in knowing any facts you may have. Keep in mind, your personal thoughts about it are already stated here at IMDB, I already know how you feel. Thanks -pete<br /><br />
