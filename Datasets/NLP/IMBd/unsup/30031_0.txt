I saw this at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival where it played for it's second year in a row. I guess since it became Peru's official nomination to the Academy Awards the Festival organizers felt they should bring it back as they feature most of the films that are official submissions to the upcoming Academy Awards. I would hope it doesn't come back for a third year at the 2007 festival. This is admittedly a low budget film but nothing in this film can get you past the fact that it is low budget. I tried to be sympathetic to young former soldiers trying to make a living back in the civilian world but except for the lead character you didn't know enough about his friends to care what happened to them. As for his plight it became predictable from the beginning. The woman who played the mother and the girl who played the little sister in small roles seemed like the only ones in this movie who could actually act. I would give this a 4.5 out of a possible 10 and not recommend it.
