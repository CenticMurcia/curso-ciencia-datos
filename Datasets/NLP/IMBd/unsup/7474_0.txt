Christy has mysterious blackouts with strange visions and decides to investigate the death of her sister that she believes had been buried alive, disclosing a dark secret, while the locals believe she has borderline personality disorder.<br /><br />"Beneath" is labeled of horror, but it is actually a thriller with some touches of supernatural mysteries. The intriguing story and the characters are well-developed, the acting is above average and in the end "Beneath" is not a masterpiece but a good movie and worthwhile seeing. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Sombra da Morte" ("Shadow of the Death")
