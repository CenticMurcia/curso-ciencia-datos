Well, the best thing about this movie was that it featured Simple Plan, 1 of my favorite rock groups.But it is absolutely beyond me why they would want to be in an Olsen movie.also Jared Padalecki was REALLY hot!! watched it bout a year back but as far as i remember the movie was pretty lame!! I have disliked the twins ever since their full house days but this movie was vaguely better than the rest. in fact the Olsen fans(thought i will never know why they have any) must b in heaven at the fact that they made an actual watchable film. it was rather moronic not to mention racist and extremely unrealistic . but some of the jokes were amusing and unlike most of the movies, the tension between the twins was something that a lot of teenagers can relate to. i think Eugene Levey's character was kinda lame as well as being obnoxious and unrealistic. the twins don't have a lot of acting potential(to be polite)but this movie might be a stepping stone towards slightly better movies. it was still pretty pathetic i'll admit but which Olsen movie is not.i'd give it a 2 or maybe a 3
