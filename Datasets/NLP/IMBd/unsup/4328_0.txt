This movie is so much like the first one. There is hardly any originality. Instead of being left at home, he gets lost in New York. It is the same thing, with slight variations. Same two burglars try to get him. He befriends someone he is afraid of, only this time it is a woman. They do the video-gag again (black and white movie) where they think it is a real person talking. The traps are the same more or less, with slight differences, along with a few extra ones, which are totally corny by the way. And so on and so forth. This movie is extremely predictable. Instead of a sequel, this movie should have been made as a "Scenario B" to the first one. It would have been good, had the first one never came out, and we wouldn't realize what a blatant rip-off it is.
