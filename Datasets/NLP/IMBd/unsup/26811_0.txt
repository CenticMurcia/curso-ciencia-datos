I simply don't care if this is "only" a MOCKumentary, it's by far the greatest DOCumentary I've ever seen! Superbly well done, and very touching. I remember watching this movie on TV when they first showed it in Sweden, I think it was in 2002. I was fascinated! I thought it was the most amazing incredible story I had ever heard or seen. I could not believe why I had never heard about this Colin McKenzie before, nor the movies he created. I NEVER thought of it as a possible hoax. I did'nt sleep that night, all I could think about was this movie, and all the suffering that Colin McKenzie got through. The next day I told all my friends about this incredible movie, and NO ONE asked if it could been a hoax. It took me over three years before I finally found out that it was a mockumentary. Ambarassing at first, then, when I saw that it was a Peter Jackson movie, I could only laugh. I watch this movie often- It strikes me every time as the most amazing story ever CREATED.<br /><br />Congratulations Mr Jackson- You got me completely fooled!
