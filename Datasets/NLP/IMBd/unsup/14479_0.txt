This could have been a great movie about dancers growing old, or older. Both Swayze and De La Pena were wonderful dancers in their prime but to be only 7 years away from professional dancing as stated in this film is frankly, a bit ridiculous when it is obviously many more years than that - more like 20. There is certainly a lot of pain in a dancer's life from growing older and no longer being capable of dancing the way you once could. There are some very accurate statements made in the film relating to this. The choreography is somewhat boring. Just a lot of lyrical steps, well executed by the young dancers, but lacking any meaning. Just meaningless steps on one level, saying nothing.
