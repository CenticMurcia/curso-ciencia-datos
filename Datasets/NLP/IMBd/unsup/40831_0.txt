I can't write much because basically nothing happens. People pose for the camera, speak their lines badly, pretend to be tribal people, run away, come back. A couple of people get eaten by crocodiles. Apparently there is some sort of history behind the tribes and their locations. There are some ape men who are around for whatever reason. I guess to give the movie some sort of plot. They seem to have designs on the women. There's also some sort of queen that the women go to who howls and makes statements. When the men were around, what did they think of this? Anyway, unlike most silly movies, I couldn't really see any fun in this one. One thing of interest. I guess there's a sub-genre of prehistoric women movies. Why!?
