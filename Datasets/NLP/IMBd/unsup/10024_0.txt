This film reminds me more of "Star 80" than "A Star Is Born". I do not have any idea how close Doris Day and James Cagney came, in their portrayals, to the real characters. However, their performances are wonderful. I was especially taken with Ms. Day's portrayal. When she sings a song, she stays exactly in characterÂ… she sings the songs precisely how her character would sing the songs. Cagney's performance is less remarkable than Day's, because he had less road to travel. He is certainly fun to watch, though! Granted, I don't know Ruth Etting as a performer; however, I do know Day is portraying someone quite unlike her standard screen persona. Cagney's portrayal depends more on our, as viewers, knowledge of a gangster's past (particularly Cagney's gangster characters). It would have been interesting to explore more about how Day's character is (or, is not?) attracted to this type of man.<br /><br />The songs do not intrude on the drama. Instead, the Etting songs punctuate and enhance different "chapters" in the film. A dramatic musical is somewhat more complicated than a musical comedy. This film succeeds as a musical drama.<br /><br />The flaw is that the film did not tell enough. There is a hint of a sexual attack of Etting by Snyder, which is followed by the wedding of the Day/Cagney characters. Her drinking, and his sordid back story, are as not as well developed as they should have been. These things make the characters less heroic, but more interesting and vulnerable. I think subtlety is great; we don't need to see everything, but "Love Me or Leave Me" should have unturned a few more stones. I do not need to see every piece of a puzzle, but need to see enough pieces for a full picture. <br /><br />******** Love Me or Leave Me (5/26/55) Charles Vidor ~ Doris Day, James Cagney, Cameron Mitchell
