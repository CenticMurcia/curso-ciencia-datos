Wow is the only thing I can say about this movie. There never was and will never be anything like it. It is the only movie that I watched more than 20 times, sometimes twice in a row. It is the best movie on the planet! I think that Thora Birch is the only one who could play Enid because nobody else would be that convincing. Every single time I watch this movie I discover something new and that is why I keep watching it. If there are original movies left in this world, then one of them should definitely be Ghost World. Now, I could keep talking about this for hours and still I would have to say more. The best way to find out what I'm talking about is to watch it.
