It's official, "The Dawn" is the worst movie I've ever seen! I can credit this complete pile of crap with only a singular attribute... The cover looks creepy. PERIOD!<br /><br />Under the cover, I can only hope that this was made by starving, crack addicted, film school drop-outs with nothing else to do with their buzz. The dialog is obviously unscripted. Nothing but mindless banter accented with an overkill of screaming (at what!?) The characters were the lamest group of needy individuals however as a man, I was at first intrigued by the lesbians, but even lost interest in them within the first 3 minutes or so. As for the plot (plot?), I think if there was ever a shred of evidence of what this was supposed to be, it got swept off the cutting room room floor by the janitor. Which leads me to the director Linwood D Neverson. Here's a man with balls. He edited his own direction and was left standing alone with nothing more than what should be an embarrassment. It also happens to be produced by Linwoods brother Darryl L Neverson and Agustin. At least Agustin had enough common sense not to strap his surname to it. As far as the camera crew, the lighting is poor and there's a scene that must have been filmed by a drunk monkey with a cam-cord and a real bad case of the hic-cups. The soundtrack is poorly edited rap/hip-hop. Though I myself don't like the style of music(?) at all, those who do can reap the crap of rap here.<br /><br />All in all "The Dawn" is by far, the biggest waste of celluloid I ever had the burden to witness. But I pays my moneys, I's gots to sees it.<br /><br />But the cover is cool.
