I came upon 1 Giant Leap after looking up what films that Ram Dass has appeared in. I love the way the passion for creativity shows up in the swirl of colors, images, music, poetry, and love of human diversity that this DVD projects. I rated it a 10 for that and its energy. Some have criticized it because of "slow" parts. I liked the balance of very energetic parts versus the time taken to contemplate the beauty and peace that surrounds us. I would have liked even more diversity to be included, Amer-Indian, Caribbean, Chinese, Arabic, Indonesian, Japanese, Finnish, North African, etc. That said, this is one DVD that can be watched time and again. I would rate this a must see. If you have an interest in spiritual side of existence, I would recommend seeing 'Fierce Grace' with Ram Dass.
