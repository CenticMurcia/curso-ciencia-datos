Another attempt to cash in on the slasher craze of the early 80's. The head being cut off a wheel-chair bound victim was poorly done, in sillouette. Then the "drump-drump-drump" sound when the mad man was coming after a victim just got on your nerves. It's a wonder this film hasn't shown up on cable yet. Bad? That's a good word for it. Especially when you notice no sequel was made. Thank god.
