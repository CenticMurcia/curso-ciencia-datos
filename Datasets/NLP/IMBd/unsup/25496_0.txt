What can I say about this film? It's brilliant; Ko So-Young and Lee Sung-Jae are excellent as the married couple struggling to conceive. The only problem I had with the film is that it verge's a little to close to being sentimental during the early part of the film, but it's only a small problem. All in all the film builds up nicely and believably to what is an excellent and touching final 20 minutes. And for me the film stands as more evidence that South Korea is currently making many of the best films in the world (they have been since 1997).
