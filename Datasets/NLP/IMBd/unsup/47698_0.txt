First time when my son brought home the CD with "15", we just had a look. And we reacted.<br /><br />We saw the opening credits, with the long list of acknowledgements - and we laughed our asses off.<br /><br />We saw the opening shot, with that ferris wheel - and we laughed our asses off.<br /><br />We fast-forwarded to a scene where Maia Morgenstern is in a sewer and calls for someone - and we laughed our asses off.<br /><br />We FF-ed even more, to some militiamen invading an apartment - and we laughed our asses off.<br /><br />We switched at random, to find a scene self-pastiched from "Revansa" (some guy jumping from a bridge on a train carriage) - and we laughed our asses off.<br /><br />...This was the first impact.<br /><br />After a while, we gathered enough patience to sit down and watch all the movie. And we both reached to the same conclusion: It made no difference. Really none.<br /><br />And we cried our eyes off.
