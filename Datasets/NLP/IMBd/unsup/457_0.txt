Swimmers rocks. It's the sort of movie that stays with you for days. Swimmers is an amazing movie with many layers, some joyful and some profound. The varying themes center around personal strength, love, connections to each other, and transformation as the characters struggle to stay above water, each in an individual way. The point of view stays with a wise and sensitive little girl which creates a innocent delight and a freshness to the total ambiance of the film. The setting could be anywhere in small town America in any working class family, yet this film is about a waterman's family and what they do in a time of crisis. There are funny spots too where the audience feels pulled in again and again to this familiar yet unique world where the Tyler family lives. Gorgeous photography. Super acting too, especially by Robert Knott who plays the father.
