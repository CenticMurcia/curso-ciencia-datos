This movie is unbelievably bad. The first time I saw it, it threw me for a loop, because it violated so many of the conventions of intelligible moviemaking that I almost felt shell-shocked. The second time, I found it absolutely hilarious. It has more camp value than a Winnebago. From gratuitous sex, to actors twenty years too old for their parts, to acting that would embarrass a junior high school drama club, to editing that makes home movies look slick, to three-minute shots of a mailbox, to special effects beyond compare...<br /><br />It's a must-see. It's just beyond description.
