I would've figured this to be just another lame joked Bachelor Party movie. Well it was pretty lame when it tried to be funny, but it actually had an excellent story if you can believe it. I wouldn't technically call this a comedy movie, because it didn't make me laugh at all. But this is a pretty decent adventure movie with a fantastic story to it. You may feel let down because the movie did pretty horrible, but if you watch the entire movie and follow the story you will find it to be a little better than the story of comedies that have made it big at the box office. I thought the movie was a little overboard with trying to be funny and all, but once again the story and plot is the only thing that can save it.<br /><br />4/10
