A friend of mine made me a tape of various stuff. This was on it. I had never even heard of this film before ... now i know why. I wonder why 'Glitter' has a lower rating then this drivel, but i am afraid to watch that film to find out for myself lest i wake up in the middle of the night from a Mariah Carey nightmare! ;)<br /><br />So - i watched it, but i watched most of it in fast forward. You get the picture that most of the cast are mean people who are going to 'get it in bad ways' as soon as they are introduced.<br /><br />This is a real stinker - one of those 'heavy metal' horror films that never should have been conceived. The problem is not that the movie is stupid, cheesy, and inane, but that that the movie realizes it is such and still continues to deliver the same old good versus evil confrontation - and guess who wins, and guess how it ends anyway. Blah blah blah.<br /><br />Hey. I like horror films - this one is best avoided, unless you want to witness some of the worst one-liners in Hollywood history. Sigh, i guess some movie makers forgot that good horror films died back in the 80's.<br /><br />On the plus side, this one would have probably made a decent Tales From The Crypt short. It does have a very E.C. Comics feel to it, but that is The Granny's biggest problem - it only has 20 minutes of entertainment tops. And didn't we already see this story in the first tale of 'Tales From the Crypt?' - at least that had Ed Harris getting crushed by a tomb stone via zombie telekinesis!<br /><br />Check out 'Night of the Demons' for a better film from this inane sub-facet of the horror genre (heavy metal evil incarnate). It sucks too, but at least it didn't annoy me. Check out Fulci for some real horror.<br /><br />1/10
