OK so i am a sucker for these terrible 80's horror films, and this is definitely not one of the better ones. However as with so many others its laughs all round, due to the shockingly bad script, plot etc. As far as the acting goes, well the less said about most of the cast the better, but a couple of leads aren't to bad, just the script lets them down.<br /><br />As far as gore goes, this film is very tame even by 80's standards. I put this down more to the low budget (which by the way is LOW), resulting in some very laughable effects, like jam looking blood and fake flies... There's a couple of good bits one where a guy has his hand chopped off, another where a guy has his head beaten in by a rock, but the effects are so lame that anyone affected by this film, really needs to look to seeking help.<br /><br />I think Forrest of Fear is a clear example of one of those films that the BBFC & Police simple stuck on the nasties list most probably due to the outrage at zombie flicks in general at the time. Certainly even by 1980's standards its laughable that this film could fall under the category of an 'obscene publication'. The fact the film still today remains banned in the UK, is not due in any respect to any offencive material, but due I'm sure to the fact that no distributor can be bothered to resubmit the film to the BBFC.<br /><br />My advice, avoid this unless your into super low budget, terrible 80's zombie flicks. Which personally i love
