This has to easily be the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /><br />Admittadly, I saw this movie AFTER I saw Heavy Metal 2000, so I might be biased in my thoughts/opinions. <br /><br />While there are some O.K. Parts to this movie, 95% of it is worthless drible. <br /><br />The Animation is AWFUL by today's standards. Even in 1980 (4 years before I was born) it probably looked like garbage. It looks like a bad Sci Fi Beavis and Butthead. <br /><br />The story makes little sense. Of course, you don't watch these types of movies for plot, but they could have at least tried (like HVM 2000 -the plot wasn't much but at least it was there). <br /><br />The music is a bunch of 80's style Hard Rock. While middle-aged viewers might enjoy this 'music', I cant see anyone else enjoying it.<br /><br />The violence and nudity are all that anyone could possibly like about this movie. And if you really want that, then you could watch HVM 2000.<br /><br />Overall, 1/10. Only older people and geeks should watch this movie.<br /><br />James "Black Wolf" Johnston blackwolf14016@hotmail.com<br /><br />
