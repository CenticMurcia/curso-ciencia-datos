In 1889 London, Christian (Robert Knepper) mourns the loss of his wife and takes up an offer from vampire Nina (Diana Frank) to live another 1000 years as her slave so he can search for the reincarnation of his lost love. Over 100 years later in L.A., he finds his wife in the form of a compassionate nurse named Katherine (Kathleen Kinmont). Christian is relieved, as he's having a miserable time stalking seedy nightclubs with Nina for (mostly female) victims to take home for kinky sex and a quick meal. Police investigate as the bodies pile up, one officer also getting the hots for Katherine. <br /><br />Knepper and Kinmont do what they can in their roles and if Karen Kelly's script piles on way too much mumbo jumbo, at least it attempts to be mature and romantic, which means it will appeal to a certain kind of audience who don't want to watch another vampire gorefest. That said this Playboy production is dull and dreary much of the time. Not exactly a good time at the movies unless you're looking for a plethora of naked chicks.
