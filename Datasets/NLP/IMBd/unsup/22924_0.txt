Oh, this is terrible. The sound quality is awful. The songs are performed without any emotion at all. Almost as bad as a Rolling Stones marathon. Please, if we wanted to see something like this, we would have invented a time machine already. I mean, Freddie Mercury has one of the worst voices I personally have ever heard. He makes Roger Daltrey sound like an angel. And please tell me what is so great about Brian May's guitar? I mean, sure he made it himself and everything, but it's so screechy, it just makes you want to hurl! Many of these songs performed are from the notorious 'Hot Space' album, which has got to be the worst album ever recorded, with exception of 'Sgt. Peppers'. Full of mindless disco beats, these songs have no meaning at all, and will most likely give you a migraine before they even start. In conclusion, if you want to be mildly amused for a couple of hours, this should do the trick. For some real entertainment, I recommend The Spice Girls movie. Now that's entertainment!
