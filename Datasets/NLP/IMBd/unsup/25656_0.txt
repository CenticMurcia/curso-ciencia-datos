As I have seen some other watchers don't seem to like this movie but I think it's good by any standards. Coneheads's way of speaking and doing everything a little more faster than everyone else is hilarious. And unlike others have said there are many gags that worked. If you had/have an opportunity to see this movie in an actual movie theatre you won't be disappointed.
