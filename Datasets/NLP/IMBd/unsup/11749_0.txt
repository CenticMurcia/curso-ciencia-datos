Kopps is a very entertaining Swedish comedy from the opening of the film to the final credits. Like most Swedish films, the cinematography is exceptional and the acting is top-notch. What makes this find stand apart is the screenplay is well-written and humorous. It's accessible to large audiences. Most people will enjoy this film. Each character in the film is unique and a joy to watch. It has a good story, and does very well at capturing small town life in modern-day Sweden. This film is not an historical period piece or set on a rural farm, which is refreshing. And it's better than most Hollywood movies. This director has a real future in film-making.
