I never saw the exposition of life like this in any movie as it goes on behind the curtains in the ghetto, and this movie showed me a small portion of just that. The ugly reality of life came to surface in this film. Typically black men in the ghetto don't show much respect toward women, abuse them on a regular basis for their selfish, immoral and degraded sexual perversions, as hinted, behind closed doors. I felt both surprised and disturbed by the portrayal of the conscienceless, shifty, two-faced and shameless men who very well painted the picture of life and the kind of men one would meet in the hellish world of drug abuse, prostitution, and poverty. In the end, we learn that there is a way out of there for all, but with a large price tag attached to it!
