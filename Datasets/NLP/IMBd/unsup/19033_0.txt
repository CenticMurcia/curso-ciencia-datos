I`ve just seen this movie and would like to say its fantastic. It`s got humor,it`s scary moments and stuff. Kathleen Turner is perfect and funny as the mother who kills everybody that does not fit in her style. She starts killing more and more people....But what the hell! She`s The Best and I really like the ending,this is a movie everybody should see.
