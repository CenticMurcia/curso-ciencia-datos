Ronnie (Adam Scott, who'd later go on to parts in Step Brothers & the Matador) is a sad sack loser of a guy who works at a halfway house for the mentally disabled. He grows infatuated by Sara, one of the residents when he spies her naked n the bathroom. So much is his fondness that later when he sees her standing in the middle of the street (she had wondered out of the house) he decides to take her back to his mom's place (where he lives, mom's in the hospital after falling out of a taxi) for some nookie. Things get complicated when Ronnie's druggie brother, fresh out of prison, shows up a day early and decides to party with his equally pathetic friends. Meanwhile the other helper at the Halfway house is looking for Sara.<br /><br />The movie started out with an intriguing premise, but soon devolved into something else entirely. Everyone in the film acts insanely stupid and none of their actions make much sense even under the lightest of scrutiny. By the end (which was such a WTF moment that I ceased to exist caring) I was though even trying to care what the hell was going on. The film felt more like a series of random story ideas thrown out there and less like a coherent plot. I'm positive there's a good story to be told of a mentally handicapped person who's kidnapped by a social worker for nefarious sexual purposes, but this movie just isn't it.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Fini Goodman shows T&A but her character is mental <br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Where I Saw it: instant Netflix via Xbox 360
