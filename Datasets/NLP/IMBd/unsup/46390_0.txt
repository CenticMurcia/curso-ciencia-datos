A rich couple and a poor couple -- both played by Joan Collins and Steven Berkoff -- prattle to the camera (and between themselves) about their lives and experiences.<br /><br />This is the pits of the pits. Bad. Bad. Bad. Staring the biggest -- most talentless -- show offs that ever went before the camera. Talk about camera mugging. Berkoff makes Jerry Lewis look restrained.<br /><br />Basically Berkoff points the camera at himself and then overacts for England, village hall style. Collins -- who looks at least a 100 years old (despite six tons of make up) looks as bored as you will be if you start watching this pile of old tosh.<br /><br />This has to be one of the worst movies ever made and without any doubt the worst script ever filmed.
