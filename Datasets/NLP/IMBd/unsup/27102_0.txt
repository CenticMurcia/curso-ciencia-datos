There are, and always will be, differences of opinion about every movie. After reading the existing comments on this one I decided that one of the things causing those differences is the question of how many movies you've seen. I grew up in the 40s of the last century so I've seen an awful lot of movies. Maybe for that reason or maybe just because I'm a wacko, I tend to judge every movie at least partly for its relation to all the other movies I've seen.<br /><br />Take "Buckaroo," for example. It came out in 1984 containing some elements suggested by "Dr. Strangelove" (1964) and "Superman II" (1980).On the other hand, its driving force shows up again in "Men In Black" (1997). "Sneakers" (1992) shamelessly copies one of its principal sets, the background of one of the characters, its technological McGuffin and one scene right down to the dialog. One line by John Bigboote is hilariously adapted in every single episode of the BBC comedy series "Keeping Up Appearances." Top that, "Citizen Kane!"
