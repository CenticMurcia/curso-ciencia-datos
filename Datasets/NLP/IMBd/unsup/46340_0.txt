This movie's known more commonly as AXE, but I suppose the more official title would be LISA, LISA. Even though it's only 68 minutes long it felt much longer. It begins with a group of criminals in suits and ties who beat what appears to be an associate of there's to death and then go out and terrorize a female clerk at a convenience store. Of course, they get tired and have to rest, so they take over the home of a young girl and her paralyzed grandfather, with predictable mayhem to follow. This is another entry in the LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT sweepstakes, but the pacing is slow and the payoff not really worth the effort.
