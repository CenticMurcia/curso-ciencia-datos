This film is definitely different in perspective on family life compared to "Cinema Paradiso". It is not as sentimental, but very real. The viewer is able to see everything in the father's eyes, played by Marcello Mastroianni. When he sees his children, he sees them how they once were -- not as adults. Mastroianni is always excellent. It is funny though to see him as a father and a grandfather when one is so used to seeing him as a bachelor, like in "La Dolce Vita". I was able to feel the love he had for his children and also the hurt when the truth was brought out in front of him. We all want so much for our children and it is painful to see it otherwise. An excellent statement. Besides the message the film brought, it also gave the viewer a good dose of the italian countryside, Roma, and Milano. The travel scenes were an added touch. Nothing can beat "Cinema Paradiso" in tenderness, but "Stanno tutti bene" is not too far off!<br /><br />
