This early talkie's plot deals with--more or less--the unrelated adventures of Ted Healy and some local firemen (Moe, Larry, Shemp and Fred Sanborn). There's very little coherence until the climactic fire, when the Stooges save the day.<br /><br />Two performances stand out, both for the wrong reasons. Ted Healy was a major star in vaudeville and film when this movie was made. If you watch this film, it's hard to understand why, because his routine was just not funny. His offhandedly mean treatment of the Stooges also alienates the viewer. Fred Sanborn provides one of the most bizarre and irritating performances ever captured on film as a mute fireman. He's just so indescribably bad, you have to watch this to believe it.<br /><br />Within a few short years, the Three Stooges were big stars in short subjects and Ted Healy was dead due to a bar fight. This film's worth catching for fans of the Stooges, since it's their feature film debut and historically interesting. Otherwise, stay away.
