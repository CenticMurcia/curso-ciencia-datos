A re-edited version of 1950's "Gone to Earth", which apparently derived after an artistic struggle between the production team The Archers and David O. Selznick. It's a rather overripe, humorless adaptation of Mary Webb's book "Gone to Earth" involving a gypsy girl in 19th century Wales who is caught between two men. Predictably handsome melodrama, yet one which seldom involves the viewer. Co-directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger have a unique and occasionally ominous way of letting nature unfold in front of the lens, and the cinematography is vivid and expressive; however, they don't seem to know much about actors or about the strength of performance--the technique seems to elude them--and Jennifer Jones in particular comes off looking like an amateur (which she is most assuredly not). The film has its charms, but it has no gypsy blood--nor a wild heart. ** from ****
