This film filled the eyes of those who saw their own hurtful experiences in it as the history they try to forget. If wishes could come true, then everyone would watch this film with an open mind if only to find out if afterward, they were still willing to throw the first stone of "righteousness". What was NOT surprising was that all the viewer's ratings for this film was distributed extremely skewed, at both poles. It correlates almost exactly with a picture of the world that the film illustrated. How poetic is it that the credibility of the film's message is actually reflected in the way people rated their personal viewing experience of this documentary. The film's message is visibly demonstrated by the prejudice reflected in the film's polarized evaluations; a powerful confirmation of the actual world around us. Bravo, Film Maker, for a job well done!
