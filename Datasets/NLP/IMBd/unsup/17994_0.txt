Gerald Parker is found dead in the penguin pool of a local aquarium. Who did it? Is it his unhappy, unfaithful wife? The man who loves her? The curator of the aquarium who want bankrupt because of him? Schoolteacher Hildegarde Withers (Edna May Oliver) and Inspector Piper (James Gleason) team up to find out.<br /><br />It's creaky in spots and some of the acting is bad but, all in all, this is an enjoyable murder comedy. The script is quick with some very funny, sarcastic and somewhat suggestive lines. The identity of the murderer wasn't obvious (to me at least) but afterwords I realized everything pointed to him. <br /><br />As I said, some of the acting is bad (Mae Clarke needed serious acting lessons and the guys playing Phillip and her husband were wooden) but the main roles are played great! Oliver (a WONDERFUL character actress) is letter perfect as Withers and Gleason is just great as gruff Inspector Piper. These two had wonderful chemistry together and interplay between them is just great. Also there's some (mild) sexual tension between them which just adds to the fun!<br /><br />The first of RKO Pictures very short-lived Hildegarde Withers series. Only three had Oliver in them. I'd love to see the other two!
