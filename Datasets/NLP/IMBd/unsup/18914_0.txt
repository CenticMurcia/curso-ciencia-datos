I really liked this movie! The look of it is beautiful. I don't know where it was shot, but the locations are gorgeous, as are the actresses. The lead actors really pulled off touching moments. You really got pulled in to the story.Eric Roberts, Christopher Knight, and Meadow Williams gave first rate performances. Adrianne Curry was really good. She's one of my Myspace friends, so it was great to see her act. Since she's a model I wasn't sure she could act but she was great, and the uninvited kiss on Chris was perfectly played.Meadow Williams was so touching as the angelic alien. Need to see more of this girl. There were nice comic touches and warm,real moments. This is a movie you can see with anyone and not be embarrassed. I would compare it to "Princess Bride". I has an instant classic feel. The romance gives it "chick flick" elements, but it is so likable and the women are so pretty that we guys love it too.
