Dougray Scott has appeared in over a dozen movies since Twin Town, including Deep Impact, Enigma and of course MI2.<br /><br />It is often said that you have to be from Swansea to truly enjoy this film, and while this is probably the case, friends of mine from all parts of the UK seem to enjoy it for the fun film that it is.<br /><br />The most memorable quote from the film for me:<br /><br />"Here's twenty quid, now go and buy yourselves a nice big pot of sticky sticky and f*** off back to noddyland"
