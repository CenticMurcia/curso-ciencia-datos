Here's what Robert Quarry did after Count Yorga, if you're interested: he donned a wig and caftan and became a Charlie Manson type hippie guru vampire. This isn't exactly up to the standards of the Count Yorga movies, at least the first one, but it's OK for a hippie vampire movie. And it even features John Fiedler, as Pop, who wears a medallion and a hippie vest but still looks pretty much the same old geek....he who voiced 'Piglet' in the Disney movies for years. The idea is that there's this commune type set-up with all these groovy hippies that live in a big house near the ocean. One of them, a creepy looking dude named Barbado, seems to set off invisible wind chimes wherever he goes, it can't be his necklace, that seems to stay pretty still. When Barbado sits near the shore one day and plays his flute, this coffin washes up on the shore and of course you know who's in it. The coffin gets dragged to an undisclosed location and suddenly the commune has been blessed by the appearance of this Khorda guy, who spouts psycho-babble and has them all drink bottled water. Groovy. Of course, behind all this groovy mysticism Khorda is still nothing but a vampire and pretty soon so are most of the hippies in the commune. Except for one, Pico, who you suspect is wearing a wig held on by his headband since that never comes off. Of course he comes back to save his girl, and so on. This never really rises above cheesy drive in fare, but that's fine, I like this stuff. No great shakes, this, but entertaining enough. 7 out of 10.
