Really, it looked like a nice movie with lots of nice killings and nice bloody gore; all that i and my girlfriend love to watch in a Sunday afternoon. But no; this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen, it has bad acting, bad action sequences, bad scripting, awful sense of humor, it's all bad. I have to say that i'm a B Movie fan, i love low budget movies and i can say with every words --- THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY, TIME, ACTORS AND EQUIPMENT---. With 1/3 of the money that Alexander Finbow had to do this i would be able to do the Portuguese equivalent to "The Lord Of The Rings". I don't know how could anyone be interested in making movies like this one. PANTS!
