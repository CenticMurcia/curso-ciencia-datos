Out of all the little teen pop starlets of the late 90s, Mandy Moore seemed like the only nice one. She didn't make trampy video clips or a million songs about what creeps guys are or how powerful women are.<br /><br />But then, she made that terrible movie about being the shy, nice girl who gets the popular hunk... which is completely the wrong message. Why can't a shy, nice girl get with a shy, nice guy? Why would she even want the cocky hunk? If she was truly nice, she wouldn't.<br /><br />And then life imitated art, when Mandy started seeing hunky arrogant bad boy tennis player Andy Roddick.<br /><br />And now another horrible movie where Mandy has turned her back on the sweet and innocent image that helped set her apart as different from the Britney Spears and Christina Aguileras. And makes another terrible movie featuring her opposite some disposable pretty boy where they get together for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />She has about as much acting talent as any other pop star (ie. none) but it's the characters, the roles she is picking that are the true tragedy. It's not like it's a stretch for her to play a shallow, vapid teenager and unfortuantely that's who she has become, not just on film but in real life.<br /><br />It's such a shame and such a waste to think of what a nice image she used to have, and now this. Just another empty, vain and self absorbed Hollywood clone.<br /><br />Mandy, please quit acting or choose different roles.<br /><br />1/10
