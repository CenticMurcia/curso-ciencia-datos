If you want to watch a movie that includes Pauly Shore quoting his other movies, with a lot of cameos in it, that shows on several occasions Pauly Shore masturbating, then this movie is for you. However, my blood pressure rose several points by the end of the film due to how irritated it made me. It was much like driving through the rain during rush hour while you have a cold. Pauly Shore has found yet another device to irritate people. This movie is lacking in plot, depth, and comedy.<br /><br />While none of the following "got" me, some people might like this: There were cameos all over the place (how he was able to lure so many people into participating in this disaster is beyond me). Some might find a new respect for Pauly Shore due to his ability to make fun of himself. People who appreciate Pauly Shores humor (if that's what you want to call it), would probably find the movie funny.<br /><br />When asked by my husband how this compared to other Pauly Shore films, I told him that Pauly shore films can't be rated on the same continuum as other movies because they're all so bad that they fail any sort of logistical form of expression.
