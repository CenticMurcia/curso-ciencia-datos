Bad editing, no style, no acting... just terrible.<br /><br />Was this made by a high school student? A bad high school student? This isn't bad in a good or ironic way, just bad as in you really don't need to waste your time with this.<br /><br />I find it odd that any IMDb users gave this a rating of more than one star.<br /><br />I watched this with two friends of mine and we all agreed on how crappy this movie is. We watched a bit of the special features, the gag reel. Also very bad! Not funny or amusing in any way. They were just takes of scenes they didn't use.<br /><br />The story seemed like a good one, actually I read about this movie and really looked forward to watching it but what a mistake that was.
