While the movie is pretty well acted, and the plot a great one, the film is simply too short. The plot runs with three different romances, deals wonderfully with unrequited love, and really shows how difficult it is for some men to deal with their homosexuality (though it seems that it was 'dealt' with just fine in the snow scene. I will never look at a snowball the same way again.) There is simply not enough time to really go into the characters or the plot, and when the movie was finished, I was wanting more. The characters are captivating and at the end of the ambush, when Yossi finally admits his love, I was crying. (Total of 2 tissues for the entire film) I wish there was some sort of prequel, since a sequel is def. out of the picture. Over all, it was well acted, well planned, but the execution could have used some work. I would still recommend it if this type of movie in general is your cup of tea. I especially loved all the Hebrew in it, and thought the subtitles were well done.
