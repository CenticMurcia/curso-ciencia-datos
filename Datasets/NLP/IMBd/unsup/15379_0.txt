All I have to say is, that this is the best movie I have seen, a movie that actually reflects on what happens when politics are involved. This has nothing to do with Mexican or American, it's all politics people. The same thing takes place here in the United States, but we just don't know it, if it happens in Mexico, it happens in the US too. If the government really wanted to stop drugs from hitting our streets, they have the resources to do so, but why won't they do anything. Why destroy what puts food on there table, if the government stopped everything we wouldn't have the need for so many jobs to supposedly contain the issue. The governments point of view is to create jobs and there you have it, they have to turn a blind eye to keep the unemployed line down. This is my thought!
