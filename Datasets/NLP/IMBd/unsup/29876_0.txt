There must be 10+ setups for each scene, where the lighting is perfect, as if it was a student filmmaker's first 35mm film. There's absolutely no style, and no thought of how the film would work as a whole. Most of the pickups are wasted coverage. There's hardly any genuine suspense, and the ending feels totally forced, as does the last tacked-on song.<br /><br />Why is it that most new filmmakers are too busy trying to prove they can run a film production, run a show just like the pros? Why can't they focus on the end point - how the film will affect those who witness it? This filmmaker makes absolutely no point in what he does, except to show how unskilled he is as a storyteller.<br /><br />Not to compare the two, since they are completely different types of films, but if you want to see real amazing direction, in which the story unfolds with tremendous, unsuspecting power, see THE PIANO. Jane Campion's direction could teach many that it's not the coverage, and multiple set-ups, but the performances, pacing and story that goes first.
