the royal rumble was pretty good. the cruiser weight match was nice which helms walked out as the winner. a nice 8out of 10 the Mickie James and Ashley match OK. a nice one won by Mickie James. 5out of 10 the royal rumble was nice and shocking. the winner was Rey mysterio a bit of a shock and sorta of un believable though. a nice 9out of 10 cena vs edge was an OK math i sorta knew that cena would win though but thats OK. 8 out 10 Kurt vs mark. pretty boring match but was well fought i knew that angle would win but that didn't ruin the match completely 5out of 10 all in the ppv was pretty good i wouldn't buy it though
