saw this on super channel one night when I couldn't sleep..and it had to be the biggest piece of garbage that I have EVER seen in my life. I kept trying to find a station playing the magic bullet infomercial rather than deal with this..but curiosity got the better of me.<br /><br />What in the world is an overweight bald Colin Farrell leading this trash for? The main actor looks like a bloated bull from night court who must have graduated from the tony Danza school of acting! Completely overshadowed by his lame Pornstache wearing sidekick who couldn't act any better..but certainly not worse.<br /><br />the opening sequence of this film was so over the top and ridiculous to the point of revulsion. They were going for shock value..instead it was laughable. ..without giving too much away...the abortion that they rip from her looks so fake you can practically read MATEL on the prop baby's behind! The climax of the movie involves a 3 person swat team!!?? are you kidding me? what you couldn't gather a group of friends, put them in some vests and do-rags and shoot? I've heard of low/no budget films but come on people..at least make an effort! it feels like the creators of this film had no pride in the half-ed good cop bad cop drama piece they were trying to make...and it shows! Bottomline..if one MUST watch this movie..such as someone has a shotgun pointed at your crotch and you must for the life of your genitals endure this...at least make a drinking game out of it...<br /><br />take a drink every time Rane cries *sip sip sip* note that his cry face is actually laying a foot long face. Take a sip anytime someone acts completely devoid of emotion when uttering their lines...sip sip..pass out.<br /><br />The only redeeming character in this whole drug infused fanfare was the lead bad guy...the talented and impeccably chiseled Neil Napier. The movie really pops when this actor comes on screen, and fizzles when hes not. Horrible movie overall.
