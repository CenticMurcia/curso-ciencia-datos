Hmmm,three guys,and two girls who, together, are all too stupid to figure out what to do when low on gas. Whoops,an old two lane road,a shabby farm,and a tank on empty.Can you see where this is headed?<br /><br />Usually, when a director subjects you to this kind of terrible acting,ridiculous story,and pathetic props, they at least throw in a good serving of flesh as an apology. <br /><br />Not only does this flick deny you that obligatory payment for your suffering, but to add insult to injury, you are actually teased several times throughout the picture,starting even before the title sequence,every time you think, "Well at least I'll see some skin for my trouble..." you are denied.Taking into consideration that this would have at least given you something to tell someone they may enjoy seeing, you'd think it would be there.<br /><br />Jenna Scott is attractive and if you like a tease show,she doesn't let you down.As for her acting, well a poor high school play can easily compete with most any portion of this film.
