For anyone that's ever seen this in its heavily edited US version, the original version is quite different, with lots of extra footage (some which is merely there, some which was cut for OBVIOUS reasons). The music is also quite different and more menacing and appropriate for a horror movie than the jazzy 80's-style soundtrack that's on the US cut. A bunch of tourists end up on a small island off the coast of Greece and encounter a being who is a crazed cannibal, and of course that's enough to ruin most folk's vacations. Most of these tourist types were just bumming around other islands until they ran across Tisa Farrow, who asked if she could bum a ride to this place as she spends her summers there caring for a young blind girl. It seems as though the young blind girl is the only survivor of some grisly attack not long ago, though, and she isn't doing very well, mentally. Most everyone else on the island seems to be gone as well. This has a decent air of foreboding and is quite nasty in parts, especially the parts that editors didn't want you to see back in the days when it was considered "tasteless" or "too brutal". Well, it's still that way but you can now view it in uncut form, thanks to the marvels (?) of DVD. I'm referring to the Shriek Show DVD too, Anthropophagus, I have a DVD of the US cut which is now going to be traded in. Gruesome and creepy stuff, and for those of you that like that, you will probably not be disappointed. 8 out of 10.
