"Cue Ball Cat" has the typical violent gags of these cartoons, however it is different because, for one thing, Tom is playing pool. Second, Jerry is living in the pool table. This cartoon focus mostly on the pool game and table, combined with Tom having his own way of fun with Jerry (obviously, much for Jerry's disgust). The result is minutes of fun, amusement, entertainment and slapstick gags.<br /><br />It's funny to see Tom and Jerry tormenting each other at times, but sometimes it can also be revolting. Anyway, it isn't surprising when it comes to Tom and Jerry, because they were always like that, right?<br /><br />Without being their finest, nevertheless this cartoon deserves a high rating from me. It doesn't disappoint me and it doesn't fail when it comes to the main ingredients of these animated shorts. It also has good artwork, despite the fact that its backgrounds are nothing special or exotic. Simplicity is the key-word.<br /><br />Overall, a different and simultaneously traditional Tom & Jerry's cartoon.
