This is a terrible, terrible movie the only redeeming factor is that there's titties in it but thats not much of one. Dean Cameron is really really ugly and who ever the other guy is, is really ugly too. A horrible, horrible mash of crappy music and neon color. Plain and simple a complete waste of time do not watch it. And the extra two stars are for the boobs. I just could not get past Dean Cameron!! And many of the one-liners come off cheesy however there are a few lines that are funny. Overall I couldn't get into the movie at all really and Dean Cameron seriously needs to shave or at least trim his crazy old man eyebrows.
