This was certainly not what I expected. having seen But I'm a Cheerleader, I thought it might me another film about some misguided bigots that think they can change a person's sexual orientation. It was much better than that.<br /><br />Judith Light was fantastic in a subtle and deep performance as the head of a house that gives those with addiction issues, and who also happen to be gay, a chance to find themselves. Yes, it is done from a Christian perspective, but it really seems to be Christian, and not the counter-programming or brainwashing we usually see.<br /><br />Mark (Chad Allen) has issues with drug and alcohol addiction and was sent to Genesis House after a suicide attempt.<br /><br />Gayle (Light) and her husband Ted (Stephen Lang) work to keep the wolf from the door as they help their residents find Jesus and themselves. There always seems to be something going on in their marriage. It really get heated as Scott (Robert Gant) and Mark become closer.<br /><br />We never really find out why Ted and Gayle's marriage is so strained. maybe it is because he is coming from an alcohol addiction background and is more accepting, while she is trying to make amends for driving away her son without really understanding that love exists in all forms, straight or gay, and that acceptance of others is the only truly Christian way of living.<br /><br />Judge ye not...<br /><br />There were some excellent performances in Robert Cary's film, along with beautiful New Mexico scenery and a great soundtrack.
