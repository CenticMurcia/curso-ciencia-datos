I can't decide if I was more disappointed in the acting, the casting, the script, or the directing. Let's begin with the audio... much of the whispered dialogue is way too soft to be understood, making it difficult to understand and appreciate... this happened time and time again. The plot... for someone knowing very little about the history, there was insufficient development to make it clearly understood how Lady Jane became queen. Character development... there was very little; there seemed to be a severe lack of depth in defining the characters' personalities and not surprisingly a great lack of ability on the part of the actors to bring out anything but the most superficial qualities of their characters. The acting seemed contrived (example is the scene when Jane is being spanked... the crying is so fake). The directing/production... it seems as if nearly every scene ends without a climax... the pauses beteween dialogue exchanges are awkward; the scenes seem to jump from one to the other without flow. The script is mundane, boring... an example would be the scene where Jane and her husband are breaking the glasses "it is done" over and over with no sense of build or progression or climax. Ah, the music... alternating between something of a 15th century feel and then 20th century romantic fluff. I can only say that I wish I had that 2 hours of my life back.
