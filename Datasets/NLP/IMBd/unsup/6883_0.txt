What is it with intelligent people? Nerds, for lack of a more colorful but expressive term, make for surprisingly interesting stories. There is something about watching people attain another league of mental skill that humbles the rest of us. Sure, there's the madness that sets in (ala "A Beautiful Mind"), but what about the quiet cheers brought about from a film like that Spelling Bee championship flick, "Spellbound"?<br /><br />"Wordplay" fits into that category of documentary film-making, as it further instills certain modesty into the lesser minds of us viewers. The film cleverly interweaves the tale of several competitors who rival one another at the twenty-eighth annual crossword puzzle tournament. As their stories develop, and we learn about these individuals, the actual match builds with surprising tension. These stories are told side-by-side interviews with other crossword enthusiasts such as former President Bill Clinton and TV's Jon Stewart who offer their own passionate opinions on the pleasure and overall importance of crossword puzzles. It's a fun, entertaining film that could easily have been otherwise.
