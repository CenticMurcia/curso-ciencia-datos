This movie was a great idea, but a brain-dead director, seriously low budget and acting worse than a high school play, seriously let this movie down. The special effects are a joke, and most of the time, I wasn't sure whether to either burst out into tears or laughter. Like the scence showing the crash air plane inside the hotel, does seriously look like the plane was put there, with fake foam scattered around it, than having crash into the building. In many scenes inside the resort which is bury beneath tons of snow, its well lit up, despite no power is on. The main actresses in this movie, obviously wasn't given the roles base on their acting, more like the size of their boobs. The Ice Queen is more scary than a broken down car, and she seriously reminds me out of those z-grade 1950's horror movies monsters or aliens.<br /><br />The Ice Queen at first shows up as a naked woman, in excellent condition, despite been bury under ice for thousands of years.<br /><br />I do believe high school students could be a far better job, than those behind making this stupid movie.<br /><br />The director seriously needs to go back to directors school, or find another job.
