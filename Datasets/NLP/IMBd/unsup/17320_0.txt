Horror fans beware of the Hewitts House Of Horrors. The 2006 Prequel makes its 2003 predecessor look like a breezy Sunday drive. Few movies today contain all the elements of the good old fashioned Late 70's Early 80's slasher genre. TCM - The Beginning gave us that and a whole new platform for other horror movies of today to live up to. Hostel took us to a place of no return TCM-The Beginning guarantee's you wont be coming back. People in the cinema were...erm...nailed to their chairs in what was unfolding on the screen. The ticketgirl was telling all who went to see it 'Good luck.' Never have I been in a cinema whilst watching a horror movie where not one person has a comment, this movie was pure astonishment followed by the occasional boo scare and gargled scream. Not for the faint hearted and far superior then any of the Texas Chainsaw's before it.
