No Spoilers (there are no actual spoilers anyways)<br /><br />I just saw this movie at a preview in New Delhi(PVR) i.e. on Wednesday (two days before the release) and i was really looking forward to this one. But as in the case of most Hindi movies ,I was disappointed yet again. The movie starts off real slow with unwanted sound effects (not even effects but those silly bangs and booms to give the audience a jolt)(a cheesy one includes sounds of a tiger roar now and then) which sounded inappropriate at times. Well, nothing i mean NOTHING happens till one and a half hour of the movie(what happens is the same old sightings of those zombies roaming in the house) and what all happens after that is silly (totally silly).<br /><br />But the thing that bothered me most is that there are numerous plot holes in the story. In other words, this movie is made of three things: Plot holes, Plot holes and Plot holes. The screenplay (or the story) is pathetic. Many things remain unexplained and its like they are showing whatever they want to without even thinking about it once.<br /><br />First i thought 'God, they have copied 'The Shining' because there was this boy who goes about the house in his small cycle and his dad is a writer and then when he starts seeing the ghosts i thought 'Okay its Sixth Sense now' but it was not even so. The Ending sequences are really stupid and seems like the director and the screenwriter are complete idiots to have thought of making such trash. The visual effects were as if they are of a B movie and were nowhere near visual effects (a kid could have done them up).<br /><br />SPOILERS HEREIN - Those who want to know what it is about<br /><br />The kid sees a zombie family and roams around the house speaking to them and playing with them. The zombie children live on a Banyan Tree (don't know if Bargat ka pedh is Banyan) and there's a small shed in the backyard of the house also. Some stupid scenes include a ball hanging in the air going here and there.<br /><br />So his parents(The incredibly talented Sushmita Sen and that guy from Satya) hire a 'Bai' who steals their stuff and is hit by one of the Ghosts (zombies)(the scene is hilarious). She tells the boy not to tell his parents about her and even threatens to kill him. When he tells his parents they become worried coz of the weird things their child is talking about but then the maid gets killed and all the stuff is found which she stole so Sush realizes her kid was indeed seeing the ghosts all the while.<br /><br />Also there is that funny short guy from Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon who features in all of Ramu's productions (He was also in Hungama). He seems to know the story behind the family in the house and jumps in front of Sush's car whenever she goes to the hospital (she is playing a doctor)<br /><br />Throughout the movie the kid keeps seeing the zombie family (which is not at all scary) and one night he and his parents go out for a movie, Sush's sis Radhika (played by Piya) is alone in the house and her boyfriend Murali comes to the house (Purab that channel [V] VJ) and starts playing with her in bed and then suddenly he disappears (The crappy part starts now).<br /><br />MAJOR SPOILERS<br /><br />Radhika starts searching him and then gets killed by the zombies. When Sush and people return they find Murali killed in bed and Radhika hanging by the tree. Even the husband gets killed and the boy is also smacked by the zombie family (who are now joined by Radhika and Murali zombies). Susmita comes to know about the tree through that mad guy (Small funny guy) and when she returns she sees her little boy lying on the floor and now her husband is also a zombie. She picks him up and runs for her life. Starts her car and goes round and round coz her neck is being held by her zombie hubby. Her car crashes into the tree and it goes on fire but Sush escapes out of the car and faints. The mad guy is very happy to see the tree in ashes and even pees in front of the tree but when he turns back the zombies are not gone. (Stupid no?).Sush wakes up in the hospital and finds her son okay and then when she picks him up the last shot of the scene shows the boy (her son) is also a zombie i.e. he died when the ghosts smacked him.<br /><br />All of these things are unexplained and are pretty dumb. Do not watch this movie and if you are very eager to see it... rent it on DVD or something. But i might add that the only thing worth watching is Susmita Sen and her acting (does a great job after Samay). But i sense that the director is good and should get another chance. Rating 2 out of 10
