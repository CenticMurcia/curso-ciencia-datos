As soon as i heard that they were bringing this film out i was expecting disappointment. I mainly agree with slyttle, who essentially slated it, because i have been a big fan of the series for a long time too. Where are the books we love? She talked about the lack of acting skill - true, the lack of good direction - also true, and the shoddy dialogue - which i thought was "meh".<br /><br />It's meant to be a mish mash of Angus, thongs and It's okay I'm wearing really big knickers but it's not. None of the characters were even slightly right. Jaz for example. Tom was not in the tiniest bit "hot" and in mine, and my mates' opinions Dave the Laugh was actually fitter than Robbie. "Wet Lindsey" was altered to "Slutty Lindsey" and i unashamedly was waiting the entire movie to get a glimpse of Sven who is a main in the books but is mentioned once in the film and i don't remember seeing him on screen.<br /><br />I do admit though that the soundtrack was not bad. In fact i might go as far as to say it was really good. I am essentially the key demographic and i disagree that it was completely without it's merits though. Some people around me found it funny whilst i found it kind of clich√© and unstimulating. There was no mention of her idiolect (the way she speaks) such as Kiwi-a-go-go land and it's like they just forgot that the books existed.<br /><br />Independently from the books (if I'd never read them) I'd say it's just another shoddy English Comedy that needed to be slightly more real and slightly more thought over. The characters need to be jiggled and the script needs to be fiddled with if they expect to bring out a sequel. I think that they were trying ti make it too much like Bend It Like Beckham, when really the books have enough merit to make their own, even better film.<br /><br />I essentially got the disappointment that i expected.
