Bad 08/15 story. <br /><br />They made the same failures like made in Final Fantasy(Spirits within). <br /><br />It's an standard, I would call it "american story". Not funny. And to technically without spirit.<br /><br />Probably I have watched to many Ghibli movies. And there is not one character I like. They are all stupid and to "designed".<br /><br />watch an good German made (animation-)movie watch "Obelix and Asterix in Amerika".<br /><br />Another tip: Watch this movie without sound, it's a really nice CG Animation without story.
