According to the DVD sleeve's synopsis, "An investigative reporter uncovers a plot against the District Attorney. The D.A. is about to present a case of white-collar crime against some well-respected Wall Street investors who wish to eliminate the D.A. before it can happen. The reporter races to prevent the murder before it can occur, and also help the D.A. in bringing those responsible to justice." But, nothing about this inappropriately titled film "races". The story proceeds in the dullest possible manner. Mediocrity runs a frightening level (and, this is crime drama, not a horror film). A couple of the kissing scenes are funny. Pat O'Brien (as Andy) sings a little. Please set your "so bad it's good" expectations on very low.<br /><br />* The World Gone Mad (4/15/33) Christy Cabanne ~ Pat O'Brien, Neil Hamilton, Evelyn Brent
