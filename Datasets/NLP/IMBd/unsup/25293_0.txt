Talky, predictable and totally unimaginative, this is not what we've come to expect from French "cineastes." Admittedly a tongue-in-cheek replica of Hollywood romantic comedies of yesteryear it's more like a quickie TV movie or a self-indulgent Off-Broadway playlet. Binoche and Reno are utterly wasted as they talk, talk, talk their night away. The best that can be said is that it's a great commercial for Hilton Hotels, Air France and Aeroports de Paris, all of which, if they paid for the exposure, got their Euro's worth. Most moviegoers, on the other hand, are not going to feel the same way.
