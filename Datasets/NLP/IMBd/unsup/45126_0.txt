This movie sucks. The plot is not that bad, I guess, but the acting and action scenes are bad. The movie is about some kids whose parents died, and then they are trained to be elite soldiers. The film begins with the bad guy driving around in a truck at night. Then it suddenly goes to the opening credits, and we see the "Elite" soldiers. They are chasing some guys because they apparently have a code that they need to stop a missile from launching. Of course they succeed in stopping the missile, just 1 second before it would be launched.<br /><br />And I love all the coincidences in this movie. Like in the beginning, when the bad guys escape, but then suddenly a truck crashes into them. Or when the Elite see the car of the bad guys, lying on a train railway, and say "They might still be alive", but then a train arrives and drives over the car, just classic.<br /><br />3/10
