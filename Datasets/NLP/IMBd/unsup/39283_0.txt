This movie proves my point that Greta Garbo was one of the smartest movie stars to ever live - Mae West, unlike Garbo should have wisely retired from films after her heyday in the 1930s.<br /><br />Instead, West finished her career with this lousy flick.<br /><br />Why do so many actors and actresses give in the temptation of making that one more film? For example - Why did Bette Davis not end with "Whales of August" - her SECOND to last film - instead of the terrible "Wicked Stepmother"? And likewise, why didn't Mae West end her career with "My Little Chickadee" instead of this bit of celluloid trash?<br /><br />"Sextette" might be fun to watch on a boring, rainy day when you are home sick from school or work and want to see how many guest stars you can identify - or if you don't want to take a sleeping pill when you have insomnia - otherwise forget it!
