Why are British films so over rated? This film (which may be obscure to most people outside the u.k) is considered a classic by the British public and some critics. I was looking forward to watching it, even though I have grown wary of British films with the 'classic' tag attached. Probably 90% of these films I have found to be over rated and inferior to their Hollywood equivalents. Now don't get me wrong, I am not a big fan of Hollywood either, but compared to British films, they are generally much more entertaining and less self conscious. Anyway getting back to 'Genevieve', I found the experience of watching this almost painful. For a supposed comedy it is very unfunny. The Oscar winning(!) harmonica score is annoying and so are the performances by the lead actors. This film tries so hard for the whimsy of, for example the ealing comedies but fails. One thing that really got on my nerves was the constant laughter of the two male competitors, which makes them sound like complete morons. I think the British are very biased when it comes to their own films. Thats the only explanation for immature and extremely CHEESY films like this getting the classic status.
