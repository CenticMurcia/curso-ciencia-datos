When a former (?) agent in a supersecret government agency is on holiday with his son in Israel, a "terrorist" attack separates the father, Peter, from his son, Robin. Peter apparently dies, and the boy is whisked to "safety" by Peter's best friend, and government agency man.<br /><br />Peter isn't really killed (though his son is made to believe so) and he both takes some vengeance on almost being killed by wounding his former friend, and tries to reunite with his son. The following may contain spoilers.<br /><br />Robin, as it happens, has a powerhouse of psychic abilities. This was never hinted at before the attack, which makes it odd that the action was even staged. However, Robin is taken to a facility where agency folk work at developing his powers. (A little of this is akin to a setup in Firestarter, but that film spends more time on the testing than this).<br /><br />Robin is becoming increasingly powerful, and increasingly dangerous.<br /><br />In the meantime, a young girl, Gilliam, starts developing her own psychic abilities, particularly psychometry. She demonstrates this in class, and eventually is referred to an institute for "gifted" youngsters, actually a front for the agency that has Robin. As her powers develop, she shares visions from Robin and others that make her a tad unstable.<br /><br />In the meantime, Peter learns of her, and staying literally a step ahead of the secret agency, rescues her from the institute, inadvertently killing his newly found lover in the process (life has been unkind to Peter).<br /><br />Robin is getting so restless that he's allowed a night "on the town," where he both gets increasingly insecure and sees Arab tourists, and psychokinetically causes a machine malfunction that kills or seriously injures them. <br /><br />Peter and Gilliam track Robin to an estate, with high security grounds, where, inside, Robin detects Gilliam's presence in the yard, and flips out, thinking that she's to replace him, and he's to be killed. So he kills his mentor and bed partner by psychokinetically spinning her to death as if she became a centrifuge.<br /><br />The violence of his actions cause Gillism to freak out, and her screams alert the security forces that capture her and Peter. Peter finally is allowed to see his son, who has in the meantime killed a number of agency people by hurling them away psychokinetically.<br /><br />If Robin recognizes his father as a loving family member, it isn't evident. He leaps at Peter, the two go through a window, and despite Peter's best efforts at trying to rescue his son, the two fall to their death, one by one. Life definitely hasn't been kind to Peter.<br /><br />Major Spoiler Alert! As he lay dying, Robin apparently passes something -- his power? A compulsion? no matter -- to Gilliam. With everybody dead but Peter's former friend and Gilliam, she awakens to find him trying to soft-soap recruiting her. She takes revenge, destroying him psychokinetically.<br /><br />End of film!<br /><br />The film built up a fairly complex, interwoven story, but left Gilliam in limbo. What happens next? Does she get away? Does she hook up with her globetrotting mother? Are there other agency types who will capture her or die trying? The film would have been much better without these many loose ends.
