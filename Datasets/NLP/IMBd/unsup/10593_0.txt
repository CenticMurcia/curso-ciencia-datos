Henenlotter's long-awaited (no, really!) follow-up to the 1982 classic BASKET CASE received mixed reactions among horror/gore fanatics everywhere. Many people hated this movie, because they felt the big budget and intentional laughs ruined the campy spirit of the original. Others loved BASKET CASE 2, because they just couldn't get enough of that cute little monstrosity Belial Bradley. I happen to be of the latter category.<br /><br />BC2 picks up right where the original left off: hanging from the sign of the Hotel Broslin. The twins survive the fall and are hospitalized, and their existence becomes the most hyped-up story in the media. Seeking refuge from the cruel outside world, our heroes end up becoming the newest addition to Granny Ruth's house of "unique individuals", a place where they are kept safely sheltered and their whereabouts remain a secret to the public. Oh yeah, the house is also chock full of dozens of friendly freaks, including a female version of Belial named Eve.<br /><br />This entry certainly has a much different feel than the original BASKET CASE, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The story is clever and stays true to the Bradley history as explained in the first movie. The special effects and make-up are simply fantastic--Belial looks more sinister than ever! Also, added to the parade of freakish monsters and gory murders is a delicately interwoven, good-natured sense of humor that somehow fits well with the rest of the film. Kudos to Frank Henenlotter, and kudos to the rest of the cast and crew, who all did an outstanding job.
