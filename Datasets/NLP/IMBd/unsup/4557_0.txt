Over the years, I have listened to a lot of bands that I have claimed to be my "favorite" band. Lately, though, my attention has been turned toward an Illinois band- Linkin Park.<br /><br />Now, I admit it, Linkin Park isn't necessarily the most wholesome band listen to; with lyrics like "I've lied to you the same way I always do" (Pushing Me Away) and "You love the things I say I'll do- the way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you..." (Points of Authority), many people have dismissed LP as just another angst-laden band who will never make a real impact. Well, what about Runaway, with its lyrics like "I want to know the truth instead of wondering why..." and With You, which proclaims "The sound of your voice brings up all my memories, even if you're not with me I'm with you..."? <br /><br />Now for the actual review: Linkin Park has produced a DVD of one of their concert performances. They sing some of their hit songs from Hybrid Theory, like Crawling, In the End, and Papercut. The extras are cool, as they contain behind-the-scenes footage and more concert stuff not on the first DVD.<br /><br />I am proud to say that I am a fan of Linkin Park and will forever be.<br /><br />Signing off, Andy Olson
