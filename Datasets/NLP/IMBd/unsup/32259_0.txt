This film is a nothing more than series of rip off moments from other, better films. It's a mash of Predator, Aliens, Terminator 2, Species, amongst others. To be fair it doesn't try to hide it's 'influences', but when they are performed so badly it's hard to forgive. The actors all try to keep a straight face, especially Mark Dacascos. It's a shame the rest of the crew didn't seem to be bothered about making a good movie. Obviously the budget was low, so low the studio couldn't afford an original screenplay. Watch only for the unintentional comedy, such as the laughable helicopter crash and the blatant theft of an entire scene from Terminator 2!!
