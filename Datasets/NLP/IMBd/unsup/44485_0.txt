Anybody else think this is a total rip off!? Gus Van Sant did it way better! <br /><br />Daft Punk did almost exact shots! Who does that? Desert scenes. Slowly walking in the desert. Fatigued. Giving up. Death. The only different was that in Gerry, they were humans. I love Daft Punk, and I really liked the last burning scene, however, it was totally a rip off. Great songs too, but too similar to call an original movie. <br /><br />At least cite Gus Van Sant's work.<br /><br />Human After All.<br /><br />-Raymond
