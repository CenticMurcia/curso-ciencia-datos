Johnny Depp is pretty nice, as one might expect, in fact all the cast is pretty nice. The script could have been made into something really interesting, but wasn't. The director did a really worthless job. Or the producer, I can't tell. There's some scenes and some music in some scenes that'll really going to make you laugh.. Crying "OMG IT'S SO BAD" Don't pay to see this B-movie. We, my friend and I basically figured out the whole movie out after 15-20 minutes.. But we said to ourselves "no this cant be it, it cant be that cheesy" .. Guess what .. it is .. Do yourself a favour and avoid the most predictable movie this year.
