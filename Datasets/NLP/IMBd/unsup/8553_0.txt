i know a lot of people say that this movie was great and all that. Maybe it is just me but after i watched the film i felt unclean and distressed. The whole movie was a mess of unbelievable sub plots mixed within a ninety minute film. There are only two parts i found funny and actually laughed out loud. The problem i was dealing with was the direction of the whole puzzling movie. Brad Pitt s character who was the most outstanding character and the star of the film gets shot in the head and dies after one hour... after that, i lost every interest of the film. Too much going on and the ending was very inconclusive. There are one or two good points about the film is the acting. Acting was well done. The character use, well, maybe too much character use making the whole film confusing. And it was a funny in some occasions. I know the Coen brothers can do much better than this. I loved their film No country for Old Men and Burn After Reading was a huge letdown for me.
