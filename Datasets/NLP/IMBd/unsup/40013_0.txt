24 Redemption is truly awful. <br /><br />Once more I am stunned that the users here, got so lousy taste. You actually think this is a great movie?? Oh my god!! <br /><br />Bad script, no budget = no action, bad acting all around. And the real time really limits the ability to tell a credible story. General Juma is not stopped, the political bad-guys in Washington are not stopped. Jacks surrender to the us-government is ridiculous and unbelievable. That he would give up so easily after being a fugitive for more than a year. Nothing is really explained. And nothing in the story seems related to season 7, witch makes this low-budget crap pointless and unnecessary. <br /><br />If you are a fan of the series, pretend like this TV-movie was never made.
