I see people waxing so enthusiastic about it, apparently I am really stupid eh what?<br /><br />Anyway, I've never before gone through the plot in one of my IMDb reviews but here I will give it a go cause I really am not sure what I just saw... so here's what I thought I saw:<br /><br />there is this cute lovable guy he's got this annoying girlfriend who would drive a saint away, she's very jealous and her idea is that he must be sick of her cause who wouldn't be with her "boring face" and in fact, she's right about this. he can't get it up until, under her direct orders, he fantasizes about this girl they saw earlier in the day at which point he does just fine. so she becomes angry, naturally. then she runs out to the plastic surgeon wanting a new face which will take 6 months to heal during which time she abandons the hot sweet as pie boy. <br /><br />while she's gone the girl working at this cafe along with just about every other girl in the universe, makes a play for him but he can't forget his bitchy annoying girlfriend he still loves for some inexplicable reason. ... um. . . eventually the girl at the cafe lucks out for some inexplicable reason, I mean basically this guy is the male equivalent of "there's something about mary"'s mary, he responds to anyone pathetic and creepy who latches onto him. by this time it's evident he has a weakness for utterly annoying women, jealous and insecure and prone to violence and to making embarrassing scenes. <br /><br />OK really my comprehension of the film totally broke down when it got to the point that I didn't know whether it was the cafe girl or the original girl post surgery who was making his life miserable at about midpoint... sigh... all the while I just wanted him for myself to take him away from this witchy world in which these horrible women were there to make him so unhappy. . . . <br /><br />at one point (forgive my non chron account) he even agrees to see this one girl who is not very pretty and who kind of masochistically insists on making it very clear that he doesn't really like her, in spite of which though of course because there is something seriously wrong with this guy he's willing to be with her...in fact when she's shooting a gun it really makes him think she looks "awesome" OK sure why not, look on the bright side why don't you. until she masochistically plays a game in which she leaves him behind... um. . . so at least she doesn't get rejected. OK, that sort of makes sense, why not? for him anyway, st. stupid cute guy... we can give him some credit at this point for not running after her. good boy!<br /><br />so then this horrible doctor who operated on the original horrible girlfriend decides the thing to do is to have our now thoroughly destroyed leading man who is so adorable and hot and long suffering undergo the knife as well, so they can be even... and . . . so then all these not by any means terrible looking but nowhere near as darling as the star of the picture guys make the scene, by this time I'm really quite honestly watching at +1 speed at which I can still read the subtitles. . . but I don't have to be stuck watching this ridiculous film with its deep implications... for quite so long. <br /><br />when the girl shows up with her old face pasted over her new one, I"m confused as to whether this is cafe girl or original girl... OK maybe Asian womens' faces don't make as strong an impression on me as they might .... but it seemed to me that it was in fact the cafe girl who stole the photo and cut it out and so would be wearing it... unless somehow it got into the hands of the surgery gal.<br /><br />and so it seemed to me that it was cafe girl at the denouement... when boy gets we guess killed, or at least properly mangled, whatever he looked like at the end of the movie...he certainly looks worse off after his big car accident. and there is one of those corny things where the beginning is the same as the end it's recursive and... as you see people on IMDb are puzzling over how to make sense out of that...I neglected to mention the beginning though, but it must be the key to the whole thing eh what? I could had a v8!<br /><br />mainly I just ... was very frustrated that such a nice guy was with such bitches the whole way through... honestly... that;'s about all I got out of this film.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the same director's "The Isle" though!<br /><br />I hope that hot doll face makes lots more movies though, he was awesome... better still why doesn't he just come to America and sweep me off my feet. the end!
