Maybe Adrian is great on Entourage, but I don't see why this movie itself isn't getting worse star ratings. This is truly an awful movie, worthy of a midnight run on Lifetime network.<br /><br />The two main characters are definitely very attractive and their acting skills are not terrible. Leila was gorgeous and didn't overdo her character, which was a relief. Adrian's character, however, was utterly unlikeable. Clingy, whiny, codependent, desperate, then violent and completely mentally unstable. I know that was the point of the movie, to showcase this behavior, but no one in their right minds would put up with that kind of partner.<br /><br />Leila seemed so passive for someone who was clearly educated, from a stable family, and independent. She let this stranger (they only knew each other for a short time) knock her up, move in with her, and accepted his proposal in what was probably only several months' time. Ridiculous.<br /><br />I also have many qualms with the way this movie was cut -- the weird "is it a dream, or is it reality" cuts were really tiring, annoying, and frustrating. They were unnecessary, and were used way too much throughout the movie, making it choppy and inconsistent.<br /><br />The therapist character was also incredibly annoying, that that she was completely unemotional and subdued the whole time, even when Adrian's character attempted to murder her. He strangled her to the point of her losing consciousness, and what does she do? Call the cops? No! She follows him back to the couple's home and asks him not to murder his girlfriend, who he's tied up and is ready to kill.<br /><br />The ending was completely absurd, too. I won't give it away, but it is so out there that this whole movie might as well have taken place on a different planet.<br /><br />I watched this movie for a college Psychology class, and the whole class just looked around at each other, saying, "What the hell just happened?" and "This was the worst movie ever." I have to agree. I have never seen such a ridiculous movie before, and it shocks me that it has gotten as many stars as it has on IMDb.
