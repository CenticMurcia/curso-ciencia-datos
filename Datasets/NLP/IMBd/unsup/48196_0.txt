I think this movie was really bad, but I liked seeing it because it was shot in a house I owned in Ocean City New Jersey. The whole thing was done in six weeks during the summer when the town was very crowded. They blocked off the street and shot all day and through the evening. It was a great process to watch. The original title "Down the Shore" was considered but changed because that is an expression that is used only by the people in the Philadelphia area. Other locations were used that showed amusements and rides that are not in Ocean City. Some were done in Wildwood New Jersey about 25 miles away. It also looked like three different houses were used. My house had two small apartments and one large unit above. All the interior shots were done in my house and some of the outside shots were done using the fronts of other houses in town. I thought that was done very well and it looked convincing. PJ Smith
