When I enjoy a new show for a season or two but then find it growing stale or repetitive or degenerating into self-parody, prompting me to stop planning to see it and eventually to turn it off when I happen across it accidentally, that's a show that I will give a vote of 3 and then write a comment explaining that I'm not panning the entire run of the show but only the later seasons. Unfortunately, in this case, the 'earlier seasons' means the first half of the first season, so I'm only giving it a 2. It wasn't that I didn't think it was funny, it was more that I could tell most of what would happen each week just by watching the commercials. And because the story lines are convoluted and intertwined, I can't just watch it once in a while and enjoy it either.
