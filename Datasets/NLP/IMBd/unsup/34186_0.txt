I normally wouldn't even write about a movie I didn't like, but this missed the boat in so many respects, leaving me feeling so disappointed, that I feel compelled to share my thoughts. This film fell down in nearly every respect. What began as a potentially funny hook (the hit man/movie buff) became a crutch used to artificially move the story along. The music was trivial and, at times, laughable. The editor didn't seem to even understand the point of the movie and in a rush to just end it as the sound at FADE OUT (emblematic of the overall editing problem) just dropped as if the editor just couldn't wait to see the thing end. I even have to wonder if the director understood what the movie was about, particularly distressing in this case as the director wrote the script! Though I'm not a big fan of either Christian Slater or Richard Dreyfus, I have to say that they did their jobs and were just fine...which didn't matter because there was no real movie for them to act in.<br /><br />Worst moments: the fairly direct rip-off of Pulp Fiction by wrapping back around from beginning to end with two somewhat comical criminals having a discussion in a diner, and Tim Allen trying to play the part of the producer listening to a pitch while having no timing for such dialog.<br /><br />Too bad, I was hoping for at least something that would have me leaving the theatre chuckling.
