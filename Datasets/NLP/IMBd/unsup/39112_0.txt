Well...It has past eleven years since this movie was made and I decided to comment it now. Why? I have no idea. I'll start from the grade that I gave this movie- it was four, but maybe if this would year '90 the grade would be much higher. Now the time has past and Van Damme has lost his magical macho muscle. The movie was actually quite good for it's time, it was very dark like a real thriller. This is one of those kind of movies that give you the very sad situation and then very happy ending.The film itself is about a canadian police officer who is put in jail as an undercover cop to investigate the murders of few locals. In jail he meets his old friend (the bad guy) who he battles to the end. Overall it wasn't very bad movie even watching it eleven years later.
