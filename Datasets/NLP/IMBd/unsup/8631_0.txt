This is was a Great movie the songs were Little ehh but the story line and the twists were just remarkable... I loved the twist at the almost end made it more dark.I also love the fact that Cinderella Got the princes love more harder then before not just cause of her looks and everything but cause of more she had to fight for love it was more realistic then a girl going to the ball and thats it.They showed more of the prince too we didn't really know him before and he talked a lot more which made it better.The 2nd movie was horrible made no sense and was not interesting to watch and way off story line. This one made more sense lovely I am actually 14 and i love this movie any Disney movie I love but this one was one of the best sequel's they have made from Disney. Anyways yeah you should see this at least once
