This show is without a doubt the worst and driest sitcom I've seen in years. Of the episodes I've waited through to actually watch something good, I only laughed or snickered like once or twice of which none of them were from Christine. The only time I laugh is when Matt is making fun of his ridiculous sister or someone else is saying how lame she truly is.<br /><br />And to make matters worse, with Christine's new season hysterical shows like Rules of Engagement and Big Bang Theory are on the chopping block to bring her back.<br /><br />So to make a long story short, Christine is just plain pathetic. I'd give her no stars if I could but I guess one will have to do.
