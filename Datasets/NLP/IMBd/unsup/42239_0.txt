the only thing to say about this movie is.... . good sex scenes and some where a little yuck when she f**k the dude with her high-heel shoe. . good action scenerio.<br /><br />and on the other hand.. . bad movie, script, plot, and dialogue. . bad acting . just plain out bad because the movie is too slow and it has entirely too much talking just like, "Hannibal" and it's just a under estimated, bad sexual BASIC INSTINCT to me.<br /><br />i rate this one a...<br /><br />2 of of 5 (due to the lame sexuality and movie.. period.)
