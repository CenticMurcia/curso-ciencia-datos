Perhaps I am bit a bit biased considering I have never found host Ellen DeGeneres all that funny and that none of the five films nominated for Best Picture (The Departed, Babel, Letters from Iwo Jima, Little Miss Sunshine, and The Queen) blew me away, but for whatever reason, the Academy Awards this year were, well, pretty terrible. While I have always loved watching the Academy Awards, there are very few times where I have actually found them memorable, or at least worthy of the hype. This year was no different. In fact, this will probably go down in history as more of a disaster than anything else. I doubt five years from now, there will be clips of this year's presentation floating around since there were no memorable moments at all to be found here other than Martin Scorsese winning his Oscar for Best Director. The rest of the show, I actually felt embarrassed for those in attendance. Ellen DeGeneres jokes fell flat 95% of the time, The acceptance speeches were blah as always, and worst of all, Will Ferrell's musical number was one of the unfunniest moments in the history of television and that's coming from a Ferrell fan. Film historians can go ahead and forget about this one. 3/10
