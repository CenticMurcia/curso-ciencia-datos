This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad dialogue, overacting by the leads and a ridiculous story make for a cable TV movie. It wouldn't have made any money theatrically. The ending seemed forced and contrite. The movie doesn't explain why Freddy is afraid of heights or why he lied to Carmen when they first met. This movie has many negative stereotypes, not only of African-Americans but of music industry people, especially the Hip-Hop music world. Greed isn't foremost in every music mogul's mind. I don't understand the title change. The original title of "Never 2 Big" made more sense. Freddy's little catchphrase was only used a couple of times in the movie.
