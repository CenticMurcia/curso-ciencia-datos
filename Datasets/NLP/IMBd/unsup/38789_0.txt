I just could not believe that Shannon Doherty or any young woman would carry on about William Devane. I know your lead to believe she had daddy issues, but I didn't get it. Maybe if she had a bunch or rats at her place like the movie 'Willard' I'd get it. The acting is decent enough though the love scenes were sort of gross. I liked William Devane in 'Marathon Man' & 'Testament', but come on now! Basically it's like like Fatal Attraction, or Play Misty For Me if you just make it young girl, older guy. The way she keeps trying and trying to win Devane's heart is all too much. I always liked Shannon from her Beverly Hills, 90210 days and felt the show sunk down when she left, I thought she'd make more of her career afterwords, but then again, who on that show did?
