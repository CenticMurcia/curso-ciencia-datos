I love this movie and i can't wait for everyone to see it! I think its funny and the Michalka sisters do an awesome job playing sisters! I would most definitely give this movie a 10 because of its awesome performance and its amazing genre. Heck, I'd give this movie a thousand and one. I'd love to watch it over and over again forever. I couldn't believe how good it was. I hope everyone likes and enjoys it just as much as I did because I know it was good and it deserves a lot of credit. Man, this movie was amazing. All I have to say is I loved it all of the way. If anyone doesn't like this movie, they don't have good taste at all.
