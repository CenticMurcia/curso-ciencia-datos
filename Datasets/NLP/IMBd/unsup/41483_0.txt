there are not too many good things about this horror movie.one good thing is the performance of Larry drake as the psycho.he really puts his heart into the performance.you can tell he really has fun with the role.the only other good thing is that in the last 25 minutes or so,the movie starts to get good.the last 15 minutes in particular are really good,and there is one scene near the end which is priceless.unfortunately the first 70+ minutes are pretty lame.there really aren't enough positives are enough to make the movie worth watching.that's my opinion. anyway,this movie is part of the Twisted Terror Collection also sold in a box set also entitled The Twisted Terror Collection.there are 5 other horror movies contained in the set.as for this movie itself,i'm afraid it's terminal and the prognosis is not good. 2/10
