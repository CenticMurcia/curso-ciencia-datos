Varla Jean has been to Detroit for several venues. I am one of her most biggest fans!!! She was back in Detroit, March '03, for a venue that I attended. I remember her "mentioning" filming a movie. Last evening I was looking for something really special to veiw, thats when I stumbled on to her latest film, "Girls Will be Girls". I grabbed the DVD AND a can of "Spray Cheese" and off I went to watch this girl in action. She IS astounding!!! I hope you get the chance to see it and enjoy it as much as I did! BRAVO VARLA!!!! a perfect 10!!!! She also has a few CD's out and are quite entertaining. I was hoping that she would be in town again this year, but I haven't heard. Varla, if you are reading this - it's "Lumpy" the mechanic - Do you remember me? Lot's of Love -Lumpy
