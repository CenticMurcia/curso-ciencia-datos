Sticking Robert DeNiro in your movie almost assures you good reviews. Sticking Sean Connery only increases that. So when all of them join with David Mamet and Brian DePalma,the result can be nothing short of explosive.<br /><br />Kevin Costner plays a naive cop put on a mission to arrest Al Capone (DeNiro). Right from the beginning, this movie is a thrill ride. DeNiro is superb as Capone, Costner is good as Elliot Ness,and Andy Garcia is entertaining as a sure-shot young Italian. But the real gem here is Connery,in an Oscar-winning performance.Connery plays an Irish cop who joins up with Ness. He plays the role very well,and deserved his Oscar.Also joining the group is Charles Martin Smith,as a accountant who shows a deft knack for shooting at stuff.<br /><br />However,that's not to say that the movie is without flaws.Some scenes are very unbelievable (especially the one where Connery meets his demise) and some parts (especially at the beginning) seem to go on too long. This,however,does not stop this movie from being fun. 8.5/10
