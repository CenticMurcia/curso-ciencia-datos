Something bothered me about this film, it's all pieced together from other Corman movies. I guess you could call it a new movie... but I wouldn't. Using the "amazing" Blue Screen technology, Corman takes you through a pointless adventure with a Soap Opera budget. This IS the worst movie ever. I usually enjoy bad movies, but this goes far beyond that- NOT at all enjoyable. There's a villain that lives in a magic videotape that is trying to steal every shade of color. He has a castle that looks like spinning umbrella. This is so stupid... believe me. Even a 2 year old should not see this movie, it would be child abuse. I tried to burn the videotape after watching it, but it rejected fire. Save yourself the effort and just rent Battle Beyond the Stars. That way, you'll see all of the "good" footage that was used in this movie.
