GhostWatcher is a great horror film. It's very scary, with alot of good "jumps" and goosebump moments. It's an "edge of your seat" movie. The story is intelligent and well thought-out. All three actresses deliver terrific performances. This is the first film for aspiring writer/director David A. Cross, and he's done a fantastic job. The movie has only been in limited release (a few horror fests, some individual showings at area movie theatres)...I'd love to see it released on DVD & video, so more people can experience it. If you love scary movies, you'll love GhostWatcher.
