The Serbian version of Scarface. The translation is accurate most of the time, however understanding the language definitely makes for a more live presentation. In my opinion it suffers somewhat from a low budget yet still manages to impress with screenplay and the gruesome reality it shows. Ulike Scarface many stories such as this one unfolded amongst Serbian youth. Even today the sings of war haven't vanished. Present is the poverty driven human mind on the look out for a better tomorrow. The same state of mind that influenced this picture is still visible on our streets. As time passes by the situation improves but our youth still grow up in ghettos, wanting out of the trap. Simply put it is a masterpiece.
