This is an enjoyable Belgian TV series. I have watched most of the episodes on the DVD box sets available. The DVDs have no English subtitles, so you need to be able to speak Dutch to understand them. OK, its not great art, and doesn't have the high production values of American or British crime series e.g. CSI or Midsomer Murders but the show has an interesting, likable set of characters who come and go over the course of the different years, moments of charming humour and is very watchable. A good, old fashioned police drama which has provided me with hours of viewing pleasure. By the way, I have also seen Sedes en Belli and Witse, which are entertaining too. Thank you TV1.
