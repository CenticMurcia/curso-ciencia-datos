I saw this "film" the first time when I was a teenager, late at night, on broadcast television. Wow, wow, wow!! Susan George was the ideal older woman to a 70s-era kid: sun-bleached blonde, jiggling halter top, and loose! Peter Fonda was uber-cool, and we all aspired to his Ã©lan. The ending was an object lesson on the upper limit of "too cool", so we tempered our stride.<br /><br />But then a funny thing happened. I grew older. I learned to appreciate dialogue in movies. I learned that "cool" doesn't pay bills, and that there's a lot of women whose entire net worth is bottled up inside their jiggling halter top.<br /><br />I saw this again a few weeks ago on a satellite movie station, on a Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />Teenagers are idiots. I can say this unequivocally because I liked this movie when I was a teenager. The only reason I'm grading this 4/10 is because I'm taking the average of my two ratings. It got 10 stars a few decades ago. Do the math.
