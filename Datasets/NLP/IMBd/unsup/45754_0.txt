Think "Silence of the Lambs" meets "Strangeland" with just about every clich√© you can possibly include to make THE most typical psychological thriller ever. "Untraceable" is another slick suspense yarn, once again, pitting some determined FBI agents against a methodical, overly intelligent, and ultra-crafty serial killer who inexplicably prolongs his victims suffering over the World Wide Web. This, of course, catches the attention of a some FBI internet specialists who realize the mass publicity is actually causing the captive's deaths. The victims are hooked up to various apparatuses - one guy is pumped full of blood thinner until he bleeds to death, another is scorched with heat-lamps - all hooked up to the web with the equipment increasing with the view toll... As one can only expect from internet users, 'the snuff show' sees a lot of hits. So, without spoiling too much, the killer is some computer nerd whose dad committed suicide and he's severely irked about it. Somehow, he is able to kidnap several FBI agents, stream his vids live over the interweb and possibly rank as one of THE most uninteresting and flat-out DULLEST villains I have seen in a while. The death scenes are much too elaborate - (almost like a "Saw" movie), every suspense sequence is clouded by an intolerable amount of implausibility, and the conclusion is one of the most dissatisfying 'climaxes' I can recall... Avoid "Untraceable"...
