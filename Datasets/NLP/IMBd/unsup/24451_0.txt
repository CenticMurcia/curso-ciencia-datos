The acting is just not worth writing about, the "comedy" - slapstick, pace - really slow, seriously, nothing in this movie could make you laugh if you were a sensible, level headed person.<br /><br />It is supposed to be "inspired" by a really old classic - It's a Mad, mad, mad, mad world and a very poor adaptation, I should say. The original movie, for those of you who have not had an opportunity to see it, is a wonderful light comedy, without any of the slapstick feel to it. The final sequence keeps you rolling on the floor for hours! This movie is NOTHING as compared to the original. Also, there is NOTHING original about this movie as well. Javed Jaffrey's character is another sloppy attempt to imitate Mr.Bean and does not induce any laughter whatsoever. <br /><br />Please save yourself and your money and don't watch this movie!
