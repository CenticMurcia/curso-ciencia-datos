This movie had no redeeming factors except it well killed a boring afternoon. The Minotaur looked silly more like a sick milk cow with a over bite. The acting was flat no feeling even when Todd's character tried to seduce his sister, sick and really had nothing to do with the movie. The"HERO" Theo acted more lick a spoiled brat and by the end you were hoping he would be eaten. The "MUTE" girl was the only one I was glad survived to the end. Plus the adaption of the myth behind this movie was badly done. Lots of blood splatters I will give that but if you have $5 to rent a movie by-pass this one unless you are really bored.
