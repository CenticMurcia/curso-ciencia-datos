When I saw the DVD box it came in, I was excited at the plot summary. However, it did not pan out the way the summary said it would. The acting was stilted at best, costuming trite, music is not even there. As I read the credits at the end, I was surprised there were 8 or so songs - none recognizable. At one time, there was a band playing at a party, but no sound came out. Same for the bongos later. Bad Trip is aptly named; that's how you feel when it finally ends. Obviously, this film was a first for everyone involved. Not a horror film, and not a biker film either - not sure where it fits as to genre but would suggest somewhere around 3rd grade elementary school comedy. I wish I could get my 85 minutes back that I spent watching this wasteland of film and plastic.
