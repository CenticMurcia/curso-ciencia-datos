LisaGay captured the spirit and soul of this incredible woman. I was moved to tears more than once and after viewing it you can say that she lived so many lives, and empowered people of all races and creeds to do the same.<br /><br />I only hope within my lifetime that her visions are realized, for this is a movie I would love for my future children to see to realize that you cannot except hatred, you must fight to change it with love.<br /><br />I know as a person of Irish heritage I cannot possibly know the struggles she had to endure, but I know my world is a better place because of her bravery both on and off screen.<br /><br />Bless you, Beah.
