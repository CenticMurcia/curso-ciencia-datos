As far as I am concern this must be one of the worst film I ever saw. For instance the directing, editing and camera work really got on my nerve. I was constantly under the impression of watching a very annoying music video-clip. I wasn't impressed by the performances either, especially Chuck Norris who reminds us that he just can't act and when he tries, it's more laughable than anything else. Even Bernie Kopell's acting job is left to be desired. Some people might ask what was I expecting from a direct-to-video Chuck Norris flick. The answer to this is "not much" and even then I was seriously irritated by this movie. I mean come on even Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagall are smart enough to stay away from delivering bad one liner anymore. And when they do, they are definitively more convincing than our friend Chuck.<br /><br />The only good thing that I can say about this film is that it's entertaining. Never for the good reasons, but entertaining none-the-less. Especially if you are among friends and drunk.
