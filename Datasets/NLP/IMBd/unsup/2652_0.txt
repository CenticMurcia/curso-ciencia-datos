The best thing about the 2007 Beowolf is the performances and dialog appropriate to the story and setting. The second best thing was the background scenery. Where the movie fails is with its silly looking special effects which were NOT enhanced by the awful camera work and excessive zoom-lens jump-about. Also, I thought the story was weakened by a lack of camaraderie among the men.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is a true beauty and she did not need a "nude scene" where her breasts are enhanced with rubber to a 60+ size. How silly. Also, besides the rubber breasts, most of us prefer our women without over-sized scale-laden tails wagging like a T-rex. How does a man have sex with a creature like that? And why? What's the logistics of dealing with a 100 pound T-rex tail wagging all over creation? Since Beowolf does just fine with women his age or half his age he could "just walk away" from any woman with a questionable unsightly giant tail.<br /><br />Sixty years ago Hollywood excelled in making outstanding pictures in this genre. But now they lack creative talent with the maturity to put the breaks on the Whiz Kids with all the fancy gadgets that simply wreck most 2007 movies. A film like this --- almost without suspense because of continual misjudgments by the director --- will run its course on DVD in the next few months and end up in the same dumpster as a Styrofoam clam from Mickey Dee's, while the classics of 1938-1950 will be sought-out long after we are all planted in the ground.
