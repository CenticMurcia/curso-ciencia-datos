This movie a musical about this girl from a village (in India), who's a dancer, falls in love with an American guy, leaves her family to go live in the states. Later we find out that the guy left her with a kid and that she's making do as a dance instructor.<br /><br />11 years later she comes back to the village because her dance instructor is dying and wants her to save the local theater, which is going to be demolished and a mall built in its place. To save it, she then makes a bet with the local Minister of Parliament that if she can put on a musical show (Romeo and juliet), and the people like it, the theater stays.<br /><br />Well anyways, this movie is awesome because it's not over the top emotional, its very light - hearted and the music and the performances are TOP-NOTCH. I had a bit of an issue with the chemistry between the "laila" and "majnu", mainly that they didn't have much, but whatever it didn't detract too much from my enjoyment.<br /><br />10/10, ENJOY!
