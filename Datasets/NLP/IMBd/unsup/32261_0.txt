There were a lot of errors in this movie.<br /><br />First, they claim the story takes place on Borneo. Wrong. They don't have jeepneys in Borneo, but in the Philippines. Funny, the credits talk about Philippine crew...<br /><br />Second, tribes living in the jungle with only spears and bows with arrows for protection/food and only a cloth around the waist is a clich√© and as far as I know, dead wrong.<br /><br />Third, the special effects just suck. The helicopter tumbling after our "heroes" looks animated - and "glued" in. The ambient colors are different on the helicopter and surroundings.<br /><br />Possible "spoiler" in the following paragraph... The story itself is a mix of "Alien" and "Predator". Those two movies are great - this one is not. We never get to understand the nature of the monster - and why it all of a sudden is so darn easy to kill it in the end. If that may be a surprising element...
