It's hard to put into words a description of this film because there are so many great things i can say about. The acting is out of the Top Drawer. Malcolm McDowell, David Thewlis and Paul Bettany bring out performances that are dazzling and make you sit back and just admire the art that they are producing. The Director gives us a sleek and highly enjoyable (although not a bundle of laughs) peice of film work that looks brilliant on the screen and the script is of the highest order. The only film i can compare this to are Lock ,Stock and Two smoking Barrels ,but this lacks the humour of that film ,or Get Carter because of Paul Bettany's Brilliant Michael Caine like performance. Just a word of warning to anybody who is offended by bad language or violence,this is NOT for you! Outstanding gangster movie. 9 out of 10.
