The story is idealess.<br /><br />The costumes are laughable.<br /><br />The set and scenery are boring.<br /><br />The fights are simple.<br /><br />The main actress is good looking, the main actor is not. But both are acting bad, together with all the other actors as well.<br /><br />The music is annoying.<br /><br />The camera-work and editing are static. Special effects are rare and unconvincing.<br /><br />There is no climax and the end is unspectacular.<br /><br />All in all, there is nothing that makes this worth your time. Only for people who really wants to know about every movie of this genre.
