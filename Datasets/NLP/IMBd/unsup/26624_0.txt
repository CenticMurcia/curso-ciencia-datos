This film is a true story about a young California man born with a rare brain tumor that gives his a head a large and disfigured shape, played by Eric Stolz. He is raised by his biker mother, Cher and her friends that come and go. His mother desperately wants him to live a life like a normal teenager, insisting that he gets enrolled in public schools and such. We are taken through the young man's journey through life and the difficulties he faces with friends and girls, as well as his increasing frustrations with these difficulties. Cher gives one of her greatest performances here, as does Laura Dern as the blind girl that Stolz meets at a summer camp for the disabled. Truly a memorable and gripping film that will stay with you for many years.
