I only got this movie because I collect movies that are related to the beer and brewing business as part of my breweriana collection. The connection (involving the "Mumblin' Jack Malt Liquor) turned out to be very weak (although I would like one of the 64 oz bottles used as props for my collection).<br /><br />What I got instead was a picture that was a little too real to have you believe it was an attempt at fiction, but too "fake" to have you believe it was real. It was just out there in no man's land.<br /><br />Let's face it, whether it is alcohol and fast food or facial tissue, advertising transcends sex, religion and race and targets (exploits?) some group the product is aimed at. It is not the advertisers fault that certain groups tend to buy more of certain products. It's called exploiting a market and that's their job.<br /><br />Bottom line - this is a confusing movie and I would strongly recommend giving it a "pass." unless you are a huge fan of one of the actors.
