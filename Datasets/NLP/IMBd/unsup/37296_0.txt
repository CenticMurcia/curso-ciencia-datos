Without a doubt one of the most inept, atrocious, badly edited, microscopically budgeted movies you're ever going to find. "Death" or otherwise. The great majority of the movie is still photographs of murders, suicides, electrocutions, car crashes, blah blah blah blah blah ... and it's mostly SILENT FOOTAGE, so they've added in some canned background music and an idiotic narration to fill that particular void. If your idea of a good time is watching a silent video taped sex change operation, I guess this is for you then. (And by the way, to the producers, clever title there guys, what did it take you, maybe all of about four seconds to think of the title for this one?) "Faces of Death" and "Traces of Death" may have similar titles, but they're nothing at all like each other. "Faces of Death" at least had a documentary feel to it, some attempt at a sequence or progression from one scene to the next, not here though. Just one still photograph after another, another silent video after that, all edited together randomly, with that annoying hack hairball "Damon Fox" providing an obnoxious and grating narrative. That FRAUD- trying to pretend he's a big time movie producer, musician, alleging that he graduated high school when he was 12 years old, etc. What a pathetic little fraud he is.<br /><br />1/2 a star out of ****
