OK, let me start with the best (if not the only good) thing in this movie: Shawn Huff. I don't know if the word "WOW" is enough to describe her. Her portrayal of an expert markswoman / assassin is picture-perfect, and she delivers with conviction such lines as (after shooting two guys point-blank) "Hell yeah I think you're afraid of me!". I think she is Brent Huff's wife, but she's so good in her role that I don't care if she got it only because of that. The rest of the film, however, is one disappointment after another: Roddy Piper is an ex-wrestler. Does he fight in the movie? No. A big German guy is shown at first as an underground fighter. Does he have any more fights? No. The villains (a para-military group) are shown training during the opening credits. Do they get to put their training to use? No. And so on. The action (what little there is of it) is of generally poor quality, apart from a few decent motorcycle stunts. Ultimately, "The Bad Pack" is the poor man's "The Magnificent Seven" (*)
