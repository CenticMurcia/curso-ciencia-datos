First of all I want to say that I had high hopes for this movie, De Palma's MI was very good in my opinion it had some good action scenes, and a clever story. But this movie is just awful.<br /><br />Ok, i must admit it starts good, with the plane crash. The Thing with the mask was a good idea (in that scene). But it's downhill from there.<br /><br />I think that the big problem of MI 2 is the plot (if it has one). There is no real mission in this one. The whole story is just an excuse to show stupid action scenes. The car spin is a perfect example, what the hell was that !!!<br /><br />Oh yes, the action scenes, well i don't know what passed through Woo's head when he decided to show half of the film in slow motion. It really went boring, like with the dumb masks, oh my god that was just laughable i mean it's just ridiculous how Hunt always has the right mask at the right moment, a little realism please !!!!<br /><br />Something that also disturbed me were the characters Tom Cruise isn't really a spy here, he's to busy with his hair now. And I really didn't care about Newton. And what were they thinking about Rhames, his Character was very interesting in MI but now he's so boring with the stupid one liners about his clothes.<br /><br />I don't know why Woo made this mess, but i think the real guilty are the writers, i hope MI 3 will be better
