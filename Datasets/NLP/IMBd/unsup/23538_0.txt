When Bram Stoker decided to name his famous vampire after a legendary Romanian prince, it had very very little to do with vampires at all. In fact there is only a small fraction of the original Dracula in the novel. The reality, as portrayed in this movie, is very different. Vlad was a brutal ruler, and he had his reasons. To call him evil would be ignorant. In Romanian folklore Vlad is celebrated as a national hero, and many still today pray for his return. Vlad was a patriot who took it to the limit - and beyond - since it seemed necessary at his time and situation! As for historical facts I can't tell for sure how much of this movie is true, but my research so far tells me it's between 50-75%.<br /><br />Go rent this movie if you'd like to get closer to knowing the real Dracula. I guarantee he's more interesting than Stokers!
