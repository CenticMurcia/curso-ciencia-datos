Before any Westerner visits India for the first time, I strongly recommend them to view Outsourced prior to their arrival. The "bread and butter" of the movie is that there is so much one can learn by analyzing some of the customs and trends of Indian culture. <br /><br />Outsourced is a very light-spirited venture about the life of an American sales manager who is prompted to make a business trip to India in order to train his replacements. All the characters are likable and the key situations that occur seem realistic. (Of course the majority of the cast is obviously Indian so it would make sense.) It was interesting to see the main character go through the transition from adjusting to vegetarianism, learning compassion through generosity, consciously eating with the right hand and other habits.<br /><br />Being a good hearted film, the only thing outsourced lacks is some prolonged suspense. There is nothing too dramatic about the changes the main character had to go through other than his initial embrace to Indian life, a mild issue with an extra-marital affair, and the brief moment where he had to tell his trainees that they've been laid off. Everything seemed just a little too easy though I am aware it is in the culture of the supporting cast to positively adjust to change.<br /><br />As said before, I would recommend this movie to any American or Western traveller to forewarn them of the culture shock that he/she would face. I've actually enjoyed this movie to my surprise.
