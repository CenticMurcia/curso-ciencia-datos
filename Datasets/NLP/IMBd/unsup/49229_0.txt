'The Break-Up' is not funny. It's been marketed as a comedy, but it certainly isn't. The constant arguing between the two lead characters and their childish attempts to get back at one another are not entertaining. Unfortunately, this is pretty much all there is to the movie. We never get to see what it is that they like about one another. What do they have in common? Why were they attracted to one another in the first place? Why did they fall in love? These questions remain unanswered and as a result I found that I didn't actually care whether they broke up or not. <br /><br />The only interesting parts of the movie for me came courtesy of the excellent supporting cast (all of whom were under-used). Johnny O (John Favreau), Riggleman (Jason Bateman) and Marilyn Dean (Judy Davis) were the only characters I actually liked. Favreau was of course very funny as always, but only has a handful of scenes, and his knack for comedy is largely wasted. I would also liked to have seen more of talented 'Arrested Development' star Bateman. He has remarkable comic timing and a strong screen presence which could have really added to this film. But, unfortunately, the focus is squarely on Aniston and Vaughn, who fail to make their characters interesting or even likable. <br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't really enjoy it.
