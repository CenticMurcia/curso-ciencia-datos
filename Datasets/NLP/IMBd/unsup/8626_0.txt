i actually thought that this movie wasn't that bad. when i heard that a Cinderella 3 was coming out, i was like..when did they ever make a Cinderella 2. so i did some online searching, and i found the Cinderella 2 summary and it somewhat rang a bell. but i guess if Cinderella 2 was any good i would have remembered it. but Cinderella 3 like i said really isn't that bad. i love the whole plot to the movie, makes you really think what would have happened if Cinderella never got her fairy tale prince and all. some of my favorite parts was when the prince jumps out the window, i just love his facial expressions and how he does it, it looks like hes trying to fly. lol. well yea, if you have kids or anything, you should at least give this movie a chance, maybe you might like it yourself
