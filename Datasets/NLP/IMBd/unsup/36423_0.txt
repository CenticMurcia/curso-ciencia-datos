The armor, scenery and especially the men in this film are fine and worthy of note. Mila however, I found to be simply terrible as Joan. Overlooking the fact that she is far too old, it seemed to me that she portrayed the fanatical Joan just as she was the fifth element. She is a poor actress at best. I was also sorely disappointed in John Malchovich's performance. A first for me that he has not shone. Faye Dunnaway was her marvelous self, however, and perhaps worth the price of a PPV. I watched this movie with several people varying in age from 22 through 52 and no one liked this film. I was the only one who saw it through to the bitter end. Nuf said.
