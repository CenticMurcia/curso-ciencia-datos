I can't say very many good things about this movie. The only thing good about it was the original idea of one serial killer stalking and competing with another, which I've never heard of before. Oh and it made me think, several times, that I could shoot a better movie in a week with a digital camera and the change in my pocket.<br /><br />The narration makes it feel almost like a graphic novel. You actually spend more time inside the main character's head than in the world. There was one thing that was pretty amusing. At one point the main character finds a dead body in his trunk, a gift from his competition. So he moves it to the trunk of a police detective's car. I had to LOL at that.
