So, what did you think of "Indigo"? Personally, I think it was one heck of a marketing achievement. Imagine, a film that would otherwise go straight to video and sit on Blockbuster's shelf, selling millions of tickets and being shown in thousands of theaters, churches, etc .... all on one night. And, no worries about bad word-of-mouth killing sales. Also, what about that shameless preshow commerical for the "Spiritual Cinema Circle"? I noticed the flyer in the lobby for the SCC didn't mention price.... only if you hurry and sign-up now, you get a free book worth $15. Wow! I want their Marketing Director for a buddy.<br /><br />Next to "Indigo," most student films I've seen ain't half bad. Certainly, the script, cinematography and acting wasn't much better... if any. In the interviews in the beginning, they said they "didn't water the story down so it would be acceptable for a wide audience." Right! That's why the script was about a drug deal that went bad... with an Indigo kid thrown in. I didn't connect with or feel anything for the characters. And, I certainly didn't come away with a better understanding of Indigo kids or feeling spiritually up-lifted... or any of the things the Producer, Stephen Simon, said the film was going to do. That's perhaps their biggest mistake... creating an expectation they didn't deliver on. <br /><br />Also, if Stephen had used the adjective "extraordinary" one more time (I counted at least 6 times) to describe the film, I would have puked on the spot. Even the interviews were shot badly... bad lighting and composition, distracting background, etc. And, weren't they were all just too "cute" the way they touched each other? How about that bit after the film? Did everyone join hands and pray at your showing? It didn't happen at the showing I went to Saturday night.... and it was at a Unity Church, where they do that all the time. Somehow, I can't imagine people joining hands at the AMC Theater in Los Angeles?<br /><br />The subject is definitely material for a good movie.... but Indigo ain't it. However, Inidgo does prove or confirm a number of things: 1) lame dialog and script - authors do not necessarily make good screen writers; 2) terrible acting - acting and directing should be left to professionals; 3) where there's a marketing strategy, there's hope.... for all filmmakers.<br /><br />Let's face it, we've been had by a marketing phenomena... and it's just started. Think about it. What if only 100,000 people become part of the "extraordinary" spiritual movement, and sign up for the Spiritual Cinema Circle at $29 per month? That's $2,900,000 coming in each month!! <br /><br />It's the "Blair Witch" phenomenon for 2005... where selling the sizzle is what counts. As a filmmaker, I hated the movie, but love their marketing savy. I will be submitting my most recent documentary to them. So, sign-up now for the Spiritual Cinema Circle and watch for my film on an upcoming offering.
