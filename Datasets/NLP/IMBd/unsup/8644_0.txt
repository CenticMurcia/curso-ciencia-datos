This movie is soooooo underrated. It should have won all it's oscar nominations and should have, at least, been nominated for best picture. I loved(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) this movie. Cher puts on an extraordinary performance, as usual, and proves that she can act, this being her first film. Kurt Russle, i am surprised to say, wasn't nominated for an oscar. This movie was great. If you haven't been able to see it, see it!!!!!!!!
