This is an okay effort from Jim Carrey. It really doesn't let him prove himself as a genuine good actor, the role is a little restrictive. This film spawned a whole bunch of look-a-likes for carrey, and it wasn't until Cable Guy came out, that I figured out he was seriously a good actor. This effort is funny, to a certain extent, the butt talking, etc. can be enjoyable. But, after a little while it gets a little tiresome. If want a genuine good comedy, don't rent this one, but if you just are looking for a couple of cheap laughs, by all means rent it.
