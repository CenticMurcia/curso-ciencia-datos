I've been a movie lover all of my life (which means almost sixty years of loving movies); saying that, I'm also one who tries to find something good to say about nearly every movie I've seen. I even defended such turkeys as "Ishtar" and "Mom and Dad Save the Universe." Sorry. No can do, this time around. "Magorium" was such a total disappointment, I hardly know where to begin. So instead, let me point out my disappointment by asking a few questions. Just who the heck IS Magorium? We learn almost nothing about him, most importantly, we get no back story as to his connection to the toy shop (most importantly, WHY a toy store.) Same with Natalie Portman's character. How did she get the job at the Emporium? Clearly she loves the shop and it loves her, so why does she suddenly find it so difficult to take over? Moreover, what is Bateman's character all about, and why did NOTHING happen in developing his relationship with Portman? So many more questions --- so little time. You get my drift. Dustin Hoffman is one of the great actors of our time. What a waste. Portman is more than competent, and there were brief flashes of character development. But a few flashes weren't enough. Jason Bateman had so much potential that the script clear didn't cash in on. Okay. Sorry about the rant. I'm so deeply disappointed. I gave up going to see "Fred Claus" for this? Especially giving that the movie just stopped. No wrap-up. No ending. It just stopped!!! Wha?
