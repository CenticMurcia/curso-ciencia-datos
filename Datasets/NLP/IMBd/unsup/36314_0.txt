*SPOILERS* This is the single worst film I have ever seen, and by some distance. It starts off with terrible visuals of someone's head exploding, and at that point I thought it might be a funny film. I WAS WRONG! The next hour consisted only of pointless crap about a band being signed to a record label. Seriously, nothing else happened! It was just so boring! The plot was unveiled 5 minutes before the end, there was a tiny bit of zombie action (without much gore - just hearts on sticks!) and then it ended.<br /><br />When I was about 5 years old I was taught that a story should have a beginning, a middle and an end. Whoever wrote this thing should rightfully be scrubbing toilets or shovelling poop for a living! I love bad films that are funny, but I just couldn't laugh at this. It was very boring and very annoying. If you suffer from depression, I urge you to get someone to tie your hands down before you watch this film!
