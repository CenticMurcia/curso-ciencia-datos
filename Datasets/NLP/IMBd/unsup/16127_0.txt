First off, what other movie has a killer alien from space that shoots green rays from its eyes and tries to have sex with the babes, and runs from shaving cream, amazing! But in my opinion what really makes this movie so freaking awesome is Craig Peck who plays mike, a horror movie fan, who just is truly amazing and knows what to do in each step. The girls are hot, the guys are cool, the alien is sick, and the camera work and music are just perfect. But here is my question, Why isn't Craig Peck in more movies?
