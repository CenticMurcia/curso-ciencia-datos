Despite its length (more than a couple of hours) the story did not find a direction; instead, you are offered to taste the characters in such manner you are forced to hate the bad guys and love the good ones.<br /><br />Many aspects of the film were definitely brilliant: the sceneries for Mexico in the early 1900s and the script, which seemed to be carefully written to exclude any neologism and include those seasonal slang.<br /><br />Screenplay, from time to time, shows a clear influence of Emilio `El Indio' Guzman and Ismael Rodr√≠guez.<br /><br />A bit silly but very amusing.
