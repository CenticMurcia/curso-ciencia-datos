Please do not mention Hitchcock!The Master knew that without a solid screenplay it's a waste of breath.All those "modern" French thrillers suffer from approximative vague scripts.The directors think that special effects ,disturbing music (here very Chabrolesque),and an ominous soundtrack can make the job done.Spice with uninspired flashbacks and nightmares .Add some sex.Serve tepid.<br /><br />Benoit Magimel is too limited an actor to suggest two different personalities (Jeremy Irons he is definitely not).Even the final trick is not new.It was invented by Sacha Guitry half a century before.And whereas "trouble" takes finally the easy way out ,the 1953 film did not give the audience any answer.<br /><br />Like this?Try these ....<br /><br />"Dead ringers" David Cronenberg 1988 Irons and his twin <br /><br />"Dead ringer" Paul Henreid 1965 Bette Davis and her twin (2)<br /><br />"Toi Le Venin" Robert Hossein 1958 Marina Vlady and Odile Versois <br /><br />"La Vie d'Un HonnÃªte Homme "Sacha Guitry 1953 Michel Simon and his twin.<br /><br />"A stolen life "Curtis Bernardt 1951 Bette Davis and her twin.<br /><br />"The dark mirror" Robert Siodmak 1946 Olivia de Havilland and her twin.
