Version: Universe VCD. Cantonese with English subtitles. Possible spoiler warning.<br /><br />This is perhaps the strangest, most random movie I have ever seen. The VCD copy I have doesn't even have a blurb or anything - just a picture of Ekin Cheng dressed as Robin from Batman, and three women (Theresa Mo, and the Twins: Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung) dressed up as crime-fighters. The lack of any description and Ekin Cheng dressed up as Robin is pretty much why I bought it. At that time, I barely knew who the Twins were (I still haven't seen the Twins Effect, and I don't think I ever will), so that only made the whole thing more surreal.<br /><br />The movie is supposedly based on the Black Rose movies (another element of this movie I'm not familiar with), and follows Black Rose as she prepares the Twins to take up her crime-fighting ways. Of course, Black Rose has gone completely insane, and she has a deep loathing of men (to the point where she has built a robot that destroys ANYTHING male), and her Protégés aren't exactly models of normality. Gillian is a psychology student, who has completed all the psychology courses at her university in the shortest possible amount of time, and her name must never be spoken. Charlene is an alien from a planet of single-mothers, and she has whatever powers are useful to the story. Ekin Cheng is a taxi driver who ends up donning Robin's costume and becoming... Robin, I assume.<br /><br />Along with the insanity in the Black Rose mansion, her arch-nemesis Miss LavenCam (what the?), and her gang of models and school-girls are terrorizing the city for no apparent reason, and it is up to the Insano Squad (guess who that refers to) to stop them, in a series of equally insane face offs, with the final showdown turning into a scene lifted straight from Jackie Chan's "Drunken Master".<br /><br />In case you couldn't tell, this movie is completely insane, in a good way. Most of it is very funny, in a really random/bizarre way. I was quite surprised to find out this was directed by Donnie Yen, this is like the polar opposite to what you would expect from Yen, but he does a good job as director. Unfortunately, the subtitles frequently don't make sense (not in a random way, but in an Engrish way), but reading subtitles does take your attention away from the full-grown man dressed up as Robin, running away from a killer, man-hating robot. Yeah. <br /><br />If random and insane isn't your thing, stay far away. If random and insane is your thing, you should enjoy.<br /><br />7/10
