You can't be a horror fan and not appreciate lower budget films. It doesn't work that way. I really enjoyed Ghost Lake, and appreciate the different, more spooky approach it took, as opposed to the fast paced, cgi driven garbage we usually get. Don't get me wrong, I love gore, I love f/x and all that, but it was a nice change. It takes some nice twists, has some real scares, and just has very effective atmosphere throughout the entire story. A very solid ghost tale. I'd go more into the story but there's already a million reviews on here that do that, so just let it be known that mine is positive. My two favorite characters are Rebecca (the lead) and the young fisherman (the zombie from the cover, he's alive for some part then gets killed). I could definitely see these two in a sequel where the fisherman goes after Rebecca and slays the people that gets in his way. I just think they were the stronger actors and a next possible movie would be better off using them as the focus. It could be a nice turn from spooky tale to effective slasher. So check out Ghost Lake and appreciate what the real hard workers of the film business put together for us folks. If you can't do that, then you probably lost focus reading all of this due to lack of explosions and cgi, so it doesn't matter anyway.
