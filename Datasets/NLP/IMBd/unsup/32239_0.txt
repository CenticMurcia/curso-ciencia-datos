I'm currently watching this movie as I write this. There are movies worse than this, there are movies that are made worse in terms of cinematography, direction and plot. However this is still so bad it deserves a 1. Its really really stupid. Embarrassingly stupid movie. I just cannot get over the stupid goth kid they have in this movie, his career must have went far. Wow, its so bad its hard to watch.<br /><br />The blood in this movie is really stupid fake blood, really stupid looking, just like all the actors. Whoever was responsible for the wardrobe in this movie was also an idiot. Of course all the actors in this 'film' did their best to have really stupid expressions the entire time. They did a marvelous job of being terrible actors. Of course Keri Lynn Pratt and bad to look at, I'd like to give her somethin, but thats beside the point, this movie sucks. Like titanic, Titanic sucked too.
