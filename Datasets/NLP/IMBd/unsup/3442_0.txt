Okay I admit it: I'm a sucker for this kind of "how long will it take them to get together" romantic comedy. Sure it has problems: the plot's kind of dopey, the audience is always ahead of the characters, David Schwimmer's still irritating (though oddly, in a completely way to usual) but enough of it worked to satisfy me.<br /><br />Jason Lee is great (despite awful hair) as Jay, who's really the lead despite billing. Mili Avital is sweet and lovely. It's nowhere near as good as My Best Friend's Wedding or The Truth About Cats & Dogs, but if this is the kind of thing you'll probably like if you like this kind of thing. You know what I mean.
