OK, I am not the most easily offended, but this movie was severely detracted from by gratuitous use of words beginning with f and s and m and you get the picture! Does Schwimmer think he is John Hughes, Judd Nelson and M. Broderick together now? No sympathy for the characters, bad language, Chicago (again)!, contrived plot ---------- that's enough!
