I enjoy this film each time I watch it. I watched it twice on the Video, later I bought the DVD and have watched again a couple of times. Even though I know what is going to happen, the humor does not miss to bring laughter.<br /><br />Its a gradual moving comedy drama without some stupid 'sexual' comedy.<br /><br />One has to understand the movie in order to enjoy the funny moments. Particularly my favorites are:<br /><br />Marvin look.... !!! Sunglasses. Son of a bi*** stole my cigarettes again. Take a wild guess.<br /><br />Watch it, you will like it :)
