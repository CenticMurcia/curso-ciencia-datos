1st watched 2/13/2007 - 1 out of 10(Dir-Dwain Esper): Absolutely horrible excuse for a movie. I mean, if it did it's job of educating the public against syphilis it might have been somewhat worthwhile, but even this attempt was executed very badly. This is another one of those late 30's attempts to educate the young folk on the horrors of loose living and boy does this one stink!! The acting is inept, and the plot is exactly what we'd expect from this type of movie. A local good girl moves to the big city and has supposedly one bad night of rolling in the hay and turns up with the dreaded social disease. She is told not to marry until her disease is behind her, so her longtime sweetheart waits in the wings while she treats her disease and hides it from him. A quack then supposedly cures her, she marries and then things get worse as she has a baby that gets sick and her husband gets it to. Why oh why did the health department have to get involved in making movies back in those day?? I'll have to check into this..but anyway the movie gives very little information about the disease -- just that if you party-hearty, get laid, you'll get it and your life will be Hell!! As far as I'm concerned this fire-and-brimstone type of teaching is not enough and in my opinion isn't even education. Well, I think I've said enough, avoid this clunker at any cost.
