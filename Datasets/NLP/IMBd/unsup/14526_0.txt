When I saw the movie in 1979, before they gave television shows or movies parental ratings, I am thinking now that this movie is actually pretty risk taking for its time. Nonetheless, it is about a 13 year old who pretends she is 16 to gain the attentions of a 17 year old high school student who aspires to be a singer Rex Smith, who was a minor teen heart throb at the time is fine. Denise Miller who played essentially minor parts both in Fish and Archies'place later in her career is excellent as a conflicted 13 year old who does not know whether she should play with dolls or boys. Judd Hirsh(Taxi) and Barbara Feldon make use of the screen time by providing Miller with advice and tactfully helping the adolescent to make the difficult transition from her youth into a young teenager.
