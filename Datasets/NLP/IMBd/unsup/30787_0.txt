I love this movie so much. It was very well directed and written and it's just an awesome movie! :) It's parted in 3 time frames-1961, 1972 and 2000. The 1961 part was about two elderly ladies that were frustrated because they couldn't express then selves in any way, the second part I really liked a butch girl named Any and a feminist named Linda meet an fall in love and finally the last one was so funny, Ellen Degeneres stared as Kal so it was awesome, Anyway, Kal and Fran want to have a baby so the go to the sperm bank and well you'll see if you watch it! This movie is so good! I absolutely love it!
