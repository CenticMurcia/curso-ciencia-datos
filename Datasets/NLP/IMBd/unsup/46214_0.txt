This effort is unfortunately is betrayed by its execution. It is a very pretty movie, beautifully shot, but with no real point outside of its most obvious one (that the Chinese coming was a disaster for Tibet and the Dalai Lama (kundun), and that that Dalai Lama guy, hey, he's pretty cool). It fails to engage the viewer, making do with empty symbolism, and some wooden acting from what I assume are probably real Tibetans. This movie has an important story to tell, but fails in the telling.
