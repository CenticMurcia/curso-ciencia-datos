Well, I didn't choose wisely when I rented this movie. Yikes! Although the concept for the film had potential, the attempt failed miserable. The story is about a drug addict artist who wakes up from a drug induced stupor and finds his friend murdered. He doesn't know what happened and whether or not he's responsible. The police then investigate and interview all the cocaine snorting friends who last saw the man alive and think they may have a suspect, but there's a twist in this struggling plot. There were some familiar character-actor faces within the cast and even an appearance from former KISS guitarist Ace Frehley in a "vain" attempt to attract viewers to this sorry film I begrudgingly admit that I took the bait. What makes this film weak is it lacks stability and a strong storyline with good character development. The acting was amateurish and the dialog was lame that is if you could understand it through all the mumbling. If that wasn't enough, the poor quality of the film, due to the low budget, was quite apparentfor instance, the poor sound mix and jiggling camera made it seem like I was watching a home movie or a student film. To keep viewers awake or to continue watching, some sex and naked women were thrown in the mix for the guys. As for us ladies, there is nothing to hold our attention. In closing, unless you're like me, a KISS fan who wanted to see Ace in his first dramatic role, don't bother with this movie. I give it a generous 2.
