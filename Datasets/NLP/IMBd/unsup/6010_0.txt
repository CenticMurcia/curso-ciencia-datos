This is one of My all time favorite Three Stooges short subjects. I have seen nearly all of the Stooges episodes with the original trio of Curly, Moe, and Larry and the replacements with Shemp, Joe, and Curly-Joe and I thank God for that. Anyway this episode is so great. It starts off with a great song sung by the Stooges and when the shopping begins I just love the guy that selling the food as he yells about the Stooges jumping on his food cart. I also love when the Stooges are in the French Foreign Legion. An excellent scene is were one of My favorite actors Vernon Dent plays Simitz. He played that role perfectly with the accent and everything and I believe its one of his finest works. There are not that many actors today who can pull off what he did in his day! The Santa Clause and the harem girl costumes the Stooges wear are so funny. The music is great in Simitz' palace and I get a kick out of his guard and his harem girls especially the gal with the black pants, she new how to dance! I just love this one! Like I said this is one of My all time favorite Three Stooges short subjects films and all Stooges lovers with adore this one!
