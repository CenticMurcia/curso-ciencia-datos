For a film with potentially more scope and grandeur than even Lord of the Rings, Eragon falls entirely flat due to lack luster acting, a terrible script and a total lack of pace. Only Rachel Weisz voice acting for the dragon Saphira manages to give the movie its only good performance while Jeremy Irons sincere performance is let down by the hammyness of its lackluster script. The special effects are fine and the cinematography is great, the pace is way off and the movie is way too short for its own good. I have not read the books that gave life to this film but I hope it was much better than this because the movie was a letdown.
