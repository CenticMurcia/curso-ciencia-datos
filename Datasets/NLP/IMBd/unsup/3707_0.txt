Wow, is this bad film. You'd think with this cast it would be a great one. But you would be very wrong.<br /><br />With lines like, "Have some raisins." Or, when Gregory Peck asks Martin Landau how many men he has left in Love Company. "Twelve." And then a cannon shell blows up 2 of them. "Bring along your ten men", is Peck's response. What depth. What compassion. This film is surely laughable.
