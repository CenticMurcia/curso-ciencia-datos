This awful, seemingly low-budget knock-off of "Superman" features Helen Slater as the titular character, fighting off evil Faye Dunaway and Peter O'Toole. <br /><br />The movie is about as fun as a root canal, which will give you a good indication of just how enjoyable it is. It was definitely a cash-in on "Superman's" success in 1978, and the success of its sequels. However it lacks the solid style of "Superman" and is really, really low budget-y and cheap looking.<br /><br />I suppose this is just ample proof that there needed to be no "Supergirl" movie--at least not one like this. The scenes with the "witch" still make me cringe.<br /><br />Please, this deserves to be on the low 100. I absolutely hate it. It's even worse than "Superman IV." Yes, I know that's saying a lot, but it is--quite unfortunately--true.<br /><br />P.S. I originally submitted this about two years ago but decided I'd revise a few of my sentences. I've gotten angry letters from the "Supergirl Cult of IMDb" giving me death threats telling me that it's an "under-appreciated slice of epic film-making on par with The Lord of the Rings and The Godfather." I didn't like Lord of the Rings too much.<br /><br />Supergirl makes it look like the best film ever made.<br /><br />So, don't send me letters, and don't threaten me. If you think I'm wrong, write your own review.
