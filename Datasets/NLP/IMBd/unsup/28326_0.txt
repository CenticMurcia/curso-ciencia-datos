First let me say good movie. Not great, but not bad. The lighting scene was great. I had a couple of questions about the film. First what camera did you guys use. I wacthed the commentary and it mentioned nothing about it. Just wondering. Also not to be a dick but how did loins gate hear of this movie? Was it festivals buzz or did you just send out 100 copies? I have done a low budget film ,and I know how hard it is. Again great job getting it on store shelves and if you are looking for crew for the new flick let me know I would love to work on it. The gag reel looked like you guys where having fun? Also did you have to put the A. in your name because of the other David cross from Mr Show, or have you always done that?<br /><br />Thanks for your time. Good luck on Gostwachter 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6.
