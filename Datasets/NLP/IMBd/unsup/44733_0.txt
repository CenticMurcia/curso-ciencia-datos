Mark Hammill plays Donald Swan, an elderly comic nerd who attends a con cause he loves Commender Courage (a made-up creation for the movie). If Hamill just made a straight up documentary, this film wouldn't be half as bad. As it is, the jokes are stale, and the guest stars including Kevin Smith, Bruce Campbell, Ray Harryhausen, Stan Lee, and others are pretty much wasted. Which is a damn shame, well not so much in the case of Kevin Smith as he's pretty much a one-trick pony (as evidence of him trying to get away for said one-trick and making a movie that bombed horribly). The extra "behind the voices" featurette on the second disc is better because it's REAL (why the hell did Miramax see fit to give this sad movie a deluxe set boggles the mind, by the way). Mr. Hammill says this move is a 'love letter to the fans', proving the saying "you only hurt the one's you love" all the more apt.<br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: Disc 1) List of Cameos; Art gallery; 13 deleted scenes; Cast and crew bios; Trailers for "Spy Kids 3D" and "My Boss's Daughter" Disc 2) "Behind the Voices" 51-minute panel; Faux Extended Interviews with Kevin Smith, Stan Lee, Bruce Campbell, Hugh Hefner, Mark Evanier; Scott Shaw, Billy Mumy, Peter David, and Paul Dini; and some other stuff
