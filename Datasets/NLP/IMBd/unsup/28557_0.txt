I bought this as it was cheap and of course like many had never heard of it until Tarantino remade it. However these types of movies I do enjoy and so took a chance. I sat and watched it with a big bag or doritos and a six pack and found it very entertaining which is the name of the game. The characters are likable rogues and quite cool. There are several stand out moments in the movie - especially topless German soldier girls firing at our bastards with machine guns - and the ending is also quite well executed. <br /><br />the only gripe is sometimes the action is a little repetitive after a while but its only a small gripe. I would recommend this movie if you want a similar but more trashy kind of Dirty Dozen or Wild Bunch.
