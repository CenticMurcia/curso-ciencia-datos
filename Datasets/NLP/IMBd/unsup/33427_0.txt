My mother bought this for Halloween at the Dollar Store for something fun to watch. Truly a bad movie. Watch for the microphone dropping into the frame from above near the pool. There is the typical nudity tease but there is none. In that respect it is safe for kids. (SPOILER ALERT) The death scenes are great fun though. Our favorites were the electrocution and the strangulation. The faces were so great we watched it over and over. Great for a laugh! Also, is that Starsky and Hutch? If you see it for a dollar and want some laughs, get it, otherwise pass.
