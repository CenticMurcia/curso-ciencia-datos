Bobbie Phillips did an amazing job as a part-human,part-sub created to battle evil. It's the stuff B movies are made of,but her interpretation raised it to an A for sure.Her strength and subtleties kept me entranced! It's great to see an attractive female in an action role that maintains intelligence and believability! I hope to see her in more of these types of roles!
