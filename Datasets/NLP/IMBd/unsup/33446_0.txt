Four sorority girls take a much-needed vacation from the pressures of school (after showering and changing clothes for about ten minutes, of course) and travel to a secluded cabin in the woods with their boyfriends. All is well until an archaeologist excavating a nearby cave awakens an entity that possesses him, turning him into a murderous creature. To relieve viewer boredom before the tame killing scenes occur, Debbie Dutch dances in a bra-less half-shirt and Dori Courtney messes around with her boyfriend in the hot tub and runs around in the woods topless.<br /><br />This micro budgeted Super 8 production should have been funnier, the creature is barely seen and the face on the cave wall with glowing eyes and echo voice is awful. You'd be much better off watching SORORITY BABES IN THE SLIMEBALL BOWL-O-RAMA or SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE 2 as far as sorority girl horror comedies go.
