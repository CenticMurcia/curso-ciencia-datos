What to say about Pod People... besides IT STINKS! Well most of the MST3K crew's classic lines have already been summarized. This is definitely one of the worst movies to be shown on MST, but the classic riffing of Joel and the bots makes it pretty painless. The sketches with the keyboards and Joel and the bots rendition of "Hear the Engines Roll Now" are classic.<br /><br />"Hear the engines roll now... Idiot control now... Hideous control now!"
