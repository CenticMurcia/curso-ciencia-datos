never underestimate the ability of hackman and dafoe... that is the only thing that i can say.... we have seen a lot of movie involving hackman, and this is one of the greatest performance from him...don't ever judge the acting by comparing to his age..he will always be one of the greatest actor for all time...Willem dafoe is just like the underdog...sometimes he has given a very powerful acting in a movie,and it was proved by two movies...this one @ Mississippi burning..and American psycho..<br /><br />thus to these performances...hackman was nominated for Oscar...he really deserves it !! Frances Mac dormant is also very good...and so she won an Oscar too..it is only i am not satisfied that dafoe did not received any Oscar for this movie...sometimes an underdog like him should be given a chance...<br /><br />nothing to say about this movie...the plot and story line are definitely superb!! the acting from everyone are great!! Michael rooker has always been good in his movie.. he played as a villain,and so.. he has proved that he is also great at playing as a villain...just like Michael ironside..<br /><br />overall...i give this movie 10 out of 10 stars...<br /><br />Bravo For Mississippi Burning !!!!!
