This movie was a good idea to bring the disease of Scleroderma to light but it depicted one of the worse case scenarios of the disease.<br /><br />Being a sufferer of Scleroderma and having a brother who died from the disease I was scared beyond belief at what could happen to me. In talking with other Scleroderma sufferers some of them felt the very same way I did. Scared and concerned.
