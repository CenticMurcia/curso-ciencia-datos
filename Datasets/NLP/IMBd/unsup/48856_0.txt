I could see where the director was going and what he was trying to express but it was a laughable attempt at conveying serious material. Yes, to a certain extent, people in London 'ghettos' do speak like the actors in the film but the dialogue was simply appalling. The actors, whether they were portraying a downtrodden or a somewhat more privileged youth gave such caricatured and clich√©d performances that one could not empathises with a single character. It can hardly be compared to a British 'La Haine' because, unlike La Haine it is so lacking in aesthetic material, i.e. inspired cinematography, gritty realism, and a portrayal of philosophic ideas that it comes across more as a day time soap such as 'Doctors' (as British readers will agree). The material covered had a lot of potential but it was executed in such an uninspired and predictable manner that I have to say I was extremely happy when it ended. The only plus side is that it gave me some of the biggest laughs I have ever experienced whilst watching a film, something akin to inhaling laughing gas - strange for a film which is meant to alert viewers of the desperation of the youth in underprivileged London areas. If you watch it expect to be disappointed.
