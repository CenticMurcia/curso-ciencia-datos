This movie featured a cast of possibly the worst actors and actresses ever to grace the big screen.<br /><br />After a plane crash that turns an already dying (or maybe dead -- I can't recall) woman into the "Ice Queen," there's an avalanche that strands a group of young men and women. <br /><br />One of the first indications of this movies lack of quality is the obvious use of TOY CARS for the avalanche scene! I can do better with photoshop. The Special Effects crew needs to get out of the movie business and fast! <br /><br />I'll skip the midsection and move right to the ending: The "Ice Queen" begins a sexual dance (if you want to call it that) to attempt to lure Johnny and he goes along with it in order to pull her into the hot-tub. Apparently the all-powerful "Ice Queen" can be easily defeated by a pool of hot water -- she is now a pile of crappy rubber parts that look like my 8-year-old brother made them with playdough.
