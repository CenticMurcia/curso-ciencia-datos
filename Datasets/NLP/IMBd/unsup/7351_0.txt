This movie rocks. It is best to watch it in French with subtitles as the voice artists for the English language version ham it up a bit. This is an excellently directed, hard hitting and atmospheric sci-fi cop movie. Set I'm guessing about twenty years in the future. Teenage girls are being murdered and disappearing. The movie opens on back to back, shock you into the movie scenes, that set up the parallel stories that will be played out. <br /><br />The cast is great. Albert Dupontel as David Hoffman is a total bad ass, grim and tough as hell. There seems to be an ocean of emotion behind his stoic tough facade. Marthe Keller is also a stand out. Just an incredible actress to watch. None of the relationships in this movie are predicable, which makes it very intriguing and though all these characters are familiar to this genre, all of them come off as totally believable people. This is something that lacks in most American versions of the genre.<br /><br />The fight scenes rock. Simple staging no wire work. It's just tough sons of bitches beating the crap out of each other in some brutal future martial art. There are twists and great scenes throughout. And though I've watched it twice and am still not sure of exactly all that happened, I don't care. I'm going to buy the DVD. Julien Leclercq is a Director and Writer to watch. I hope to see more from him. <br /><br />And a word of advice to the Director. Don't move to Hollywood. They would just ruin you. Look what happened to John Woo.<br /><br />Great Movie.<br /><br />Peace.
