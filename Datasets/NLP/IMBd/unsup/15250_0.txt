What a steaming pile this is. It's not anywhere near accurate of what early 80's high school was like. Everything from the wardrobe to the hairstyles are completely inaccurate; which would be okay if only there were *any* other redeeming qualities about this absolutely terrible television show. But there isn't. The staging is quite literally laughable; I think a moderately competent 12 year old could shoot a better show. The acting (and I'm being waaaay too generous there) is very, very bad and the writing stinks like fresh dog pie on a dewy spring morn. Seriously - this show is popular because the demographic it's meant to be consumed by have money and want to romanticize a past that never happened. This is junk.
