I thought that this film from Jess Franco was not a bad film. it is about a man called Raymond Bordier the editor of a newspaper, who uses a castle of a count and countess to preform black masses that look and seem very real. Vogal who is a former priest, and a religious fanatic happens to walk in on one of their Black Masses. He believes that he has saw the real thing, so he decides to exorcize the people taking part. so that he can make them confess that they are under the influence of Satan. To get their confessions he tortures them to death using medieval rites. I though this was quite a good film to watch although i did not find a lot happening in the film.
