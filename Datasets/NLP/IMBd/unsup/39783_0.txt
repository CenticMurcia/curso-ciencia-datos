How many times have we seen an 'alien' attack humans? Haven't we seen this story before? Too predictable.<br /><br />Mr King should stick to themes like 'the langoliers', where you don't see what is coming, or know what is coming. This movie could have been so much more. <br /><br />It did feel like a B movie. The art on the DVD cover looked inspiring, and I couldn't wait to watch it. Maybe that's why it was so disappointing.<br /><br />Mr King should go back to 'It', 'storm of the century', 'the langoliers', etc. <br /><br />Have to say 4/10 for this one.
