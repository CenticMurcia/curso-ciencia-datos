I first saw this film 5 years ago as a University student when it originally came out. I still remember how impressed I was afterward. I told my sister who was with me at the time, "I think that is the BEST Bollywood film I have seen so far". I recently saw this film again, and I remembered again why I loved it SO much the first time. This movie is a credit to Farhan Akhtar who has since directed the spectacular movie "Lakshya".He is a true talent to contend with in Bollywood,and certain more experienced directors, can take a leaf off his book. <br /><br />"Dil Chata Hain" works on SO many levels. It's an attempt at telling a mature story. NOT the same old plot exhausted to death, and no "over blown" Bhangra numbers either! The movie was content and script driven. It explores the many faces of love, and the changes that occur in friendships as people mature and move on with life. But what it shows also is that true friendship can overcome many an adversity, misunderstanding, and even time.The first movie about "Male-bonding" to come out of Bollywood!<br /><br />So beautifully told, this story captures the lives and loves of Akash, Sameer and Sidhart (Sid). Played brilliantly by Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Akshay Khanna.They are supported by Dimple Kapadia, Preity Zinta & Sonali Kulkarni. All the main actors give their best in this movie, and I cannot say one thing negative about any of their performances. (Except maybe that Sonali didn't have enough to do). The movie also includes a few characters that have only a few scenes to play but they play them well, and they ALL add value to the story. <br /><br />This movie was the turning point in Saif's career. Since DCH, he has gone from strength to strength, and his versatility as an actor has finally been recognized. As for Aamir Khan... what can I say? His performances are always stellar,as he is a "thinking" actor who gives his all to a character he plays.I have yet to see a "bad performance" given by Aamir. He never does things by half. Akshay is great and he too has always given fine performances in all his movies to date! Preity and Dimple play the next most prominent characters in the movie. Preity gave a very controlled performance, and Dimple was superb. She gave this movie that extra bit of "Oommf". I also love the way the story did not portray a clich√©d relationship between an older women, and younger man, and how they kept both the characters dignity in tact. <br /><br />The Akash-Shalini love story was touching too,as these are two people who never intended to fall in love with each other,but did.Akash,who does not believe in love, and Shalini, who is engaged to her surrogate parent's son.The scene in which her father tells Akash, "please look after her, as she is my daughter" was very emotional.But the best part was that it was not "over-dramatized".The emotions of the moment created it's own drama. <br /><br />All in all, this was a "coming of age" story.In the end, we see the three characters two years later, in the same place in Goa where they spend that last summer of youth together.At this point though,they have come full circle, and have moved on from "boys to men".We feel their maturity come through as they sit their talking,even though non of them say anything profound. <br /><br />In conclusion,all I can say is PLEASE make more intelligent and enlightening movies like this one!<br /><br />Farhan,very well done indeed!All the best!
