A must-see! One of the most delightful animated flicks ever! Just like the efficient worker bees in Bee Movie, this is what happens when everyone does their role right: the cast, the director, the writers, editors, the animators, etc. Everything just hums along smoothly with nary a glitch.<br /><br />Bee Movie works even if it is heavily reliant on the incredible comic timing of lead bee voice-over Jerry Seinfeld, who delivers the laughs as his whiny but likable stand-up comic personality is retained even in cartoon bee form. He plays Barry Benson, a fresh grad who goes against the drones of bees who are satisfied working one job for the rest of their lives in the comfort of their hive. He ventures out into the dangerous world and meets florist Vanessa Bloome (Renee Zellweger), who saves his life and helps him sue the human race for illegally taking bee honey for their own profit. Matthew Broderick plays his best friend and sympathetic foil Adam.<br /><br />The impressive graphics of Bee Movie draw you in, making you feel like you're part of it. The visuals are so vivid it's almost extra-sensory; it would be great to see this in 4D where you can even smell the flowers, feel the rain, wind and sunshine, and taste the honey! It's hard not to tear up and feel emotional in several parts of the movie, no matter how incredulous the plot is, unlike in other recent animated disappointments such as Enchanted and Shrek the Third. The dialogue, animation and story all appeal to adults and children alike; all that help make Bee Movie immensely enjoyable!
