The movie should have stayed true to the book wherein the first scene started with the Muggle Prime Minister being introduced to the new Minister of Magic and while he was being told about the ministry and how resent catastrophe were magic related....scenes o death eaters destroying the bridge, etc should have been background scene and not, not what was shown in the movie.<br /><br />I am so disappointed with the film. It was a total waste and it didn't do justice to the series. The first Harry Potter movie is so far the best for me. I wish they will get Chris Columbus or Peter Jackson (LOTR) to direct the Deathly Hallows.
