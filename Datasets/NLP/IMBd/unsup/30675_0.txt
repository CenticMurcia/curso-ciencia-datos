Like what has been said before, this movie shouldn't be compared too much to Tombstone, since they carried different story angles. I do, however, think that Costner was more what I have imagined Earp as than Russell was. I've always imagined him as somewhat quiet, and less prone to outburst, but what do I know?<br /><br />The plot carried over very well and pulled at your emotions with real gut-wrenching scenes. The tension between the Earps and the Clantons was very well depicted. You got the whole picture of what went on in the life of the legendary Marshall<br /><br />Kilmer vs. Quaid for Doc Holliday? Both were effectively symptomatic of tuberculosis, which symptoms mean more to you? Pale fever and a cold sweat (Kilmer), or just the rapid weight loss (Quaid)? Also, I don't think anyone can't really determine what kind of demeanor was right for the Doc, so I can't say which of the two actors were more inline there. Quaid was great and scored big in playing outside himself, but I have to go with Kilmer who managed the same, and consistently stole scenes with his "cool cat" portayal.<br /><br />As good an historical epic has ever been done!
