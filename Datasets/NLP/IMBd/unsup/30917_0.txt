Considering the average of the movie evaluation was 6.5/10 at IMDb when I had watched knowing, I was highly disappointed eventually. I cannot believe how Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times could give this movie an "A" and call it one of the best SF he has seen". However, according to him "The plot involves the most fundamental of all philosophical debates: Is the universe deterministic or random". I admit, this is interesting. However, did I get something wrong? This is just a very small part of the movie and in case it should be the main aspect,it has been handled very badly. Better listen to the 90% of critics who gave "knowing" a "C" or "D".<br /><br />The main problem of the movie concerns the numerous holes in the plot!!! The longer I watched the movie, the more questions came to my mind. For example, the list of numbers show the worldwide disasters, but the next two big ones are only in New York?????? Why was Calen (Koestler's son) still writing "numbers" after the big crash was forecasted? And in the end, I was just loving. I am sorry, but the whole "alien warned you, but needs ages to contact you directly" part is ridiculous. All the hassle with the 50years old list, no better way of communication? Sorry, I no way I can buy this.
