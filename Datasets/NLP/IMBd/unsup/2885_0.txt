I visit Loch Ness every year and can confirm that Quagmire is refreshingly realistic about the nature of lake monster hunting - getting soaked to the skin in the middle of nowhere and buying tacky souvenirs. Kim Manners' direction is beautiful, dragging all the misery and despair out of every raindrop and wet pair of jeans. The script is tight and full of lovely little moments, the not-as-daft-as-they-look locals who believe in the monster as long as it sells merch are especially funny and accurate. Chris Ellis and Timothy Webber give the principals stirling support, both giving vibrant performances that are a joy. I was always disappointed that there was never an X File set at Loch Ness - it seemed such an obvious thing to do - but Quagmire is a very close second best.
