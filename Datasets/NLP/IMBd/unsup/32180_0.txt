Erotic titling and opening scene of a prostrate naked woman sets the mood of an oft-told theme. "Do you love me?" asks the woman of her lover. And when he returns to his household and family "Do you love me?" asks his wife. The possibility of his furtive little game being found out adds to his sexual excitement. And this is an absorbing and titillating situation for the viewer as well. So we wait and see....<br /><br />The lovers secretly meet in an upper room in a hotel...the so-called blue room...usually on a Thursday when the coast is clear. But quite a few of the locals have figured out what is going on. Disregarding advice from his friends,Tono recklessly continues his love-making. It is pretty obvious he is playing a dangerous game and will get caught sooner or later.<br /><br />When the husband of his lover unexpectedly dies and later his own wife, Tono becomes prime suspect and is arrested on two counts. The film at this point becomes more interesting as the tension mounts.<br /><br />I don't understand the judicial system in Mexico but it looks pretty casual judged by this film. The investigating policeman demands the truth from the accused who continues to insist he is innocent of both crimes.<br /><br />The local baker is an expert bread maker but a woman full of hate and constantly pointing an accusing finger at Tono the wayward husband. Her sinister character is somewhat over-played I thought.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback behind prison bars as the police investigator probes for the truth. Important events in the story are then played out by the characters.<br /><br />There is a sudden twist in the story right at the end of the film that is bound to surprise. What follows is left to the imagination.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching.
