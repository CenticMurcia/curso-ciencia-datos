There's never been another movie like "Green Pastures." Seldom has there been such an outrageous premise, so original a conception of simple religiosity, such a deft accomplishment of a potentially disastrous idea. This is the Old (not the New) Testament as it might be imagined by impoverished black children in the Mississippi Delta before their world had electricity, running water, radio, or the opportunity of anything beyond the most elementary education.<br /><br />Rex Ingram exerts a quiet but stern and, by a wonderful paradox, very human authority as "De Lawd. The entire cast exudes the confidence of professionals and both the acting and the direction keep the film from ever descending into a minstrel-show debacle. It's a movie all Americans, regardless of race, religion, or their position on Darwin should be proud of. The tragedy - once again - is that so many talented actors were prevented by the racism of the times to achieve the professional success of white performers who, though no more talented, became familiar and durable stars. <br /><br />Well, there's some poetic justice here, because the film itself is an enduring monument to its players, and a reminder of one of racial segregation's most insidious effects: the denial to American culture - and to world culture - of the fullest contribution of outstanding artists simply because of the color of their skin.<br /><br />The warmth and humor of "Green Pastures" is indelible. The entire production, not least the choral numbers, remains world-class. The film is a must-see.
