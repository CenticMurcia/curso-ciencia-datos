I saw the review for this late one night on TV and i have to say, i was quite surprised to see Matthew from Eastenders doing a Ouija Board! It was a British film and I knew then immediately that I had to see it for that reason alone. I was one of the many people who were fed up of American horrors that are not even scary. It was 2/3 weeks before I actually i did get to see it at the cinema late one night with my friend and it was a good thing I did. It was an excellent film. I have never been so scared out of my life whilst watching a film! For the first time in my life it actually made me jump back in my seat- and that was pretty embarassing seen as there was a whole row of girls a couple of rows back!<br /><br />The plot itself is good and the scenes in which the djinn chases its victims down long flights of stairs and dark warehouse corridors were simply brilliant. The director had used all the resources to the limit and had used them well. I did feel that the film itself was very short and if they had more characters bring killed of, like in Scream, it would have been better but nevertheless it lives truly up to being called a 'horror film' and definitely makes Jeepers Creepers look like the tweenies. Americans should stop making horrors now and let the British take over as it clearly obvious that we are better at it!<br /><br />For a low-budget British horror, this is truly more than brilliant with a superb ending, superb actors and superb scare factor! And for a low budget film, this is wayy better than any American Hollywood blockbuster that I have ever seen this year. 'Signs' was a pure disappointment and it couldnt even scare my little 12 year old brother let alone me and it was labelled really scary and someone even wrote that 'you shouldn't see it alone'. HAHA, yes, you should take your friends with you to have a great laugh! Because it AINT SCARY! If you want scares, LONG TIME DEAD IS DEFINITELY THE FILM TO SEE.<br /><br />A brilliant 9/10. Maybe the film could have been longer.
