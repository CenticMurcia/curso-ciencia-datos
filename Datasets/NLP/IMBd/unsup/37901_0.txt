The former lead singer with "Fleetwood Mac," gives a concert at Denver's "Red Rocks" outdoor amphitheater in 1987, and it was a disappointment, at least to me.<br /><br />Being a fan of her smoky voice, pretty looks and song interpretations, maybe I expected too much. A lot of times you can find out just how good a singer is when you hear them in person, instead of the studio making them sound perfect.<br /><br />I found out Nicks isn't that good a singer as she sounds on disc. What's more, I was totally turned off and disgusted she resorted to profanity in a couple of her songs, even saying "G- damn" in one of them. From what I have read, she's into witchcraft, too, which is pretty weird. Anyway, her raspy voice sounded poor and this was not an impressive concert.<br /><br />I thought it might be fun to see and hear Mick Fleetwood and Peter Frampton, who are billed as guest stars, but they just played backup and didn't have much of a role in here. There are 14 songs in all, the best one being the finale although part of it is just her shaking hands with people in the audience.<br /><br />For a beautiful setting like Red Rocks, I thought the lighting was just so-so, not as dynamic as it good have been, sort of like Nick's performance.
