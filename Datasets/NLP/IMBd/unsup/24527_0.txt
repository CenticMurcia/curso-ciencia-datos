Don't want to add to any spoilers for this film; I wish for anyone wanting to see it to be as surprised of its quality as I am. I saw the preliminary character sketches for this film and was horrified at what the costuming and overall appearance of the characters were. Now, I've done a complete 180. Nearly everything worked in this film. Only really lacking was a kick-butt score for it. I'm a firm believer that music accents the emotional value and can add a great deal of excitement to any given scene. Music was a bit weak, but the rest was a gem. First comic book to film adaptation I have ever seen that the characters actually had depth. This should be a benchmark for any future comic book projects. Anyway, go and see it and see it in a big DTS or SDDS sound screen. You'll be anxious for the sequel when you leave the theater. Great action mixed with explanatory and character building scenes and was actually very funny in spots.
