I saw this for the first time on TV when I was a child. I remembered liking it a great deal-I think it was the first time I'd seen Liza Minelli. Watched it again today on Showtime and was amazed! Liza was fabulous-and the whole thing seemed so undated-that was a real surprise. Bob Fosse's choreography is still so modern looking and sexy. Halston's costumes were gorgeous and even when he put her in knickers (which believe it or not were IN for about 5 minutes during this time) she still doesn't look dated-you just think "Wow, I didn't remember KNICKERS looking that amazing"! The only thing that looks time-warpish is the hair and facial hair of her backup dancers. The guys have big, fluffy mustaches and it looks like she is being backed-up by 1970s porn stars. Other than that this special could have been done yesterday. The decision to do it live was perfect-Liza starts off quiet, and she just does a slow burn. By the end of the show her hair is plastered to her head with sweat and she is just burning and glowing and brilliant. An artist at the peak of her powers. Liza is just as talented as her famous mother, I think. She has all of Judy's raw talent & her incredible vulnerability, but with Liza you also get sex-I had forgotten how very sexy she was. By all means watch this special on Showtime or rent the DVD-you will not be bored.
