I enjoyed this movie very much.<br /><br />This is the only Lucille Ball/ Desi Arnaz biopic I've seen. I have yet to see "Lucy" with Rachel York.<br /><br />I liked how it started out with the beginning of I Love Lucy and flashes back to when Lucille Ball meets Desi Arnaz. Then it kind of flashes forward and you get both perspectives. It didn't let you know about how Lucille fought with Vivian Vance, or the fact that William Frawley had drinking problems. You get about as a good behind the scenes look as I think you'd get out of a biopic movie.<br /><br />I'd give this film a 7/10<br /><br />Thanks for your time.
