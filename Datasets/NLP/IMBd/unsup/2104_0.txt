For a black and white older movie to catch my attention as a 22 year old, it's gotta stand out. I first saw this version of mice and men back in the mid nineties on AMC channel. I was captivated. Lon Chaney Jr's role as as Lennie was Brilliant!!! So many Idividual performances in one movie WOW. Crooks, Candy, Curly, Slim, George, all with their own great performances. What a great scene when Lennie and Crooks are in his room talking about being lonely And no happy ending like most movies, made it seem more the real. I recorded it off of AMC years ago, and can quote it word for word any day of the week. This is a timeless masterpiece. If you haven't seen it your missing out. Definitely on my top 5 of all time. Please excuse any Mispellings as I have had a couple cold ones LOL!!!
