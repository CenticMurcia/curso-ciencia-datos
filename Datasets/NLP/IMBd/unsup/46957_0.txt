I think I must have watched the wrong film. So many people have given this rave reviews, saying how ass-kicking it is etc<br /><br />It was to me, a B movie lavished with an expensive budget. The plot (if it can be describe as such) was risible and must have had about 30 seconds thought put into it while the screenwriter was waiting for his coffee. And just how many sickening cliches can you cram into a single film? We're they going for a world record or something? Jeez.<br /><br />The action scenes were appalling rife with either pointless John Woo slo mo, or jerky blurry slo mo. This was probably to disguise how generic and badly choreographed they were.<br /><br />The characters were totally wooden and completely devoid of any sympathy whatsoever, the actors never really needing to concentrate on anything except the dreadful script they'd been given (with the exception of the main guy who had to speak two languages all the way through).<br /><br />Diabolical soundtrack which would suit any guff-filled B Movie you've ever seen.<br /><br />Breathtakingly poor camera work.<br /><br />I could go on but reading the full list would almost be as boring as watching this dross.<br /><br />Korean studios should make more films like Public Enemy instead of this expensive atrocity.<br /><br />Meh 2/10
