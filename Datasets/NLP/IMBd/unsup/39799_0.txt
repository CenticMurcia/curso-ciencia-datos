The film deals with gay issues and presents progressive and well thought out points of view but the film really needs the help of a good screenwriter, director and editor. The drama of the situations are robbed of their power by being recounted to us rather than shown to us. Several of the characters tell us their points of view rather than showing us. While I am an avid supporter of gay film, and I applaud this film's good intentions, I cannot recommend this film from a dramatic point of view. The old saw that "exposition is deadly" is proven true in this film.<br /><br />I do suggest that folks see it as there are worthwhile moments but perhaps you should reserve this for a `double feature' night and make sure that the other film has more of the conventional aspects of a well-told story about it.<br /><br />I also suggest that other film makers see it as an example of how the excitement can be sucked out of a storyline by too much exposition.
