Quagmire completes the "Queequeg Trilogy", the three episodes from season three that feature the tiny dog that Scully adopts. Quagmire sets the mood for the show right away with Scully's facial expressions. Mulder takes Scully out to the middle of nowhere on a Saturday to a wet, rainy, miserable place. Gillian Anderson does the perfect job in showing how bad Scully does not want to be there. She actually looks like she's in pain, she is suffering so bad. Some interesting things of note from this episode: We get to see Scully drive a boat for the first time in the series. I thought the shot of Scully chasing the dog leash was well done. And once again, I must say how miserable it must have been to shoot in Vancouver some of the time. Quagmire looks so wet and cold, and the actors just look miserable, which really helps for this particular episode. What makes this episode so good is that when the agents get stranded out on a rock in the middle of the lake, they have a real in depth discussion about Mulder's reasons and motives for chasing monsters all over. Scully compares him to Ahab from 'Moby Dick'. We get to learn a bit more as to what drives Mulder and how Scully feels about Mulder's ambitions. The show has a cool final shot that summarizes this episode quite well. Get stuck in Quagmire!
