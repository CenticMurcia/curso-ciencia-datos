As much as I love Rutger Hauer, I just couldn't enjoy this movie. Because some of the cops looked alike and because the filmmakers only attempted to explain half of an interconnected story in order to preserve the final surprise element, I wound up confused in the beginning (until they make it totally obvious that Hauer is being set up).<br /><br />Hauer is Nick Randall, a slick bounty hunter who is visited by Philmore Walker, an old partner (Robert Gillaume), who persuades Randall to take on a risky job involving Arab terrorists (I think they need the feds, not one bounty hunter for a job of this size). Only problem is, that Walker is in cahoots with the city police officials are actually working with the terrorists to bring Randall down. In constructing the story, the filmmakers try too hard to make some of it, but not enough of it known (at least sequentially), and for me at least, it turned out to be a difficult mess to sort through (again, until they make it obvious through at least half of the second act). Furthermore, there just wasn't enough develop among the characters (possibly, because there are too many people involved) that you never really get a real sense of anything.<br /><br />The only saving grace, however, are the action sequences. Plenty of car chases and explosions if you're in the mood for them.
