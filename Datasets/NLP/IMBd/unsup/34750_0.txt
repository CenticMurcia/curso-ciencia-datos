After viewing this film,being well aware just how far back the story of Flicka goes,and not having seen any of the other films based on Flicka,or read any books,I came away being pretty darn sure that the story has been told far,far better than this.First,let me start with the selection of Tim McGraw to portray the girls father.He was supposed to be this stern,put his foot down type of ranch owner and father,and he just isn't very convincing in the part.I'm not saying that he doesn't have potential as an actor.Perhaps he does.I'm saying that he wasn't right for this part.Also,the story was not told in a way that kept me interested,thereby leading me to believe that it has been told better.My advice would be to steer clear of this telling and view the classic version.It's too late for me to do the former,but you can bet I'll be doing the latter very soon.
