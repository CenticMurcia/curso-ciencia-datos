This is the best movie I have seen this last year. Being interested in the genre of Holocaust films I found this to be the most realistic yet. It does not flinch in showing the horror that existed in Auschwitz-Birkenau and particularly in the crematoria and gas chambers. This is the movie to show to those who claim "the Holocaust never happened." It may be horrifying in its portrayal of history. Let us hope by watching this movie that more Holocausts and genocides don't occur again.<br /><br />I have been interested in the Sonderkommando and read all the same source materials that Tim Blake Nelson consulted for this film. Miklos Nyiszli's "Auschwitz" and "Amidst the Nightmare of a Crime" compiled by members of the Sonderkommando (and buried near the crematoria in Birkenau) were the main sources Nelson used. His film kept true to events in both books. Some may say this film is a horror fest. Let us not forget that the Holocaust and the Nazis were a horror fest.<br /><br />David Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi and Mia Sorvino all deliver Oscar worthy performances. They make the characters believable. Nelson did an exceptional job directing this. Keitel had an instrumental part in seeing that this picture was made. The whole cast worked for less to be sure this important picture was made. I commend the whole cast, crew and producers for making this film. I feel it will be a contendor for many Oscars. This film is based upon the play of the same name Tim Blake Nelson wrote. When it played in New York it won numerous awards and received rave reviews.<br /><br />I hail this as the best most realistic Holocaust film ever made. Go see it if you desire to know the truth.
