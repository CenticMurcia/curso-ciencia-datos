If you haven't watched 'There's Something About Marry' then you might enjoy this lame movie .... Lame because every joke is lifted directly off 'Something About Marry'.<br /><br />Seems like nothing original is left in Indian film industry (or may be very little). Stay away from this piece of junk, watch 'There's Something About Marry' and you'll laugh throughout the movie. After watching the original you can watch 'DHP' just to compare how cheesy it is!! Its sad to see that good actors like OM Puri are working in such movies. As far as other actors are concerned they are ordinary actors not like Amir or Shahrukh who like to work in quality movies only.
