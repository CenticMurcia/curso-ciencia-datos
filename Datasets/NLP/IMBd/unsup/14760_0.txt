I really loved this movie. I live close to the set it was filmed at. The movie was made in Lebanon, OH and my cousins live there and they lived close to where they were filming. My cousin told me that they were filming another movie in Lebanon (also the location where a medical movie was made, but I can't remember what it's called). She invited me to spend the night with her and we walked down to the set on the very last day to meet some of the stars. I got to meet Melanie Griffith. She was so tall in person at the time. She was a very sweet person. I remember also meeting Jessica Wesson. Me and her clicked right away. She was the greatest person to hang out with. I couldn't believe how hot and sexy Adam La Vorgna was in person. I still have his autograph and picture of me and him in front of the ice cream parlor that they filmed at a couple of scenes. They were so tired on the last day we asked them if it was OK if we took them to the ice cream parlor and the director said that was fine. We ate ice cream and talked and laughed with them. Michael was so funny in person. He made a lot of us laugh. He was great. They were the nicest people I have ever met.
