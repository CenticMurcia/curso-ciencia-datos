Bruce Leddy tried his best giving the budget to make 'Shut Up And Sing' aka 'The Wedding Weekend'.<br /><br />The problem lies in the plot, Some moments are interesting, but usually bland.<br /><br />A group of guys who sang together in a college a Capella group reunite 15 years later to perform at a friend's wedding and discover how their lives have progressed -- and in some cases regressed -- since their college heyday, an idea that seems dated and the lack of face-value, disappoints all the way.<br /><br />Acting wise: Molly Shannon is the only actor who does her part well, while all the others try hard, though some manage.<br /><br />on the whole 'Shut Up And Sing' isn't what you expect.
