I checked this out through MST3K (as most have already pointed out). To tell the truth, I was pretty excited... being a huge Bond fan, and loving the small Bond roles like in OHMSS, but this was worse than B-Film "comedy". Allow me to lay out the plot of this fiasco:<br /><br />Sneaking dealings arise when Largo/Diabolico surfaces and kidnaps a patient of Dr. Connery. Apparently, Bond's brother (as mentioned by M) is a plastic surgeon with the special ability to hypnotize unsuspecting people Jedi style (within 2-3sec). For some ungodly reason, I suppose the real Bond was busy with more important things (I'd like to think getting plastered on a remote island). So, the MOD hires his brother to discover what's going on.<br /><br />Before you know it, Dr. Connery is taking out electric fence perimeters with a bow and arrow, showgirls in the middle of nowhere manage to take out an army convoy, and blind Arabs are weaving radioactive carpets. One may wonder where this will lead, well, Largo manages to unleash an EMP (they just called it a magnet) on a small mountain town in the Alps. At this point, I'm sure nobody would care, but no, a squad of horsemen with bows and arrows somehow appear and storm the enemy base.<br /><br />In the end, the day is saved by the dud, and he settles in by somehow managing to get a whole ship of women under his charm (more mind tricks I'm sure cause the desperate brother couldn't con his right hand into charm).<br /><br />Q, or someone pretending to be him, never makes an appearance, but you can expect three fine spy gadgets in this film: a bow with a spool, a knife that shoots its blade(used by a female villain, and also may I add a useless weapon compared to say... a gun), and a belt that becomes stiff for throwing as a javelin *rolls eyes*.<br /><br />Any Bond fan should vier away from ever being disgusted by this movie.
