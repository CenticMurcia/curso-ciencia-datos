What makes this movie so bad? Is that the insane plot about Hulk Hogan's "retired" secret agent finding a treasure map on the back of a turtle and then following it? Is it the sad waste of talent of Robert Vaughan? Is it Grace Jones's almost insulting turn as the baddie and the usual assortment of incompetent henchmen? Or is it the patronising and quite frankly unbelievably immoral ending?<br /><br />Surely somebody, at some stage of making this picture, must have realised that the only people who were going to watch this was desperate parents who drop their kids in front of rubbish like this and call it "family entertainment"? It's cheap, crass, embarrassing and just not worth the effort. I realise that I may not be the target audience but even so, children should not have to put up with awful movies like this one. Avoid like a nasty aunt at Christmas!<br /><br />Still, the scenery looked nice.
