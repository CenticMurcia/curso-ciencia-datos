I hoped for nice Star Wars Cartoon with a nice story, good drawings and kool characters. But instead I got this...<br /><br />I think everything about this movie was really bad. The whole style how it is painted.. it reminds me of some old Hanna Barberba Cartoons.<br /><br />The story was like.. I can't even say what exactly has been the story just by watching this "cartoon". You have to watch at least Star Wars Episode 2 to understand a little whats going on.<br /><br />The Action was about 95% of this whole cartoon. And this action was really annoying because it always happened the same thing. Bang bang here, bang bang here, if you would count the shots I think there will be about 2000 or more.<br /><br />There was practically no dialogue.<br /><br />I recommend to keep your fingers away from this B-Movie Action Cartoon drawn like a mix of Heavy Metal Fakk 1 and the Jetsons.
