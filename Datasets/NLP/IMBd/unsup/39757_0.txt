This made for sci-fi channel movie was so bad it was funny! Only watched it for Costas...and thank the Lord for Tivo allowing me to rush thru this campy B-Movie wanna be. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes had a better sub-plot than this laugh riot. <br /><br />This movie used a lot of stock footage. What was disturbing was the shot of lower manhattan smoking....I am just SURE they used some 9-11 footage...and I HOPE they didn't...because that would be wrong!<br /><br />The special effects were tolerable for a TV movie. Standard overacting by the extras in all the "disaster" scenes made this a watchable laugh...<br /><br />Bet it's not what they intended though... (generous 3 out of 10)
