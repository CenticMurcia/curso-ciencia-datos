This movie seems to owe a huge debt to Final Destination, in that the film is primarily about horrible fate hunting down a group of teens one-by-one.<br /><br />I found the characters even more cardboard-cutout than those in F.D. Main difference is that here the threat is personified, but the boogity stays so undeveloped that this is a weakness. The father should have been developed quite a bit more, and the landlord could have been a very interesting pivot point for the story, instead of serving merely as a red herring or distraction.<br /><br />The fact that the ending was actually an ending, rather than a Hollywood sequel-tease was nice, however.<br /><br />Watchable, but only just. If, however, you go all weak-kneed over mush-moufed British accents, you might like it more than I did.
