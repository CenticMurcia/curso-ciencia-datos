it's cheesy, it's funny, some parts are badly acted.<br /><br />the eye talks about these teenagers trying to see ghosts by following this thai rule book one of the main characters found. The book mentions that there are 10 ways too see ghosts so the 5 people venture off to see these ghosts then one day after they played about 3-4 of them there friend disappears when playing one of the games. So they go to HK trying to escape these ghosts but yet there still hunted, so they have to finish the last one in order to not see ghosts.<br /><br />The story is disjointed near the end, and in a lot of ways did not make sense for a fact that they never really mentioned how they can stop seeing ghosts. It would of made much more sense if they had rules in the book saying that you must all complete these 10 tasks in order not too see ghosts or something or hinted in some way how not to see ghosts.<br /><br />They also never really resolve the problem since one of the main characters for some reason has the power to stop seeing ghosts bought the book then his grandmother figured out that somebody is putting a spell on them.<br /><br />What was the spell casters motive? why them? is he there just to mess around with kids? you see it's very disjointed but yet i still enjoyed the movies and some of it's ideas it had. it's a cheesy horror movie with some decent ideas into it that should of been thought about a lot harder if it wanted to be taken seriously.<br /><br />but since you see breakdancers in the movie break dancing with a guy who is possessed i don't think this movie was really made to be that much of a serious horror flick.<br /><br />I personally liked the setup a lot more then the execution of the rest of the movie.the beginning started out pretty well with some interesting team ghost seeing but ultimately failed due to disjointed story telling, and decent CG effects. Nothing really scared me much in the movie but i'm still giving it a 7/10 why? because i enjoyed this average horror movie for it's cheesiness and interesting ideas and cool dancing lol.
