It is a purely french movie, with a subtle character analysis , a clever and calculated progression . But with a hint of dark and anguishing 30's movie . Two main characters : a pretty young woman, a wife and a mother with a normal life. Girl meets boy. Classic... But there is a twist, the man is a duplicitous, attractive and repellent persona . The end is too delectable to be revealed. But, as the young woman, the spectator is drawn to the Machiavellic character , and the more we sense its dangerous personality, the more we want to get close to him. Until the last minute , lulled by the intense music, we are hypnotized by the relationship , by the love and death link between Isabelle Carr√© and Benoit Poolvoerde (both INCREDIBLE). A must see.
