I found 7 Zwerge to be a delightful German film and highly recommend it.<br /><br />However, it contains some language based jokes which don't translate well to English, so beware if you don't speak German and watch the film with subtitles to miss a few of the good jokes. But there is still plenty there for those who don't speak the language and overall the plot and humor translates quite well.<br /><br />A great film with a fairly simple plot that is great to watch if you are trying to learn German but also great for anyone who really loves foreign films.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of German comedy!
