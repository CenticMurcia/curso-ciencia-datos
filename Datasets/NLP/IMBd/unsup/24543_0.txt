I've never heard of this comic before and I hate comics in general, but I enjoyed this movie. I think some people are losing it a little with their big wraps of "X-Men" though. It can surely only be described as a good fun movie that's not to be taken very seriously. Still Hugh Jackman was awesome and it managed to entertain me, and that's all I was after.
