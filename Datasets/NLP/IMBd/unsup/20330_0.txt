Although it wasn't quite horrible enough to make my list of the ten worst movies of all time, "Dead Doll" sure tried hard to make the cut. The technical quality and production values were actually pretty good, but there is no reason, compelling or otherwise, for anything that happens in the film past the initial murder which we are shown via flashback ad nauseam. The characters are simply motivated out of the blue. It wasn't funny. It wasn't scary. It seems to be a vehicle to show Romi Koch's tits as many times as possible. The only way I could describe it to someone who really was interested in knowing is as a chain of events involving a bunch of sick and sad people all driven by the mere presence of the doll to do things that no rational person would consider - and do nothing very interesting at all in the process. The logic flaws in the story not-withstanding, and the inevitable continuity errors that plague through-out, this was just dumb. The misogynistic adolescent wet-dream of an abuse sufferer. My sympathies to anyone who spent actual cash on this one.
