I had heard a lot for this film, which is considered a classic for the Indian cinema. It is true that, in comparison with other Bollywood films of the period, is far better, as it brings a fresh look coming straight from the Italian neo-realist school. But Bimal Roy is a bad imitator. He gives the portrait of the peasants and of their life in Colcatta in a persuasive way, but his story is full of unnecessary melodrama, as all life's misfortunes seem to have conspired in order to fall on Shambhu's head. Additionally, the plot is naive, the (largely) amateur actors do their best but without significant results, and the songs sound very dated. Overall, what remains after the end is a feeling of disappointment. I have rated with 4 out 10.
