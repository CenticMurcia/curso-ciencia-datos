How could Willem Defoe and Samuel L. Jackson associate themselves with this piece of crap? I have seen better comic books.<br /><br />The only thing worse than the acting was the clearly improbable plot.<br /><br />The special effects were laughable.<br /><br />The acting was stiff and not credible.<br /><br />The storyline must have been written by a five year old.<br /><br />It takes far less than ten lines to describe this movie.<br /><br />Too bad the lowest rating I could assign was a one.<br /><br />Oh all right, the blonde was kind of hot.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it took less time to write this screenplay than it did to watch it, even on fast forward.
