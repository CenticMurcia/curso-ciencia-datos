The movie begins with Aamir Khan trying to win over kajol..The first 90 minutes was so bad..i thought i would die..I think i had a good idea of what it would have felt, if they hung me upside down with a bee up my ass..the first 90 minutes was so very bad.<br /><br />Then the next 10, the story took a turn and i was like maybe I will live through the movie and not go to rehab or bang my head against the wall..but that's when it goes downhill again. The film doesn't walk downhill, it falls straight down and drags you by your balls.<br /><br />The next 90 minutes were worse than the first 90.. i never imagined that could be possible but it was... i ceased to exist as an individual after that movie and now roam the roads of New York like a homeless bum..<br /><br />The second half of the movie is supposedly taken from one of the best novels of all time _ the eye of the needle..Bolloywood has a great talent.. they can take the best and turn it into a piece of crap in minutes..<br /><br />Eye of the needle is so good that you support the bad guy, and when he's about to die you feel bad for him.. here i felt bad for myself all the people who had actually paid to watch this crap...they need to pay us back and pay for our visits to the therapist...<br /><br />If someone can really walk out of this movie and say with a straight face that it actually OK..i will not only be surprised but will know that there are dumber people than Paris Hilton and Jessica Simpson in this world..<br /><br />I really have seen porno films with a better story line than this..and that too after they copied it from a great novel.. SCREW BOLLYWOOD..<br /><br />and aamir khan is supposed to be good and he doesn't act in any movie, he picks and chooses the best.. if this is the best, i want to see the ones he rejects.. Wow, if that was possible..<br /><br />3 hrs of crap with icing on it..ENJOY..
