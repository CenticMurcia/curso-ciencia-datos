"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"-- these were the last words of Jesus on the cross, and is the translation of the title of this film.<br /><br />Minimal dialogue, beautiful sounds, desolate scenery-- With all of those aspects, I found 'Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthani' to be a beautiful film. The story in itself is something unique and untouched before-- an illness that drives people to suicide, the only cure being sound... Acting by Asano Tadanobu only makes the film more stunning-- he plays his usual disconnected and silent character, but it was very effective in this film, maybe more so than in his other works.<br /><br />Combining the crazy guitar of 'ELECTRIC DRAGON 8000V' with the subtle beauty of 'Last Life in the Universe', I found 'Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthani' to be a very interesting, enjoyable film of beauty and disconnect.<br /><br />I can see where some people would not like this film-- the plot isn't very clear at times, and minutes and minutes pass by with almost no words spoken at all. A melancholic feeling is carried on throughout the entire movie-- with the slow, sorrowful piano often playing in the background, I might even call 'Eli Eli' a bit depressing. But if you're interested in artistic films that take you on a journey, then I think you should see 'Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthani?'.<br /><br />I doubt that this movie will ever be for sale on DVD in Europe or North America... But if you speak Japanese, definitely buy the DVD from a seller in Japan.
