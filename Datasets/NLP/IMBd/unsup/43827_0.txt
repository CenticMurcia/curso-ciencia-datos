This movie was really bad. The only saving graces are Bill Murray and Larry Bird's all to brief appearances. We have definitely found something Jordan can't do and that is act. That is kind of bad considering he is playing himself in this one. Though most of his costars weren't there, so it might have been difficult. At least he stopped after this one unlike Shaq who made four or five pictures...Thank God Phil Jackson came along and refocused him. As for the plot being like a Muppets movie it is. A few appearances here and there from a surprise celebrity, the whole working with live actors. It just did not seem to be a Looney tunes movie. Though they stopped being Looney a long time ago. I liked Daffy Duck when he was, well, daffy...he has been smart aleck duck for a while now. It just doesn't feel right. All the Looney Tunes on one team, some being life long enemies...and what is the point of introducing the bad guy voiced by I think Danny DeVito. The Martian has always been trying to take over the world, why not just let it be him. Also, what is up with the girl bunny? Why introduce a new character? I guess we just had to be politically correct. Well this one may be good for the kiddies, but most of us are going to recognize it for what it is...one long commercial. I saw a clip from the next Looney Tunes movie and it is even more Muppet looking than this one
