This movie was simply crappy. First off I was expecting something else entirely, some one told me this movie was like The Road Warrior or something along the lines of post-apocalyptic future. Pierce plays a french anthropologist who is being harassed by metalhead/punk bikers who may or may not be some kind of ghostly creatures. Its a pretty stupid concept which is not scary at all and also can be a little confusing at times. I really don't find the concept scary at all, so If I hang out with these ghostly metalheads (like I would hang out with metalheads in the first place) I will go crazy? Lame dude. Nothing about this movie was scary at the least, and it never properly explained how this so called nomads, came to be. You've got better stuff to do, trust me.
