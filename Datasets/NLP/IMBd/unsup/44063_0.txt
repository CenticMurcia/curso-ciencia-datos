Badly scripted, acted and shot. Everything feels really rushed, especially the pacing of the shots... one minute a character is fighting off a zombie, only 3 seconds later he's 40 paces down the street... it seems the director really liked the matrix but had no idea what he was doing... the cut scenes in the video game are better directed.<br /><br />The plot has been rewritten from the games, but instead of refining it, they have taken the games premise and just added ludicrous plot points. The video game was better written, and that's saying something.<br /><br />Spoilers BELOW ****<br /><br />By the end of the film the story has gotten so dumb, The main bad guy of the film, "Nemesis" becomes good (?!), and the main character Alice has strangely gained mind powers and she seems to be able to kill people just by looking at them!!?!?!?!<br /><br />Utterly stupid... don't waste your time with it.
