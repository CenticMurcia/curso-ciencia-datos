Red Dwarf is, without a doubt, my absolute, all-time, favourite TV program. I absolutely love everything about it. The performances are brilliant, and considering when Craig Charles joined the crew it was his first acting job, that's not to be underestimated. The story writing is superb. The jokes are sharp, witty and extremely hilarious. I wouldn't go as far as saying that it's the funniest thing I've EVER seen, but that isn't all that makes it my favourite program.<br /><br />I have every series on DVD and watching them repeatedly is somewhat a hobby of mine. The way the characters are developed is brilliant and every single story of every episode is genius, clever and brings you into the Dwarf world more and more. Other than making me break out in fits of laughter every other line, it also offers intense entertainment through its action and adventures. Despite the fact that Lister's a 25 year old Liverpudlian space bum, Kryten is a robot, Rimmer is a hologram and the Cat is, well, a Cat, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor wrote every episode and every series so beautifully that I can really relate to the characters and feel like I'm a part of their world when I watch it.<br /><br />This is no doubt one of a long line of classic British comedies that I would love to see brought back to life, the only difference is that this SHOULD be reborn. The eighth series ended with a terrible cliff hanger that was, sadly, not to be resolved, and I really think that the BBC should pull it's finger out of it's cavity and commission a ninth series to give the show the full, complete conclusion that it deserves. It was a waste to let the Red Dwarf era fizzle out all those years ago and I hope to god that something gets done about it.
