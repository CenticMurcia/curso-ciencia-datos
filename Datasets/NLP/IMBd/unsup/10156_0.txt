As a retired Christian minister, I have perhaps a different view of the movie than some of the other reviewers.<br /><br />I felt that Laforgue,the Jesuit Priest, showed amazing courage to undertake his mission under the most difficult of circumstances.<br /><br />Director Bruce Beresford has addressed the issues of clashing cultures in several of his other films: Driving Miss Daisy, Mr. Johnson for example. And he presents the complexities of culture anew in this film.<br /><br />I was struck by the absolute beauty of Qu√©bec and the film's cinematography.<br /><br />Back to Laforgue for a moment: here is a protagonist that accomplishes his mission with wisdom, intellegence, prayer, dependence upon his faith, lack of violence, and persverance.<br /><br />
