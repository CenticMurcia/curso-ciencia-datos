Full of (then) unknown actors TSF is a great big cuddly romp of a film.<br /><br />The idea of a bunch of bored teenagers ripping off the local sink factory is odd enough, but add in the black humour that Forsyth & Co are so good at and your in for a real treat.<br /><br />The comatose van driver by itself worth seeing, and the canal side chase is just too real to be anything but funny.<br /><br />And for anyone who lived in Glasgow it's a great "Oh I know where that is" film.
