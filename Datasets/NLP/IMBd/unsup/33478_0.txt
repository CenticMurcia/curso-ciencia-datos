I've seen hundreds of poor films. My friends and I often watch films in a "Mystery Science Theatre 3000" setting: watching the worst movies we can find and make fun of them for the purpose of entertainment. That being said, it is safe to assume that I have seen terrible films such as "Shrunken Heads", "Doctor Gore", "Night of the Scarecrow", and "Miner's Massacre".<br /><br />This "film", however, is absolutely terrible from start to finish. I was somewhat put at ease at the beginning of the film when it became obvious that this film did not take itself seriously (which CANNOT be said for most bad movies). However, this film instead tries to be a spoof (of many things) and fails at every single attempt. As a film, a 5 year old could create a movie with better technical value. The sound, film quality, acting, and dialogue are bottom-of-the-barrel bad. I did not rent this movie thinking that it would be "Citizen Kane", but the problems with this film go FAR beyond the lack of ANY technique. This film tries to make several types of jokes (situation jokes, juvenile jokes, etc), and fails every single time. I cannot imagine anyone in the universe laughing at ANYTHING in this movie.<br /><br />Basically, if you rent this, I hope God has mercy on your soul. Odds are you will not survive "Cheerleader Ninjas", which could very well be the worst film ever created.
