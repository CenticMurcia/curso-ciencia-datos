This is a muddled mess of a movie that has something to do with people who were born in a particular New York City apartment building being evil and how they become Lurkers undead creatures if they die at that building. I'm not really sure what happens because I don't think it was ever clear. In the films favor the muddledness of the movie does add some creepiness to the film because you never can get a handle on what is really happening, but at the same time the film falls apart because what you do understand doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense. An exploitation "semi-classic" by Roberts Findlay this is the sort of thing that would have played in the old Times Square grind-houses. Actually the one good thing about this film is the copious shots of New York in the late 1980's which record the city before urban renewal changed everything for the better. This film feels like its related to Findlay's Prime Evil which has many of the same actors and locations. For those seeking to see every horror film ever made or those wishing to track the final films of the grind-house theaters and early days of home video.
