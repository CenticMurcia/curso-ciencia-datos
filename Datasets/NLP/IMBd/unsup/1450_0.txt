I really love Piven and I have always felt he should have been the leading man in most of the films he's in. In this movie he really gets his chance to show his stuff. And he blows it out of the water with his charm, and personality. The movie is cute, funny, and makes you cry (just a little). Truly a great flick to watch on valentines day or a girls night in. My mother and all of my girlfriends (some who don't even like the Piv!!!) think that this movie is really good to watch on a Friday night. Piven's performance of a guy who just wants to get to know the girl is endearing and makes you wish you were the girl. The father and the son relationship is fantastic and sweet. And you'll wish there was a little violence between Piven and the agent.
