This is like Rudy for the birds. In this movie Ewan McGregor plays Valiant, a young pigeon during WWII hoping to join the Royal Homing Pigeon Service (RHPS).<br /><br />Valiant is younger and smaller than his fellow recruits, but has high spirits. The RHPS has suffered great losses during the war. Squadrons A thru E have all perished to Von Talon's (Tim Curry) falcons. It is up to Valiant and the rest of squadron F to get the correspondence back to England.<br /><br />This film was cute and maybe kids will like it, however, I was disappointed. There is not a lot to the story. Bird joins service, bird save the day, and that is about it. The movie is a little more than an hour long. In it's defense, the animation was good.<br /><br />There are a few laughs from John Cleese who plays Mercury (a pigeon who gets captured) but not enough for the whole movie. Most of the other characters really lack personality. Unless the kids really want to see this, I would not recommend it.
