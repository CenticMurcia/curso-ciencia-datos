This film is hardly a masterpiece, though it does have some good moments and plenty of action. Really it should have been named "Broken Helicopter" -- by my rough count they wreck at least 3, maybe 4, helicopters during the course of this film.<br /><br />Travolta is over-the-top, of course, and Slater is fine in his role. Howie Long does a good job as the henchman.<br /><br />I wouldn't spend money to see this, but if it's on cable and you're in the mood for a lot of wrecked helicopters, check it out.
