My question to Blake Edwards would probably be "why?" I guess he grew old, felt a bit nostalgic, missed the series too much and realized he had to carry on with the panther-saga despite the fact that there's no sense in it. We could've managed without "Son of the Pink Panther" but unfortunately we have to live with the fact that it saw the daylight and be thankful "Son of the Pink Panther strikes again" didn't. (I hope Blake doesn't read this - I might give him an idea!)<br /><br />I've watched it three times and only because it's part of the movie series I love and I wanted to find even something good in it. Actually there's one quite a wonderful thing in this flick: opening credits and especially the superb version of the pink panther theme. What about the actual movie? When I saw it for the third time I smiled patronizingly couple of times and that was like a victory to me. Roberto Benigni is clearly a funnier comedian than the idiotic Ted Wass in "Curse of the Pink Panther" but he can't save a film that's doomed to failure from the beginning. "That felt good!" Yeah right.<br /><br />2 out of 10
