The Twilight Zone ... The Outer Limits ... But wait. Lets go ... One Step Beyond. This series was, and remains, classic. The episodes, based at least in part on factual stories, shine. The stars? Great names, some caught early on in their careers, with lots of talent. The structural aspects of the various episodes themselves are very well done given the techniques and equipment available at the time. The host, John Newland, had a very benign style all his own. My own experience with this series is, perhaps, a bit different than some others. I understand when it ran originally, and that it was in rerun mode for sometime after that. Funny thing, child of the 60s that I am, and born in the 50s, I NEVER heard of it or saw an episode until March, 2007. History lesson: The 60s? There were TWO, count 'em ... two, primary networks. NBC and CBS. ABC, and One Step Beyond was an ABC program, was still an up and comer with out that many affiliate stations. The area I was raised in, well, we got two TV stations. Right ... NBC and CBS. It was past the mid-sixties, literally, before I knew there was anything else around. And then only because I moved into another section of the country. So One Step Beyond? Never heard of it till I saw it on DVD. And ya know what? I love it. Creepy, huh?
