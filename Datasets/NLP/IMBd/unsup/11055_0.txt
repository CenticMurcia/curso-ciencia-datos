I love Linda Howard's books, (although I found 'Loving Evangeline' less likeable than any of her others, and the lead character Robert Cannon an unredeemable rake) but as the previous reviewer said, this movie is crap. There is absolutely no similarity between the book and the movie. Even in it's own right this movie has a total lack of redeeming qualities. I feel like Ms. Howard deserves an apology from the producers for doing such a thorough hack job of her book. If you have the option pick up another Howard book instead of watching this nonsense.
