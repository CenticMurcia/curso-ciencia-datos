If you like horrible, campy movies,<br /><br />you might like "Kill Squad".<br /><br />But the real problem is we were serious when we made it. oops. I never made a penny on this movie. I guess that's o.k. Most of you were very kind in your comments Thank you for that. Your nice people. Someone mentioned that they bought the movie on Ebay for 6 cents. That was still too much to pay.I hope you never have the depressed shock to shoot a movie and have your voice looped without your permission or notice.There's nothing like the feeling of being laughed at by movie goers in Norway.
