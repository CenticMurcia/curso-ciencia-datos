lol one night my friend & I were watching this movie since her parents rented it. we literally hid under the blanket after all of those frightening moments. also we were afraid to go into the bathroom and look in the bathtub after watching this film. Robert De Niro & Dakota Fanning provide excellent acting throughout the movie. However, I'm not sure if I really liked those frightening moments. It feels like you're in a haunted house in your own living room. They're those "jump-out of nowhere" scary things. Also, I found some parts of it gross, like when that police officer is in the basement and they show his icky face...o_O Although I rate this movie 8/10, overall I found this film scary yet interesting. ***Dont have your kids aged 10 & under watch this movie - it might give them nightmares & they may be afraid to go into the bathroom***
