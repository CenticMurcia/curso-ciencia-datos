OK, so let's cut it short.<br /><br />Apocalypse. I understood that part. No petrol. OK, i dig that too. No electricity without fuel ? My intelligence points fingers to the hydro energy, and eolian one. But, it's a movie, so i step over it. Random city - fine with me. They don't have what to eat - mmm, well it was summer and humanity managed to live ~ 4000 years without those specific sources too. Pick the f***ing apple in the tree ??????? Yet again, i'm indulgent, considering it just a small error in brain functioning maybe. OK, monsters kick in (big & stupid kind of human monsters, the message passed to the audience. They are big & got muscles, but that's all, probably). They line up like Australia rugby team. The good guys got a rifle and a gun, yet the rifle isn't used once in the movie. <br /><br />Pretty much sums it up. Awful waste of time with this movie.<br /><br />The acting wasn't that bad, but the script is just plain awful. Every single action is predictable. <br /><br />I wonder how the directors find the necessary money for movies as bad as this one.<br /><br />Waste of talented actors.
