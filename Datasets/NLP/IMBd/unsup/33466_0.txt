I have seen a lot of movies and this is by FAR the worst I ever seen. My wife and I couldn't stop watching it out of disbelief. I must admit we laughed a lot because it was so bad. If your looking for nudity, there is plenty but I've seen a lot better. The computer geeks are portrayed by having guys wear Star Trek uniforms. As far as I could tell, the "star" Kira Reed doesn't even play a character, just a body double in a fantasy scene.<br /><br />Once in a while I like to look for the worst looking title I can find because bad movies make you appreciate everything else in life more. If you ever feel like watching a grade C movie, this is a must see. Also try and find "Hillbillies In A Haunted House".
