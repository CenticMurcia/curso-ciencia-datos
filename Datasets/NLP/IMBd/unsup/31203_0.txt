You may agree or disagree with the vision this documentary exudes. I certainly thought the steps taken where a bit rash at some places. I do agree however, with the message which is given as a whole.<br /><br />Regardless of what your opinion is on current day socio/economic/political society. This documentary is of such outstanding cinematographic quality, that it just cannot be ignored. It looks like they went through all the pieces of film of the last 4 decades to make this! And the use of sound is simply astonishing.<br /><br />I usually loathe the 'leading' documentary, like Michael Moores cheap propaganda I just refuse to watch out of principle. However, 'What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom' is very direct and conscious about it guiding the viewer. To redeem itself it simply contains so much facts and correct historical reference, it doesn't become a 'mockumentary'.<br /><br />If you do not agree with the vision that we are all trapped in a system of numbers and targets, just see this film document as you would a riefenstahl. Commend it on it's graphical excellence supported with great sounds, a vicious style and sublime directing. See it anyway if you like (political) documentaries.<br /><br />If you are a person that does connect with the message this document conveys: Try to see it as soon as you can and be enthralled.
