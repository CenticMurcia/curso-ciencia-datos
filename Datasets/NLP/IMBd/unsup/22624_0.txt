This is such a wonderful version of the movie Brigadoon. I by far remember it as being far better than the one with Gene Kelly in it. I would absolutely love to purchase it in DVD and have tried literally for years to find it. No luck. If anyone out there knows where you can get a copy of it in DVD, please let me know. Thank you. I liked it better than Gene Kelly's version because I love Robert Goulet's singing. There's nothing wrong with the other version just that I remember loving this one. I was only about 13 when I saw it and have never been able to view it since then. This movie is a little more updated than the earlier version. It still retains the quality of the original but as I stated, I love Robert Goulet's singing and I loved how he played the part of Tommy. This movie would quickly sell in DVD format so if anyone out there with the knowledge of how to get it put on DVD, please do so.
