I've seen a lot of films but this is easily the one with the all-time worst dialogue. Also proof positive that Theresa Russell = horrendous film every time. It's not even possible to imagine how bad this film is -- it defies description. Ever worse -- I saw it at a film fest billed as one of the "Best of Erotic Shorts." If this was the best -- god help us, what was the worst?
