The movie is utterly predictable. The story is black and white, good guys vs. bad guys, no in between. ALL the cliches have been used in this movie, cheesy lines and all...<br /><br />It's like they took some of the best lines of good classic american action movies, and made the actors recite them, one after the other... I mean, there's a scene where they're in the middle of enemy fire, and yet they stop to deliver an exchange of like 4-5 lines that completely useless to the story line, but i guess some writer thought it was "cool".<br /><br />I'm surprised they didn't include the lines "I'll be back" or "Yippi-ka-yeah!", they put all the others...<br /><br />and of course, all the storyline cliches were there... The woman that shows up in a squadron of men, they make fun because she's a woman, she proves herself to be just as worthy, one of the guys falls in love with her. And at the end, she even goes to rescue the guy and messes up and so our hero has to rescue her back... UGH!!<br /><br />and not to forget the shot of the chopper flying home with the bright red sunset behind it and the fuel smoldering in the sun...<br /><br />then the chopper returns home and they are greeted by all their army buddies, just like in Top Gun...<br /><br />but then, they start chanting "USA! USA!" what was that????? i mean, even in the best, most patriotic movies they don't do that, especially since this wasn't even a WAR where the USA won against another country... They went to bust a drug lord's cartel!!! How is that a victory for the USA???? and who goes around chanting "USA! USA!", rather than hugging and shaking hands with your friends that have just come back from a dangerous mission!!!
