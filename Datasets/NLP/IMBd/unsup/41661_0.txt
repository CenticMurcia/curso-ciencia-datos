neat little horror/exploitation flick about mutated frogs/salmon ?! the monsters are cheap ripoffs of the Alien creatures but were done by EFX genius Rob Bottin, clearly an early effort. lots of jiggly young thangs pop up throughout the flick and the monsters serve as a good excuse to rip off their bikinis. furthermore, there is a small raft of established b-list actors/actresses that make it interesting. good for late night viewing
