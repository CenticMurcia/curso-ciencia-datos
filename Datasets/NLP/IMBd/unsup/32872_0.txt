Ugh. Awful. Didn't last much past point one. Violent without<br /><br />remorse; predictable without restraint; terrible beyond belief.<br /><br />Even my own first self-rejected and childish screenplay was better than this!<br /><br />Women should be picketing this piece of trash. It's abusive and condescending. The writer and director should be ashamed they spent the money this type trash.
