It could be The Lord of the G-Strings: The Two Towers. Yeah. Anyway, this is a typically weak, but harmless Seduction Sinema movie. My favorite part, besides the obvious, are two names: Smirnof and Ballem. They are funny. I kept wondering why Dildo Saggins name wasn't Dildo Packin. I realize that Saggins is closer to Baggins, but isn't Packin a much better image? Hmm. And the ending, wouldn't it be better if there was actually some want to get rid of the G-String, that would make it funnier that there, essentially is no ending. Thoughts? Now, back to the obvious. Misty Mundae has nice little breasts with light pink nipples, AJ Khan's butt centered, stripper dancing is very pleasant, and Ruby Larocca's short cameo as a sultry barmaid seduced by the horny Mundae is a highlight. Also, all wood nymphs should have tongue piercings. That is all.
