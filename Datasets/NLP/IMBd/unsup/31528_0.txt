It doesn't happen very often that I rate a movie 10 out of 10. Not even "Citizen Cane" got this highest mark.<br /><br />But "Gloomy Sunday" really deserves it. A film that brings real pulsating life onto the big screen: Love - (mainly) three men who try to find their luck with the same woman.<br /><br />Friendship - between two men and a woman. Loyalty to the end. Betrayal - Hans turns out not to be a real friend of Ilona and L치szl칩. Melancholia - they do what they have to do, what life demands of them. Passion - in the good and the bad sense of that word. Revenge - not all sinners can get away with it, even if it takes time... The background for all this is the 30s and 40s in Budapest, Hungary, the Nazi threat right before your entrance door.<br /><br />You might argue that the song itself isn't as powerful as you might expect it. All right. But the script is superb, a story that could really have happened like this, a narrative that doesn't bore you and develops it's characters properly so you understand them. Without inflating them to some unrealistic capsules. The figures aren't painted black and white, there is the grey you usually find in real life. The performances of the main actors are superb. Thinking of Ben Becker and Joachim Kr칩l this isn't a surprise. But also Erika Maroz치n and Stefano Dionisi, which I haven't seen in another movie before, do everything to grant them an Academy Award.<br /><br />Maybe I can't express my admiration properly in English (which is a foreign language for me), but if anything I wrote gave you the idea that the movie might be interesting ... give it a try!
