What a fantastic movie, I've seen this movie many times and it's just as god and funny every time. Audery Tautou's performances is amazing, she is perfect as Amelie, she really make this movie flying! The atmosphere is also fantastic. Well, I can say that everything is perfect in this movie, everythingÂ… you have to see it, is just so fantastic that you almost wound believe it. A suburb 10 out of 10.
