Some people consider it necessary that I warn you that Crucial Plot Elements are exposed in my review. I feel it is more Crucial that I Warn You to not see this movie. Here's why:<br /><br />Never before have I felt so misled by reviews from you-know-who (2 Thumbs Up?!) and this site's resident reviewer (3 stars?!), not to mention the jacket cover, all claiming this be to be a Fun Comedy. Well if your idea of a comedy is watching a woman get drunk, get beat up, almost raped, live with a psychopath, turn him in to protect him from himself and others, give birth to their child alone, re-marry a guy who's filled with as much rage as the 1st hubby, and then, when the 1st hubby returns, leaves her 3 kids and 2nd hubby without so much as a "I'm gonna miss you" - then this is your kinda a comedy. So pop some corn, cuddle up, and prepare to laugh your head off???<br /><br />If I had known this was an edgy drama I would have been better prepared to properly judge this movie, but I kept wondering when was it going to get funny, even if only in a black comedy kind-of-way, like War of the Roses. It never did, save for 4 lines (Yes, I counted them all. There was little else to do.) And one of those involved swearing at a 9 year old and telling her to shut up and drink her beer. (Oh, and it was so endearing when the 9 year old gave the adults permission to swear because after all she has heard worse.)<br /><br />What really gets me is that all the reviews described this movie like this: Hip Comedy about a woman who remarries after her 1st hubby goes to jail, and then 10 years later when he is released must choose between the 2.<br /><br />Well that part about the 1st hubby going to jail doesn't happen until more than an hour into the story, and by then you have figured out that it is a no-brainer - she will always go with this guy, no matter who else she marries - even if it's John Travolta.<br /><br />And don't bother watching this for John Travolta. He doesn't make his entrance until the last 30 minutes and is in only 3 major scenes.<br /><br />So I guess the point of this movie was more of a social commentary on the irrational thinking involved with love (She's de-lovely. Ha Ha! Now I get it?! Oh palease!) and dealing with life's difficulties in general? Well I guess I am now Officially Un-Hip, because even in retrospect - No, I don't get it.
