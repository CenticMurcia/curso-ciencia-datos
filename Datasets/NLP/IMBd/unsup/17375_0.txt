This movie was a pleasant surprise! I watched the individual characters and said "I know these people!" They could be my neighbors or colleagues, or even relatives. The writer used the vehicle of stereotyping in a serious, as well as a comical manner. I have not seen this since "All In the Family" on TV in the late 60's. On one level, ideological conflicts (such as the Mid East crisis or the religious conflict in Northern Ireland) were brought to the surface. On another level, the indifference of a given character not involved in a given conflict was exploited for its humorous/serious value. On yet another level, there was humorous stereotyping; no one is spared - everybody gets insulted here! I saw the movie by accident; I cannot wait to buy it!
