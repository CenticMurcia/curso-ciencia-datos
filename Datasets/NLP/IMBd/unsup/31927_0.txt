This is really one of the best movies I´ve ever watched in my life! Christopher Plummer is absolutely wonderful as Atahualpa (nice accent, convincing acting) and Robert Shaw is a great Francisco Pizarro (lots of emotion and passion). This movie is about a beautiful culture and empire being ruined within a very short time: the Spanish conquistadors come to Peru in search of gold and to convert the natives. They find an extremely well-organised empire with their own God: Atahualpa. It´s fascinating to watch Pizarro becoming more and more fond of Atahualpa and at the same time it becomes more and more difficult for Pizarro to decide about the Inca´s fate. This is, of course, not a very modern movie: there are no visual or audio effects and at certain points the camera work isn´t perfect (a bit shaky, for instance). However, the story is great, the dialogue is interesting and sometimes thoroughly moving and the actors are doing a terrific job! Full marks for The Royal Hunt Of The Sun and...sorry, but I have to mention it...Plummer doesn´t look bad in this movie...
