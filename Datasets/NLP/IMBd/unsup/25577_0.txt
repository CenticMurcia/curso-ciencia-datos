Before i saw screwed i had seen some poor reviews & i noticed it had only 7 million in takings at the box office. Well anyone thinking about seeing this movie should discount anything they've heard about it being bad because it is a super ,energertic original film. Norm mcdonald is a superb lead & he carries the film throughout. He has good support from his other actors especially miss Crock.<br /><br />The film starts with norm as a unappreciated butler who finds a way out of his predicament by stealing miss crock's dog but the dog escapes & He has to think up more ways of making his plan come to fruition. Endless gags ensue & each one hits the mark especially where he is attacked in the park & when Danny devito finds his face plastered around the city.<br /><br />This was a masterpiece. Don't miss out on it & one more good thing about it was it didn't feature the actor in the last film I saw Mel Gibson who would best be screwed out of his career.
