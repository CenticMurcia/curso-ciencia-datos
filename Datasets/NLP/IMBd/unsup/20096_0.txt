Joseph Kuo was one of the best independent directors and teamed here with Yuen Woo ping he produced a classic old school kung fu film. It seems strange to have the two strongest characters Carter Wong and Lo Lieh as the villains (and nasty villains they are too) but the young students of the school (including Jack Long (Lung) and Mark Long) faced with overwhelming odds are inventive and courageous and unlike many films it is not at all obvious that they will win in the end. A special mention to the two evil minions as well, played by Corey Yuen and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Shun-yi. The fights are not only well choreographed but well shot as is generally the whole film with good scenery well filmed. Carter Wong is brilliant here, from his high pitched voice and white hair - effects of his Tai Chi virtual invulnerability - to his fighting skills and ability to form a Tai Chi diagram with his feet whilst fighting. The end fight is terrific, clever and very satisfying.
