I'll watch anything which stars the occasionally delightful Kari Wuhrer, but this is pure dreck ~ it doesn't even look like her (which is our loss).<br /><br />It intrigues me when a director claims to be an auteur by leading the credits with " A Film By Eric DelaBarre," when it really should note that it's "The Film By Eric DelaBarre."<br /><br />For the chance of there being another film by this poseur seems remote.<br /><br />1 Niro~Star (out of 10, only because there's no ZERO, apart from the director)...<br /><br />
