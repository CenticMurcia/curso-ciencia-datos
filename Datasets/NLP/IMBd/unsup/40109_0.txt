To be honest, I didn't even make it all the way through this piece of crap movie. It was horrible! Boring, with a story that made absolutely no sense, and full of random nudity and sex. Not creepy, bloody, or even like a Hellraiser movie at all! They should have used another actor to play Pinhead, this movie surely couldn't have been made worse by it.What were they thinking when they made this garbage? I'd rate it zero if I could. I think I made it about 85% through the movie, there was about 15-30 minutes left of it, and if the end redeemed it...well...I wasn't willing to waste a second more watching to see. The series had gotten steadily worse, but in the end they were watchable. This travesty though...I think it's time to stop.
