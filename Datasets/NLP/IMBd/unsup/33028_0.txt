This movie was a load of crap, In the preview commercials. It had "From the producers of Alien and Terminator" comes Virus. I expected to see some serious scary sci fi thriller, but instead this movie was extremely predictable... on what will happen next and blah blah blah. There wasn't enough information about this "Virus" entity, just a bunch of electricity zapping around and scaring ship scavengers. This movie blatently tries to rip off Star Trek's Borg (Machines turning humans into robots) and trying to do a little Alien and Terminator like, but fails because of the depressing way the actors were talking. What a failure for the people who created this film, total failure.
