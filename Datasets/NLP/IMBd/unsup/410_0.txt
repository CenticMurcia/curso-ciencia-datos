While this movie was not exactly earth-shaking, it was a well-made film that held my attention. It's about 4 lady friends who are waiting for their husbands to meet them at their summer retreat. While waiting, they begin to tell their innermost secrets about their marriages--particularly the details of boredom or infidelity. The most memorable one of these is the final segment with the husband and wife stuck in the elevator, though they all were well acted and interesting. Those who are great fans of the later depressing work of Bergman may find this movie a bit of a letdown, it should appeal to those in the audience who want greater depth in the plot without the hopelessness that accompanies many later Bergman films.
