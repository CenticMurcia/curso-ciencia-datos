<br /><br />Standard, and worthless, sequel to standard original has Hewitt back as Julie James, who is still haunted by the events of the original. When she wins a vacation to the Bahamas, guess who follows her there? Havoc ensues. Death after death proves tiresome after a while, while the usual dumb characters become more annoying as the movie drags on. On the plus side, it has more scary moments than the first one (if you can get through a dreadful first half). Hewitt is excellent as usual, while Brandy brings a freshness to the screen as her best friend. Prinze, Jr. is hardly in the movie until the end (and what a lousy ending!). RATING: 4 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and strong language.
