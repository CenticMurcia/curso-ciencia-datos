Fairly desperate sequel to 1992's "Sister Act" has one-time lounge singer Whoopi Goldberg now a big attraction in Las Vegas, but called back to the convent by those kooky nuns to help bring order to a school full of rebellious teenagers. Poorly constructed script just begs for a lighter touch, but everything is hammered home. James Coburn looks appropriately puzzled as the proverbial villain of the piece (he wants to shut the school down, and after meeting the students, any audience may come to sympathize with him). Goldberg's mere presence brings a smile, but this is hand-me-down material (much more so than the cookie-cutter first installment) and is completely without merit. *1/2 from ****
