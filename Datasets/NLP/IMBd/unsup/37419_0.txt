Gee, where to start... Well, first, this movie is awful. From the very start, it is apparent that what is about to follow is going to be a true offence on the viewers intelligence. From the cheesy music to the horrendously bad acting, it is amazing that the film ever got made. Its main protagonist is the character Matt Riker, a mercenary for hire. The actor playing him ( of who's name I thankfully can't recall) is easily the worst actor I've ever seen. At many points you can see him reading his lines off a card behind the camera, and what's worse, for the whole first ten minutes of the movie, he gets around only in a bad pair of white underpants. The story follows a bunch of cyborgs, who due to a heavy intake of some drug, go insane and start killing people for pleasure (obviously). The cyborgs themselves are just a bunch of terribly stiff beefcakes in gymsuits, and are as convincing as they are menacing (ie not at all). Matt Riker and his band of comrades must track them down and destroy them, before they kill again. The continuity is appaling, the cheesy 80's synthesized keyboard music stinks, every actor is a joke, and the story fails to impress. In short, the whole package is a complete dud. I heartily recommend checking this one out if not merely for a glimpse of what I believe is possibly the worst movie ever made.
