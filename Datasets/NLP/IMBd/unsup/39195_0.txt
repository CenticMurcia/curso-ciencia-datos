I've voted a one, but i can't decide if it's supposed to be a serious film. If it is, my vote stands. If, however, it's an insidious and subtle parody of recent disaster films it might be a triumph... i doubt it, though.<br /><br />I can't even remember half of the gaping plot holes and moments where anyone with a science education above infant level would scoff at, but the one thing that does stand out for me was the remaining two protagonists bodging up a perpetual motion machine to rescue themselves.<br /><br />Ummm... surely a film about the socio-political consequences of such an action would be far more interesting. But, nope, we get some piece of cobblers about the centre of the earth stopping spinning.<br /><br />Worse than "Armageddon", probably worse than "ID4".
