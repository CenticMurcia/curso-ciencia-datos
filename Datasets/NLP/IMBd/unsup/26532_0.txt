I remember seeing Fortress and Fortress 2: Re-Entry for a bargain of Â£1,00 each so I though okay. I'm a fan of Lambert in the Highlander films and the plot seemed interesting so I bought them both. I watched it and loved it, it may be a low-budget film but it was great.<br /><br />Lambert does a great performance as John Brennick a man sent to the Fortress because he wanted another kid with his wife Karen. The law in the future says you can have only one child and that's it.<br /><br />Kurtwood Smith does an equally great performance as the warden Poe, who gets pleasure out of watching the inmates sexual dreams but dreams are not allowed in the Fortress. Each prisoner is implanted with a device that shocks them if they break the rules and also kill them if they misbehave too much.<br /><br />Jeffery Combs is good as D-Day a computer genius, his performance in Re-Animator was great too.<br /><br />Fortress is a great sci-fi film that wont disappoint. 10/10
