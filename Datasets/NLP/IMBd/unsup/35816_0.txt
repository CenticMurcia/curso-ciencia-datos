Don't let the somewhat all-star cast in this movie fool you into thinking it's any good. Not that it's all their fault. I believe most of the blame needs to be placed on the awful writing and directing. Not once during this movie did I feel any empathy for any of the actors and good lord the action was so predictable. The title is even unimaginative and pretty meaningless. Bettany, although great in other roles, has a hard time convincing me he could kill someone. I have a hard time believing Ford gave a crap about this movie, when he can't even convey that he cares about his wife or family. I love the line where he's trying to find his family and says "I'm going to find my dog". The humor is flat and timing is awkward.<br /><br />Please don't waste your time with this horrible film.
