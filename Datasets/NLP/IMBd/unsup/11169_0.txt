I had the great fortune to watch the full-length version of this movie at a Hollywood screening. I am glad to see that it has been edited as the original dragged on just a bit though it did have good flow. My gauge was through my eleven year-old son who joined me for the screening as he is a baseball nut. Not only did he make it through but he couldn't stop talking about the movie for days on end. I think every kid in his elementary school is waiting for this to come out and with good reason.<br /><br />A great family value movie with enough of a love story to hold the teenage to mid-twenty something crowd. There are enough feel-good moments to hold adults and seniors.<br /><br />I would like to see this movie make it to the big screen. With a little promotion it would do well. Especially if it breaks out either just after the World's Series 2002 or early 2003 opening of the MLB season.
