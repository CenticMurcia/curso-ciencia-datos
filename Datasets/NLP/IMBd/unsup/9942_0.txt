Yes, it does "period" in the same broad sweeping comic-book gestures as the Hollywood of yesteryear. Yes, saying Sam Neil is over-acting in this one is like calling Lassie merely a good dog. Yes, we've so done the hero-who-actually-IS-a-good-guy bit. Yes, the overly French-Horned theme reminds me of the satirically self-important music from Young Frankenstein. It is cheesy, yes! But you start out with a classic romp of a tale that happens to (as a little bonus) dig a little deeper and discuss some pretty important stuff. And  my god  Olivia Hussey was a babe.<br /><br />And what is really great is that as this book was written, your interest doesn't have to be maintained by the titular character because there are supporting folks heavy-laden with their own fascinating tales  and that's the way this movie was cast; the most interesting actors are playing the most interesting characters.<br /><br />And Robin Hood is in it. That just rocks.
