The first 10 minutes (first war scenes) or so was so boring I stopped watching at the first time. Then I gave it a second try and fastforwarded it to 13 minutes from the beginning. There started a real surprise. The rest of the film was actually REALLY good. For most of the film I thought the war scenes/flashback felt a bit out of place, and I thought they had to be made just to get the financing. Most of the film they feel more like nightmares than memories from some actual events.But in the end every element get its own place in the entity of the film. Everything in this film is good, in many places even ingenious, or real art, true self expression, whatever you want to call it. Good acting, good casting, good sounds&music, good editing, and REALLY beautiful photography, really beautiful "on location"-imagery all through the film. Most of the film is more like poetry than linear storytelling. The voice-over was best and most justified that I remember seeing ever in any film. Also the non-actors were "used" really good in this film. This was also the first serious Troma-film I've ever seen (maybe the only one there is, I don't know?). From this movie you can see, that "eighties/seventies"-type of synthetisizer music and it's sounds can be something else than ridiculous ancient history, when used in the right places. The ending is somehow predictable, but it's still shocking. To me the ending was also a bit of a disappointment. I don't mean in an artistic or film-artistic way, but mentally and personally. Definitely recommended for the interested.
