I took a gamble by renting this one DVD - it certainly had potential, with the good storyline and great actors (Madsen, Hopper).<br /><br />After 15 minutes however, things really went downhill and it became obvious that this is a total Tarantino ripp-off. The story is very similar to True Romance and the music reminded me of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction - except that these weren't the original tracks from the 70s :)<br /><br />It's really a b-grade ganster movie with none of the subtle filming or dialogue we get in Tarantino's movies.<br /><br />4/10
