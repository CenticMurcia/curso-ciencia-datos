How does this movie even get to stores? If you are thinking about buying this movie, don't! I wouldn't even rent it. The only value in watching the movie is that it is quite funny, unintentionally, at times just because it is so horrible. I would expect this quality from maybe a high school film class, but I consider it a horrible injustice that it has made it onto the shelves of a movie rental store. So once again if you want to laugh at the bad acting, weak plot, horrible makeup, and cheesy effects then by all means watch this movie. But if you value your time, you might want to stay away from this one. I want my hour and a half back!
