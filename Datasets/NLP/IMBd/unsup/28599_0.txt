I saw this movie a long time ago and as I remember it, it was pretty depressing. It was about this family during the great depression who struggle with farm life. I think that there is a grandmother in this movie who gets left behind on the top of the car in the rain. That wasn't very nice and I think she refused to go inside. It reminded me of that scene in "National Lampoons vacation." I remember laughing at it when I was younger but now that I think about it, it just seems depressing.<br /><br />The family was living in this house where there were leaks in the ceiling, they worked for little money but stayed together. It wasn't such a bad movie, it was just sad.
