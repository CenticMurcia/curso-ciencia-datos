"Taken at the flood" is in my opinion the best, and indeed the most dark and haunting, of this year's films from the Poirot team. Based on yet another cleverly structured murder mystery from Agatha Christie, this dramatisation is absolutely crammed with webs within webs, lovely scenery, and many fine acting performances from a large, enormously star-studded, cast. Apart from the always brilliant David Suchet in the leading role, Elliot Cowan in particular made an impression amongst the supporting actors, giving a delightfully menacing and genuinely haunting performance as David Hunter. This adaptation might not always be completely true to Christie's original novel, but still a truly recommended hour and a half of well-made television!
