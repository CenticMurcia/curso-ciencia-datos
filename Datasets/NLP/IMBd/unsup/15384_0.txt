After years of only finding good dramas on HBO and Showtime, I'm finally watching network TV and enjoying it thanks to this show. The show is both well written and acted. Sheryl Lee is a pleasant surprise - I think I've only seen her before as Laura Palmer on Twin Peaks and had no idea she was so talented. Brian Benben's morally conflicted plastic surgeon is equally intriguing. This is one miniseries that definitely needs to return for a full season!
