what the ?? these people don't know how to make movies?? or i guess they were just making fun of themselves and others..<br /><br />watching the title of the movie i thought that it would be some good ship movie but after watching the movie i was really disappointed..the acting was terrible..the main villain in the movie was so dumb and was thinking as he was the God..means he was so over acting at several points...<br /><br />i could not understand what they were up to before and during making this movie..there is no story the action scenes are lame and cheap.. they could have done better in many ways like acting and other points..but they have to fail to do so and make a piece of crap...<br /><br />never ever watch this movie under any circumstances... i wished i could give this movie 0 but that is not possible as the lowest vote is 1
