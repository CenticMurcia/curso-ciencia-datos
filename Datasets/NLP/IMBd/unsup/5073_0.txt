Victor says to Clara in Bulgarian 'As Imam Odin Golyam Kur' and says her this means let's move the stuff. In Bulgarian that means 'I have a big penis'. Bulgarian is not common language that any people who know few languages would understand what he is saying.So 99% of the people who watch it don't know Bulgarian.That means they don't have to understand details. Like most of the Spanish movies I have watched, it has sexuality on it. The problems that people might get in their lives spontaneously. It's interesting that the accidental shot fired by Elena changed her life and the life of 5 other people. Overall it's a nice movie to see.
