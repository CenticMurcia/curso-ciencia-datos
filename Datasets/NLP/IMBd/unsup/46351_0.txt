I saw this movie when it screened in Cannes and oh my god. i Haven't seen a worse movie in so long. FOr some bizarre reason, it closed the un certain regard category and during the movie approximately half of the audience walked out. THis movie was pathetic. There simply was a weak story embedded in an hour and a half of nothing. FOr some reason, every 20 minutes or so, when the plot was starting to suck, dead bodies fell from the sky.. THere were so many holes in this story. and parts of it were just plain gross. How this got into Cannes, i will never know. The applause at the end was weak and didn't even last a minute. IT was more an applause of 'thank god this is over'. Outside in the foyer, people were literally laughing at how bad this was. NOT a good way to end the festival.
