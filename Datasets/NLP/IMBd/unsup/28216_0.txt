I grew up a fan of The Three Stooges...basically thinking that there was "no other comedy prior to 1960 besides them". Since that time, I still believe the Stooges, especially Shemp-era material, is the greatest comedy of all time. In the 1990's I came to appreciate the genius of Tim Moore & Spencer Williams. I have almost every episode of "The Amos 'n' Andy Show" and now consider them just a hair below the Stooges in terms of comic creativity.<br /><br />Honesty needs to come into play here as I reveal that I had never seen a full W.C. Fields short or feature in my life prior to this year. My introduction to him was "The Fatal Glass Of Beer" and I am amazed at this short! Whereas most of the clips that I had ever seen of Fields turned me off from ever wanting to see anything else, this short makes me want to view his entire body of work.<br /><br />If I had to make a short, this is probably what it would turn out to be like!
