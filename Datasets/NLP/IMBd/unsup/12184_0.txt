German movie-making is at its best. In the last 8-10 years a new generation of super-talented writer-directors and actors emerged from the Harz mountains and Bavaria and took the world by storm. It all began with Tom Tykwer and his infamous Run, Lola, Run which showed the way for many a prodigal self-made movie-makers and put Germany back onto the map of world cinema. What is more, their peculiar yet classical take on timeless questions of existence and their social awareness opened up a whole new perspective in audiovisual arts. They ceased distancing and brought the viewers closer to understanding the nature of things by sticking to human scales, cutting down on special effects and omitting falsely-sounding, hypocritical dialogues and proclamations. Hans Weingarten's Edukators however, is balancing on the edge of idealism and the realm of common sense, but finds the perfect solution how to let ourselves beguiled by the sensible and sensitive combination of the two.<br /><br />Jan, Peter and Jule are young souls worn out by the controversies of modern-day life. They try to play the role of the catalyst in a society which is only driven by money and economical interests: they break and enter rich people's homes to make them feel uncomfortable with all their excessive valuables. But one day they have to think it over whether what they do is not as very selfish as collecting antique furniture or vintage cars.<br /><br />Edukators is an exciting piece, dealing with the exact same existential problems most of us have to deal with. Although shot with digital technique it is enjoyable to watch: locations were picked with a very good sense, while cinematography is really pure. It is all capped by a chillingly breathtaking soundtrack. Superb.<br /><br />I have read the American remake is under way. It makes me worried, because this film is literally perfect. Should not be touched only admired.
