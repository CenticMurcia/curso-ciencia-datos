I'm sorry guys, but this movie is bad.<br /><br />Ivan Sandomire's performance, the music, and some externals (including the B&W still pictures) are good, but not strong enough to save the film.<br /><br />I found the screenplay particularly unconvincing and the direction quite uninspired. The overall result looks more like a graduation project than a proper production.<br /><br />It may be enriching for those struggling with emancipation from Hassidic Jews communities, but it fails to be compelling to a broader audience. As it talks about a young man in search for understanding, identity, and love, it could be much better.<br /><br />I also found the representation of Brazilian culture, of which I know a thing or two, outrageously inaccurate and small-minded. It surprised me that it got best actress and best picture award in SÃ£o Paulo International Film Festival (which is misspelled in the DVD cover as "Sao Paolo"). I went to the festival website archives (www.mostra.org) and found no confirmation. Perhaps they are referring to another festival or to nominations, which I would consider it misleading.<br /><br />In anyway, for a really good movie showing the interaction of Jews and Brazilian culture, check "the year my parents went on vacation" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0857355/).<br /><br />I hope this review helps.
