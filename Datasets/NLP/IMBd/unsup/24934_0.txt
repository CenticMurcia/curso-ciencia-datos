I do not want to give too much away about this film as it is worth watching not knowing the sequence of the events as the film unfolds.<br /><br />This black comedy is about a TV chef whose days are numbered and his show is axed by the producers.<br /><br />He is at the end of his tether about the loss of his show, his celebrity lifestyle and reputation as a chef. What is he to do?<br /><br />He throws a dinner party an a subsequent events are a combination of tense and tragi-comic action.<br /><br />The film is carried a long at a steady pace as the characters and plot evolve until the arrival of uninvited guests when the pace becomes frantic.<br /><br />The excellent work of the director Robert Heath is ably supported by a very strong cast. It was a pleasure to derive such entertainment from a British film
