Entire film wasn't brilliant. Boring at moments, banal structure, but still worth to watch it! Why? Becuose every kids in Poland know that "kiedys chlop zakladal babie chomato i oral nia pole!" or "chcialbym byc jak Tony Halik". Polish teenage society is cruel, so I also MUST know few lines from such films as "Killer" or "Poranek Kojota" to survive.<br /><br />I admit that many jokes are hard to understand, if you are not polish.<br /><br />Laska (with his ganja-mutated voice) is the best! Typical teenage from Warsaw! Dublicate of my school-friends... <br /><br />10 for Laska's character, 6 for all the rest. Average: 8.
