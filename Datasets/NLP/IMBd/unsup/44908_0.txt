This movie was sick, not to mention completely unrealistic. Jackie-O would definitely be locked up at this point in time. There is no way the doctors who diagnosed her illness would let her roam free after she shot her brother! Despite the fact that Jackie O's lines were very well written and well delivered, I did not find any of this movie to be funny. I found the character of Jackie O to be very annoying. She is spoiled, and criticizes people she thinks are hicks, yet she's sleeping with her own brother. The whole time I was rooting for Lesly (Tori Spelling) to run away from there as fast as she could! It bothered me that she would sleep with Marty's brother, because I thought possibly they were writing one character who wasn't screwed up. Not to mention the fact that if a normal person found out their fiance was sleeping with his sister, they would dump the guy right there and leave. The mother was also not amusing because she allows this psycho (Jackie O) to continue with her behavior and doesn't even care. Although I know the writers were going for being shocking and portraying a very abnormal family, this movie was sick and not at all humorous. It's too bad I wasted 90 minutes of my day subjecting myself to these awful characters and ridiculous storyline. If the story had any chance of being amusing, the writers would have had Jackie O be the only abnormal character and have her imagining this whole "love affair" with her brother. Writing everyone crazy and weird was just too much.
