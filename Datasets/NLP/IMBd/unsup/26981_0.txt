Yes, this movie may be a bit predictable, however the scenery is phenomenal and the acting is very good. It is a story about a woman who has lost her way. Upon returning the ashes of her adopted mother Lily to Hawaii, she begins to find her true self again. She is not, as one of the previous reviewers states, a cheating wife. She is in fact a typical wife and mother who is taken for granted by her family. She is also responsible for neglecting herself and the relationships that are important to her, including her relationships with her adopted mother, Lily, her husband and her children. She learns to reconnect with all of the people that matter to her through her journey in returning Lily to her homeland. It is actually quite touching to watch her as she rediscovers what is important in life: family. A very touching story that is a guilty pleasure to watch.
