A very good action film. What made this one original was the difference in fighting style between the 2 leads first lead: roddy piper, who does the wrestling style. Second lead, blank who does the martial arts style<br /><br />It makes the fight scenes so cool, and original, especially the fight between piper and blank. The story, from what I can remember is good enough. It's not a brilliant story. But the story doesn't make or break the film. It's the real excellent fights that make this film. Obviously, this is not a film that girls would like. Girl tend not to appreciate a witty fight scene, girls would prefer it if the wit was in the story, which they won't get in this film. Hence this film wasn't rated higher (females gave it low ratings - see the statistics) But I am a man, so I loved this film :)<br /><br />
