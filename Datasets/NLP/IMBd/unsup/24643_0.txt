When I think that The Twilight Zone and One Step Beyond were created and ran at the same time, it is hard to believe. Why? The production qualities of OSB seem "cheap", "noirish" and old-fashioned at first viewing. But that's the wrong way of looking at them. I think these are a plus to the mood and execution! <br /><br />What makes this series in some ways superior to TTZ is that these are not fantastical concoctions of the mind, but derived from actual accounts from reality! The casting in these is wonderful, too. Many wonderful portrayals in these. Although in some cases, the acting styles may seem dated to some viewers. It is exactly these qualities which somehow make OSB even more interesting and believable to the viewer. Well...at least this viewer.<br /><br />I am on a quest to find all of these episodes...I just bought the 10 DVD/40 episode compilation and cannot wait to fly through them!<br /><br />Recommended to those of you, select few, who enjoy good drama, mystery and discovery, wherever and however you find it.
