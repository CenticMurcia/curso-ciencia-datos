I took two of my kids to see this abomination the other day, and couldn't wait to get out of the cinema. It's just truly dire.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting Pixar levels of animation, but I certainly wasn't prepared for quite how bad it turned out to be. And as for the story... well, at least it's being environmentally friendly by recycling every clich√© it can lay its hands on.<br /><br />The voice acting is more wooden than Keanu Reeves (now that's not something I ever expected to type!), but given the script it's not entirely surprising - it sounds like the 'talent' just phoned their parts in.<br /><br />Awful, awful, awful.<br /><br />Avoid.
