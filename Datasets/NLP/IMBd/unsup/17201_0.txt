I saw this movie on TV as a pre-teen. It took place well before I was born and I had never been to California. But even today--decades later--the movie has an incredible tone that has universal appeal. On one level, it appeals to Americans (and Canadians) ideal of a simple time: it takes place just shortly before JFK was assassinated and American pop culture went out the window in a mayhem of drugs, acid-rock, and bizarre envelope-ripping behaviours and lifestyles. On another level, if you've been a teenager, you will be able to relate to this movie. The movie was somehow--even to us in Canada hundreds of miles away in a different climate and culture, and a different era--it was somehow OUR last night of summer too. What more can I say? Brilliantly shot with the hand-held camera at times for a suggestion of reality. An incredible film with classic, universal themes and characters. Absolutely love it.
