Sorry to say, I was bored about 2 minutes into this flick. The actors ham it up so much, they almost distract you from the flat dialogue. The Director tried really hard, maybe too hard, but nothing clicks in this movie. Our audience giggled once, but at the end, we all looked at each other, and left the theater wanting to see a REAL movie.
