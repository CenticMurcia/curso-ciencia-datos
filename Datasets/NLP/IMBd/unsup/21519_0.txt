This movie has a lot of elements to it and it strangely worked for me. I do not think it was a super success at the box office, but for me the movie was a very funny film. I do feel this one is more of a comedy than action or science fiction as Martin Short steals the show as the guy who ends up getting Dennis Quaid's character shot into his buttocks. The story, a group of scientist have invented a shrinking ray and they have used it to shrink Quaid's character and a ship to super small size. They aim to inject the ship and Quaid into a bunny, but some sort of attack occurs and he ends up injected into Short's character instead. So the rest of the film is the group that attacked the scientist coming after Short while Quaid tries to figure out a way to get big again. There are some interesting scenes of the insides of Short, though one has to wonder why they would have a device to attach to the inner ear of the bunny as I do not think you can talk to a bunny. The eye part though makes sense though. Another thing that makes little sense is the dude with the hand attachments, seems like a character that should be in a James Bond movie or something. I know there was a character exactly like that in a movie that was sort of a Get Smart movie called "The Nude Bomb" or something to that extent. This film though for the most part worked, especially when it was being a comedy.
