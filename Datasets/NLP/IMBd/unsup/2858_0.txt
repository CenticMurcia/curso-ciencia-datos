Director Bob Fosse does it again with Lenny, a fine movie of the life of legendary 60's comedian Lenny Bruce. Using the same trademark style he used in Cabaret, Fosse creates a wonderful black and white visual collage. The mood and world of 60's nightclubs is wonderfully recreated. Both Dustin Hoffman and Valerie Perrine are superb.
