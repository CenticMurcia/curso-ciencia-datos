Mike Binder, who many know from 'The mind of the married man' has all the talent and capabilities of a young Albert Brooks or a Gene Wilder. This sex farce is right on and a perfect look at a the male scenario of his wife and a girl getting it on going bad. A fast (ninety some minutes) funny, (Hemingway is the funniest I have ever seen her) and fresh, (this is almost like a french film) Awesome little comedy. Don't know how I ever missed it but I rented it after seeing the TV series and laughed like crazy. Watch this with a date. You'll get the topics flowing all night. Also watch for cameos from Kevin Pollack and Steve Baldwin. Loved it!!!!!!!
