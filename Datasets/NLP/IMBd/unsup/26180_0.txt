I was recently at a friend's home and he screened the last 1200' of this feature. Having always been a fan of Geraldine Page, I wanted to see the odd reel. <br /><br />If the whole movie had been available I would have loved to watch it from beginning to end again. This is one thrilling and suspense filled conclusion, and the movie deserves an award for the color, camera work and the writing. <br /><br />Geraldine, though no longer with us, probably got a crown in heaven for her role in this forgotten thriller.
