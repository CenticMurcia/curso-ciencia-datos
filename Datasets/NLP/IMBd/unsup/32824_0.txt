A total snoozer. If it is based on a true story, then it took far to long to tell, and it just wasn't worth it. What was the point? He was a confused young man? Watch this movie and you'll be confused. The screenplay, characters, and acting are so weak. If there's a movie to miss, this is the one. I just can't believe the other reviews given this movie. This is one lame movie. If it's so great, would you ever sit through a second time? I doubt it.
