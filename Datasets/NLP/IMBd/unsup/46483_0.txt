Ever since she was a little girl, Chun-Li's sole ambition in life has been to become a world-class concert pianist. But when her businessman father is unceremoniously whisked away in the middle of the night by a ruthless corporate tycoon bent on ruling the world, Chun-Li agrees to be trained by a martial arts master so she can get her father back and bring the villain's empire crumbling down around him at the same time.<br /><br />Burdened by kindergarten-level storytelling that makes "Kung Fu Panda" look like stark documentary realism in comparison, "Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li" is a far-from-legendary, barrel-scraping fiasco marked by stock characters, bland performances and rote dialogue.<br /><br />Heck, even the martial arts sequences fail to generate any genuine excitement or pizazz. Stick to the video game instead. At least you can participate in that one.
