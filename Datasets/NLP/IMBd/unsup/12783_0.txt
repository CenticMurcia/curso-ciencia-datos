I saw about ten minutes of this movie once, and it blew my mind! This movie used a brilliant experimental mixture of animation (both video and hand drawn), collage, special effects and props. This was like nothing i've ever seen before. This movie had really inventive and unique elements to it, and I would love to track it down. SPOILER: the scene i saw involved a hanging lamp moving of its own accord, and attacking and electrocuting a girl. this scene also involved drawers of a dresser opening and shutting on their own, bloody body limbs flying around the room, and a painting of a laughing cat that came to life and then starting spewing blood. more than a couple elements of this movie found their way into sam raimi's evil dead trilogy, including the props, use of camera and frame-by-frame animation. incredibly trippy, experimental horror movie that seems to have been overlooked (is it even released in the US?); if anyone has a copy of this or knows how to obtain one, even for rental, i'm interested! kinkonmusic@hotmail.com
