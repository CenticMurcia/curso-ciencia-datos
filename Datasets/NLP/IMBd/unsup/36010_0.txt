Unfortunately this is probably the worst movie that I have ever seen. It does not hold the viewers interest and is boring to the extreme. Acting poor, Sets, terrible. Obviously a low cost budget movie, which should have done every-one a favour and stayed in 1978 where it belongs - Old and unwanted. Sorry - but I doubt if even Bill Collins would have endured this one.
