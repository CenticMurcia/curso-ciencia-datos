I have submitted comments on this film a few times and they never get posted. Here's the deal, I belong to a horror yahoo group and the director/producer joined and constantly harassed us about this movie. I argued that there is no way this was based on a real serial killer (never heard of him before or after....do a look for William Allen Grone on your fav search engine) and there is NO real snuff footage on it. The idiot claimed it was all real and that the last few minutes were the actual (ie real) snuff film in it's entirety. I got the flick, fast forwarded through the extremely bad acting and low budget special effects and went to the "real" snuff footage. It was so fake and cheesy looking that I can't stress it enough. Then after it's over and the credits run it says "This film is and all characters in it are a work of fiction". Stay away from this one it's junk.
