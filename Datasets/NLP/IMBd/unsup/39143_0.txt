There's this silly scientist (Kenneth Hendel), you see, who has managed to create a machine, a Material Transmitter, which can, well, transmit stuff into a parallel universe. And then there's this female reporter (Kay Lentz), see, who's gonna do a report of the man and then there's this ken-do fighting cable guy (Richard Hatc), who because of an accident gets hooked up in this and they all are like sent into a parallel universe. And in the parallel universe there's some green dude (Ray Charleson), a giant (Larry Taylor), an annoying little thief (Peter O'Farrell) and this, like, evil warlord (John Saxon). And guess who's gonna get napped by the warlord and who is gonna do inventions for him. And who's gonna safe the day.<br /><br />Prisoners Of The Lost Universe is my first camp movie love. When I was a kid I must have watched it dozens of times, even tough it is flat out silly film, whit poor settings and obviously small effect budget. That is the reason I am a bit too generous with my score.<br /><br />POTLU isn't nothing more, than a low budget action/sci-fi/fantasy flick, which, if you are into this kind of films, will make a grin on your face just because it is, what it is. And, at least in the first viewing, you can't help but to applaud for the inner logic of the story and the world. A pod gun. Black and white red eyes pygmies, hot stone worshipers and much, much more.<br /><br />In a word, if you are watching this film, you most likely are into low budget camp films, and thus can appreciate this film for what it is.<br /><br />Score: 4 of 10, Camp Score: 7 of 10
