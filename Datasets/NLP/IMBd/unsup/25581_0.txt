When I went to the theater to see screwed I knew it would be a good film, with Dave Chappelle and Danny Devito, I also knew that since Norms previous feature film (Dirty Work) was hilarious and very well-written that this movie could not live up to it, and it doesn't but it is still a wonderful piece of work. Casting Sherman Hemsley gave this movie a little more life than it would have without him, going back to the whole Dirty Work thing, this movie recycles ideas from Dirty Work, the whole Revenge thing, but a whole new plot, which could've been funnier if only Danny Devito would've worked to his potential, which we have seen recently in such critically acclaimed but movies that bombed such as Man on the Moon.
