I knew I had seen it on tv many years ago, guess it's not shown anymore, possibly because of racial overtones. Lana and Sandra Dee were great, but not the actress Claudette Colbert was. Wonderful drama, but Claudette is my favorite. Her partner and Steve, as well as the costumes are memorable. It's a period piece - life in the USA the way it really was. I award the original a 9, the remake, although updated and excellent, a 7.
