I essentially agree with Anonymous of Raleigh, NC below.<br /><br />The Holocaust is of course the most saturation retold story of modern media history. This version is way weaker than many, and adds nothing to the genre. It doesn't succeed in making us care especially poignantly about the victims. In fact it's much weaker than many other Holocaust films in that.<br /><br />The two strongest Holocaust films, at least of recent vintage, are the inimitable Schindler's List, towering above all, but also "Jacob the Liar". "Life Is Beautiful" is also poignant.<br /><br />This one is dreck.<br /><br />I only saw it for Kirsten Dunst. She too is disappointing here, probably largely because the character she is asked to play, a spoiled affluent brat, is fundamentally unappealing and unidimensional, until near the end.
