"shabulia" writes my opinion of "Diner", exactly - except I think my opinion is worse.<br /><br />Is this REALLY how young men act and feel? Deliver me !!<br /><br />Everyone to their own tastes, but I found nothing to get excited about ( and nothing entertaining) while I was watching KCET's "Saturday Night Movie", and Martin Sheen promised me I'd see a hilarious film - I'm still waiting to laugh. It isn't the first time I've been disappointed in HIS opinion - or what he's paid to say.<br /><br />Since almost all users say the actors in this film have regressed in their careers, I can see no reason to mention even one. I lived through that period and didn't know ANYONE like these air-heads. Maybe it's because I never got to Balitmore....did I ? If this is Barry Levinson's best direction and writing, I don't think I'll bother to watch those other films some suers mention. I'm not one to worship any "star's" performance, but I'm going to make a point to remember how I kept waiting for something to happen in this "great" film. I think I was mesmerized by the total inanity of "Diner" - and I LOVE the Food Channel's program "Diners and Dives".<br /><br />I still am pleading STORY, STORY, STORY, please......
