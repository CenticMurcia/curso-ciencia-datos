This film is unique, you won't ever see anything like it. The animation technique is patented, the characters are original and lively and all scenes are extremely carefully and detailed modeled. The movie is soaked with atmosphere and you can just lean back and enjoy it as you become familiar with each of the different personalities in the film. The exciting car race is wonderfully animated with plenty of details. Having been made 35 years ago this movie is still a winner as the environment it is happening in is kind of timeless, and the animation dolls are just as timeless. <br /><br />This film is a must see! ...and it's very suitable for kids as well.
