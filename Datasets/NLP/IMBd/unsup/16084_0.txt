When I heard Godzilla 2000 was coming to American theaters, I was really excited. For the first time ever, I'd get to see Godzilla on the big screen. I was not disappointed. Godzilla looks great with a meaner, leaner look. The special effects, although not without their bad shots, are generally very good. The enemy UFO/Monster is really cool and the final fight is fantastic and exciting. The dubbing is fine, but it did have its bad moments. Tristar's edits were fairly unobtrusive, so I didn't mind. Would've liked it if the they did make a few shots grainy. Oh well. And the movie dragged a little. Despite its bad points, though, Godzilla 2000 is a very fast paced and exciting entry into the Godzilla. It's one of my favorite Godzilla movies. And I the movie left me with a big smile on my face. I can't wait to see it again. 10/10<br /><br />(kaiju = monster)
