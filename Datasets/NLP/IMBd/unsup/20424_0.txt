Don't expect to see a lot of football here cause there isn't. Its a drama. Has everything --- infidelity, high speed pursuit, sex,etc,etc, etc.<br /><br />And yes it shows glimpses of some high class footballers like Beckham, Zidane, Raul, etc but thats about it.<br /><br />The movie stresses more off field than on it. Football is the backdrop. The high life , the fast cars and the glamorous girls of sports industry are a big part of the flick . Well one does not expect the story of two long lost brothers in a sports film, but this one has that bit too!!.<br /><br />I was not expecting more out of this after Goal and it does not even meet my humble expectations.
