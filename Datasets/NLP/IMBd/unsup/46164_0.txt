This has to be one of the one of the worst comedies to walk on the face of the Earth,the acting is dreadful,the plot sucked and Eddie Murphy put on a bad performance.I've seen Eddie Murphy in the Shrek movies and he put on great performances.It's about to lads who call themselves losers and put up a daddy day care center and they soon find out that they can't control the kids and an inspector comes and says they need more staff or else he will shut daddy day care down but fear not...the two boneheads have a plan that doesn't seem to work and daddy day care gets shut down.The only way to reopen it is to find a bigger place,more staff and try to get the kids back from some school for kids aged 2-4 or something like that.This movie is a real joke that can't make you laugh instead it makes you sleepy.The story isn't that bad but nothing is funny except the part when a kid comes out of the bathroom and says "I missed"and Eddie Murphy looks in the bathroom and the music from "Psycho" comes on.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy fans will be extremely disappointed with this movie but I kind of doubt they will like it but its your choice to watch it.This really is a really bad movie and that includes Eddie Murphy's performance.<br /><br />I would only watch this again if I have to pick a choice between "The Pink Panther" or this,I would watch this movie again This is a movie that should be avoided at all costs and don't say that I didn't warn you if you're disappointed.What a waste of time and film.
