I've heard it said that Vince Vaughn described this as the "punk rock of Westerns" or some such. If by that he meant the bad punk rock that's just mindless incoherent noise, well, he's spot on.<br /><br />The way I envision this falling together, Yoakam and some of his wacky buddies were sitting around, under the influence of a foreign substance, realized they all had a coupla days to kill and decided to shoot a movie. He decided that he'd always wanted to make out with Bridget Fonda, so took a chance and wrote her totally pointless character into the script. Since she's not exactly had a full plate the last decade or so, she jumped at the chance for a paycheck even if it meant, you know, kissing someone who looks like Dwight Yoakam. They gathered up a bunch more weirdos to round out the cast, a cinematographer who's not half bad, and made themselves a movie. A terrible, terrible movie.<br /><br />IMDb readers, please believe me. The 10-star reviews here are just "jokers" who are trying to trick you into seeing this film for their own perverse pleasure. The people ascribing a deep inner meaning are like the art snobs who enjoy telling you why a painting done to look exactly like one your 3-year-old would do is ACTUALLY much more important and valuable than a painting done by your 3-year-old. Don't let them win. There's NOTHING worth seeing here (other than the always lovely Bridget Fonda. But seriously, just go to her entry and look at some of the photos. The acting is comperable.) This isn't a "so bad it's good campy fun" sorta flick. It's JUST PLAIN BAD.
