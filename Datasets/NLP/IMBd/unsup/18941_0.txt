I was only 9 years old in 1968, but I was an avid television watcher, and I loved this TV show.<br /><br />My parents got me a Julia "Barbie" doll, even though I did not have any regular Barbie dolls. (We are a Caucasian family.)<br /><br />It is almost 40 years since I have seen an episode of Julia, but reading the other comments triggered a little memory for me.<br /><br />I remember the morality of the show. I remember respecting Julia. I remember liking her little boy for his respectfulness toward his mom. I remember it was an intelligent show, not a silly one.<br /><br />I loved this show.
