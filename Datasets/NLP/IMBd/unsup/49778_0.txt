Is this movie ever horrifyingly awful. The first one was absolutely great and I can't believe they bothered with this and thought they could pass it off as a DTM movie. Don Rickles sucks as an actor and sucks even worse as Mr. Wilson. The kid playing Dennis is atrocious as him and this movie is just so over the top fake and unrealistic beyond forgiveness. It is already a very short movie and the length it is is already too long. To say it's not as good as the first is so far beyond an understatement it's ridiculous. Stay as far away from this piece of puke as humanly possible. Giving it a 2 is already being quite generous and that's right near the absolute bottom.
