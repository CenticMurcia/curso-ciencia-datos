I'm glad I did not buy or rent this movie, I picked it up at the library where you don't really have to buy stuff at expect fines. I seen this movie at the Library like 2 or 3 years ago and didn't really want to pick it up, then I picked it up this year because I read the entire description that meant like Indigo children have powers and I just thought that it will make it a wonderful and inspirational movie, but when I first turned it on, I felt like I fell asleep in a nightmare of demon spirits until when I got to the part where they were in the house and a little girl was in the car. If I bought this movie, I would've thrown it away feeling so sorry that I bought it, avoid this at cost and look for better inspirational movie like Matilda even though it might be a little overrated and silly but still worth watching. But for this movie, 0.0 it is probably the most least favorite movie I ever seen, no likeness at all.
