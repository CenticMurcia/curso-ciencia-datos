This show is literally depressing to watch. I've seen two or three episodes now, and wish I hadn't. After they were over, I was disgusted.<br /><br />Essentially this is just a TV show where a camera crew follow around the "Playboy Bunnies" in the Playboy Mansion.<br /><br />If you don't know what Playboy is, who Hugh Hefner is, what Playboy Bunnies are, or anything about porn, chances are you will have no interest in this whatsoever. I know all of the above and it still made me feel sick.<br /><br />Obviously a certain portion of this is scripted for dramatic effect and viewer appeal but, I think, probably very little. These bleach-blonde bimbos are incredibly stupid, selfish and appalling. Yeah, they're hot. But when they open their mouths, you feel like vomiting.<br /><br />It's kind of sad to see Heff (at age 79) courting these girls. The Head Bunny, a.k.a. "Heff's Girlfriend," is probably no older than 30. All the girls kiss him and he fondles them... twenty years ago Heff was a god. Now, he looks like one of those disgusting old pervs in shopping centers who stare at young girls all day. He's the type of guy you want to call the cops on. And he's loose in his own mansion surrounded by dozens of beautiful women.<br /><br />Likewise, they are taking advantage of him - they know he'll die soon and they're really milking his old-age for all its worth. They get free rooms as well as free food and the best thing of all: they get paid for being sexy and rich! The richer and more beautiful they are, the more they get paid. The more they show, the more they get paid. Apparently, all they have going for them is their looks - they are dumber than I don't know what.<br /><br />They are so stupid some of the episodes are painful to watch. They made me feel sick in my stomach - the Bunnies are gorgeous? Sure. But good god, they're ridiculously dense.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only "plus" about this show is that we get a rare glimpse inside the Playboy Mansion... but ol' Heff will be dead in a few years, and supposedly according to his own wishes the mansion will soon thereafter become open to the public. Now THAT will be fun.
