Truly a waste of time, money and voice acting; "Return of Jafar" is one of the most banal sequels Disney's dished out.<br /><br />+ SPOILER ALERT + The story opens with a bunch of thieving morons who want some jeweled flower thingy. But Aladdin (who is suddenly a poor street rat again) stops them.<br /><br />Then, the main moronic thief escapes from Aladdin and finds Jafar's lamp, sets him free and the "plot" unfolds. If by "plot", you mean, Iago basically deciding if he's a good guy or a bad guy. (Sad "plot", ain't it?) With cheesy half-arsed animation, and dweeby songs, this sequel just is a sappy one hour waste of time. Aladdin and Jasmine are not married in this film, (even though they married at the end of the first movie) and the only really memorable scene is a brief goof, where the Sultan loses his eyebrows for a split second. I truly believe that if poor (late) Mr. Walter Disney had seen this idea, he would've cried.<br /><br />I give it a 1 out of 10.
