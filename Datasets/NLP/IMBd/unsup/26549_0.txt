I saw this movie for the first time, about twenty five years ago. And every time that I have the opportunity to watch it again, I donÂ´t waste the chance (although unfortunately is rarely show it on t.v.) This film is almost eighty years old, and in my opinion has yet to lose their strong plot history, with Douglas Fairbanks at his top performance and in his stunts.The stages are so impressive.I like this picture a lot more than the 1940 version,that was made with much more resources. I recommend this movie amply. !Good Fun!
