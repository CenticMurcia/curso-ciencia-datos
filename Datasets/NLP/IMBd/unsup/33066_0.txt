Despite the name of the movie and the cover, this is not a zombie movie. It is however, a mystery movie that involves the dead walking the earth again. The actual movie starts with a man reading the ink tape on his used typewriter to discover someone else was working on defeating death. That sounds like a good kernel for a movie, but this is not it. Few things tie together and there is no payoff for any of the plot lines and characters shown. What is shown is a prolonged attempt and arising suspense and mystery. These both failed as aforementioned lack of payoff and inability to draw out any conclusion. I would not recommend this movie in any way to anyone.
