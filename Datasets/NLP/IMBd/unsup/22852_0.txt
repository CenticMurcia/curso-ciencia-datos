I watched this movie with my boyfriend, whom thought this movie was ridiculously stupid. I thought it was pretty good. I hate spiders naturally, and I was scared in the movie for the people the spider was going after. There are many moments, the flick seems totally unrealistic. Overall, I thought it was pretty good. It kept me interested, I didn't fall asleep, and the suspense kept me watching. Not bad, give it a chance!
