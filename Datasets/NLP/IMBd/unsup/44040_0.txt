This is possibly one of the worst films ever. There is no suspense, the plot is utterly predictable, the dialogue ludicrous and the acting appalling. Apart from the fact that one has to suspend all disbelief to forgive the script its premise, it doesn't even evolve into fantasy. It remains incongruous and implausible. Some thrillers thrive on this and actually pull it off, but Dead Man's Run fails in all aspects.Once John Savage has been 'outwitted' his acting reaches histrionics which are so funny, one doubles up. Unfortunately it wears thin and one cannot even laugh at it. The two other blokes are not too bad, but alas the two actresses are at best terrible! Is this all the director and scrip-wright's fault? Perhaps. If you really have nothing else to do, rent this one for a few laughs, but don't expect to be scared.
