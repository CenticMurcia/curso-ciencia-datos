WARNING:I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.<br /><br />I had avoided The Derby Stallion ever since it came out, because I was so much more concerned with other movies(but of course), and one day it was about time to leave the movie rental place, so I just grabbed it and ran on, and now I'm glad I got it. This movie was a nice little film and I really liked it. Of course there was some things wrong with it, but I decided to overlook them and not pay attention to them that much because the movie entertained me so much. This movie is good and it's an enjoyable film to watch. Although I'm not much of a horse-movie lover, this movie sparked an interest in me. I thought this movie was decent and, but of course, I knew when I got it I wouldn't be saying after I had watched it, "Oh my god, this movie was perfect, it's the best movie ever!" I tell you one thing I did not say though, "This movie was horrible, it's the worst movie ever". This movie is worth the watch and aside from minor problems, like the way they filmed it, it looked like you took your own camera and filmed it yourself, and when the old man dies, you can see him breathing, and he moves his thumb, lol, this really was a fine movie. It's rating is unfair.
