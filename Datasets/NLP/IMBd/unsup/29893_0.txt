Talented stuntman/fighter Dan Chupong (Born To Fight) is given little to work with in this repetitive, overlong mess from Thailand. Clearly hoping to bask in the financial glory of Ong Bak and The Protector (aka Tom Yum Goong), this film seems rushed and it shows. The plot is terrible and the acting is substandard (even for a Thai film). The action scenes are poorly conceived and filmed. Slow motion is used for shots that don't deserve it and money shots almost always feature a cutaway revealing the choreographer's complete inability to make the action scenes work. If they get any credit, it's that they don't stoop even lower and use the horrible "shaky, camera on a string" crap to further cover the shortcomings! The character's are cardboard and the set's look like, well, sets! The special effects are cheap (as in most modern Thai films).<br /><br />Just a reminder to those Thai filmmakers who wish to emulate Ong Bak-<br /><br />1. Get talented martial artists & stuntmen <br /><br />2. Concentrate on the quality of the fight scenes and don't give in to CGI and cutaways. <br /><br />3. Keep the plot simple (the best martial arts films usually have minimal plot)<br /><br />If you are going to ask those talented stuntmen to risk injury or death, at least try to make a film worth them getting injured for!
