SECOND BEST has an original film language -- the protagonist pours his angry heart into a self-published news letter. He is angry at how awful he feels about himself vis a vis his richer, better-looking, taller, more self-assured friends and neighbors. They drive better cars, smoke richer cigars, bed prettier women, eat juicier steaks. Certain that no one will publish his newsletter, he pins it up around town, places it under car windshields, stuffs it in local mail boxes. Most people just throw it in the garbage, others find it offensive, and yet with a few it resonates. They respond to the author's website address with tales of inadequacy of their own. This all takes place against a suburban Jersey backdrop, where four middle-aged male friends hang out not that differently than they did in high school -- frequenting pick up bars, Chinese restaurants, and burnt out municipal golf courses. Their lives are not turning out as they had imagined when graduating college. Now, thirty years later, these baby boomers are experiencing problems with their careers, marriages, health and children. Yet they stick together, cobbling a life of humor, sports, dating, and ribald conversation just as fun as if they'd each had a couple of million bucks.
