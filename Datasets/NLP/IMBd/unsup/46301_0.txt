This has to be the worst idea ever, a story being told with a bad beat that seems so improbable, unbelievable and pointless that it makes no cents after chapter 3. It also sets a stereotype that everyone who cheats on their husband or wife their husband or wife is cheating on them. Almost every time a group of 3 or more people are talking someone has to pointlessly pull out a gun. It just goes to show that these people try to make their guns talk for them and shoot someone for no reason. Most of the chapters you don't know whats going on unless you listen to all the chapters before it so you cant even listen to one part of it without getting lost. Unless you have like 45 minutes to waste don't watch or listen to this garbage. If you are waiting for the next chapters to come out then you must find watching paint dry and grass grow exciting.<br /><br />Question for bbadger187: What do you find awesome about this?
