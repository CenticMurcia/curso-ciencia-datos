Tears of joy and tears of anguish.<br /><br />You'll have both with this movie as it takes you on a roller coaster of emotional highs and lows.<br /><br />Rent the DVD and you will be enthralled with scenes of the original Calendar Girls who made the whole thing possible.<br /><br />The Yorkshire scenery is very beautiful, they don't show quite as much rain as you'd get in Yorkshire, but that's movies for you!<br /><br />While Julie Walters and Helen Mirren play the two 'title roles' I hope you join me in enjoying the pianist who has obviously had a chequered past and is a hoot.<br /><br />I hope this movie spawns many more 'calendars' that will help cancer research. What a great epitaph for John, the cancer victim in this movie who's humor inspired the ladies to do what they did.<br /><br />Best movie for ages.<br /><br />JP
