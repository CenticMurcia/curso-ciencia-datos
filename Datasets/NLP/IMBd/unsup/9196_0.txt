The sight and sounds of this piece is a true reflection of the time's. An emotional journey through the bands creation of songs and the struggles that surround the creative processes. A very candid look at the Beatles. The songs are great. I saw this movie when it first was released. It ran at the theater for over a year. Lines would always be seen outside. The dialog between John and Paul are at times serious when it surrounds the bands musical structure. George brings in new material. Paul is some what argumentative over George's performance with a few songs and asks him to change the approach to the part he surrenders to Pauls wishes. Ringo is funny and plays the piano a bit. You can also see others aiding the Beatles with a few songs such as the the anvil clang on Maxwells Silver Hammer. Billy Preston jams the organ on a few songs.
