Three wives and one husband in one house! What a mess! Apart from the moral issues I have with this situation, it seems detrimental to nearly everyone involved. This guy doesn't have three wives. He has three concubines and no wives. Not one of these women can possibly be having a fulfilling relationship with her husband. The guy has variety in bed and doesn't seem to really care about anything that goes on in the house, let alone the children. The most important problem with this arrangement, in my opinion, is with the children. You'd think having three moms would make it easier for the kids to get attention, but... NO!! The women are so busy competing for their husband that they don't have any time for the kids. The kids are just there kind of on their own. It's awful! <br /><br />The husband asks his wives to be sisters. EWW!! He's just crazy. He tries to order his wives around as if they were his children. I don't know how this situation can possible work. It is certainly REALLY messed up! It seems like the buy wanted to have a lot of slave labor so he can go out and play pool. I just don't get it.<br /><br />Overall the whole situation is just weird! The man seems like he's been very creative in trying to justify his unwillingness to commit and have just one wife which is what man's and God's laws decree.
