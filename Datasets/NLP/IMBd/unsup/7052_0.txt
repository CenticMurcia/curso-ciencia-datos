In a word? BAD. This has all the elements of a badly done "B" movie; ie: poorly developed characters, horrific cinematography, deplorable cacophonic soundtrack, and terrible over-dramatized acting. <br /><br />The CGI used does not even begin to redeem this detestable smack-fest of sugar-coated zombies/vampires/whatevers, the main monster looks like something an 8 year old put together for the front porch on Halloween, and the four main characters are totally indistinguishable from one another. <br /><br />The American version of this movie was cut, so it's possible we lost the character development on the cutting room floor, but honestly, even if we hadn't, I seriously doubt this movie would be worth watching. <br /><br />There is only ONE good element. The sets. The sets are nicely done, and that is literally the single enjoyable aspect of this entire production.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and do something...no...do ANYthing else.<br /><br />It rates a 0.0/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
