Someone keeps asking me, "What's this movie about?" SS5+ is one of those that defies to be labeled...just the way I like it.<br /><br />Tadanobu Asano, a literal jack of all trades, is the main reason I wanted to see this. From an infamous masochist king known as Kakihara to low-key Kenji in the visually stunning Last Life in the Universe, Asano always manages to display, not only a wide range, but he performs on several different levels. In this one, you can't help feel anticipation for his scenes and trust me: they're worth the wait!!!You are then presented to an elegant buffet of avid brights, darks and color schemes which makes his home seem like Lewis Carroll's summer house. Reika Hashimoto and Asano (phenom chem!) had me mind scrapingly perplexed as to what would unfold next.<br /><br />The rest of the cast all play their roles well (and with fun) and the intertwining events keep the ball rolling with an occasional rest stop for character development and goodfeel. There's a dark humor in this film which gives it it an odd, adderol driven, yet refreshingly original style. Also, a high bpm soundtrack gives it some additional high octane for the trip. I will have to keep an eye out for Gen Sekiguchi's future films or other works by Taku Tada 'cause Survive Style 5+ has warped my way of thinking Â– in a good way!
