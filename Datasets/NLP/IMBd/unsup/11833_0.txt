Watching this on TCM as I type this. I recorded it to my DVR from TCM's airing last night- 3/12/10, in case anyone wants to get technical about it;)<br /><br />My impression of this 1974 movie "Shanks"?<br /><br />IT'S THE ONLY MOVIE CREATED FOR PEOPLE OVER 90.<br /><br />It's dreadful. Extremely slow and needless to say, boring. The humor, or rather attempts at humor fall very, very flat. So flat in fact that what should be construed as humor comes across as mean-spirited, creepy and obviously to my eyes not funny. I mean trying to import Marcel Marceau's unique brand of French humor to U.S. audiences? Who thought this was going to work? William Castle apparently.<br /><br />Poor Marcel. Watch him proudly strut about the American? countryside looking utterly and completely out of place. This debonair older sophisticate should be strolling the streets of Paris in his trendy euro fashions. Instead he's playing Uncle Creepy to a young blonde girl, who apparently has no friends or family even though she lives in a charming house with perfectly blooming flowers. The American kids just outside her door feign interest in Marcel Marceau, I think they merely humor the old creepy French guy into making him think that he's entertaining them.<br /><br />Throughout the movie Marcel is stuck with an angry, confused look of "why the hell did I decide to make this movie again when I could have stayed in Paris drinking Absinthe?" And speaking of drinking, this movie is awash in Bombay Gin®. The product placement incidents actually out-number the cast members. No really. In one scene at a general store there's a shelf fully stocked with Bombay Gin®. So as clearly as the gin itself, this movie fueled by gin. Which explains a lot actually.<br /><br />Oh god. I just watched a scene that involved the brother of Marcel's character being attacked by a reanimated rooster.<br /><br />To illustrate this scene here I will provide makeshift screen captures to get across the immense lunacy of this movie:<br /><br />http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/8048/image030g.jpg http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/7955/image029a.jpg http://img371.imageshack.us/img371/4836/image028s.jpg http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/1905/image027n.jpg http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/9040/image026k.jpg http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9454/image025ww.jpg http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/1715/image024qk.jpg http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/2791/image023ck.jpg http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/2702/image031bt.jpg<br /><br />Shortly after this scene the be-wigged mother is struck down and killed in a hit-and-run accident in which the driver asks the important question of Marcel's brother Barton; "You didn't see anything did ya?"<br /><br />I certainly wish I hadn't!<br /><br />This is one of those movies in which I would have LOVED to have sat with a paying audience as they watched this thing unfold before them when it first came out. I dare say their reactions, most likely followed by their stampeding to the exits, would have made the price of admission worth it.<br /><br />So I'm going to go back to giving my full attention to Shanks because I don't want to miss one priceless moment..<br /><br />However, I still maintain the masterstroke in Marceau's (brief)film career was his brief appearance in Mel Brooks' 1976 movie "Silent Movie". It was such a brilliant thing too because Brooks made a silent movie for (then)modern cinema. And guess who had the only line of dialogue? Of course: Marcel Marceau.<br /><br />So I will echo his one word utterance from that brilliant and funny 1976 Brooks' film to describe this 1974 experiment titled "Shanks":<br /><br />NO!
