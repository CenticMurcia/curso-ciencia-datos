Plain Out a Good Movie. As Usual, Candyman is Stalking his latest Obsession. He Does the Killings and The Girl is Blamed. Seems Familiar? Here's The Twist. This One is the most Enjoyable From The Whole Series. When I Say Enjoyable, I Really Mean...Terrifying, Stunning, Brilliant, A True Master Piece. I Could not See Myself Thinking so Highly Of The Candyman Without This Latest Installment. It's Just That....Well....I'm Sure The Candyman Will Return for More Thrills Due to This "Odd" Ending. Better than Part 1. Check This and Other Candyman Movies Out!!!!!
