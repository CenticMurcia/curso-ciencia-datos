Laughed the whole way through. Thought it was a parody on all films of the genre. You have GOT to be kidding.All the kids in the room were laughing too. How about those blood sprays?? All death scenes the same except for the wardrobe change. OMG--the acting...But I am glad some people enjoyed it in a different way. Kelly McGillis looked about 65. What on earth has happened to her. That was freaky.<br /><br />Another thing I found odd was the murky, ghastly looking water. I have never been to Hawaii but always thought the water was sky blue. Must be all the fake Kool-Aid blood, huh? <br /><br />Still my whole family watched it all the way through. We took bets who would be the last actor standing--and none of us predicted the end.
