this is a movie about one of my most perferred writers Henry Miller and my absolute favorite female writer Anais Nin. While I thought the movie was quite good and very well acted it only left me with the taste of wanting to read one of the writer's work. I'm not sure if this a disappointment to the movie as much as it is an attribute to the writers who each had a wonderful way of putting together words in such a manner as to make the experience of human life sound as poetic as the experience itself actually is. One thing about the movie that I noticed was the amount of smoking done in the movie, probably as much as any movie made since the fifites. Is the smoking intregal to the movie? no. but there's is some aspect of character lost in today's movies due to directors timidity with smoking or hat wearing. Anyways, this movie was partially undone I think by it's length but overall serves as a very good if it lacks some of the poetry of the writing. It's direction and all other production aspects seem to be up to standard but given that the movie based on true events lacks alot of the standard movie arch and direction that usually satisfies. What were left with is a retelling of people passionately in love with being alive.
