It wasn't wretched, but it just wasn't that funny and I'm a geezer with a gray beard. Sure there are amusing parts, but the two characters had the chemistry of a pebble and tepid tap water. I think Jeffrey Tambor is a fine actor, but Jill's character tries to make us believe he's rather desirable when he's rather overweight, with jowls like Droopy the dog (yes! I'm that old) and Eeyore's demeanor. Charming, I thought he might be. I also think Jill is a great actor, but was she's looking pretty anorexic these days. She was so thin in some scenes that it occurred to me that when do you see fashionable really thin women like her dating lumps of dung like him? Ah, not so much. I like seeing men of his age, dating women of her age, but these two went together like tobacco and peanut butter. Wha-wha-what? Yeah, his mother was a hoot and Earl was a nice foil, but I didn't buy Christopher being anything but a schlep. He fit the running a pest spray company well, but the jazz musician? Again, not so much.<br /><br />I mean I'm near their age, and I found much of the dialog, plot and characters required me to suspend all belief in the law of physics. Say it ain't true Earl? Is it worth a buck a day rental for hearing Sandy Duncan curse? Talk of sex like a whore? See! Its a stretch.
