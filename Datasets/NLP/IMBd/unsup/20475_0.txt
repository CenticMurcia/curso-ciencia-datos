"Doc Hollywood" is a lovely film that deserves a wide audience. It captures some wonderful truths about small-town life in modern America, namely that it is wrong to assume naiveite among its inhabitants, and that the most mundane practice of arcane knowledge, such as medicine, can be the most fulfiling. My only caveat in the entire film appears early on when Julie Warner appears fully frontally nude. She's lovely naked and the shot is completely within the context of the story of the film. But many people might be put off by the nudity and it might be enough for them to not want their children to see the film. That is completely understandable but it is also a shame because with the exception of that shot, the film is wonderful for all ages. I highly recommend "Doc Hollywood" but if female nudity bothers you, then avoid it.
