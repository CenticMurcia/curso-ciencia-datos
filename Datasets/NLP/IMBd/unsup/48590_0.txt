I don't understand why so many like "Happy Tree Friends". I watched 4 episodes of it, and I had more than enough. It's simply a sick series. And it's supposed to be funny. Do the makers really expect that people would laugh at this? Well, unfortunately the makers were right, because there are a lot of people that like it. A lot of my friends even like it, but I simply found it awful. I really can't understand what is funny about this series. Apparently there are many people that dó like it... what I would like to know, is whý these people like it. I'm gonna ask some of my friends why they like it so much. Because I really don't understand why anyone would enjoy this crap.
