"Full Metal Jacket", "Platoon", "Apocalypse Now" - these movies have their rightful place in the history of cinematography, but if you want to have a refreshing look at what war really is on a personal level, you must see this movie. It will grab your heart, it will make you want to live each day to the fullest, it will reinforce the importance of love within you, it will remind you of one simple fact: 'memento mori' is a maxim we all need to keep in mind, but there is another one that is so much more important: 'memento vitae' - remember that you are alive! The love, the youth, the passion for living, the war - all come together in this extraordinary picture. I would recommend it to anyone, from any culture, with any background.
