For the number of big stars in this movie, I'm surprised more care wasn't taken to ensure it wasn't so horrible.<br /><br />The movie starts out promising, with kind of a campy nostaligic feel, but soon progresses into crapland. The script is awful, and it seems like the actors know it. Hearing Gwyneth Paltrow say "what about your hickeys?" in any context is just wrong. And Christina Applegate's acting style fit in on Married with Children, but that's because she was SUPPOSED to act poorly. On a feature film, that approach doesn't work. Mike Myers just should not be in this movie. His character is poorly thought out, and he just pulls out the same old shtick to compensate for a stupid character.<br /><br />This movie gave me that same sinking feeling I got when watching "Cellular". I knew it was just going to get worse and worse, that's what bad movies do.<br /><br />I gave this movie 3 stars. I don't know why I gave it that many. Maybe because Gwyneth looks good.
