The only reason I gave it a rating of 7, and not the 4 I wanted to, was Roddy Macdowell's portrayal of Chiun. I found the head-wrap annoying, but he does not sport Chiun's wispy quaff. If you're a fan of the movie or book series, you really need to see the pilot.<br /><br />It's based on the Novella "The Day Remo Died." This short story was part of "The Assassin's Handbook," later reissued as "Inside Sinanju." Warren Murphy recently reissued a new version of "The Assassin's Handbook" and "The Assassin's Handbook II." Both are available at warrenmurphy.com.<br /><br />I managed to procure a copy of the TV pilot through the generosity of the DestroyerClub.com website (the official site.) They produced a FREE DVD that is yours for the asking. All I had to do was send them a mailing label and a few stamps, and my free DVD arrived. What was cool was the extras Â– the TV promo spot and movie bloopers! I have also seen very poor quality bootlegs for sale on eBay (don't but this trash!)
