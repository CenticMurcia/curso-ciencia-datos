I looked at this movie on the shelf for months before I took a chance and rented it....I figured that it would either be hilarious or suck fiercely. It turned out to be one of the best I've seen this year. It was funny as hell and (I was VERY surprised...)had a great message. The final scenes had way more depth than I was expecting. I can't believe how low the average rating is for this film.
