This is one of the movies that set the standard for movies today. This movie was by far Hollywood at it's best. A classic movie that will make you laugh out loud and surprise you at the end. This movie also reflects acting in its most simple and effect tone. <br /><br />Leslie is a director many enjoyed in the following years in many TV series like: Charlie Chan, F Troop, Gilligans Island, Maverick and too many more to comment on. <br /><br />Those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing Murder in the Blue Room and you have enjoyed Leslie's TV series, this movie is a must see for all of you. It is almost impossible to find on VHS (never been released on DVD) and very few television stations have heard of it so you can't request it from them...so if you do happen to run across it keep it and enjoy!!!
