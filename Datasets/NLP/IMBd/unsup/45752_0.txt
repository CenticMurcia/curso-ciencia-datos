This movie is simply implausible and convoluted.<br /><br />What hits you early on is that it seems like a SAW wannabe with all the elaborate and gory executions. It's hard to believe someone is so prolific at building complex execution staging without leaving a trail of evidence. They should simply be caught when the law traces where unusual quantities and specialized items have been purchased.<br /><br />The FBI seems lethargic and terribly ineffectual from start to finish. I find it hard to believe that NSA could not be tapped, in confidence, to help put and end to something so heinous on the Internet.<br /><br />Other goofy stuff includes hiding one FBI agent in a seedy motel for security, an insanely fast web hit counter, and an FBI agent dumb enough to climb back into a car that's obviously rigged.<br /><br />The only entertaining scene was seeing the psychopath get it good in the end. Other than that it is mostly "Why the F*** did they do that?!"
