This is probably the best show I have ever seen. With great actors various voices it makes for a wonderful way to spend 12 minutes. This show features skits anywhere from 3 seconds, to 5 minutes. The creators of this show use action figures for frame by frame animation. They simply draw mouths on the faces to move them. They frequently make fun of old people, Optimus Prime, Keanu Reeves and a whole bunch of kids shows. When I first saw this, I laughed so hard that I had to turn it off! This is simply the funnies junk I have EVER SEEN!!! Seth Green is a shear genius. Some of the guest voices are Seth MacFarlane, Amy Smart, Macauley Culkin, Phil LeMarr. The show mainly focuses on ironic humor and unexpected twists that frequently uses wrecking balls. haha. The show gets TV ratings anywhere from PG to MA. Some of them are very tasteless, but funny nevertheless. Some are as profane as southpark and have as much sexual content as sex and the city. And some are no worse than the simpsons. So if you are easily offended, this show is not for you. I rate this a 10 out of 10 in my book. Sheer comic masterpieces.
