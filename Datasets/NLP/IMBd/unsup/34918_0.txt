This TV Show was rated one of the five worst shows ever made!! When I saw this evaluation of this Steven Bocho production, I was perplexed a little. Bocho has a reputation for cranking out prime time top quality television shows!. "Hill Street Blues" is one of the best shows ever made, now comes along "Cop Rock" by the same producer, it almost seems impossible to believe. I guess putting heinous crimes to notes and lyrics seemed like a novel idea, however, it BOMBED!!! Television has the right to bad programming, so long as it gets canceled right away!! This show was a mistake, and that's about all you can say about it!! Policemen and detectives do not need to take voice lessons to expedite their jobs effectively, therefore, putting music to police responsibilities seems rather purposeless!! I am glad I saw this show only a couple of times, I will not see it in reruns, and I hope ABC never comes up with a show like this one ever again!! THUMBS DOWN!!
