With a title like MARS, you instantly think of movies like TOTAL RECALL, RED PLANET or even the slightly abominable MISSION TO MARS. Now those movies at least showed the planet Mars in all its glory. In Jon Hess' MARS we get a story that could take place anywhere. We only get two CGI top-shots of the Mars-based Alpha City in the beginning and the end of the movie, and we also see some actors stumbling around on a pile of red sand. The rest of the dull and clich√©d story takes place on card-board interior-sets. It all looks real small and they don't even have enough extra's to populate the sets. The story itself is predictable involving a company-man (Olivier Gruner) arriving on Mars to investigate the death of his brother. But still the plot manages to be structured like any decent police-investigation story. You can immediately spot who the bad guy is and the plot is just an excuse for a lot of kicking and fighting. There's also supposed to be a big successful mining-company on Mars, but all we see is three man drilling outside. The bad guys just can't act and Olivier Gruner is incapable of showing emotion but does kick a few good punches (that's why he was great playing a cyborg in AUTOMATIC and a cybernetic human in NEMESIS). But please don't give him any meaningful lines to say, 'cause you won't be able to stop laughing with his straight face. In the end this movie even loses track of its own purpose. Is it about the drugs? Is it about the ore? Is it about the health of the Marsians? Who cares. But it will have you laughing when the bad boss is killed at the end. So, to many, MARS might be a waste of time, which it probably is. But still, I've seen worse. Mars belongs in that same bad sci-fi vein as PRECIOUS FIND, but at least that one was fun 'cause it didn't take itself seriously.
