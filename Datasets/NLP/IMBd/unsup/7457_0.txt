I was confused when I ran across this on the hotel TV (with no guide screen on the cable). Steven was looking a little older, so it had to be recent, but the cars belonging to these allegedly super-rich villains were all 10-20 years old, so what the heck was it? This came out in 2006? No way. Big budget there -- just scan the local classifieds for $2500 cars. Even TV shows don't stoop that low.<br /><br />I guess that doesn't have much to do with the movie, except this level of quality and attention to detail carries over to the script, acting, everything. You notice things like this when there are no interesting characters to follow, no coherent plot, and the dialog hurts your ears.<br /><br />There is nothing of merit in this movie. Seagal should cut his losses and go do commercials -- they would offer him more dignity. I hope they let him keep one of those 1988 Benzes.
