I saw this in Italian, in Italy. Apparently Italians don't like sub-titles. I missed the start and came in only at the moustache-shaving scene, so, as I don't speak Italian or French I think it's a sign that it's a better film than it might appear that I understood and enjoyed it so much, though I thought it very sad.<br /><br />If I understood it correctly, it's extremely misogynistic, but most men will have recognised the situations and understand the feelings.<br /><br />I just think it's a good sign that such an apparently wordy film can be made to communicate on a non-verbal level.<br /><br />I didn't recognise any of the actors ( though my wife tells me that the actress who played the mother is in the Lurpak ads ) so my understanding wasn't led by anything I might have expected from them.
