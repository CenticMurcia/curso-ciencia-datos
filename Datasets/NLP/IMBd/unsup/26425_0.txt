I really enjoyed this film, I was not sure where it was going to go - so that just added to the suspense. I thought the performances were all terrific and the plot held quite a few surprises - none of which were easy to anticipate. I loved the writing and thought it was a very intelligent representation of what can go wrong when human lust and emotions get out of control. The photography was superb and I would love to live in the house that is all through the movie. It is so interesting human behaviour and what can push us over the brink so to speak and this is primarily what this movie is about - human emotion and psychology and what us humans can be capable of - it is truly an original and spellbinding movie.
