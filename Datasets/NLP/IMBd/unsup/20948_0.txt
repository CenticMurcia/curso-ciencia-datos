Jim Carrey, in his first film starring role after achieving genuine stardom being the "token white guy" on TV's 'In Living Colour', plays the title character, who is hired by employees of the Miami Dolphins football team to locate and retrieve Snowflake the dolphin, the beloved mascot of the team.<br /><br />I really laughed hard when I went to see this in theatres ten years ago, and while I am smart enough to know how crude, silly, and infantile THE MOVIE ITSELF really is, I can't deny that I still laugh a lot. That is thanks in no small part to Carrey, who plays the role in all his manic, face-making, body-contorting glory. Carrey manages to be always funny in this role and he single-handedly manages to save the film from what might have been a disaster with a less talented comedic actor in the lead. As in "Liar, Liar" (which re-teamed Carrey with "Ace" director Tom Shadyac) everybody else is the straight man. There are no other funny roles. (Then again, that seems to have been the pattern for most of Carrey's comedies, hasn't it?)<br /><br />Sean Young (in what turns out to be kind of an embarrassing role) and Courteney Cox both look great and there are some familiar faces in the supporting cast.<br /><br />Some of the real-life Miami Dolphins at the time appear on-screen, including coach Don Shula and quarterback Dan Marino.<br /><br />Network TV airings include a few minutes of footage not included on video and (I assume) DVD versions. This footage actually slows down the film and I can see why it wouldn't have made the theatrical cut.<br /><br />"You really love animals, don't you?" "If it gets cold enough."<br /><br />7/10
