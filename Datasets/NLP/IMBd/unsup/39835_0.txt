I have two favourite periods of history: JFK and the English Civil War. It would therefore have had to have been a really awful film to have kept me away.<br /><br />What can I say. I loved it. Yes there are one or ten historical inaccuracies, and Scott is a poor actor. However, Roth and Everett are very good. I had a great night out with Cromwell & co.
