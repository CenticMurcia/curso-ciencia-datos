The lurid title may suggest vacationing teens getting massacred, but the truth is very different. The cast is almost entirely middle-aged and mad scientists, ruthless businessmen and corrupt officials all play a far greater part in the proceedings than any shark, whether stock footage or rubber. Casper Van Dien gives a sold, hard-working performance, while Jennifer McShane manages to sidestep as many clich√©s as she can and make palatable the ones she simply can't avoid hitting head-on. Bob Misiorowski captures and conveys the desperation that clings to coastal communities from Port Albert to Skegness, but is far less sure of himself with the attack scenes, all of which lack the tension and otherworldly fear they should be full of. Shark Attack is a decent film that - with a little more darkness - could have been a very good one.
