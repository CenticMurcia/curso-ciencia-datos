This is a great movie with some absolutely hilarious clips. From the hip hop Hindu, to a kid who does not want to acknowledge his identity the South Asian/ Desi college kids have a romantic and funny adventure in freshman year. Deep Katdare's character falls in love simultaneously while another Muslim character does as well. The main female character falls in love with the main character and is not a typical American type character where a man and a woman sleep with each other during the first few weeks. Indo-Americans are on average well to do and this movie reflects that(as is typical with Israeli-American/Jewish ethnic films) , as this reflects more of a fusion of the best of Indian and American culture as opposed to just trashing Indian culture in favor of American culture like a lot of other ethnic movies do. On the other hand, it certainly does not bash American culture in an unwarranted way. This is certainly a classic in South Asian circles in North America. This is certainly not representative of the 30's or clumsy as another very remarkably wrong user said.
