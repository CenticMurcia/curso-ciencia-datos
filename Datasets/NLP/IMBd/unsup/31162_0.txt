Since a lot of movie buffs seems to have seen this film, and gave it mostly positive reviews. I decided to give it a try, and I sure wasn't disappointed. The film starts out with all these guys at a bar and they aren't the typical type of people hanging out at a bars either, they are a bit awkward and unreal but at the same time hilarious. And it gives a introduction for each one of the characters even if they won't last a minute, which at first I found to be a bit annoying but once action gets started, you actually really start to appreciate the introductions it showed. Another aspect that sets this horror film from others is that the action starts, almost right from the beginning without the tedious nonsense in some horror films to get the audience to somewhat care about the characters that are trying to survive. This film is a ambiguous, ballsy and hysterical gore fest that will keep you grinning from beginning to end and to top it off the action starts real quick. What I really liked about this film is that it broke just about every rule in the survivor horror genre and sort of does a parody of it making fun it. Also just about every character in this film that are trying to survive isn't really normal but actually quite memorable, cause they go over the top with the generic survival horror types of characters. This is a film you gotta watch with your buddies to get the most enjoyment out at night with it's crude humor, it's a B movie that is most definitely worth checking out, especially if your a horror movie fan.<br /><br />7.6/10
