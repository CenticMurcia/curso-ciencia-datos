Right...first of all, and this is CRUCIAL, hmmmm?! Bin any bullshit you've heard about Twin Town being the Welsh Trainspotting as it is a thousand, zillion times a better film. It bothers with such niceties as a storyline and plot twists, for a start!!! Trainspotting was a good film - in it's day - but unlike Twin Town it's aged really badly.<br /><br />From the start of the credits, which shows Swansea bay and then pans up the hill to uplands, showing all manner of local characters, I was howling with laughter...I used to live in Swansea and I think the whole thing depicts "The Pretty Shitty City" in a fairly accurate manner. In fact, I used to live round the corner from the opening scene was shot...'Fatty's Boys' practically bouncing down a hill in a stolen car...a regular sight off screen too! The boys' antics shows that the Chav was alive and well long before the GLC reared their sun-visored heads...from a sister who works at the local massage parlour (as a receptionist, mind!) and bath-time bongs to a pet dog called Cantona...all the signs are there! The film also boasts a crazily eclectic soundtrack - I defy any fellow Welshie to now set foot on the Kingsway without Downtown resounding in their head! Ending with SFA's "Bad Behaviour" was a stroke of genius - did you know, fact fans, Rhys Ifans (a man who could snap my knicker elastic at 40 paces!) was once a member of the 'Furries?? He was kicked out "else they'd all be dead!" Anyway...I digress...if wittering was an Olympic sport I would win gold for my country every time! WATCH THE DAMN FILM YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
