OK so I think its good fun,<br /><br />On the TECH level<br /><br />I dug the look in some areas more then others such as some ext stuff looked Well videoish (Being that it was shot on video) while the some of the INT especially when Rane fights one of the main bad dudes (who was giving a blowie to other dude) hand to hand had a cool gritty look, Girlie Club also...I wish the latter look was kept throughout more, that's just my personal taste..There's a lot of gun action going on in this flick!<br /><br />Story<br /><br />Simple and to the point it was just good ol Revenge..Nice gratuitous violence =) Aborted babies always a good for a cheer in my book(You'll have to see the flick to understand how messed up it is)!..I liked also the constant hits of coke etc prob most coke hits since Scarface lol..<br /><br />Acting<br /><br />John Fallon who played Rane was solid the rest of the cast ranged from decent to passable(I felt weakest acting wise was female cop)..I Rane's coked up buddy he was cool and I liked the two Fhorensic Cops cracking the jokes.<br /><br />All in all considering small budget and what these guys went for I feel they suceeded on all levels! Will this hit a theater near you, Not likey but will make for a very cool DVD rental or hell go out and buy it. I was entertained and in the end that's all that counts
