As is almost always the case the star is left to carry the movie he or she is in. Life Size was no exception. As the only true actor/star in this made for TV movie it was left to the incomparable Lindsay Lohan to save the day. Unlike her 1998 blockbuster THE PARENT TRAP where Ms Lohan was supported by the likes of Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson, she was surrounded by a who's who of WHO? Her co-stars supermodel Tyra Banks and Jere Burns were mediocre at best and it was left to the timing and comedic talents of Lindsay to breathe life, no pun intended, into this otherwise stale movie. Ms Lohan showed heretofore unseen dramatic talents as well and it is obvious she is on her way to a huge acting career. Life Size is available on video beginning early May.
