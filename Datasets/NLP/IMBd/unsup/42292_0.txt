Wow. That is pretty much all that I can say. For you bad movie lovers out there, this one is possibly the grand-daddy of them all (and yes I have seen Manos the Hands of Fate). Trust me on this one--unless you saw Blair Witch and you know how a movie can actually make you sick, don't rent this film. To be honest with you, I rented this because of the cover: a giant headed, freakishly odd looking alien holding hands with two African kids--that's funny. However, I was soon to learn that the only thing funny about this movie was that a four year old with a hand-held could have done a better job. I don't want to summarize the plot for you, because I'm still not sure what that was. Something about Nukie (an alien) trying to save his brother alien from the evil United States Commodore-64 controlled testing facility. In between can be found talking animals in shorts, stock footage stolen from National Geographic, and all in all, the worst movie I have ever seen. This movie actually made my friend physically sick to his stomach. Frankly, I am sickened to say that man could possibly create such worthless drivel.<br /><br />Let me put it this way--See this movie just so you know that in no possible way has your life been even close to a failure; unless you were involved in the making of this film (if you can actually call it a film). Because no matter what you've done in your life, it could never reach the low that this movie has achieved.
