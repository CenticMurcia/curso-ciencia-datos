Utter nonsense, but fun nonsense. Warwick Davis made this deranged plot a camp riot, and Jennifer Anniston makes a good shrieking target victim.<br /><br />The rest of the cast are not very memorable, except they kept rehashing the same "Lucky Charms" jokes. Some guy with a predictably low IQ swallows a gold coin (!) belonging to a leprechaun who wants it back. That's the whole plot. That's it. The leprechaun hobbles around, searching for his beloved coin, and knocks off a few extras who get in his way.<br /><br />It bogs down in places, especially with the "nobody believes there's a monster" clich√©s which are a staple for this kind of movie. Extra legends about 4-leaf clovers are thrown in at random to provide for a resolution. But who cares; you're laughing too hard at how stupid the whole thing is, anyway. My favorite goof is how the house is supposedly long-deserted, but is fully stocked with groceries, naturally including a certain cereal. The cast all seems to be having fun, probably between acting gigs when they had nothing better to do.<br /><br />For a cheap laugh only. Turn the brain off. And be careful not to eat any gold coins.
