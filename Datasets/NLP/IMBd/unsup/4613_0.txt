The beginning of the film, is kind a slow, but is not annoying. It doesn't last so long, so you don't get tired. What the movie says is the hard side of life, and there aren't many movies that shows it the way Zambrano did. Is sad that Solas and Todo sobre mi madre had such a strong competition. For the Goyas, for the Oscar. Is sad Spain couldn't present both! They would probably leave the Shrine with an ex-aequo award!<br /><br />The characters of Solas are very well written and definite. The huge heart of Rosa (the mother). And the also big heart but with more bad mood heart of Mar√≠a. A lady that seems to give up, until she understands that it could be even worse!<br /><br />The movie makes you feel lucky in some ways! And is sad to think that many people are having such similar problems, and is so horrible to think that there are millions of people out there that wish at least have the house Maria had! So Benito Zambrano has shown us a hard side of life, but not the worst!
