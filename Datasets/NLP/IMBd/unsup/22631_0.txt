I'm from Scotland, & the Kelly version just didn't have it, even although it was entertaining, but the 1966 Goulet version was more realistic & caught the essence of the highlands, I know because, I was a youth hostel member & my happiest memories are when my group of mates & I would travel all over the highlands, magic. With movies that run hundreds of times on our TV over & over again, I can't believe they keep this gem under wraps. I would pay any one $100 if they could send me a copy taken in the 1966 version. Again it's difficult to believe the powers at be pass up the opportunity to make millions of dollars on this film. I remember the movie played twice in the one day, & as I sat there enjoying my vicarious journey to my childhood homeland my heart just swelled with joy. Walter White email < ww76@sbcglobal.net.
