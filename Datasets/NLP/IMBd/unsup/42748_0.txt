This movie was terrible. Absolutely horrible. The acting was some of the worst I've ever seen and the movie seemed to simply revolve around sex. A few of the violent scenes were well done, but the actors were too horrible to pull them off. The outtakes were honestly the best thing on the DVD.<br /><br />Not to mention the fact that I am a REAL climber and realized that he had some ice axes, some crampons, and a lot of TRAD CLIMBING gear that you would die trying to use in pure ice climbing. Mixed climbing, acceptable, but the movie called him an ice climber (which is also different from alpining, which is what hiking in the Himalayas would be). <br /><br />/Gear rant. The movie itself sucked. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't spend any money or time at all on it. Horribleâ™¦
