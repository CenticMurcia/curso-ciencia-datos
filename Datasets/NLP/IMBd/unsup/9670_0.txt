Chasing Papi is an excellent example of the mingling of the Latino-American and Anglo-American culture!<br /><br />Linda Mendoza's debut movie proved to be a great success, a well made movie, hot, spicy, funny, and the 4 stars of this movie are the most beautiful people on the planet! Gorgeous, award winning Eduardo Verástegui, the emerald green eyed hero of México, known all over the world as the beautiful gipsy hero in the jennifer Lopez clip ""Ain't it Funny"" (#1 on the charts in almost 100 countries) is the fastest rising male Latino star! Eduardo is a great example for all of us, his sincerity, warmth and kindness are magnificent. Eduardo is very active helping to fund charity projects, a man always ready to help people in need. Thinking of all these wonderful aspects of Eduardo makes seeing him in action all the more wonderful!<br /><br />And then, back to the storyline of the movie! Méxican superstar Eduardo plays with great fun and dedication Tomas, an executive in love with 3 woman! These 3 woman are not just woman, they are the most beautiful ladies of America Latín!!<br /><br />The 3 female superstars are not only of dazzling beauty, they act superb as well, as in the movie they are all in love with Tomas without knowing this from each other. Everything explodes into a funny romantic, twisting and turning storyline when the 3 woman decide to teach their Chasing Papi a lesson..<br /><br />The movie glows of enthusiasm, dedication, made by a great crew, and incredible cast, warm wonderful people. You can see the best of Hollywood here, a truelly 21th Century Hollywood, where no longer cold egocentrism and Big Money Rules, but these facts shown to be replaced by warmth, and kindness.<br /><br />This new, better face of Hollywood we can be proud of, we hope this is the new trend, and more movies of such nice wonderful people will appear! The friendship among the entire Chasing Papi-crew, the great work of Fox 2000, proves there is a bright future for the new generation superstars!<br /><br />My deepest appreciation for all the people that made Chasing Papi such a very special and dear project!<br /><br />For all of you who missed the movie, there is the DVD/video available at Amazon.com. Type ""Chasing Papi"" in the search box and order. Watch and enjoy!<br /><br />Anthonie van Vliet M.Sc.
