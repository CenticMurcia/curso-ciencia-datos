Within the first five minutes, your jaw will hit the floor. <br /><br />I write for a major horror review publication and see them all. Pink Eye is not for Hollywood buffs. But its the froth of the horror indie slaughterhouse floor, and its reminiscent of the 80's when horror was low budget and raw, without trying to be. <br /><br />The combination of director James Tucker and writer Joshua Nelson has hit the monkey for dinner on the head before - Aunt Rose, Addiction, and Skinned Alive are titles you cant go wrong with on a blind purchase. Also, Melissa Bacelar frequents these parts. Although she's not nude in any of them (DAMN DAMN DAMN!!!!) there are ample alternatives in the T&A department. On top of it, Melissa can act, and can carry your eyes through 90 minutes of ANYTHING. <br /><br />If you can appreciate good low budget horror, don't pass this one up.
