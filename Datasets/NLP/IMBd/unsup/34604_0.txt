Pathetic movie. This is the second pathetic movie I have seen in my life. I don't remember the name of the 1st pathetic movie. This movie is so sick. I was expecting some really cool graphics work, but was disappointed. The story is OK. Had there been more twists and turns, I could have given a 5 for this movie. But I can only give this movie a 1. Very bad movie. The actors have done a OK job. Overall a pathetic movie. Don't recommend it to your friends unless you want them to suffer. The director needs to get a huge collection of DVD's so that he can get some inspirations of file making.<br /><br />The story runs at such a bad pace. Being a pirate movie, I was wishing more thrills. The end is even more pathetic. The hero and heroine had been shot. They get up after some time without showing any signs of pain!!!
