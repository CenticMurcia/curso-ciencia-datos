Obviously this is one of those films I only wanted to see for some good nudity and sex scenes, but I didn't get what I was expecting. The only two sex scenes that I can actually remember was a very short lesbian scene in the club that the main guy was visiting, they were doing it while he chatted with the owner. The other is the main girl having ice cubes rubbed all over. The main girl is a really good singer, and quite attractive, but she could have done more, if you know what I mean. The main guy is an idiot and is only good for choosing the right girl. Again, there is not enough of what I wanted in a porn like film. Pretty poor!
