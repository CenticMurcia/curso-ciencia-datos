The welcome return of Sean Bean and Darragh O'Malley to the screen in Sharpe was so overdue. I love historical drama and the feature length really did the period justice. Fantastic production. All the actors were excellent. Completely in role. Excellent casting. I felt irritated I wasn't aware of the 'Making of Sharpe's Challenge' so didn't record it. Now I've missed it. I wish some historical dramas were preceded with an actual documentary about the events including famous works of art. There's a famous oil painting of the forlorn hope attacking a fort similar to this isn't there? I'd have liked to have looked out for the depictions in the film. Thanks to Sean Bean, Darragh O'Malley for their work. Don't give up on us. Also Shaggrat 'don't you know we're at Warrr? where have i heard that before!!!! Boromir?
