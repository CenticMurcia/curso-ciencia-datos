Inspector Gadget 2 (2003, Dir. Alex Zamm) Still in the police force, Inspector Gadget (Stewart) is reduced to sitting around. After capturing Claw (Martin), all the criminals have gone into hiding untilClaw escapes! Gadget thinks he will get the case, but everyone else has other planes. A new version of the Gadget project is unveiled in the form of G2 (Hendrix). Strict orders are given for Gadget to stay away from G2 and every crime scene, but Gadget feels he is needed more than anyone.<br /><br />Tries to make the film similar to its animated show but ends up creating a film which is more disappointing than the original. The CGI effects are terrible, many plot holes from the first film are unanswered and French Stewart fails to capture the same quality performance that Broderick achieved as Gadget.<br /><br />You can't fire me. I quit!  Inspector Gadget (French Stewart)
