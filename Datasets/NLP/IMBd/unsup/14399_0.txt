The Scarlet Pumpernickel is a great and very interesting take on the Alexandre Dumas classic The Scarlet Pimpernel. The short starts with Daffy getting frustrated at only being typecast in comedy, and reads HIS version of the classic to the producer. The rest is a roller-coaster of priceless performances from the toons, swashbuckling and sight gags complete with references to Errol Flynn, with an unexpected ending to boot. The animation is pretty much spotless, and the music is rousing. The story is fun, and there are some many good moments, so much so I cannot think of my favourite part.<br /><br />The toons however are the real stars here; Daffy takes on the role of "The Scarlet Pumpernickel" and does so with gusto. Porky is given little to do but does what he can with The Lord High Chamberlain, while Sylvester relishes his part as the Duke. Also Melissa is a very beautiful and cute duck I think. All thanks to the marvellous vocal talents of the immortal Mel Blanc. All in all, hugely entertaining. 9/10 Bethany Cox
