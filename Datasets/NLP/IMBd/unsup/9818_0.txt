This documentary contains many factual errors and instances of flawed reasoning. The director did a poor job of finding credible witnesses and he plays on the paranoia many people have of the government. To a conspiracy theorist, nothing ever happens randomly. There is always someones behind the scenes pulling the strings. I think the funniest (and perhaps pathetic) moment of loose change is when it shows footage of the second plane hitting the second tower. The footage clearly shows the plane making a direct hit, almost a bullseye into the tower, but the narrator claims "it barely hit the tower" And the director expects me not to believe my own eyes? By the way, the narrator's smug voice gets pretty annoying. A film called screw loose change debunks practically every point made in loose change and rather convincingly. it points out the glaring errors made by this hack.
