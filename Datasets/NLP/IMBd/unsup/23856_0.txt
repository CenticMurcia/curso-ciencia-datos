I have to say I find it difficult to join in the chorus of 'masterpiece' preceding this comment but that is not to dismiss it out of hand. I merely wonder it is possible to have a thriller without thrills. It's clear from murder #1 who the killer is and there's not even an attempt at a red herring but by the same token we are spared the justification scene I did it because my parents rejected me, never displayed affection, etc. Apparently this guy IS really just a son of a bitch. This leaves us with atmosphere, lighting, music, acting. The lighting is non existent and what music there is is unobtrusive but luckily acting and atmos test high so all in all it's well worth an 8.
