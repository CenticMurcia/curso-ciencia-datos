If you enjoyed the film versions of Ghost in the Shell and are worried that a TV version will be an inferior product you shouldn't be, Stand Alone Complex is excellent, and as it takes place in an alternate time line to the films Major Motoko Kusanagi is once again leading the operational side of Section Nine.<br /><br />Each series has twenty six episodes, some following a main story line, others which which are self contained, some of these tell us about the characters' pasts. The series is lighter in tone than the film but still exciting when it needs to be. Some viewers might not be too keen on the addition of the Tachikoma, small blue tanks with cute voices, I too felt that way initially but grew to like them more and more as the series progressed. As this was made for television the Major keeps her clothes on far more than in the film, she does however wear a rather revealing costume in the first series.<br /><br />An exciting story well told is helped by really good animation accompanied by a great sound track. I really liked the characters, especially the Major, it was nice to get to know them better than the shorter film format allowed. I would certainly recommend this, not just to people who enjoyed the films but also to any fan of exciting science fiction.<br /><br />Don't switch off when the end credits start as after the credits for each episode there is a short "Tachikomatic Days" story, a little comedy sketch featuring the Tachikoma.<br /><br />These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.
