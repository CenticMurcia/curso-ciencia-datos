I thought I could never find a completely bad movie. Well, I found it. It's this movie. This has to be the' worst movie ever made. Everyone over acts, there is no flow to the movie. Shakespeare will role over his grave every time someone sees this ruined version. I strongly recommend not seeing this movie.
