This movie considers what life is like when 2 people attempt to build a relationship with sex as its foundation. The question asked of the viewer is `What would a relationship be like if the only connection the couple makes is sexual?' The answer is quite obvious.<br /><br />** Possible Minor Spoilers ***<br /><br />Each main character is consumed by sex. One-night stand type sex or sex without meaning. This is all well and good but problems arise when 2 of the characters mistakenly try to have a real relationship based on their like appetites for sex. Demi Moore and Rob Lowe quickly learn workable relationships are much, much more than great sex. Most people, including myself, at one time or another think sex is the single most important part of a relationship. This thinking could not be further from the truth as this movie tries to illustrate.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie is not real effective. Nor is it very funny. All 4 characters are complete sluts and seem to lack any type of intelligence. James Belushi is funny but Demi's friend, Elizabeth Perkins, is simply annoying until the very end of the movie. Let's face it, Rob Lowe is not a great actor and it shows. Demi, with her utter beauty and sexy voice, is extremely sensual and naked in the movie. She makes the entire film worth watching in my estimation. The ending is decent but the story is told in a choppy way. The scenes do not flow together very well. The characters, Lowe and Demi, do seem to learn something thru their experience but overall they are both shallow people.<br /><br />Overall this film is watchable and somewhat enjoyable but does not do a good job developing the character's thoughts and emotions. Plus, this comedy is simply not very funny other than a few stories and lines by Belushi. This film is more `eye candy' than a true portrayal of a couple's trials. 4 out of 10.<br /><br />
