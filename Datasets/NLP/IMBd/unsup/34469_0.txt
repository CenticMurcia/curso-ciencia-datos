This film had to have been written by a junior high school student, because that's the only mentality that could enjoy it. When the main plot device is to make sure you sleep with someone on New Years Eve (in 1981 to boot) you can't expect much more. Also, it contained the most stilted dialogue and wooden acting to make it to the screen in quite some time. I'm especially disappointed in Christina Ricci, who is capable of so much more. I didn't care what any of these people did or if they ever got to their party. A few laughs, but not worth the time. The soundtrack is the best part of this juvenile, amateurish film.
