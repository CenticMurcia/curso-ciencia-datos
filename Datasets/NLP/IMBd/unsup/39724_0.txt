What an awful movie with a pathetic story line! This has to be one of the worst writing and directing jobs out there. The writer is obviously ignorant,uninformed or just plain stupid. The whole restaurant scene was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen. The portrayal of the Albanian restaurant with middle eastern music and belly dancers was ridiculous and inaccurate!!! Albania is one of the oldest countries located in Eastern EUROPE and has no such music nor does it have belly dancers!! To put it nicely the writer and director should be embarrassed of this piece of crap. <br /><br />Don't waste your time on this! I gave this disaster a 1 because 0 was not a option...
