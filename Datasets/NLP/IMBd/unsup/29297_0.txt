i have to say i've been a fan of Takashi Miike's films for some time now. i was essentially sold on him after watching "Audition", which was an incredibly creepy piece of work to say the least, but alas, that's not what i'm writing about so on we go.<br /><br />i have to say i was a little skeptical at first when we paid a dollar to rent this movie, but no doubt it will find it's way into my DVD rack sometime soon. this movie will grab you right from the beginning. the opening scene with Tarantino is a great lead-in to the movie, and from there it never disappoints.<br /><br />the characters are developed extremely well and all of the action is very well done and choreographed. obviously it's a western, but think more "Ichi the Killer" meets "Tombstone" meets "Kill Bill" and you'll be a little closer to what this movie has to offer.<br /><br />all in all, if you're fan of Miike, watch it. if you're a fan of westerns, watch it. if you're a fan of action movies, watch it. but most importantly, if you're a fan of good movies, you have to see it.
