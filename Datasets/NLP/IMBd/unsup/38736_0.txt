I found this movie at WalMart in the $5.88 section. I had heard mostly bad things about it but decided to give it a try anyway. After viewing it, i'm sorry that i didn't spend my money on better things. It isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, but it's pretty bad. The acting is mostly high school level and the music is really lame. The worst performance is "Ranger Bill" played by David Johansen, he really sinks this movie before it has any chance to be anything although the other actors are not much better. The three campfire stories range from boring to bad to average at best. If you're looking for a real horror/suspense type of movie, do NOT look here, i'm sorry i did.<br /><br />
