Flåklypa Grand Prix is a one of a kind movie. The magic that Caprino has created with his puppets is absolutely amazing. You don´t have to like puppet movies and the film is not only for kids.<br /><br />This is a movie that you will find much pleasure in seeing over and over again. The detail work is fantastic and you will see new details every time. The film is a masterpiece in every aspect, the story, the sound-track and the picture. All fits together in perfect harmony. This movie is a true classic and I reward it a 10.<br /><br />The DVD version of 2000 should be a must have for every film lover. The film has been restored and dolby digital 5.1 is added.
