Terrible movie, with goofy music and the kind of wacked out scenes you'd expect to see in a bad dream. I thought the movie sounded good when I heard it had something to do with vampires and such. It turned out to be a long, boring movie that wrecked the rest of my evening, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie. Expecially when there is so much more better things out there.
