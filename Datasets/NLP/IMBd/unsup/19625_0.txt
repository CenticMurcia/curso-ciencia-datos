I wanted to like this show, and the hosts are a likable pair, but the show is the same show over and over. Never any real proof of a haunting anywhere they go. Just some photo's of orbs (most paranormal researchers don't consider orbs paranormal) and Chris contorting and making weird noises, sorry Chris but I can do the same thing if I wanted to. Also the choice of locations leave a lot to be desired. If you want to catch a ghost's spirit you should go to actual places they lived, not a restaurant they went to at some point in their lives....<br /><br />I like Gail Porter, she is cute and perky, even after losing her hair I think she is awesome, but they show just doesn't deliver the goods. However, it can be entertaining as long as you know you aren't going to see a haunting.
