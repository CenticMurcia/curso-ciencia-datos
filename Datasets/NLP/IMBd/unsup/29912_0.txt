A no-frills role for Cher playing an over-worked Public Defender whose latest client (forced upon her by the court) is a homeless, deaf-mute male accused of murder. Still, this is a terrific Cher performance: focused, unselfish on the screen, and quite natural; she's charming without effort. Dennis Quaid is a decent match for her as a Capitol Hill lobbyist and juror who wants to help piece together the murder-mystery surrounding a female clerical assistant who had information regarding dirty doings in Washington, D.C. A fairly sophisticated yarn, though one cut straight from a formula. Director Peter Yates does well at keeping the pace lively, though some of the early moments with Quaid are confusing and the script is weighty with contrivances and red herrings. Builds to a strong climax and all the supporting performances are solid. *** from ****
