What is essentialy a very simple story is made into a compelling masterpiece by Russel Crowe and Al Pacinos performance's. <br /><br />Michael Mann certainly is the mann as even with the great acting the film would have been very dull with out the direction of Mann. His ability to keep the atmosphere of the film going through image and music is second to none. Suspence is held throughout with a kind of feer to the characters.<br /><br />We have to wait till the end for his trademark slow motion frame, but it well worth it.<br /><br />Excellent Film.<br /><br />
