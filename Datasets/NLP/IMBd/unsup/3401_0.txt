Although I am not a purist or any other kind of radical as well as usually abstaining from strong language I am forced to say just one thing...: THIS FLICK SUCKS!!! The story is not only as cheesy as the Sherwood is green, it is so predictable that you have uncovered the plot after 10 minutes... if you haven't fallen asleep after the first 5... If you have the choice between seeing this "movie" and staring at a pure white wall for 2 hours... watch the wall!
