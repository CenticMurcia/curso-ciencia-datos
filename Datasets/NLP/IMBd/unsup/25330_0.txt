I saw just the first hour of this movie trying to see what my guide meant by dead. Then when I find out the movie turns out to suck. <br /><br />The cinematography is horrible with the fact that you can see what is computer generated and what isn't. Give you an example, the first time the zombie gang attacks our "heroes" of this movie one of the marshals is firing out of the SUV and it looks like they used a blue screen either for the character or for the background. <br /><br />Why does a zombie carry around a jackhammer in the first place. Ohhh, and for an added bonus the marshals who are supposed to be trained at firing guns can't hit the jackhammer zombie because they are firing at the jackhammer that is just there.<br /><br />This "MOVIE" doesn't make any sense at all.
