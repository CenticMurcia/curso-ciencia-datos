I watched this film on DVD and absolutely loved it--nearly as much as other European crime classics such as RAFIFI, BOB LE FLAMBEUR and GRAND SLAM. The acting was amazingly realistic--particularly from Jean-Louis Trintignant in the lead. The direction is generally excellent and the writers showed that they could make an intelligent and well-constructed film that is timeless. And the film just screams quality is nearly every respect.<br /><br />Despite how much I loved the film, the editing was very odd, in that the scene transitions from the present (1970) to 1965 and this transition is not at all smooth. You figure it all out very quickly but you are left with the distinct impression that you missed something. As I had the DVD, I went back and reviewed this transition where the two male crooks are eating at the home of the lady Jean-Louis Trintignant met at the theater in 1970 (after his prison escape). Suddenly, his old girlfriend is seen driving up to a house in the country and it's "pre-crime"--and long before he goes to prison. It appears to be a mistake and I can't see why the director would have chosen this otherwise.<br /><br />So one final comment about the film. The movie succeeds in hooking you because the plot is pretty entertaining and complex and I strongly recommend it. Oddly, however, the DVD box says it's a comedy. I wouldn't agree--it's not at all funny, though it has some ironic twists (that you're bound to like) and has a somewhat light mood at times.
