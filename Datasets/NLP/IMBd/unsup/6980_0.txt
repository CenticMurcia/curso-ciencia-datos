Get this for a weird plot: Set in a run-down apartment building sometime in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic future, the landlord, who is also a butcher, keeps the neighbourhood supplied with meat by slicing up applicants for the job of assistant in his shop. His daughter, who falls in love with the newest applicant Louison (Dominique Pinon) helps keep the butcher from chopping up Louison until he learns of the danger he is in, and escapes with the help of a band of vegetarian freedom fighters, and his new-found love. It is an incredibly bizarre film that contains painstaking details of the lives of some of the apartment's peculiar residents.
