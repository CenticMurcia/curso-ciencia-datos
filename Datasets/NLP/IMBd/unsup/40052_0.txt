In the beginning of this movie there is some bird or owl that got too close to the camera that it makes this annoying sound. This movie is awful and the painful acting doesn't help. In some scenes the peoples mouths move but the wrong words come out. There must have been something wrong with the dubbing that day. At one point I thought that it was being narrated but it isn't. This is just another terrible movie. Every killing is in slow motion and when the lady is being kidnapped she doesn't even try to escape. It's pathetic. Also the music sounds like a bunch of hyper active kindergardeners in a jazz night club. There is also a bad wrestling scene, a pop can on a guys neck and too many redheads. I got confused and thought that the main redhead was dead but then she wasn't and it was just another redhead. It doesn't matter anyway. Just avoid this movie.
