"Marie Antoinette" is the epitome of classic Hollywood grandeur in film-making. No expense was spared in this lavish production which features sumptuous sets, intricate costumes, beautiful cinematography, and also some top-notch acting. Norma Shearer and Robert Morley give fantastic performances as the King and Queen of France, who live in luxury while their subjects starve. Norma especially draws kudos for playing a complicated part, which is definitely Oscar-worthy. Tyrone Power is also in it, although he is pretty much wasted in a rather small role. For anyone who would like to see classic films at their peak, "Marie Antoinette" is a must-see!
