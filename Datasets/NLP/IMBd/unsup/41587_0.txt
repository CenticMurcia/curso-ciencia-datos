Not much to this film. Group of strangers including a handsome, wisecracking paleontologist, a professor and his hot daughter, a grizzled Vietnam vet and his alky, unsatisfied wife, two nude models and their photographer are on a plane which crashes in the 'Valley of the Dinosaurs', where headhunting and cannibalism is still practiced by the resident tribe!! I must point out that well before the plane takes off you've seen all the chicks naked already, this is that type of film. Awesome! But I digress, the survivors of the wreck must walk out of the jungle, avoiding not only the cannibals but also the cruel slavers who would just love to get their hands on some fresh meat... and are picked off by a variety of methods.<br /><br />Good cheesy fun with plenty of T&A!!
