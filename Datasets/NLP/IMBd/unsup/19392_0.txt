Good movie, except, and this is a big except. When Anthony Hopkins is acquitted, you then seen him at a window, in the jail?, retrieving his personal belongings. One item is the gun. I'm sure when he went to jail and he had the gun on him, they said, "Oh, OK Mr. Crawford, we'll just hold this for you until you get out." Nobody thought him bringing a gun to jail and the jailers handling it like it was his wallet was a problem? An then, they give it back to him? Excuuuussssseeeee me! What happened? And this is big in the movie. If the gun is not back in his drawer, then Ryan Gosling never retrieves it and Hopkins gets away, scott free. It was a nice plot twist about the switching of the guns, but to have it miraculously returned by the prison when he leaves, basically made the movie a bit unbelievable.
