this movie just made me sick to the bone. it is a sick attempt to create a from dusk till dawn kinda movie. it starts of as a road movie with the pshyco killer and then goes to a bar. hmm where did i see that before.? the humor was so bad it became horrible. the guys with two guns raised ready to go out side was just crap. the pretty female being an ugly but good alien ? ohw come on what were they thinking? and the end that it all as a dream ohw please . so if you like to mess up you're day watch this movie. if u like crap that is more crap than crap watch this one and you will have a blast. and to be honest the box is better than the movie and that says enough for me .
