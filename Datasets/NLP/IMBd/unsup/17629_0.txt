"Saving Marriage"<br /><br />A Must See<br /><br />Amos Lassen and Cinema Pride<br /><br />I had heard great things about Michael Roth's documentary "Saving Marriage" so when I sat down to watch it last night I was ready for something amazing. This is one of the most powerful and well made documentaries I have ever seen and it is absolutely a must see film for everyone regardless of sexual tendency or political alignment.<br /><br />When the Commonwealth of Massachusetts became the first state to recognize gay marriage, a constitutional amendment suddenly is presented to take that right away. With that the Massachusetts legislature became a battleground and activists and newcomers found themselves involved in a fierce political war. The future of American gay rights was the prize to be won and it is very, very close. The battle to save gay marriage would change the way people view same-sex relationships and the history of civil rights takes n a new meaning with this fight. The movie is a record of that. This is the movie that will change the way one values gay marriage as it shows why it is an absolute necessity to the our survival as a community.<br /><br />"Saving Marriage" is moving and highly emotional and it is not just about gay marriage but about the rights of all humans. It is a detailed view of the entire gay marriage issue in Massachusetts and presents both sides of the issue. One of the main things that it does is give a very careful explanation as to the difference between marriage and civil unions. Civil unions are only band-aids for a short term solution, a kind of appeasement and not a term of equality. The message of equality and creating a better life for all is the true values of "Saving Marriage". We are taught that the government is supposed to protect citizen rights and not deny them. I would venture to say that many of us have no idea of how the issue of same-sex marriage came about and this film gives us a time-line of events showing the role of the courts and legislatures. The interviews are enlightening in the way that they explain why politicians voted "yes" or "no" on the amendment but it is even more engrossing to see the process by which an ordinary person, the man on the street, can make difference.<br /><br />By seeing the first gay marriages in Massachusetts during which the amendments were proposed to shoot down and ban the practice, we are taken on a tour of emotions as both politicians and "little people" fought out the battle for equal rights in the New England legislature. Coming together for a cause such as this shows how laws can be changed, altered or done away with and that we as ordinary Americans can change lives.<br /><br />I have always considered myself an activist, especially since I moved to Arkansas but after seeing "Saving Marriage", I see how little I have done. Here are people who have devoted their entire beings to bringing about change. I feel so insignificant.<br /><br />This is also a film that is filled with passion and as you watch you heart fills with pride. I found myself wondering why I have not worked harder in the fight for equality. The beauty and sadness of the personal stories in the film is an extremely moving experience.<br /><br />Told from a GLBT perspective, the filmmakers incorporate all points of view, showing both sides of the issue. Here we get the human face of the same-sex marriage debate. We see wedding ceremonies, we see same-sex families. We see love. Anyone who claims to be apathetic about what the word "marriage" means as opposed to "civil unions" has to see this film. <br /><br />As Americans, we are all entitled to the very same rights and privileges without regard to gender, race, creed and sexual identity. This movie will make us realize how important that is. The suspense, emotion and drama in "Saving Marriage" should be a wake up call to all of us who have nothing to advance the way our community lives today. This just one beautiful film that shows us not only how we live, but how we should live. It is one film that everyone, straight, gay, black, white, Jewish, Christian, whatever owes it to himself to see.
