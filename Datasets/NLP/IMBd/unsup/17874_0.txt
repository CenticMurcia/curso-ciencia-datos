I thought that this was a spectacular movie, with a good cast. The plot was cleverly put together, and the responses from the characters were quite realistic, making this movie an exciting and thrilling ride (too bad about the give away scene about 3 quarters of the way through.)<br /><br />The film starts with with the "putting together" of a group of ten people, all driven to the same hotel, by a wild storm, that has flooded all the surrounding roads. As time goes by the group of people are being murdered, one person at a time. As you could expect in a situation like this, fingers are pointing all over the place, but who is the real murderer?<br /><br />Ten People, One Hotel, One murderer, No Escape!<br /><br />This film is one to watch!
