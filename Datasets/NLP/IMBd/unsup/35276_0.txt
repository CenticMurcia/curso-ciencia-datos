The plot of the movie is a good one but pretty typical of a b type thriller movie. If you don't mind the ridiculous premise of a screener killer and a 15 year old killer this one is for you. I found it hard to get past the fact that 2 adults could not defend themselves against a little girl with basically no weapons at the end as stupid. This is the perfect movie for teenagers to watch for the scare factor but overall pretty bad. There was hardly any gore shown and the acting is sub par. I guess the best part about the movie is that it was only 1 hour 24 minutes of wasted time on my part and the location that it was filmed is quite nice.
