Altho QUITE a bit different than the Edgar Wallace story on which it's based, this is an excellent serial, none-the-less. Why? Because it's QUITE a bit different than the usual "mad-genius-taking-over-the-world" sort of thing that was the usual theme of serials at that time.<br /><br />A crook & his henchmen move into a castle (to be used as a "base of operations"), but they didn't reckon on the "ghost" of the Green Archer who haunts the place. He continually thwarts the crooks in their shady deeds, and it's quite a surprise when he is unmasked at the end of the film.<br /><br />An enjoyable film!
