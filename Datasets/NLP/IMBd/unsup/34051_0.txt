The movie has terrible actors. Even young actors from the Portuguese soap-operas are better. Well, when most of actors are from the family, the best actors from this movie are then the American secondary actors. It is more than obvious that this movie was made only to get some money to pay the holidays of all Oliveira's family to USA and Madeira. The sound is awful, as well as the image. A kid could do a movie with a better argument. In the end, everybody becomes convinced that Colombus wasn't Portuguese with again terrible arguments! The movie cannot has 1/10, since it has still one funny part: "Oh Silvia!..." when the old actress (director's wife) forgets her lines. A terrible pseudo-nationalist movie, as a old men's crank.
