Man. Bad, just bad. I can remember the trailer for this movie. A well editted glimpse, with all the explosoions, and feminine body outlines necesary to look like another good kill people and then have sex movie (knock 'em all you like people dig james bond syndrome). All with the back drop of Wycleff Jean's Stayin Alive remix.....got you real excited.<br /><br />Then I saw the movie. I submit that it was written by a 14 year old. Dialogue stupid enough to make you feel ashamed at the thought someone might witness you watching the film. Action scene's with no real thrill, pathetic little attempts at comic relief. And let's not forget, suggestively stroking a frozen chicken........"Worst episode ever"
