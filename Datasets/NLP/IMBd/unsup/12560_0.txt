After getting panned by reviewers and critics alike, I went along to the local two dollar theater with little expectation. What I saw was a very funny movie, with some excellent dialogue and set at a great pace. The story is silly and some of the special effects look rough around the edges, but who cares? The story and many memorable quotes make this a great film for kids and adults alike. I may get this as a DVD when it's released!<br /><br />Quite the sleeper hit.
