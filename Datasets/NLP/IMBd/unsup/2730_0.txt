Typical slow, boring, badly written and acted movie that idiots will over-praise because they confuse dull with intellectual. The "psychological cat and mouse game" consists of endlessly boring, repetitive dialog and people acting one way and then another for no reason.<br /><br />"You were in love with him" "No, I wasn't" "Yes, you were." "No, I wasn't" "Yes, you were"<br /><br />That's the level of the supposed "mind games" being played here.<br /><br />In the end, the whole movie ends up being just another example of the disgusting sexist clich√© about a woman falling in love with her rapist.
