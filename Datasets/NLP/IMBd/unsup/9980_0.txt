And then filmed during each actors day off at their actual paying jobs? I have to wonder if each actor has a copy and if they crack it open every time they have company over to share in the pride that they once were in an actual movie. I am sure they meant well. I am positive that this movie was meant to be thrown into a well and drowned before someone had the brilliant idea to show the entire world a movie so badly created that a scene that depicts the actual time period that they "chased" to had to shown via dates on coins. High-Tech stuff. And why is it that every time that a "INTO THE FUTURE" movie is made...does anyone not die before they get to that point in time? My copy of this movie may come in handy during my future. I may need to level my dryer with it or I might use it as a coaster for a pitcher of beer as I enjoy watching the MST3k version of it. Huzzah!
