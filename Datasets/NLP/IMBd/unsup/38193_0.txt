I hated this flick.<br /><br />Rodney Dangerfield makes me laugh often, but not in this film. Even in the few lines he had that were actually funny, for reasons relating to the obviously poor directing, those lines sort of fell flat.<br /><br />And that's the story of this film--poor directing. This film comes off as the work of an amateur. And it is no wonder--this was James Signorelli's first major film-directing project. And, except for the unfortunate Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, it was also his last.<br /><br />Joe Pesci seems very out of place--probably a casting error. He just seemed to be playing the wrong character altogether. Maybe this is just a part of the poor directing, but he seemed like he wasn't at all interested in putting in a good performance.<br /><br />The film has an overall tone that is way way way too serious for a comedy--a clear indication of an amateur comedy-director. I would classify it as a drama, actually, if I were forced to classify it. Yet the plot is very hard to believe in, and it would've been so even if this had been filmed more as a really over-the-top comedy--just completely ridiculous.<br /><br />Of course, my first viewing comes in 2006. Obviously, I may have given it a 2 instead of a 1 had I seen it in the 80's.<br /><br />You can safely skip this one, even if you are a big Rodney Dangerfield fan. If you need to see a movie with Dangerfield in it, I'd recommend Caddyshack and Back to School, or just any of them other than this one.
