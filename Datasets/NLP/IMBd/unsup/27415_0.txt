After just viewing this film, I found myself appreciative of the attempt, but the sad fact remains: the film leaves you with so many loose ends, you have to wonder why Jeremy Podeswa started so many plot lines to begin with. If this was intended to be a character study, why set up expectations for individual conclusions? Most of the characters in the film end up in the same place they were where they began, but with not a gain in wisdom or understanding. In fact, the audience is left hanging along with the characters.
