Chuck Norris, stiff-as-usual, in yet another mind-numbingly predictable action thriller which actually has just as much talk as action, maybe even more. Professor Toru Tanaka is a promising-looking villain, but even he doesn't prove to be a worthy opponent for good ol' Chuck. And Christopher Lee is wasted, again. (*1/2)
