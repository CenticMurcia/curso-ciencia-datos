In the future humanity is on the verge of destroying itself which leads to the scientists at ROTOR to make a cyborg policeman who goes berserk and starts killing people for speeding, now it's up to the scientist to destroy him while (in the film's most laughable moments)he waxes philosophical about the robot's place in the universe. I'm not sure if I remember the opening credits but they read "We wanted to create the perfect cop, but along the way something went terribly wrong!" Irony has never been so abundantly clear. ROTOR has gained the reputation of one of the worst movies ever made. I can't disagree either because I think that this craptastic thriller is so ineptly made that you can't help but laugh. Indeed it's hard to keep a straight face when the acting is this universally horrid and that our would be hero (Looking like Gary Busey without the sex appeal)starts waxing philosophical questions such as "Is it really his fault? He's doing exactly what we programmed him to do." or "To face him is like facing yourself. Your failure is his failure, to win you must use pure illogic" (Obviously the writers of this script did)Indicating that this film is made with such leaden seriousness that the movie is perfect for anyone game for a laugh. The production values are also woeful with some of the worst dubbing ever imaginable. Surprisingly ROTOR didn't sweep the Oscars that year but i'm still at a loss at why this camp classic has yet to get a DVD released. I mean if Date Movie can get a DVD release...<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)
