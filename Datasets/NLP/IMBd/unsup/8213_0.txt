This movie is really extremely funny.<br /><br />That is, if you are into either Comics, Science Fiction or Shopping Malls.<br /><br />The basic idea is simple: Two dumped guys try to win their girl-friends back, and their brilliant strategy is to hang around in the local shopping mall.<br /><br />What makes the movie work is the wonderful mix of slap stick humor, intelligent puns and gross sexual innuendos. The actors are excellent in their roles, and I was surprised to see Ben Affleck and Claire Forlani, two coming actors, credited for supporting roles.<br /><br />For a comic fan this movie is a awfully funny experience. But I can imagine that the film looses some of its appeal when you are not familiar with the Marvel and DC comic heroes and the strange passion (and science) of collecting comic books.<br /><br />And to everybody who has also failed in seeing a sailboat in those dumb 3-D-pictures, this movie provides some comfort...
