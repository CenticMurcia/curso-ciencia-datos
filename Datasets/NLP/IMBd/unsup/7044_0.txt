I chose this movie for a report in my Communications class. I have seen it several times but looking at it from a different angle this time, I saw the development of Swayze's character or his return to his family roots. However you want to look at it. The first time I saw this movie I was blown away by Liam Neeson's portrayal of Briar Gates, he brings his character to life as much as any actor as ever brought a character to life in any movie. Years later when I discovered that Liam was british my opinion of his acting abilities skyrocketed. My favorite quote in the movie was by Liam, "My name is Briar Gates and I want the man that kilt my brother." In print it doesn't sound like much but when he delivers it, this quote is truly amazing.<br /><br />
