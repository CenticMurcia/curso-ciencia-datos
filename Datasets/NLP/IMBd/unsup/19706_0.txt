I love movie's that include vintage war planes in the plot, and this is no exception- even though the ME-109 and Japanese Zero were substituted by a repainted P-51B and a T-6 Texan. But it was still a fun b movie ride. Directed by John Glen, best known for his work on the James Bond series, the story follows Chappy Sinclair (once again played by Louis Gossett, Jr.) who is now flying part time in an air show act, with him flying a P-38 Lightening. Joining him in the show are three washed up WWII vets: Palmer from Great Britain, piloting a Supermarine Spitfire (beautiful airplane); Leichman from Germany, piloting an Me-109 (the P-51B I mentioned earlier, but still magnificent looking none the less); and Hirokoshi, piloting the Zero. The action starts when a deceased friend's sister approaches Chappy for help in taking down a Nazi drug lord who is holding her Peruvian village hostage. With her and a street wise hustler by his side, Chappy and the vets out fit the planes with air to ground rockets and set out to prove that its about the man, not the machine. The action in this movie is awesome, considering the budget, and its a fun concept seeing these pilots coming together and putting past former differences past for one final battle. If you love antique fighters and aren't a nitpick, then this is the movie for you.
