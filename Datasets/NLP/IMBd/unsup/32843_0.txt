A well produced documentary, but if you don't share the political viewpoint of the filmmakers, you will end up frustrated. A very one sided perspective where everyone interviewed agrees that the this tragic situation is 100% the making of outside forces like the police, school system, prison system etc. Frustrating for me because I really would like to see conditions in gang infested communities improve but by the end of the movie the message is clear: gang members and the people in high crime communities are doing nothing wrong and should not change a single behavior. Therefore everyone should continue these self destructive behaviors and wait for the world around them to improve their communities. A well meaning but sad and tired viewpoint that has unfortunately contributed to this tragedy. Most gang members would leave this film feeling much better about themselves and the crimes they have committed! "No Excuses" President, Barack Obama
