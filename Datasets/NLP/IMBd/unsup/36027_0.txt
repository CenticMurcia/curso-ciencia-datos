When I was younger, I liked this show a lot. It was funny seeing Will Smith doing the dumbest things. And the other characters were just as good. I admit, Will Smith can act better than a lot of these rapper turned actors.<br /><br />Well, now that I'm older, I can see a lot of things that were not noticeable back then.<br /><br />First off, IMO, Will Smith acts a lot like Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence combined. There is no style, it's the same type of acting, the same "just because I'm black" jokes, and the same "I'm sooo good looking" crap. His jokes are all the same through out the show. I'm picking on the Will Smith character because he is the only one that makes the show dumb. But, I still watch it!!! As for the other characters, they really do a good job! It's just Will Smith, he gets annoying at times. But I'll give to him, he has become a good actor over the years.<br /><br />Well back to the show...<br /><br />It's witty, and quite fun to watch. But my only gripe is Will Smith and his old bag of tricks. He's still cool though.
