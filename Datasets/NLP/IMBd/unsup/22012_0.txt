What to say? I have no idea cause there are no words to describe how magnificent this movie is. You might say excellent or fantastic, but those words would not do it any justice. I mean the plot of the movie is full of surprises and the characters are so complex. I just love it!! I was so glad that I was able to get my tickets for it at the last minute due to my short term memory loss. LOL!! Even though we went to the Saturday viewing at the butt crack of dawn, but it was well worth it. All I have to say is that I hope it comes out to the big screens soon, so I can see it again and again and then eventually buy it on DVD. So I can watch it again and again and again. LOL!!!
