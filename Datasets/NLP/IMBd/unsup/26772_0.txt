"Big Night" is a claustrophobic character-driven ensemble flick about two Italian immigrant brothers (Tucci & Shalhoub) trying to succeed in the restaurant business. There's little story to be found in this lovely little tale about food, brotherly love, food, family, food, friends, food, success, food, Louie Prima, food, the nature of the universe, and, um, food. File this one under "G" for "Gem". (B+)
