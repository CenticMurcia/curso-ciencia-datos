After watching a successive trend of boring movies which promised to be wonderful comedies I did not have very high hopes from this one but it seems I was totally wrong for this movie as it does wonders with comedy, it really proves how a clean entertainer can be made and enjoyed without going through vulgar gestures and cheap jokes. This is an adaptation of the movie Rat Race in a very Indian way and really the comedy makes every moment of your time worthwhile. There is no proper story line, not a good music but all of it is irrelevant compared to the spellbinding comic performances delivered.Trust there wouldn't be a minute you would think about anything else than heaps of laughter you have poured. All the actors did their part extremely well, the dialog delivery was just perfect and without going into too much technical jargon, I would say I really loved watching it.
