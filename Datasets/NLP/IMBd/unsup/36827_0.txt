Is the movie in ENGLISH? I have seen a lot of Hindi films, and although I am not Indian, I found them easier to understand than this movie. The actors' accents are so horrendous that I couldn't understand 1 word in every 3. Also since it is supposed to be in `English', no subtitles were provided. I have traveled to India several times and never had a problem with their English accent. I find the accent quite sexy actually. But this movie, WOW.... couldn't they find people that actually could speak English?<br /><br />I find that even Hindi movies without subtitle are easier to understand, for a non Hindi speaker, than this movieÂ…<br /><br />1 word is enough to describe this movie: CONFUSED.<br /><br />The whole plot characters, story line, narrative arc goes nowhere.<br /><br />As evilmill said: ` I wasn't Confused until I actually saw this movie! '<br /><br />I enjoyed movies like American Desi and Leila. Those movies where about Americans finding back their Indian roots. This movie feels more like confused Indians trying hard to be American abd making a bad job out of it.<br /><br />Yet, there is a sort of off-beat quality to the movie. The confusion of their life appears on the screen and story. I think it was intentional that the movie plot went nowhere. The movie was built as a metaphor of their lives. <br /><br />The only way I can appreciate this movie, is as a non Indian movie, a non-desi movie. It is an art house, low budget, flick that portrays existentialist angst.
