I pray all the days for never have a night like the night of Paul (Griffin Dune).<br /><br />He meets a very sexy girl and she invite him to her home......well this is a good start .....but later he feels fear about the girl and her friend and he goes out. Wihtout any money the only thing that he want is to return to his home........in all the movie he have a problem: with another blond girl, with a bar tender, with some criminal, with the police and finally the loneliest woman in the night is the only one that help him to return home.<br /><br />This a very special film because is just great but is not very know and maybe the reason is some films like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and Raging bull.<br /><br />Yes, we can't say that after hours is the best of Scorsese because, well Scorsese has a lot of classics, but still After hours is a masterpiece, and a must see for all and not only for Scorsese's fans.<br /><br />Is a similar case to other of Marty's films: Casino, because Casino is a masterpiece but a lot of people think that is a copy of Goodfellas......is the same.<br /><br />More about the film: i love it because is a very unique story and because of the great cast.......Scorsese can't be better.<br /><br />In conclusion: After Hours can't be compared with the best films of Marty like Goodfellas or Taxi Driver but is a very original film and for me is a Masterpiece that maybe in some years latter this film has the attention that it deserves.
