So this has a minor claim to fame as ex-Sweathog Ron Palillo is in it, other than that it has Josie, who's pretty nice to look at but she's dead, so take that as you like. The plot? Well, some biker dudes go after the daughter of the owner of this "old west" Ghost Town, called Hellgate, and they accidentally kill her. This is in the 50's, allegedly, but it doesn't really look too authentic. Fast forward to the present, where some college students are getting together at a cabin in the woods to hang out, and all hell breaks loose when Josie falls in love with Matt (Palillo) when her REAL job is to lure folks into Hellgate so her dad can kill them. Hellgate is populated with zombies/ghosts/whatever, who the heck knows, they act like zombies but they also disappear like ghosts. Now Josie's dad, who has a nasty cheek scar from being bitten by a reanimated turtle brought to life by some crystal that shoots blue rays, has a large picture of Josie on the wall of his office that looks like some sexy 80's model picture, and when you see this keep in mind Josie has been dead since the 50's, ?? This whole film is one big confusing mess and if you manage to squirm through it (not with terror but with wanting it to be over) you'll see what I mean. I can't say I recommend this for any reason, because it's not even "so bad it's good", it's just bad. 3 out of 10.
