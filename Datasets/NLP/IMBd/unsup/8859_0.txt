I found the comment about the rank of Detective Chief Superintendent, not being introduced, until post World War 2, nit picking. It takes nothing away from the entertainment, to me. Do not people watch this kind of programme, just to be entertained? If one looks for them, one can find flaws in anything.<br /><br />Samantha, adds a welcome touch of mischievous humour. However her comment, about hoping for a German Invasion, just so she could get a cup of tea,was OTT. Something as traumatic as that should not have been so trivialised. The reality thankfully never happened. Another likable person, apart from Mr Foyle, was the Uniformed Superintendent.<br /><br />p.s. For your information. The Oxford English Dictionary, gives 'Trivialized.' as a correct spelling for this word.
