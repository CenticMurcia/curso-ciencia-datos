You would think the lead could do a better job of acting since he's just playing himself, for God's sake, and you would think a movie with this title would not put you to sleep. I rented this as a fairly liberal person and a fan of "Sex and the City," almost expecting to laugh at whatever society considers "excessive" sexuality. <br /><br />Caveh has an irritating voice on so many levels-that childish lisp, that flat delivery and the self-indulgence of the content itself. Am I supposed to share his offense that he inadvertently hired a porn star to play his ex-wife? What was he doing surfing those websites when he found out, anyway, who is he to judge? My reaction to Caveh was mostly disgust with his self-absorption, ranging to being absolutely CREEPED OUT when he groped receptionists' breasts at massage parlors. Just when I thought the "Eeewwww" factor couldn't get worse, I listened to him reminisce how much he enjoyed himself by groping and getting thrown out, how it was a big entertaining game for him. Also listening to him describe his rough-up a prostitute fantasies to a friend, who did not react with any normal response. Where does he find these people? <br /><br />This was the first time ever I felt like asking Blockbuster for my money back.
