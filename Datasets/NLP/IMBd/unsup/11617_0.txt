Hilarious odd-couple / road movie / cop movie / action comedy packaged together very well. Robert De Niro is Jack Walsh, an ousted former Chicago cop now working as a bounty hunter, who is determined to bring in bail-jumping accountant Jonathan Mardukas (Charles Grodin) who embezzled millions of dollars from nasty Mafioso Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina). Of course, it is not that easy, both the FBI and the Mob are on their trail - and the whole story snowballs into a sorry ordeal along the lines of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" as Walsh and Mardukas are forced to continuously change their mode of transportation.<br /><br />This was made back when producer / director Martin Brest made GOOD movies - not notorious box office duds like "Gigli". He only makes a movie once every couple of years so he shouldn't have disappointed everybody like that.<br /><br />Anyway, THIS movie, while rather lengthy, is upbeat, action-packed, and pretty funny, as the swaggering De Niro and the very dry Grodin display perfect odd-couple chemistry. Good supporting cast, too, and lively music score by Danny Elfman. This here is the kind of action comedy that is actually fun to watch, without getting lame or stupid or annoying.<br /><br />Followed by two made for television movies in which Jack Walsh was played by Christopher McDonald.<br /><br />"I tell you what, you don't co-operate, you're gonna be suffering from fist-o-phobia."<br /><br />9/10
