Anyone who thinks this is the best or even one of the best Bond films is in love with Roger Moore or didn't see the other 20 films. It may have been highly regarded when it came out, but compared to the others in the series it is quite weak. Michael Lonsdale had a lot of potential as Drax. Why does he have a English accent? He is German in the book! They could have at least got that right. I liked Jaws more as a murder machine in TSWLM. I do not like Bond in space at all. Lois Chiles is possibly the most boring Bond girl in the series, and such stiff acting! I put this one lower than the Man With The Golden Gun (Christopher Lee was ten times better as a villain than Lonsdale). In the bottom 5 in the series (not the worst mind you, that belongs to Die Another Day or A View To A Kill). This movie may have been quite good if they had stayed close to the book. I doubt Moore could have played Bond though if that happened.
