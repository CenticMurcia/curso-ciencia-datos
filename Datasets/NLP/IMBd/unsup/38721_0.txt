I saw it yesterday at a local movie theater. As a turk, I think it is a depiction of anti-americanism run amok in turkey. The main reason behind this attitude is the thought that if we don't stand in solidarity with our neighbor (Saddam's Iraq) we would be the next to be hit. In addition to this came the economical damage caused by 1991 gulf war and America's prospects of establishing a kurdish state in the oil rich areas of Iraq where also many turcomen are deported from their villages. These prospects are explained in detail in the movie.<br /><br />In reflecting the personalities of people from a different culture, this movie is very much like "midnight express". In midnight express each and every one of the turks in the movie was a sadistic villain. Likewise, Kurtlar Vadisi depicts all of the Americans as plain villains. Additionaly, the sight of American soldiers driving a Mercedes army truck from 60's is just hilarious. Also my personal belief is that the organ trading cannot be done officially, as is depicted in the movie. With Gary Busey and Billy Zane starring it is easy to see that it could only be a B-movie.<br /><br />I hate this movie as much as I hate midnight express because it does not serve a useful purpose except for making it harder for different cultures to know each other and get along.<br /><br />Some quotes from the movie: Doctor: You just can't treat those prisoners like that. They are people, not animals. Sam's assistant: I have more respect for animals than I have for those iraqis, sir.
