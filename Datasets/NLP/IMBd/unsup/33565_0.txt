With so many praising reviews, this must be fantastic movie. Right? Wrong. I have no clue why almost every reviewer rewards this movie with a 9/10 or 10/10. If this is one of the best movies you guys ever saw, then please go watch some real movies.<br /><br />I expect to actually laugh or at least have some smiles when watching a comedy. About 40 minutes into the movie I realized I hadn't even smiled once. Where are the jokes? I have a very broad taste in humor and like both sophisticated and lame jokes, but I had a really hard time trying to find any jokes in 'Where do we eat'. Of course, after those 40 minutes I couldn't stand it any longer and switched it off, so maybe the last 50 minutes really explode from all the fun.<br /><br />It didn't seem that the movie is really bad, it's just not funny. Pitch this as a family drama and it might be sort of acceptable. As a comedy, I can't rate it over 4/10.
