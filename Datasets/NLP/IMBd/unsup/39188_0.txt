As a bit of a Sci-Fi fan, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. How disappointed was I when I realised (15 minutes in) that this movie was more than a disaster movie, it in itself, was a DISASTER. With terrible dialogue and awful acting combined with a sever lack of drama, this movie is an embarrassment to the Sci-Fi movie industry. What baffles me is that these directors are given millions of dollars to produce a blockbuster and then they churn out rubbish like this! Do they not realise that there is no credible acting being carried out or that the screenplay is terrible? I wasted over 2 hours of my life last night watching this.... how many months of her acting career did Hilary Swank waste?
