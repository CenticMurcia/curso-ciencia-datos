I enjoyed Selling Queer. I was familiar with the director's previous work and wanted to check it out. I think that people who are have seen the film and think that it is haphazard are the same people who didn't understand Pulp Fiction when it came out. The segments do jump around in a non-linear way. I got the connections right off the bat with a feeling of being at the event in some what real time. I loved the segments behind the scenes at the carnival and I especially loved the lesbian wedding segment. I thought it captured real emotion on the part of the women and drove home the sense of how much they loved each other. I also enjoyed the brief history of circuit parties. This film is not for everyone! I saw the movie with two straight friends and they also enjoyed it leaving the screening saying, "I didn't know there was so much to gay community". I never really let them in to my life in that way and in turn they never realized that there was anything to these kind of happenings besides people holding hands and singing. The film will definitely play better to a straight audience or gays who aren't directly involved in "being gay" in the ways portrayed in the film.
