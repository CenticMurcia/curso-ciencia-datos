I've seen quite a few vampire films in my time, good and bad, but never as bad as this one!!! First things first: Blood Angels or Thralls was crap, but I've basically already pointed that out. The acting was overall okay, but what really sucked for me was the storyline, directing/editing and the ability to keep me entertained.<br /><br />This is the first Ron Oliver film I've seen, but he can't direct for s**t! The dodgy camera skills and editing techniques show no talent there. Lisa Morton and Brett Thompson have also given us a dodgy script with little interest and beyond stupid (I mean one of those "Thralls" had snake thingos come out of her boobs, now that's just plain dumb).<br /><br />Overall, Blood Angels or Thralls could be possibly one of the worst horror films I've seen so if you need a good laugh for the wrong reasons you've gone to the right place. If you want to save your money, choose another film!
