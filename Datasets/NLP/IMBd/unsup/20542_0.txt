I miss those days when quincy was shown at TV here in Norway. The show was just pure magic. On one side Quincy was the relenteless detective/coroner who gave everything on the job. On the other side he also liked to shoot the breeze, drink, chase woman and have fun. That's what it is all about. The 70's were a dream considering TV series. Just think about cannon, Kojak and Quincy. JUST GREAT. Quincy is "old school, funny and a delight to watch. The style of the 70's seems so much more relaxed and cool compared to that of today.Recommended for everybody that's tired of all the crap shown to day. The 70's rule and Quincy is number one!
