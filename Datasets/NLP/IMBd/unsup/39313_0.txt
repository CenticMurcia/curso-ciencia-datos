Perhaps, I shouldn't have waste my time watching this movie. I thought it would be funny based on the preview. When I went to watch this movie on Saturday, I did not find one scene funny at all. The only funny stuff in this movie was the bloopers. Overall, the movie just sucks! It wasn't that great as the first one. The first one was more funnier. The second one was good too, but this one was just not that great. It was okay and all but it just wasn't that funny. I personally think that I should have seen Borat instead of this movie. At least, I would have something to laugh about! I miss the 90s! They used to have such good movies that were much more funnier! If anyone want to see a good Christmas movie, I would recommend Home Alone 1,2, Miracle on 34th Street, and The Santa Clause 1,2.
