How a terrible, terrible movie like this is financed and distributed to video stores is beyond belief. The cover box in the store is completely misleading as you think you are getting a fair to good quality product but you soon realize that this film looks like a film school video with a budget of about 5 hundred dollars and filmed over a weekend - unbelievable. The only reason I sat through it was because some reviewers said it was so bad it was funny...It wasn't, it was painfully bad. Lame dialogue, direction, acting, story - you name it, it was bad, really bad!. I going to try and get my money back from the store that rented this garbage.
