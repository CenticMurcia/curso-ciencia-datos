Troll 2 offers everything one expects from a movie with its reputation: bad acting, bad dialogue, bad effects and best of all loads of entertainment. Thank you Claudio Fragasso.<br /><br />Also, I have read a number of reviews touting this movie as the "Holy Grail of Bad Films". While I can't disagree with that, I have to say as a lover of low-budget debacles, many of the greats don't get adequate exposure. In no particular order, I offer a few other treats to fans of this movie. 1) Eyes of the Werewolf 2) Demons at the Door, 3)Necrofiles(*Warning:adult content and very distasteful) and my personal favorite: 4) Ricky-Oh: Story of Ricky. Just giving a little something back to those who have given me so much.
