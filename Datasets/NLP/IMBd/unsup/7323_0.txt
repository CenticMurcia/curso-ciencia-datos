Having seen almost all of Kim Ki-Duk's movies, I will say that this one is easily among his weakest. What goes wrong then? I'll start with the good. The old man's acting is pretty fine-- the girl's acting is a bit more capricious, but usually not annoyingly so. The cinematography is passable, but nothing fancy. The part where the old man plays his bow/ violin on the roof of the boat, however, belongs in a tourism video promoting the wonders of South-Korea, not a Kim Ki-Duk film. The music is cheesy. It's never a good decision to have an actor play a rugged instrument on screen and simultaneously play polished, incredibly melodramatic music on the sound track.<br /><br />With the technicalities out of the way, let's focus on the story. As far as Kim Ki-Duk goes, the main idea could've been workable. Now it just takes some elements from 'The Isle,' adds some painfully obvious and overdone symbolism plus some magical realism at the end that makes me think that Kim Ki-Duk is having a laugh at my expense. The bow as a symbol of love-- acceptable, sure. It shoots arrows, too = love hurts. It can be used to play the most touching music = love is beautiful. You can use it to predict future events = love is mysterious?? Not to mention, the thing with the rooster and the hen. The type of symbolism the film contains I might expect from a romantic novelist, not a renowned director. The ending is a story in itself, but I honestly felt embarrassed for Kim Ki-Duk while I watched it. Should it have ended with the old man diving in the sea, I would've probably viewed the film in a much more positive light.<br /><br />Sure there are some classic Kim Ki-Duk moments like the scene with the old man and the rope and even the wedding, but overall this is very sub-par. It's still probably worth watching-- one reason being: to see what kind of sap a talented artist is able to produce apparently without flinching an eye.
