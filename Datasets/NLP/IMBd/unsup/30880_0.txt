What is the main reason to see a film with Jenny Agutter in it? That Agutter's in it. What's the best thing about that film? That Agutter's in it. And this one also has Carol Lynley and Anne Lockhart in it (though practically as extras). How many ghost stories make sense? ZERO. Others review this flick as if a parapsychologist COULD make sense but that is impossible. The two male leads did a fine job with their OF COURSE stupid characters but I will admit that Kevin McCarthy sure was wasted. SPOILER ALERT: If you're wishing to point out dopey things about the film (though of course EVERYTHING is stupid), the ghostly decomposed body of the murder victim couldn't have decomposed, as it was sealed in concrete. Why didn't you others point THAT out? THAT was the main error in this flick. If other people's problem with this film is that it doesn't scare you, I've NEVER been scared by ANY movie so I cannot relate to that factor in reviewing.
