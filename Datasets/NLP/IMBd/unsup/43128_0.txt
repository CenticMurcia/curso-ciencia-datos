OK so since they had a really old joke about Pauline Hanson in the movie i guess i can just use that famous old pauline line... PLEASE EXPLAIN i so did not get what the point of this movie was. i mean, there's a guy who gets his penis chopped off by a mincing machine and i'm like OK, is this a porno? then some tacked on story about some professor with a grudge against the pie shop owner, and i'm like, is this meant to be some statement about small town revelry. then there's all this nonsense crap about 20-somethings being promiscuous and i'm like, is this a story about youths out of control. Then IMDb says its meant to be a comedy. where were the jokes? where were the larger then life characters? where was the point?
