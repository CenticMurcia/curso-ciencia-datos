Well well, people warned me not to watch this one. But I had to. I had seen the trailer on youtube and thought, worth watching. But I can tell you that, if you watch the trailer then you have seen the whole movie. Again made as a reaction on Sleepaway Camp and other female flicks and even made at the end of the slasher era it is clear why that scene crashed into oblivion. Nothing really happens, except for the fact that the killer survives almost everything, falling from a window, being hit on the head,...must be an ode to Halloween, but there it worked, here it doesn't. The killings aren't gory at all let's even say, they aren't bloody at all. It's obvious that it was a low budget horror. Look at the girls, not attractive at all. The clothes are worse and the hairstyle is worser. Okay, what makes a slasher is in it, some nudity and first person shots but still it is missing suspense. It could have been much better if the red stuff was flowing. All I can say is that it is indeed a massacre!
