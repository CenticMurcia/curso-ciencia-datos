Recap: The brothers Bloom, Stephen and Bloom, are master con-men. Since childhood they have conned people out of their money by taking them on some mysterious adventure. Now, Bloom wants out, but agrees to do a last con. A rich but seemingly bored heiress is their target, and the theft of mysterious book in Prague their tale. But Bloom grows attached to their mark, Penelope, and the feelings seem mutual. Suddenly truth and tale mix and everyone has problems to tell what is true or not.<br /><br />Comments: A really nice movie with a little odd twist. In these con artist movies the audience is usually in on the con, and the suspense is usually on some weak link in the plan that must come through. But in the Brothers Bloom it is a little bit different, and refreshing. Because one of the con men themselves, Bloom, is not sure of what is real or what is fake, we can't get any more clues either. We, just as Bloom, must put the pieces together for ourselves. Quite a intriguing concept.<br /><br />It is well acted. There are four lead characters, apart from Stephen and Bloom also Bang Bang, a Japanese explosive experts that help them and Penelope, their mark. And what's nice is that all character has much more than one level to them. They hide something, or don't tell all at least, and the actors and actresses show this perfectly. Especially Penelope (Rachel Weisz) manage to radiate innocence and at the same time be surprisingly adept to the brothers criminal ways. There seem to be so much more to tell about her, I wouldn't actually mind a sequel that used her a little more.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody have some nice report between them. A tongue in cheek way about them about how to proceed best with the con. But also Rinko Kikuchi acts very well as the explosive expert that seem to have taken a vow of silence (except while singing karaoke of course). Kikuchi bears watching in the future as she has shown to be a great talent already (i.e. Babel). I hope she finds her way into more movies that is accessible in the west.<br /><br />The Brothers Bloom is a good piece of craftsmanship in the con genre. Fans of the genre is almost certain to enjoy it. I wonder what writer/director Rian Johnson will be up to next. I hope he put something together soon, as he seem to have nice ideas and capable to realize them well.<br /><br />7/10
