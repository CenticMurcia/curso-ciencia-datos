All you need to do is listen to the dreadful theme song at the end of the movie to realize what a complete, moronic, hack job this movie was. Free isn't enough. Someone pay me for the time this movie consumed!!<br /><br />Cartoonish military stereotypes vs. Cartoonish small town stereotypes. Poor Brian Keith seemed to really want to do something with his role, but with this script that was just about impossible. I will give him an A for his effort, though wasted it was.
