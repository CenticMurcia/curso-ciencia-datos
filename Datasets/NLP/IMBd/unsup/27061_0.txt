Everywhere I seen a review of this movie it was always the same, this is bad. So I was ready to view it, only one problem, not available over here but fortunately a good friend offered me a full uncut version. Only 1 minute into the movie I already knew something was terrible wrong. The first girl murdered was dressed sexy. Not that I have a problem with that but mostly that attracts more then the gore. Anyway, the good part of the movie is indeed the gore. It's not all in front of the camera but they really show the result. It's gory but easy to take. But there is of course the movie itself. The acting of some is really bad. For example the interrogation is a big laugh, she never impresses me as a copper. And the killer is a cheap version of Leatherface, his clothes, mask and hair is a copy! Furtheron they also listened what they did with Evil Dead and Nightmare on Elm Street, I mean the children singing chants. Some scene's are too long, could have edited it better. And some scene's had nothing to do with the movie, for example when one of the guys goes home with his girlfriend her sister opens the door, what we have next is nice to see but has nothing to do with the script, and a lot of girls show their body, clothed, in an explicit way. I told before, I have no problem with that if that doesn't let you forget the storyline. I gave it a 3 just for the gore, could have been much better...
