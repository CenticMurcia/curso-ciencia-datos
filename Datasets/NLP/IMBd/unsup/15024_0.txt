Well, what can I say - when the cable channel program guide classifies this as a "Substandard slasher film" then you KNOW there must be something wrong...<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD!!!!! The film imitates (a nice way of saying "RIPS-OFF") a couple of other slasher films, like Jamie Lee Curtis' "Prom Night", where the slasher is mentally deranged and taking revenge for crimes committed against someone special in his/her life by fellow classmates. In this case, the classmates are high school students who accidentally burned down a house of the slasher's foster parents (I think - it's hard to follow)with a wayward roman candle. So, when the slasher disposes of one of the victims - a roman candle is left next to them.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie tries real hard to drag red herrings across the trail at various places. For example, the wife of the county sheriff is over-sexed and under-appreciated, and so she gets out of her bed in the middle of the night and drives 10 - 15 miles to do it with one of these kids. The sheriff may of noticed - or he may of not - all we see is him fumbling around the suddenly vacated bed. The problem is there is so little back fill of story, that its hard to figure out what the heck is going on, or who would have motive to kill anyone.<br /><br />Instead, much time is wasted on useless story elements. For example, the kids are on a camping trip, and they unpack their SUV in a five minute sequence where the motion is sped up - think something along the lines of a Benny Hill chase scene. Then, we are treated to another five minutes of kids playing in a lake, who don't seem to miss one of their own who was murdered in the middle of the previous night.<br /><br />The gore is not really gore, with low budget movie blood being used. Some of the murders seem improbable - like one where two kids are shot through the neck with the same arrow, when they were both facing the slasher? Overall, don't expect much of this film. It's a confusing muddle of elements, too bad to be entertaining in the least bit (some films are so bad they're actually enjoyable to watch, like a Mystery Science Fiction Theater 3000 film). It apparently got an R-rating, although I suspect it's more due to the kids using the F-word every 30 seconds than gore or nudity. If you're bored, and this happens to be on - well, its better than nothing, but barely.
