This is meant to be a thriller, but the audience laughed in way too many places at the ridiculousness of the situation.. If you like seeing a naked Sigrid or Peter O'Brien 6 pack this is the movie for you.<br /><br />It almost got to the point of saying "Watch out -He's behind you!" And why oh why didn't they use the line "Oh my god - I've killed Kenny!"
