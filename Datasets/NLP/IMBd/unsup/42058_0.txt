A terrible attempt to cash in on the success of A Man for All Seasons, this is a very overlong and boring film. Richard Burton, always a wooden film actor, overacts like never before as Henry VIII. His horrid, raspy chain smoker's voice is all wrong for the part - cigarettes didn't even exist in the 16th century. Burton is also too old for the part, he was only 43 during filming but looks more like 50. I wasn't surprised he was amazed to receive yet another undeserved Oscar nomination for this garbage, not only is the film so terribly acted by its elderly cast but there is nothing good about Burton's awful performance at all. Unsurprisingly, the film was an enormous flop on release. Forget about watching this crap, stick with A man for All Seasons instead starring Paul Scofield, an actor who (unlike Burton) actually had talent and could act.<br /><br />0/10.
