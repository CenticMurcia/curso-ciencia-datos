A simplistic, yet highly entertaining comedy starring Richard Pryor. Arlo pear (Pryor) seems to have literally EVERYTHING go wrong for him; from his house move, to a new job, to his daughter wanting to marry a sleaze bag! The dog wants to give up and bury itself, and as for the fixtures and fittings in the new house: "Are they staying there or are you taking those with you?". And "After 15 years I gave him the wrong finger!" Doesn't make any sense yet? Good. Track down a copy on ebay, amazon, or any good retailer and watch it. It's a shame Warner Bros won't release it on DVD though, as like many other Pryor classics (see Stir Crazy, Brewsters millions, and See no evil, hear no evil) this is fantastic. This film isn't meant to win any Oscars nor be critically acclaimed. It's mean to be watched and enjoyed by all. It achieves exactly what it set out to do.
