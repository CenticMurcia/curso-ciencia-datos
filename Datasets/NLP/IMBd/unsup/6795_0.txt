Attention: Chuck Norris is at it with his really, really unspectacular fighting moves and horrible acting. Are you looking for excitement, stay clear. In fact, this movie had potential. It's set in Hong Kong, and that's often a plus when it comes to fighting movies. Hong Kong is also mentioned by Norris as "The Place" in this movie. The great locations help a bit, but since Chuck Norris isn't' exactly "The Action Star", then this is definitely not "The Movie" (ha-ha). To be more specific, I guess people already know that the plot alone can't save a movie like this. It's the action scenes that make the difference or not. And as mentioned, Norris fails on every level in this movie when it comes to that. He's better suited to army/machine-gun movies (like "Delta Force") than karate-flicks like this one.
