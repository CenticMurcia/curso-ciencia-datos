This movie is one of the most powerful and moving films I have ever seen. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone, but especially families. It has a message about a young man who has to find out there is more to life then money, that being apart of a family who loves you is the most important thing in life. Finding the ultimate gift is like finding your place in the world, what are you here for? What is your purpose? There is an incredible amount of value in this message and it is something people of all ages can learn from. The acting of Abigail Breslin is yet again incredible, I think even better then Little Miss Sunshine, she completely steals the show. Brian Dennehy is very funny, and James Garner is wonderful as well. This movie has all the aspects of a great film; sure it's no Godfather, but its still and incredible flick. In my showing of the film people where laughing and crying the whole way through, Highly recommended.
