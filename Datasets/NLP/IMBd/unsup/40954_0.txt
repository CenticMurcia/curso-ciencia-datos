This movie is total fiction! The big problem is that it has been researched and shown that there were no plane phones on UA 93. Upon research, it has also been shown that it was virtually impossible to use cell phones in 2001 at that height & speed.<br /><br />Also, no plane parts were found at the supposed impact point. There were parts found up to eight miles away from the impact point. This would mean that UA 93 either exploded in air by a bomb or was shoot down by a fighter jet.<br /><br />Finally, there were no passengers with Arab names on the flight manifest for UA 93.<br /><br />Wake up and do some research (911blogger.com)-- we won't be fooled again.
