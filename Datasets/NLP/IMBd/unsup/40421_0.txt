Nothing special at all and was just an unclever movie. There were no good quotes except the 'live love' phrase but other than that nada. The only redeeming values of this movie was seeing a somewhat familiar cast and the music was exceptional. It was an interesting twist on the old Shakespeare poem but I still think it could have been A LOT better! There was a little bit too much on the topic of homosexuality that seemed unrelated to the story and I had no idea why they threw that in there (and no I'm not homophobic at all, I just thought they could've left that out as it was pointless). There were a handful of good looking girls throughout the duration and they were definitely nice to look at. It was an alright movie, just don't get your hopes up.<br /><br />Final Round:<br /><br />Movies : This would've never made it to theaters!<br /><br />DVD Purchase : No way in hell.<br /><br />Rental: Sure, why not?!
