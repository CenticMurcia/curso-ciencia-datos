I think this movie was one of the best romance movies I have ever seen!!! to me, this was way better than Titanic,etc. I think this movie would even be better if it had a sequel to it. Like it starting off showing them in the war and what they experience. Then they should show them coming home and what happens with Hop and his girlfriend, like if they get married or not. I love this movie, Sean Penn and Nicholas Cage were awesome in this movie, you couldn't have asked for 2 better actors. Also, if there's not a novel already published, I think they should have one. I think one of the very low points of this movie was that it had so much cursing, it could have made a good family movie if it didn't have that in it. Also the nudity was just not necessary. Basically that movie was totally ruined because of those two things.
