I am just now viewing a very old and incredible bad copy of Gunbus, that I found yesterday... The story is actually amazingly interesting, with many great scenes and the other reviewers are often totally wrong! Okay, this film is clearly inspired by "Indiana Jones" with the same comedy spirit that made "Kellys Heroes" so great... Plus a few hilarious exaggerations of the technology, even if they are mush more realistic than the silly (but funny) machines in "Wild Wild West" The story begin in the wild west, were the the friend (our heroes) are dynamite crazy bank robbers, that finally get caught and are sent to the first world war front, as alternative to a very long time in jail...<br /><br />There must they party (when they see two lovely ladies) of course and get into a bet with two English flyer's, that they naturally can fly an airplane... They try anyhow and crash land a bit later, at a rather extreme "flying circus" just as some of them actually were at the time, with flyer's who lived passed their expected time and definitely are ready to die for the glory...<br /><br />Before they landed, did the spot a HUGE air ship in a cloud and that valuable information, plus the fact that they happen to shoot down a very impressive Gotha Bomber (forgot that part) just before they saw the girls...<br /><br />Yes, almost everyone seem to act rather lousy, but that may be deliberate, just to make the story even more funny and then are many flying scenes rather sketchy, like a comic strip, but may be deliberate! Then have me many incredible air stunts, which partly should be for real and the hunt on the HUGE air ship... So this film is more than charming, if you like crazy adventure films and don't mind that they play strange and many air scenes look rather peculiar! I will give it 8 of 10 because it's a very nice in it's class... And I grade it also as really worth viewing 2 or 3 times in 10 years and a good buy, if it's hopefully get on DVD and you like this type of hilarious adventure films...
