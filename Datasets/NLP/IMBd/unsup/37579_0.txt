"Campus Man" isn't quite sure what kind of a movie it wants to be. It appears to be a comedy at first glance but that is rather deceiving. In fact, it would've played a lot better if it had been more serious in tone. The "funny" parts are typical 80's cheesiness and aren't very witty. The plot involves an Arizona State University student who owes $10,000 in tuition and has 30 days to come up with it. He decides to produce a male athlete calendar in order to try and make enough money to pay his tuition and hopefully have some left over. Of course, things don't go exactly as planned and trouble ensues. Uneasy mix of comedy with some serious issues makes "Campus Man" an uneven disappointment. A harmless time filler, however, if you can catch it on TV. 3/10
