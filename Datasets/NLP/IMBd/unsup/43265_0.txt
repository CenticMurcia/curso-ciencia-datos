Once again we have to deal with Mr. Grubin's use of mundane metaphors. How many times do we need to see the sun, moon, or a galloping horse? Show some faces for cryin' out loud. Obviously Mr Grubin had to fill up his 6 hour doc with idle images because he couldn't use stock film footage they way used on his other docs. Too bad. The documentary could have been a good one. It is Mr. Grubin's worst film so far. One note of interest, Tom Haneke's editing for the first couple of hours was superb!
