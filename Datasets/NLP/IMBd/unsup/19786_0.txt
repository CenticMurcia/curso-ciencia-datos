Preposterous terror movie based on a Bran Stoker (Dracula) short story. A demon tries to conquer the world through a good boy but a "Rambo" priest and a sheriff gets in his way. Incredibly dull and silly, even the violence here is just nonsense and the devil, played by Jackson, sometimes resembles old Gene (Kiss) Simmons or Bozo, The Clown. Escape from this one. I give this a 2(two).
