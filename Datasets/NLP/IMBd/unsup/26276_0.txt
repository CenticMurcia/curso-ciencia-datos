I liked this film, and I think other user comments are unduly harsh.<br /><br />The script is more innovative than most crime thrillers. The script design -- of having interlocking baby monitors in next-door apartments -- and working that into the danger of the young children, is unique.<br /><br />The acting is very good. True, the last five minutes are Hollywood Stale, and some of the things in the plot are unbelievable, but the film holds my interest.<br /><br />
