Multiple Maniacs is excellent. Better than excellent. This is my favorite Waters film. It is funny, yet serious. A few lines give you a chuckle, like "And then she inserted her rosary into one of my most private places." This movie, unlike other Waters movies, moves into the well-crafted characters' personal lives. My first Waters movie was Pink Flamingos, which I adore. But Multiple Maniacs ties Pink Flamingos in every way. If you like Waters, or if you don't, buy Multiple Maniacs. This is one of the strangest movies (other than Pink Flamingos) that I have seen. Divine is fabulous in this movie. She is excellent. This movie is scary, bizarre, and somewhat sacreligious. So, if you're not of the faint at heart, weak stomached, or religious freaked, at least rent Multiple Maniacs.
