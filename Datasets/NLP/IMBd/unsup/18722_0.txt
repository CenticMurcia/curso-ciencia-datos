This film was not the best movie ever made, but as far as the Conan clones that came out in other countries this one was certainly not the worst of that bunch. It tries to do some different things for a movie of its types while doing some of the things these types of movies are known for mainly the giant puppet monsters and the completely off the wall scenes like hang gliding with a flying dinosaur. What is a super cool caveman who questions who he is supposed to do? The movie goes by quick, I am guessing they knew it was not an award winning masterpiece or anything so keep it short and simple and throw in a really strange yet catchy theme song to really get the audience going. Or to make them more confused as you find out the strange truth behind Yor the hunter from the future, something tells me he is related to the Robot Ghost of Christmas Past From The Future of Aqua Teen Hungar force fame. Still, you have some interesting things to see here, there is action and you get to watch as they just launch a super powered jet as an explosion occurs cuing yet another round of that strange song that is most highly energetic. No, it is no masterpiece (let's face it Reb Brown is the star of this one), but it is bad enough to be rather entertaining in its own strange little way.
