This new interpretation just does not flow as well as the original. If you have never seen the original, then you may just become confused as to what this movie is all about. I highly recommend that you see the original and get the DVD if you can. The DVD is not great quality and the pictures are blurred and have lots of shadows, but it is a great story. The original scared a lot of people, this new version will only confuse them.<br /><br />I sure wish that they had followed the original story line more closely.<br /><br />
