Let's review the original 70's movie (since i haven't read the book, which i'm gonna read after this): An infectious but nouvelle agent menacing mankind, a special team with the ultimate technology gathered to solve the problem, the US government eager to finish it the fast (and not always)the smart way. All with the methodic and reasoned approach that a group of scientist will do in the real life. The team of scientist with absolutely nothing in common except for their knowledge, and the boring-not ''pretty people'' looks of all of them (the female character looks like my oldest aunt). That and a believable story behind it...............<br /><br />All it's gone in the miniseries.......A few points on the plus side: beautiful scenery, the laboratory amazing and realistic, the same for the computer graphics, viral-bacterial culture devices and the electron microscope.<br /><br />But the story has so many loose ends :the wife and son of the lead scientist has absolutely no purpose at all, not even to influence the actions of Ben's Bratt character; no clear progression around all the Andromeda discoveries; the continuous mutations of the agent ''explaining'' everything (with no sense at all); and the environmental message some screenwriter (a drunken one i'm sure) put with forceps into the story.<br /><br />And: 'la creme de la creme': a wormhole!!!!!!!!!!!! and a coded information from the future (insert here dramatic music).<br /><br />It's amazing for me to see how a number of good pictures, series, miniseries are continuously destroyed year after year during the past decade. This one is another example of the trend.<br /><br />Do yourself a huge favor: if you are capable of being entertained by the Sci-fi genre, only watch the original movie, and you will be safe..........until Hollywood looks up again in the movie database.
