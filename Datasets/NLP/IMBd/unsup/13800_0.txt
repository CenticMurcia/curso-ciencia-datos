I found this at my lending library. I've always wanted to see it being a fan of the three leading actresses and the songs from the play.<br /><br />While Elizabeth Taylor really tries with her role she doesn't quite get there and any scenes with Diana Rigg she may as well not try because Rigg steals the entire show as the strong willed Charlotte.<br /><br />Lesley Anne Down is a good choice and while she was dubbed she still gives it her all. Her rendition of Everyday A Little Death with Rigg is superb and i rewind that scene many times.<br /><br />The male cast members are pathetic and you can tell they are from the stage because they act dreadfully.<br /><br />See this if you are a fan of the actresses, especially Diana Rigg. Pity it flopped this could of really done something for her film career!
