Its about time for a Marvel movie to be great. Blade was good but X-Men is a great film. It hits all the right notes and doesn't descend into camp and self parody. Hugh Jackman is amazing as Wolverine, I didn't for an instant doubt him as Logan. His scenes with Rogue (Anna Pacquin, also excellent) were believable and often touching. Although the rest of the cast didn't have much to do I have high hopes for the inevitable sequel.<br /><br />The whole cast does an excellent job (even if they don't have as much to do) but Jackman, Pacquin and Ian McLennen bring real heart to what is simply one of the best superhero films ever made. Its really hard to contain myself when I'm talking to friends who haven't seen it yet who ask me how it was. I can't wait to see it again.
