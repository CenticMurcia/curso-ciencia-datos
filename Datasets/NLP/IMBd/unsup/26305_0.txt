Airwolf is quite simply the greatest television series/movie ever made. I have over 20 episodes of Airwolf and I still can't get enough of it...<br /><br />Airwolf is piloted by String-Fellow Hawke, an elite combat pilot, who would only return the awesome machine if the top-secret F.I.R.M can find his brother (MIA). Airwolf is full of incredible air-fights and has a good plot to go with it. But the amazing chopper is not the only factor that gave Airwolf it's popular title. String-Fellow Hawke is a lonely man who lives in a cabin, 40 miles from the nearest village. Along with his slick flying, he pilots Airwolf skillfully, taking out the opposition with nothing but class. Airwolf is portrayed as realistically as possible making the series a one-and-only, using advanced radar, weapon systems, and stealth capabililites along with superb footage with Airwolf flying below radar scan a few feet of the ground.<br /><br />An irreplacable television series.
