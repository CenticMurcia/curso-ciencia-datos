When Paris born and raised Bruce meets Rome born and raised Matteo, sparks fly but both are convinced that they are straight. Will they won't they?<br /><br />Matteo seems to love flirting with those "Jared Leto" eyes and loves to fall asleep in Bruce's bed. But, is he flirting because he wants something to happen? Or is he just torturing Bruce? Enjoying twisting the knife as it were?<br /><br />The film is emminantly watchable even if the attitudes seem a bit dated. It reminded me a lot of the scenes of unrequited longing in "The Fourth Man" but without the masterful use of suspense.
