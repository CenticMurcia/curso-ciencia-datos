Liza Minnelli has it in her genes from her beloved mother, Judy Garland, and Vincente Minnelli. Although she states that her sister Lorna Luft is the singer in the family, LIza is the entertainer of our generation. She can sing, dance, act, and do it all. Thirty years later, her career is revived after another divorce and health problems. Liza may never be as fit as she was when she performed on stage in a live production in 1972. Liza has always been an incredible performer. I love her in Cabaret and I refuse to see any production of the musical because I can't imagine anybody but Liza as Sally Bowles, the sad Berlin singer who craves the love of a good man and the love of her own father in the film. This stage version is like an extended performance of her from the film, Cabaret. Unlike the film, this show is not as dark and lonely. Liza worked hard for six weeks before this production. IT's a once in a lifetime event and I wasn't even born yet. I first bought her Liza with a Z CD to listen in the car. You can't imagine not singing along with her as well. Now I look forward to seeing her dance, sing, and entertain us in the DVD. Believe me, nobody today can touch Liza as a performer.
