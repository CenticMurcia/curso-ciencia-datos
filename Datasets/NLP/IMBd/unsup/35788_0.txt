Did I see the same movie as the positive reviewers, below?<br /><br />I didn't know a Dracula film could be this boring. I needed 10 cups of coffee just to stay awake for 90 minutes. This film makes Abel Ferrara's THE ADDICTION (1995) look like unmitigated horror classic, and that's not saying much since I almost slept through that one, too.<br /><br />I can put up with a b/w film for 1994, but watching this with the pixelvision camera parts is enough to make one go blind. There's also a lot of philosophical, boring talk about the meaning of life, but do I really give a sh#t?<br /><br />It meanders on and on and on...<br /><br />2 out of 10
