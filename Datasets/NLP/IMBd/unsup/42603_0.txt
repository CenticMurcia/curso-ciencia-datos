Following the musical triumph of "The Lion King," and the sheer magnificance of "The Prince of Egypt," there should have been a lot of enthusiasm about their creative meld - "The Road to El Dorado."<br /><br />	But the genius of Elton John, Tim Rice and Hans Zimmer (all who won Oscars for original music in "The Lion King"); and Dreamworks' animation division (who received critical acclaim for "The Prince of Egypt") don't bring enough to "The Road to El Dorado" to make it a movie worth watching.<br /><br />	"The Road to El Dorado" follows the story of two Spanish con artists who hitch a ride across the Atlantic and stumble upon a native civilization that mistakes them for gods.<br /><br />	It's tough to handle that everyone in this movie speaks English, although for practical purposes it's probably more handy than having small children try to read subtitles. But the movie still takes Euro-centricism to a disturbing level. For heaven's sake, the tribe actually calls its city "El Dorado."<br /><br />	That's not the half of it, though. The two Spanish protagonists are white enough to be from Norway (although the other, evil Spaniards are dark-skinned). They are voiced by Kevin Kline (who's from Missouri) and Kenneth Branagh (who's from Northern Ireland). Members of the tribe - the movie never says exactly who they are or where they're from - are generally slow-witted, with the exception of a manipulative thief (voiced by Rosie Perez) and an evil priest (voiced by NArmand Assante).<br /><br />	That's not to say the movie is racist; in fact the movie is for the most part kind-hearted. But the movie is highly insensitive about race, and promotes an awful lot of stereotypes to children at an impressionable age.<br /><br />	However, there are plenty of other reasons young children should be discouraged from seeing this movie. There are disturbingly explicit sexual scenes, and a lot of adult humor, such as Kline's character yelling "holy ship" during the voyage across the ocean.<br /><br />	Children's movies seems to often struggle with this point - a movie aimed at children still needs to appeal to the adults who are taking those children to see it. Advertisers are quick to point out whenever a critic says "fun for all ages" about any film.<br /><br />	"The Road to El Dorado" seems to overdo its attempt to involve adults in the movie by sacrificing its innocence. It's not simply a matter of grown-up themes like "The Lion King" tackled with a character's death. On the contrary, "The Road to El Dorado" only uses adult themes of the most immature nature.<br /><br />	Add to all of these problems a weak soundtrack - weak as far as animated musicals go. John's songs are actually OK, although the movie probably would have benefited had he not provided nearly all of the song's vocals in the movie itself.<br /><br />	At every level of execution, something went wrong with this movie. Instead of being a promising children's movie, it turned out to be a highly flawed movie inappropriate for younger viewers.
