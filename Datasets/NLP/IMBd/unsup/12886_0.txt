Just saw this for the first time (thank you Sky Arts!) I have always loved Gilbert and Sullivan so decided to tape it. I'm so glad I did! It was amazing! I've never seen any of the cast before so wasn't sure what to expect but they were all so good. Especially the purple-panted Pirate King, Jon English. His facial expressions had me in stitches and his energy!! I also loved the Police Sergeant, that man is made of rubber - is there anything he can't do!? They all looked as though they were having a great time hamming it up wonderfully! As someone said previously, if you're feeling down, watch it, I guarantee you won't be for long!
