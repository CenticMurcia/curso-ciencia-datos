The She-Creature is a thing from the ocean that looks like an angry lobster. It comes ashore, invisible, then materializes and kills some people. It then returns to the sea. Why? I don't know. Then there's Dr. Carlo Rambaldi, a hypnotist and overall oily guy, who threatens Brack, from This Island Earth, and hypnotizes a beautiful young woman. Brack shows no emotions and does his best to feign interest. Rambaldi makes predictions, has some people killed, and moves into a house that has delightfuly Swedish caretakers. In the end, the lobster kills Rambaldi, the police shoot the monster, and Brack and the beautiful young woman presumably go on to live a rich and full life together. Very dull movie that will put you to sleep faster than Nyquil.
