It has been one whole year since the capers in Home Alone! And America's favorite family is back again! It's next Christmas and the family is going on yet another McCallister clan vacation. This time it's to Florida! Christmas in Florida, well, according to Kevin,<br /><br />"There's no Christmas trees in Florida. How can you have Christmas without a Christmas tree?" Good point. Kind of like you can't have Easter without an Easter egg, or Halloween without a pumpkin. Anyway,<br /><br />[THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT THAT SHOULDN'T STOP YOU FROM READING ON!]<br /><br /> When Kevin goes to get his tie from the bathroom, Uncle Frank was in there taking a shower, who warned Kevin that if he saw Frank naked, Kevin would grow up never feeling like a real man. But he does anyway, and tape records Frank's singing, but soon Frank discovers and Kevin runs. At the school, there was a pagent going on. There was a problem<br /><br />though: Buzz stood behind Kevin and was holding a candle. He held two of them up to Kevin's ears, making him look ridiculous. Kevin found out and knocked Buzz down, causing a chain reaction that caused everything to fall. The family forced Buzz and Kevin to apologize. Buzz faked it but when Kevin explained, they didn't buy it. Once again, another tizzy with his family. Next morning, they rush to the airport, Kevin with them this time! But at the airport, Kevin is sidetracked and<br /><br />follows a man in the same coat his father wore! So while the<br /><br />McCallisters boarded the plane to Florida, Kevin boarded the plane to New York!! So knowing his family was a thousand miles away, Kevin lived it up in the city. He bought fireworks, he rode in taxis, he even went to the top of the World Trade Center (Which sadly no longer exists). What Kevin didn't know was that his old "friends" Harry and Marv broke out of jail and are in New York! They need money to leave the country! Kevin checks into the Plaza Hotel, where the sinister<br /><br />consierge, Tim Curry, was watching his every move. His hotel room is fabulous and he loses his shorts in the pool! He even orders a mountain of room service and watches "Angels With Even Filthier Souls", the sequel to the classic! So the next day while Kevin was enjoying a limo ride across town, Tim Curry discovers that the credit card Kevin used to check in was stolen. Kevin arrives at Duncan's Toy Chest. A huge toy store filled with everything! Including Harry and Marv who are hiding in playhouses. Kevin is generous and gives some money to charity, so Mr. Duncan let's him have some turtle doves from a mini tree. You keep one and give the other one to a special person, and as long as each of them has their turtle doves, they'll be friends forever.<br /><br />Outside, Kevin reads a map while Harry and Marv depart from the store. Bad timing. They meet up with Kevin, and still having some left over bruises from last time, want to carve him into little pieces. Kevin<br /><br />runs, and cleverly gives them the slip, curtosey of a pearl necklace. But now the Plaza hotel staff is after him, but he outsmarts them with "Angels With Even Filthier Souls". Kevin escapes but runs into Harry and Marv. He escapes into Central Park! He stays there all night and runs into all the weirdos, so he finds shelter and runs into the Pigeon Woman! Kevin's terrified but soon discovers a friendly woman underneath her tattered coat and pigeons. They have a talk at a concert hall. She teaches him that a<br /><br />good deed erases a bad deed, so Kevin thinks about what he can do that's a good deed. He remembers that Harry and Marv plan to rob<br /><br />Duncan's Toy Chest, but the money the store makes is going to the<br /><br />children's hospital! Well that's going too far. Kevin rushes to his Uncle Rob's renovated townhouse and transforms it into the ultimate bobby trap haven! It includes all the trimmings: holes in the floor, monster sap slippery ladders and floor, tool chests falling downstairs, ropes dunked in kerosene for obvious reasons, and more! Kevin get's the crooks to chase him there. Then, he hurls bricks at them, all of which hitting Marv. So when trying to enter through the front, Marv has a run-in with a staple gun. When he finally does get inside, he falls all the way down to the basement. Harry has tools topple onto him, his head catches fire, Marv has a shelf fall on him, a bag of plaster cover him to look like a snowman, and they both get mashed by a tool chest falling down stairs. They soon climb down the kerosene soaked rope after Kevin and find out why it was dunked in kerosene. As the rope is lit on fire, the bandits fall and get paint thinner splashed on them. Kevin knows he's winning and feels great but doesn't watch where he's going! He slips and falls right into the clutches of Harry and Marv. They drag him into the park where Harry attempts to shoot him, but are attacked by a bucket of bird seed and dozens of hungry pigeons, curtosey of the Pigeon Lady. The police soon arrive and take Harry and Marv to jail once and for all. And, at the big tree in Rockefellar Center, Kevin and his mom meet up. The family was staying in a Plaza hotel suite! Yes, apparently the Plaza has started a new custom: 'If We Lose Your Kid, Your Luxury Suite is On Us!' And what a deal that is! The family get's a truck load of presents from none other than Santa Claus himself, Mr. Duncan. Kevin gives the Pigeon Lady a turtle dove so they'll always be friends. And once again, all is happy and merry! Very! Until Kevin's room service bill is brought to Peter (Dad)'s attention. He yells, "Kevin! You spent $967.00 on room service?!!" Then Kevin runs off. A brilliant film! Really lives up to the first one!! Great music, great messages, Good!!! It's followed by Home Alone 3, naturally, but it doesn't star anyone from the first two. It's similar to the horror series Halloween. Halloween III was an original story having nothing to do with I and II. I'll tell you about Home Alone 3 next time. For now, gotta go. Merry Christmas everybody!! --------
