Being a fan of the games WCIII and WCIV, I couldn't wait to see this film version. I had since Freddie Prinze Jr try to act before, and wouldn't exactly call myself a big fan of his, so I was slightly weary as to whether or not this film would be any good.<br /><br />The plot isn't all that original, and the script doesn't break any new grounds either. But I've given this film 10/10 because it is so damn entertaining. The action scenes are cool, the special effects are brilliant, and the characters are worth watching. Prinze Jr is excellent as the young Blair, Matthew Lillard is, as always, scene-stealing as Maniac, and the rest of the support cast are equally impressive. Also, listen out for Mark Hamill, who does the voice of Merlin, Blair's ships computer.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the game, you'll probably love this as much as me. Anyone else will like this film if they don't mind watching quality entertainment rather than some three hour epic. Top class entertainment.
