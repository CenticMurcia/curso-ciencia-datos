A group of 20-somethings have regular Role Playing Game gatherings at their former high school teacher's house. John, the geekiest of them all, gets picked-on by some of the other "gamers." He kills himself and the others find themselves being stalked by a knight on horseback. Yeah. This movie is quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I've always thought obsessive "gamers" (I cringe at that word!) were somewhat off, but this movie just makes them look incredibly stupid when playing their RPG. I can usually find some redeeming value in any movie, no matter how bad, but that is not the case with "Knight Chills." My Rating: 0/10.
