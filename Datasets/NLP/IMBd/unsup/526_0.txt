The nice thing is, that if you bought this because of all the hype about the underage Kiera Knightly flashing, you won't be disappointed and you see a decent movie as well. Thora Birch, sporting a spotty British accent, plays the only survivor of a group of students who hide out on the school holiday by going into a bunker. The Rashomon type plot is a little too simple, we know that the other three are dead and we also know that when four people go somewhere enclosed and one comes out alive, that they had something to do with it. The script never gives us anything else and trying to convince us that nobody even suspects Thora's Liz is unwise. The fractured way that the story unfolds isn't satisfying either since we only have two versions and the second is the one that we know to be true. The saving grace is the cast. Thora, Kiera, and Desmond Harrington are three good young actors and they make these vain characters watchable. Also, even though the script is week, the direction is good. It's one of those jumpy quick cut movies that fits the supposed state of mind that the main character is in as she tries to find the truth. It's an interesting movie with a strong cast that could have used a re-write to flesh out the story.
