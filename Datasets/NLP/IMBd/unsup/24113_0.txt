Blake Edwards, the man who was certainly the most visually inventive and provocative comedic filmmaker of his time, naturally has a hard time being understood by the historically myopic. This film is no exception, and it's too bad: it's rather tender and vibrant in its humor, colorful and gracefully paced in its framing and editing. However, today is the age of team MTV and nudgenudgewinkwink teencomedies, and woe to Blake. Too bad - the anger that folks seem to hold for directors as they work into their later years is rather frightening and rabid, it seems to me. This film is fresh, funny, and, actually, rather youthful. I, for one, am quite glad that Blake made it. Thanks to all of you.
