I was so excited to see a show that encompasses the genre I love so well , and it got better each week. Then I found out that is was actually a series that had ended in the UK in 2004. So I guess they will s how the remainder of it this year some time, and alas another good show will bite the dust for me. Why can they not keep fantasy/horror going is beyond me. I've lost so many shows in 2006: Blade, the series, Invasion,Surface, and Threshold. Yet we have Law & Order on 3 channels 24/7. I can't wait to see Michael Fassbender in "300" when it comes out. The girl who played Cassie was very good also. I've seen a few other shows I like on the BBC channel as well , one about ghost hunters (a man & a women). So I guess people who like Sci-Fi or whatever you want to call this are in the minority as usual.
