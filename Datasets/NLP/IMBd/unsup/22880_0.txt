I saw this movie as a young child and I cried, but I love that movie. That movie had such an impact on me. I think it did on everyone who watched it. I had no idea that little Carrie Ingalls played Jill in that movie. Although I don't think that I have seen this movie since 1973. I have looked at the library and the video stores. I just cannot seem to find it anywhere. I would love to see it again. Maybe someone can help me find it. Please let me know. I would appreciate all the information that anyone has. Any ideas I welcome them. I can be emailed with the info. Any idea where I can find it? I have looked for that and Go Ask Alice. Please email DAWNDDMACK@AOL.COM
