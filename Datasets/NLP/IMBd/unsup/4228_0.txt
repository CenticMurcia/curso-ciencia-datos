OK back in 90whatever in the UK,the episodes of different series were not shown a year apart in order to catch up with the years and also since I didn't have a TV for most of 94/95 I ended up seeing episodes either on video or in whatever order they were on TV,so I saw them in totally the wrong order and never knew which ones were series 1,2,3 or 4 until 10 years later when I found an episode guide online. I say that because the order in which people see episodes generally determines how good,scary,dark and maybe life-changing each one was.Also because all those episodes were filmed around Vancouver in the same forests,fields,villages etc they looked so alike visually that it might as well all have been one continuous series to me. So different fans have their different favourite episodes for whatever reason.This is one of mine. Its the only one that ever scared me during and especially after,for...OK weeks.The eye effects have been used in things since but at the time they did freak me out.The child abuse stuff is damaging.The satanic ritual stuff,even though its been the reason it seems that oh so Christian Americans like to believe that true evil in their country exists for the last few centuries and is thus THE stereotypical scapegoat,and even though it's as unbelievable as any other religion,well it is scary anyway.After all it's TV so a level of disbelief must be maintained.I think a major reason it scared me was the concepts,if they were true just feel more fear inducing than an individual who kills with electricity (DPO) or inbreds(Home) or any of the many reincarnation ones. The only problem I have with it is that it has Bulldog from Fraiser in as an evil,scary non-Christian type and I just kept seeing Bulldog and his gong and sports crap...But thats just having to deal with people from other roles being someone else so it shouldn't really detract from believing in a programme..except it did which is why I give it 9/10 instead of full marks,which is what it should get from someone who doesn't know who Bulldog is/was.
