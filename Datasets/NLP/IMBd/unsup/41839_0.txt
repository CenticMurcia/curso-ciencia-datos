Horrible writing, incompetent camera-work, terrible acting, non existent direction. But it's got full frontal male nudity, so what does anything else matter, right? When is gay themed cinema going to be held to the same standards of mainstream film? Why is everything else left to trickle down the drain as long as we have cute boys running around naked and stereotypes abounding by the dozens. This one had everything but a drag queen, and my guess is it was left on the cutting room floor, where the whole rest of this dreck should have gone. And the audience ate it up. Sometimes, I think we get what we deserve.<br /><br />Memo to the lazy DP- try switching lenses every once in a while. Half the movie looked like it was shot with a surveillance-cam.
