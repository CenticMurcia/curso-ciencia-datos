I agree that this movie is fantastic. For 2 reasons in particular... 1.My brother suffers from Schizophrenia and some of the scenes really rang true for me. 2. I grew up on the Sunshine Coast and competed against Jennifer Copping in several festivals, etc (of course, she always beat me ;)!!) and she has always been extremely talented. I was thrilled to see her shine as Kate. She drew me in to her character's dilemma so well that I felt her turmoil. I can't wait to see her in Slither! I believe it won't be long before the rest of the world recognizes her talent! GOOD ON YOU, JENNIFER!! <br /><br />(the Middleton family!!)
