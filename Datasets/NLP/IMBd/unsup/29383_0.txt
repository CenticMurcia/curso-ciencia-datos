One of the greatest soundtracks of all time linked to one of the lamest movies of all time.<br /><br />The entire premise of the movie is a bodyguard, played by Kevin Costner, out to protect a rock singer, played by Whitney Houston, and the 2 fall in love. But outside of that, there is no story. No plot. Nothing to make it watchable.<br /><br />However, its soundtrack is still one of the best soundtracks to date. Especially with one of the best love songs of all time, "I will always love you." In fact without the soundtrack, the movie would have died on its first weekend. The song is the whole premise of the movie "The Bodyguard," while the movie itself is 2 hours of aimless garbage.<br /><br />Without the soundtrack, the Bodyguard is at best zero out of ten. But even with the soundtrack, it still rounds out to a disappointing 2 out of 10.
