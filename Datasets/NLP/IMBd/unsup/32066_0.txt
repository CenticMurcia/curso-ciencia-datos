Mainly it is just that, you may guess it. Sunset Boulevard is a movie about movies; one of the first called FILM ever made by Hollywood - because it's a state of art, a piece in art form... an authentic gem.<br /><br />It's hard to find a film like this one-- it's even impossible. Never saw a movie which depicted film making so perfectly. The shadows of scriptwriting, the dark side of fame, the evil portrayal of such magnificent lives... this is one of the best movies of all time. The best film noir ever done, no doubt about it (can't be compared to other ones because of its subject, of course!) and one of the best ever made in the Golden Age. A film capable of surpassing another mine favorites - like Casablanca or Rear Window.<br /><br />Everything falls perfect into this film. Everything but the reception - of course the Academy wouldn't accept a film that depicted themselves. But then again, classics only get that designation when further times arrive. Like important people -- "Funny, how gentle people get with you once you're dead.", his words.<br /><br />The nominations, the Oscars won. This could have been the film to win all the Oscars - almost all of them. Brilliant art direction - amazing collection of props - good music score, screen writing whose dialogs possess a very realistic feel, top-notch performances by all actors (mainly the duo plus the supporters; I was very surprised by Nancy Olson), cinematography and editing which catch that noir feel and a director (who I wish to know better!) of modern camera angles, brilliant moves and captivating images. All in one, I still don't know how the movie hasn't got the most important of all, the Oscar for Best Picture. Yes, was it the blacklist? Was it the depicted reality? <br /><br />We'll never know. We dream of Sunset Boulevard. We die in Sunset Boulevard. The valley of dreams. The peak of ambitions.<br /><br />Ah, Hollywood! Once I dream of thou!
