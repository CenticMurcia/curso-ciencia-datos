Rated R for Violence and Language Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18A(Should be 14A)<br /><br />I saw Juice a couple of months ago.I would say I am a fan of films about South Central LA.Menace II Society is one of my favorite films of all time.I saw Juice expecting to see a movie like this.This is not like Boyz In The Hood or Menace II Society which are "growing up in the hood" films.Juice is actually a fairly entertaining thriller with good performances.Tupac is one of the few rappers who can actually act! His acting in this film is excellent.Omar Epps and the rest of the cast are fairly good as well.The film is about four friends named Q,Bishop,Raheem and Steel who skip school one day, they find out afterwords that one of their peers was shot and killed while he tried to rob a store.After hearing about this, Bishop(Tupac) wants to do something crazy.So the four friends go and rob a store but Bishop ends up killing the owner.They then run into an alley where Tupac then kills Raheem.He threatens to kill Steel and Q if they tell anyone.The film then goes on with Q and Steel trying to hide from Bishop who is losing his mind and kills some more people, then frames Q for it.Q must prove his innocence and confront Bishop.Juice is a pretty good thriller with good performances and a good early 90's rap soundtrack.
