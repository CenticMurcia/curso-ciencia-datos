My previous review of this film was somewhat biased towards other Horror/Comedy hybrid films like Shaun Of The Dead & Slither.<br /><br />However, after watching Black Sheep again, I feel a re-write was necessary.<br /><br />I don't rate this film any higher than i previously did, but did find a few scenes enjoyable and might i add; funny.<br /><br />I know that the purpose of these films is to have bad acting, bad special effects; but films like Slither had excellent acting with a cast of characters that looked like they wanted to be in the film, putting as much effort in as was possible.<br /><br />As said previously, the effects were pretty decent for a low budget flick, but i simply cannot forgive a bad script and bad acting; even if the genre allows it. Other films can do it right, why couldn't this one? Watch it if you must, but watch Slither afterwards to see how the genre should be directed.
