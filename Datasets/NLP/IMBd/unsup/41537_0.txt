Because you sure chewed up pretty much all of it.<br /><br />I love Al Pacino. He is one of my favorite actors ever and I love it when he goes completely over the top like in Heat: "Cause she's got A GREAT ASS! AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY UP IT!!!" But there's a point where that stops being great and becomes just a crazy man yelling his lines. Overwrought doesn't begin to describe the acting in this severely overrated film. I understand that Frank Serpico probably had a very intense life but did he really scream 24 hours a day? If that's the case, no wonder nobody liked him. <br /><br />Sidney Lumet was a great director and Al Pacino is a fantastic actor. If you want to see a great example of Lumet and Pacino working together at the top of their game, rent Dog Day Afternoon and skip this. Your ears will thank me for it.
