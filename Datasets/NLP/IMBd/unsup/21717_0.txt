I really liked this one since there was an all star cast. I loved how there were different legends told from all over Turtle Island. Most of the stories took place in the Plains however the one from the West Coast as well as the one Haudenasaunee story were real cool! Of course, I love Native women and the ones in this one were sexy! Kimberly Guererro is hot as well as Alex Rice. Those were just 2 examples of the gorgeous women.<br /><br />But I'm surprised that this was only a made-for-TV film and not one to go into the mainstream theatres. Were they worried that it wouldn't make it well enough on the big screen or something? Regardless of how much it would make in the box office, I think it should have gone there anyway! It's stupid just to worry about how much money something is going to make without at least giving it a chance first.<br /><br />But... ANYWAYS... excellent one nonetheless. That's why I gave it a perfect 10.
