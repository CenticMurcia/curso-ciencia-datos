TRIVIA: Three of the main players -- the male co-lead (Dick Purcell), the Admiral (Guy Usher) and the Mad Doctor (Henry Victor) all died within four years of making this 1941 mystery-comedy-voodoo film.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, 65 years after it was made, and considering the social and political atmosphere of that day, it's hard to fault the writers or director for what was considered standard fare back then. The movie was assuredly cheaply made and was only held up by the comedy relief of Mantan Moreland. The treatment of servants and the demeaning stereotypes portrayed here chill us today, but were common and expected in an era where segregation was a way of life, people could actually smoke in hospital rooms, when drunkards were usually funny (especially when driving) and when seat belts were unheard of. We have indeed come a long way. ~~
