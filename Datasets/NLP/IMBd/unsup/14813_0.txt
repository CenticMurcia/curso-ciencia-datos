As a thriller, this movie must be one of the most "laid-back" kind of psychological 'who-done- it' criminal survey of the human potential for understanding and/or entropy of the freckled- mind ... Both main actors are just "plainly" superb and truth-worthy... Isabele Care is so natural and Poolvoorde so much "evil"...without "pathos"...The general feel or attitude rendition by the actors is just right to the point, with a naive witness and an faulted main character, whom reveals witness' ambivalent attitude and feelings toward the same perceived sick or morally tainted "main" character"...All subtle and slightly perceived, apparently superficiality felt by main "witness" character... Just incredibly well understood and acted by both main characters !
