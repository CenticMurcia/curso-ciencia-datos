I truly enjoy the better "teen sex comedies" and I guess I have seen over 30 films in this funny category, but this crap includes tons of annoying fillers - meaning pointless "jokes" and lousy filmed views... So it's not even good as a crazy tourist or event video, even if it may show how stupid boys may act when they are drunk... As the long belly diving scene... There are also a babe with big breast in an almost see through t-shirt at 07:38 for 3 seconds, plus another babe with huge nipples at 25:03 for 5 seconds (!) and that was all real candy in the whole movie... Except a wet t-skirt competition, with girls that danced and jumped around with some bare breast, but in a very silly and NOT sexy way... And the amazingly stupid side plot, was actually much worse... Finally was it also a strange "romance" that is hard to call romantic or funny, but at least didn't fail completely! <br /><br />It is almost impossible to compare this insult, with the best "teen sex comedies" that I seen, as Hot Moves and Private Resort - that both is 1000 times more sexy and really funny, over and over again... Even the hilarious college comedy Up The Creek (1984)is totally outstanding and dramatically more sexy, without even having that ambition!!<br /><br />Yes, this film was mostly annoying for 90% of the time and never funny, which is rather vital for a comedy... So I would definitely give this film a negative grade, if it was possible.<br /><br />I can even give this film to anyone I know, because that would be a serious insult and not a nice present... And to sell it would be fraud! And this was my try to write a totally fair review, but it's hard to review puke.
