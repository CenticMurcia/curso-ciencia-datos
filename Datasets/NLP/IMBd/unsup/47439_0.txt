During the Christmas holidays, a homeless dude returns pages of a lost thesis to a Harvard student in exchange for food and housing. <br /><br />I never believed for a second that this shallow college boy would care a cockroach's butt for this pathetic derelict, but 'Harvard' gets what he deserves when the stinky bum assaults him with a lead pipe, throws part of the kid's thesis into a furnace, helps himself to other people's closets for clothes, puts his dirty socks in the oven, disrupts a class in session, murders another student's pet, and asks to be driven across the state-line to visit his son who wants nothing to do with him, causing the student to miss the deadline for turning in his thesis.<br /><br />I'm supposed to feel 'sorry' for this scumbag? I was hoping he'd get hit by a train. No such luck, but at least he dies in the end. He dozes off and quietly passes (awww... *sniffle*... pffft!) while the four Harvard roommates sit around wiping away their tears because they don't have anything better to do. I would have sneaked into the bum's room while he was asleep, opened his bottle of liquor, poured the alcohol all over him, and set him on fire.<br /><br />OK, I grajudated... gimmee my digree!
