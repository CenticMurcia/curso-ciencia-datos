Tom is lying around on the porch at the Dude Ranch when he uncovers Jerry under a flowerpot. While Jerry races away, Tom lassos him, the rope even going around the corner of the building! Suddenly, a station wagon roars up and out comes a beautiful cowgirl, er catgirl.....whatever....Tom is smitten, big-time!<br /><br />Tom runs back in the house and gets his best cowboy duds on and starts strutting in front of the girl, trying to impress her. He pulls out his tobacco and papers, has Jerry lick the paper, pulls out his gun and shoots it to light the cigarette. He then blows a smoke ring that says, "Howdy." Wow, is this dude s-m-o-o-t-h!! Tom then serenades her (with the cows singing the chorus!). Man, he's pouring it on. Jerry, however, is ready to puke watching this spectacle. He decides to put an end to it....and how! Poor Tom takes a beating, especially from an irate steer.<br /><br />All in all, there are numerous laugh-out-loud scenes in this animated short - really good stuff. Great music, too, with amusing lyrics in some of the songs.
