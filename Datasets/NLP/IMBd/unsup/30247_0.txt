A beautifully acted and produced film about Women's sufferage during the Woodrow Wilson presidency. A great history lesson to all who would take the right to vote for granted.<br /><br />The period was wonderfully portrayed and the cast was excellent. The only flaw I found in the production was the overexuberance of the "sound mixer" regarding the music volume levels during much of the dialogue.<br /><br />
