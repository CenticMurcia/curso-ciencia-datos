Well, I have myself to blame. I should have read about the movie and should NOT have rented it. But I did. :-(<br /><br />I like Steven Seagal. He is usually in entertaining movies with very good fight scenes. Be advised ! This is no ordinary Seagal movie. The little fighting he does is in the end of the movie and it is so bad that you wonder if he has gained so much weight that he can't move anymore.<br /><br />Well. What more can you say: This is a REALLY bad movie. The copy I rented had DTS sound. For what ? So that the explosions can sound good ? The other parts of the movie has really bad sound.<br /><br />SPOILERS: And the clock. What about it ? Was it some kind of trigger or what ? Not to mention the car that explodes without the ground even turning black. And ... ... Well actually there were so many bad things in this movie I could go on and on and on ...
