I am a huge fan of James Glickenhaus, and when I saw this film for sale I snagged it, and let me tell you, from the cover it looked like a second rate tele movie, but it is stylish and intelligent. Scott Glenn is superb, as is the director's son. This film is scary and chilling, and I think it has more class than most famous ritual killing films. Brilliant, Glickenhaus you should keep making films!
