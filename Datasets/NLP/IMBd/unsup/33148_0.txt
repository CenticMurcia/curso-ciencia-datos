Watching this movie was a little black mistake. Starring Brittany Murphy and... well... that's really all I need to say, isn't it? The movie is bogged down by beginning-screenwriter-style exposition at the start, all of which screamed, "Sorry that I couldn't actually find a real movie to fill up this space, but this stuff is really funny and you can relate to it, right?" Now the opening sequence is supposed to make you like and care for Brittany Murphy's character. In fact, if that fails, the rest of the movie is bound to fail.<br /><br />It failed.<br /><br />I just didn't care about her and her pathetic little life. Party Girl did a much better job of pulling the whole "existential" story-trapped-in-a-woman's-empty-life and even Legally Blonde did a far better of job of using the love hook to help a character examine herself and how she values herself. But the ending and the changes as they occur in the film are all pretty contrived. Furthermore the direction messed up some of the alleged jokes in the film, accidentally giving away the unfunny punchlines before the jokes were thrown.<br /><br />Good job guys. In the end (and the beginning and the middle) the movie falls flat on its face, like Ms. Murphy's antics. I should've bailed on this one when I had the chance. 3/10.
