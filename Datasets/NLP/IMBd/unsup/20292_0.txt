Not their greatest film, but not bad at all. I prefer this one to At the Circus or Room Service. Some would object to the obvious ethnic humour, but in all it's quite silly and mild. Margaret Dumont proves she still has it, Groucho is sharp, Chico's shooting keys and Harpo is, well, Harpo. If you have more than a passing interest in the Marxes, give this one a shot. Best Line: Groucho, "This dress is actually red, but technicolour is sooooo expensive."
