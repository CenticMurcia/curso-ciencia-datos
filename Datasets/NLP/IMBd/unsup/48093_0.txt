I guess I can't describe it in a better or shorter clearer way: Boring and Stupid. Acting? what acting? why are all the actors laughing while Reading their lines??? they just never stopped laughing or smiling even when it was the most "dramatic" moment! The "plot" was one of the most predictable plots in the history of TV. and not only is Sam a total $lut, but ugly as hell too!! what happened to that "actress"?? I remember she was hot in American Pie. here she is so damn ugly!!!! puffy face full of bags, or whatever these are. and the happy ending?? no one to tell the poor viewers that these 2 are doomed??? very soon he will wonder why he took her back (because she was hot in American Pie?? or because he used to drool over her topless pics when he was younger, on the internet??) He will soon start wondering if she ever slept with that Luke, but hiding it from him. He will soon start seeing how shallow and self centered she is. and he will hate how everyone just knows him as the husband who married the woman who kissed the other guy. (is there anyone who didn't know about her thing with Luke??) then he will start seeing other girls attractive and charming (and caring)! then he will start flirting, and maybe kissing them, making Sam taste her own poison. then will she accept his apology? or act like an ugly B!tch and go out again and kiss or flirt with the first sleazy a$$hole she meets??? so.. the actors can't act. the plot is so weak and predictable. you hate the Bride for being s|utty and selfish. the Groom for being an idiot. the 3rd person for being an arrogant dumb a$$hole.<br /><br />sorry for all the swearing. but this "film" suxxxx. Big time.
