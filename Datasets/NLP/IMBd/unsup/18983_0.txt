Anthropophagous 2000 (1999) is your typical Andreas Schnaas gore movie, in this one he pays homage to the classic video nasty from 1980 (Anthropophagous the beast), and makes it even more fun and A lot more gory in the process!! :o) If you don't know the story, well it's simple, it's about this cannibalistic loner who preys on a group of young people who come investigating in his area, one by one he kills off the group in a manner of revolting ways........ some of the gore is cheap looking but some is a lot more realistic, just some of the examples of the gore are: axe in the face, guts being pulled out of peoples throats, baby being pulled out of a pregnant woman's stomach, and then chewing on the baby's head, gruesome stuff!!! All in all this movie is well worth checking out, especially if your fan of GORE, i really enjoyed it, it's not Schnaas best movie tho which is Violent Sh*t 3: Infantry of Doom.
