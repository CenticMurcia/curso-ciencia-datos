I'm 55, and have seen countless movies in my day, from silents to computerized re-makes of classics. I won't repeat all the wonderful things said about this movie by others, but only endorse their views and feelings: The filming, the setting, the story, the casting, the music....combined they add up to make this movie stand out a bit above all others. I saw "Lonely Hunter" when it came out, and perhaps 2 or 3 times since then, and it has certainly stood the test of time. I don't see how you could find a more moving, sensitive, and thought-provoking production. Only recently have I read the book, and, despite one viewer's comments, believe the film to be a wonderfully compact and visual interpretation of same; a joy to behold, and one that has positively influenced my life in many ways. Would just like to add that the latest movie to have such an effect on me, although not necessarily for the positive(!), has been "American Beauty". "The Heart" surely rates a 10/10!
