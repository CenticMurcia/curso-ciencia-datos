I just watched The Hills Have Eyes2 1985 and the soundtrack sounds like Friday the 13!Someone tell me if they think so too.I was just sitting around and thought I'd watch part 2 of this little miniseries and I'm a big trivia buff.I told my husband and son this should be good like the first one right?Wrong think again.This was so corny and i kept getting the feeling the music in it sounded so familiar that i gave some thought to it.i don't wanna give any major parts away but like save your time effort and money because it is definitely not worth it.I love most 80's movies and music mainly because I was a teenager to all that corny,quircky but amazing stuff. This movie went way too far beyond that I can tell ya Oh well live and learn i guess.
