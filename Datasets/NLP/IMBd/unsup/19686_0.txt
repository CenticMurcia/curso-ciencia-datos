This is the quintessential example of a bad book being turned into an excellent film. The novel was an international best seller which "ripped the lid off" a small town. The movie explored the psychology of the characters and featured some superb acting as well as a musical score that ranks with the very best. Franz Waxman flavored the music with a touch of Aaron Copland and came up with a real winner. Photography was stunning, and the movie makes great use of wide screen.
