This movie is very hard to rate. Is it a plain, old bad movie or is it a good bad movie? I've decided it's just a plain, old bad movie. Yet whenever I stumbled upon this movie (usually on Lifetime) I get drawn in. Think train wreck and you understand what I mean. Regardless of Christina's "allegations" this movie certainly bends and twists facts and sometimes even creates brand new characters who never existed to help fill in the blanks. The E! True Hollywood Story would be more factual than this, so this movie falls into the realm of sheer fantasy. Faye Dunaway. What can be said? She needs to be done away with. The rest of the cast, especially young and old Christina were played by two very bad actresses who must have been striving to be nominated for the Academy Award with the amount of gusto they put into their portrayals of "She who must not be named." I give this movie one weak handed bitch slap out of five.
