a good film with good acting performances, i would say it takes an open mind to really see this film for what it is because what seems ridiculous really has a meaning behind it. one is that you'll notice the TV in his house flickers when his mind is not straight, and an obvious one is that the fish are his subconscious.I also think that the film is supposed to show how people crippled by there niceness and quietness stay at the bottom of the ladder in a corporate business and the people with legs to step on others, reach the top, and don't have to care about the lower people. this is also seen by the cars going fast, i think this shows that he is being left behind going slower then everyone else because he has no charismatic qualities. i found the ending predictable and half way through i was hoping it didn't end the way i knew it was going to, and at that i thought it ended too quickly and left too much still open for thinking. The anagram of Coleman to Maconel was a good touch though. I would recommend this film to people willing to think a little about the film.
