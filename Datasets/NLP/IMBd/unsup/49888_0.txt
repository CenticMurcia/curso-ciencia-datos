I had high hopes for this because: 1) It was called LEGION OF THE DEAD and had box art of some ancient Egyptian tomb king and a whole army of undead troopers.<br /><br />2) It had Bruce Boxleitner in.<br /><br />3) Putting together 1 + 2, and armed with the knowledge that Boxleitner plays the sheriff, it implies some sort of gigantic apocalyptic battle with hordes of mummies will occur, sort of like the battles in Lord of the Rings or even Army of Darkness.<br /><br />Now without giving any spoiler information away: The actual plot of the movie is nothing like the assumptions you are lead to be believe from facts 1 and 2 above and the film was therefore a severe disappointment for me. Had they re-named it, it might have been less of a let down.<br /><br />However, the acting IS poor, the plot is VERY dubious (in terms of the genre; I know mummies walking around is inherently dubious, but there are ways of doing it right and this film doesn't due to inconsistencies). That being said the comedic gore and the amount of breasts are about right.
