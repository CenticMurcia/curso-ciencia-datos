We can expect more IMDb user coverage on LAST DAYS OF PLANET EARTH, and tons more that fall into the "schlock" category. And for a good reason! This one is about as bad as, say PLAN 9, and may just be the worst science fiction production imported from Japan. Why science fiction? Is it because Earth is under peril from natural and man-made disasters that is described in the prophecies of Nostradamus? This is a classic example of a plot used heavily in these movies, minus the seer's words. In fact, you can always expect ANYTHING to happen, making EVERYTHING go wrong in the plot without a trace. It all ends up as an in-depth documentary that focuses on the stages of mankind's existence in the final days, spoken by an overpaid voice actor who needs his lips glued with Mucilage. Read the Weekly World News and you'll soon find out that feeding on fear is such a silly idea after all. Anybody else want to comment?
