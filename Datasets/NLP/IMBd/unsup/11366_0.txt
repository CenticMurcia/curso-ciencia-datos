I was asked to watch this, and just for kicks I watched it. I originally was not expecting much from this movie, but I really got a lot more than I originally had planned for. Johnny Yune is honestly one of the most underrated comedians I have ever seen. Most people may not find it funny, but his style of humor is very funny in this one. Something about the way his character says stuff, just makes for huge laughs. There is no reason to take this movie seriously, because it is just a straight up comedy with a very action parody style plot. Basically seeing this made me want to see a lot more from Johnny Yune, but this was honestly his biggest break in films. So at least give it a try for several cheap laughs. The laughs may be somewhat immature to laugh at, but they are consistent and truthfully very funny.<br /><br />10/10
