this has to be the worst remake ever. It's not only Robin Williams, he's just bad as usual. They just changed the most powerful scene from the 1975 original by Frank Beyer.<br /><br />SPOILER ahead When Lina discovers that Jakob has no radio at all, she prolongs his lie, so that he can still believe in it too. In this disgraceful remake, she goes to him and dances with him. They just don't get the message of the book by Jurek Becker.<br /><br />I can't understand this. So leave this one alone and watch "Jakob der LÃ¼gner", by the way the only movie from the former GDR ever to be nominated for an Oscar as best foreign language film.
