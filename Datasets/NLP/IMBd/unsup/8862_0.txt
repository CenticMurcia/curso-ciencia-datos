Foyle's War has a good and quite believable wartime atmosphere, largely due to the good sets and costumes. The stories are also often good. There are some quite glaring problems, though. One is the anachronistic speech, for which the revered Michael Kitchen is often to blame. He tends towards the dreaded (and very modern) "uptalk" which turns normal statements into seeming questions, as in, "My name's Foyle? I'm a policeman?" His extremely mannered performance is a bit of a trial overall, in my opinion. He manages to make underacting into a kind of overacting.<br /><br />Some of the phraseology is too modern, too. For example, British people did not talk about the 'train station' until very recent times. It was just called the station, or, in full, the railway station.<br /><br />Foyle's two sidekicks are better than him. In particular, Honeysuckle Weeks excellently picks up on Deborah Kerr's role as Colonel Blimp's driver Johnny (in the famous 1943 film). She seems exactly in period and lifts the series.
