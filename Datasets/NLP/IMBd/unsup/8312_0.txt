By nature, I am lured into the crap of "STARZ ONLY HERE," their B-Flix of the holy hellish. You know, just bad horror flix. This one however, exceeded my expectations by a margain. I actually thought I'd guess what the ended would come out to and yet, I was wrong, mostly. Maybe I'm not the smartest of movie-geeks, but "the man" will often pull the wool over my face and present me with a climax I did not anticipate. Seth Green is the best and most believable character in this movie (though I can't deny Colms as he is a legend among films of this genre). The gore is adequate but mostly lacking in realism. The blood is bad in chemistry. The story isn't bad. Actually it's kind of good, but the production quality isn't what it could be, and so I'm a snob I guess. I gave it a 7, so I think it's worth watching just because I didn't guess the end...but I'm no genius, just a girl that loves blood and guts. And boobs...there were not enough boobs. Though there were some. Crazy girls don't count though, right? Don't pay 3.99 for this, but watch it if it's free...rock on!
