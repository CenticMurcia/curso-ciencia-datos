This one has gotta be one of my favourite films, apparently this documentary started out as a film about bob Marley's funeral then ended up being something else. Has a very spiritual feel about the whole thing, contains interviews with local inhabitants of the Look Behind area in JA, all of which are reggae lovers, gives there views on RastafarI and Bob Marley, then goes onto feature mutabaruka with plenty of interviews, also gregory Isaacs at his African Museum record label, he also gives a great performance and u can see just how he gets the name "The Cool Ruler", then onto a performance by Louie Lepke singing a song he wrote about bob marleys death. Also shows footage from bobs funeral and the gives a good idea of just how big an event this was showing the mass crowds that turned up that day. A Must for any reggae lover. An Excellent film.........
