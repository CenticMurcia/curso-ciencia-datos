I didn't know quite what to expect from this film. I didn't expect light and fluffy, but this movie, which documents the life of one weird nymphette, was less enjoyable than I could have imagined. Ms. Chong (not her real name) had a very decent middle class upbringing. The question I asked myself was why she turned out the way she did, but we have a person with absolutely no self-esteem, who appears to be totally strung-out on whatever, and who claims to be doing 251 guys in ten hours in the name of liberation. Something she's proud of. Yeah, sure. I thought I'd at least like her in the end. I didn't. In my opinion Ms. Chong is a total flake who needs to see a good therapist. Soon!<br /><br />If you want to be entertained, go see almost anything else. On the other hand if you want to feel good knowing there's someone out there more messed up than you are, by all means see this movie.<br /><br />
