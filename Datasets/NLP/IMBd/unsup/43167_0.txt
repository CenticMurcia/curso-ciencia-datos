I just finished reviewing all 9 seasons of the X files (while watching the 8th and 9th seasons for the first time) and i guess that my comment is not only about the last episode but also about both last seasons.<br /><br />The first thing that i realized is that at least for me the show was based on agent Mulder and his special non-romantic relationship with Sculley, the last 2 seasons totally ruin that, Mulder mostly isn't there and when he is the he deals with the romances with Sculley and their baby. Although i think Robert Patrick (agent Dogget) is quite good he is still no match for David Duchovny as an actor. I find the last 2 seasons lack the great acting and the great sense of humor there was in the first seasons (especially 1-6).<br /><br />The last 2 seasons really turned one of the greatest series to just another sci-fi series, and thats why i think it would be much better the show would end with the ending of the 7th season (mulders abduction by the aliens). That would save us the 2 seasons that took the show down and also would be a great point to a sequel movie if there is ever gonna be one.
