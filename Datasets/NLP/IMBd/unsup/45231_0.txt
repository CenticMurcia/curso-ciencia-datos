Sturgeon's Law more than applies here: "90 per cent of everything is crud." There is no chemistry between any of the actors, the writing is on middle-school level, and any movie that dares to invoke Katharine Hepburn in one scene and then drags its characters through one contrived and pointless and flatly-acted episode after another is indeed crud. The only redeeming scenes were those featuring Zooey Daschanel, who brought some sincere charm and liveliness to her role, and there was the dolphin at the end. That dolphin was more engaging than most of the humans in this pitiful excuse for a romantic comedy. This movie was a major disappointment and a major waste of talent and time.
