I can understand why planktonrules is so irritated at so many mediocre episodes getting high ratings just because it's got the Twilight Zone name. My issue is when he (or she) targets episodes that I think are pretty good. Maybe the people who like this episode just happen to like this episode. There are different opinions, after all. To use a line from one of the episodes, "beauty is in the eye of the beholder." <br /><br />This episode though is just boring. Why it was chosen for the movie, I don't know. Maybe I'm missing the point. Maybe if I ever get to old age, I'll understand why it's special. For the time being, it's a bad episode and I can do without it. It's corny. People should act their age.
