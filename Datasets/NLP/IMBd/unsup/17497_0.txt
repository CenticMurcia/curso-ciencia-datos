Probably there is no Fellini's film, after Amarcord (1973), with such a high level of mastery as "Otto e mezzo", "La Dulce Vita", and Amarcord. But there are certainly strokes of genius in "E la nave VA", the nostalgic and highly critical of TV "Ginger and Fred", the delightfully autobiographical "Intervista" or even the "lunatic" and "moonstruck" "La voice Della Luna". "La cittá Dell Donne"has few assets to remember: Mastroianni, of course, and some brilliant scenes where the world of Snaporaz's erotics fantasies is brought back as a sort of entertainment show. But the script is faulty, there is no "reality check" to confront such unbridled fancy, where everything is possible. Of course, Fellini is a master, and "La cittá Dell Donne" is still the work of a master, who revisits one of his obsessions: women and sex and eroticism. But the same subject has been (much better) treated in "La Dulce vita", "Otto e mezzo", "Roma", "Amarcord", "Intervista" and even in "La Voce Della Luna".
