This awkward piece of celluloid garbage was allowed to escape the cutting room floor. The directors, producers, production company could have done so much better. The actors should have been shot on the spot. This is not the level of incompetence we want to release to the public. I have seen better on a county college film school. Not to be nasty, but you have to get nasty to the people who release this type of manure. High in nitrates, carries across three fields, able to induce DiarrhEEEAR !!<br /><br />get a video camera, invite your friends over, and drink some beer; you can do a better job yourselves.
