Let me just say that after seeing two of the After Dark films last year (The Hamiltons in theaters and Gravedancers at home) I was very excited for this film, and considering the cast, it was warranted in my mind. Now...I want my 9 bucks back. How bad was the film you ask? Throughout the showing i was surrounded by nothing but drunkards laughing at inappropriate times, this was annoying at first, but by the end, i had joined them...not because the movie was entertaining in any sense, but they seemed to have found the only way to enjoy it, and i wanted to try as well. I don't know where to begin with this abysmal blunder, first off though (and most obvious) Nicole DuPont CANNOT ACT. Listening to her botch her lines in an over-exaggerated manner the entire film was simply painful...I WAS CRINGING BY THE END.Not that her lines were any good in the first place, which brings me to point 2, the writing was terrible, and despite the best effort of Ryder Strong, Michael Madsen, and Rachael Miner, the film was intolerable. I didn't not know how to feel about characters such as Dakota (just came off as bitchy and annoying, but was supposed to be a hero...wtf?!!!) and characters such as Jackal were underused and ruined by the bad script (WHY ARE YOU WHISTLING "I'VE BEEN WORKIN ON THE RAILROAD"?!!! THAT MAKES NO SENSE!!!) Third, there was nothing intriguing about this film, the gore was kind of cool, but neither the cannibals nor the protagonists interested me in any sense, nor showed any depth; locations were boring and rarely changed; and just not a whole hell of a lot happened. I'm sorry this review is long, but i cannot warn you against this film enough, it isn't even laughably bad, its the rare breed of horror that has no redeeming qualities...
