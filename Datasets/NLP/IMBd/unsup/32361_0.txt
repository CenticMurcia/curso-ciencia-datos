wow, i've seen something worse then cena's wrestling, his acting! wow....don't watch the marine...i went for the laugh factor of seeing cena play in a movie...but it wasn't worth it...they tried being funny, but quite frankly it was just pathetic....there were 43 explosions for crying out loud! bad acting anyone? when his wife thinks he dies, she doesn't even changer her facial expressions...she just shrugs it off like it's no big thing.<br /><br />a very very stupid plot....an ex marine goes to a gas station with his wife...but little does he know...some jewel thief's are in that exact same gas station! they steal his wife, need her as a hostage, though they didn't really....need a hostage at all. and they walk through a forest, while cena gets whacked in the head with a fire extinguisher and a plank of wood for the only laugh factors of the film.<br /><br />so we end off the film, with 20 explosions, and his wife chained up in a truck falling into a lake! and then...cena has an epic battle with the main villain everyone thought was dead! after 5 more explosions and much more crappy acting later, he beats him up and the whole place blows up with a huge explosion....he dives in for his wife....who is obviously dead at this point, brings her up, and saves her somehow....and in an ironic twist, john tritan says to his wife "shoulda gone to da beach" ohohohoh, hilarity ensued.<br /><br />i truly want my money back, plus some extra cash just for how bad it was
