This movie was really great, and in my opinion, lived up to it's expectations. Maybe it wasn't the "BIGGEST Sequel TO THE BIGGEST Disney CHANNEL PRODUCTION," but it was still a great movie. I will admit that it wasn't as pulling as the first movie was, but I think the plot was very creative and funny. People said that the first movie was a "Cheesy remake of Grease," And I disagreed with that. It may have had a similar plot, what with the whole boy meets girl on vacation, girl moves into his school, they can't be together because of clicks thing. But at least the second movie didn't come out like, 10 years later out of the blue, with different actors, and a lame plot with main characters not even related to the originals at least. It was an incredible movie, and very funny for a person under, or over 18.
