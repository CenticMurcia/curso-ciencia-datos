I don't even know where to begin with this wretched excuse for a movie. Two very unlikeable (and hard to look at) women are obsessed with their selfish desires to have the "perfect" wedding that they can't even share it with their best friend. In the end, it says "Don't fight with your friend...they'll give up eventually and let you have your own wedding." I can't even stand to look at the poster for this crap. I don't even want to write this review. It's a waste of time. Just like this movie. Only worse. I'd rather cut off my big toes and run from Maine to Mexico non-stop while simultaneously sticking blood-sucking leaches all over my crotch. That's how bad this movie is (if you knew me, you'd know how important my crotch and toes are to me).<br /><br />The utter selfishness of the two lead characters just pisses you off so much that you do hope something bad happens to both of them and when such things (and believe me, not nearly bad enough) happen, you won't laugh. You'll just sneer evilly because that's what you want to happen. Honestly, I was hoping one of them would either kill the other during a childish cat fight or accidentally stepped in front of traffic. Hell, a murder mystery does sound a hell of a lot more interesting anyway.<br /><br />This is going on my list of the worst of 2009. Without a doubt. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must redeem myself for putting my mind through that kind of torture and watch something good.
