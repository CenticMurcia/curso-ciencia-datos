I don't understand the many bad comments about this show. the show is excellent for small children, and my daughter (3 years old) loves this show. <br /><br />I think the authors of the negative comments forget that this is a simple children's show for ages 2-5. It is not meant to win any artistic awards, nor was it meant for teens/adults.<br /><br />While this isn't exactly the highest quality animation show, I've seen far worse, and the world setting is cute and simplistic, as it should be in a children's show.<br /><br />I give this show an 9 out of 10 because my daughter loves it.
