In 1974, two American agents are sent to Hungary by his superior Miller (Barry Bostwick) to get werewolf blood for a secret project for the creation of an invincible warrior. One of the men dies and the other decides to inject the blood in himself, being killed by Miller. There is a shutdown of the project. Twenty years later, the scientist Anne de Carlo (Kim Delaney) is carrying out a research under the command of Miller, and the body of the dead agent is delivered for the experiment. The agent is transformed in a kind of killing metallic werewolf. The screenplay of this low budget movie has no originality. I do not know how many films I have seen with this storyline. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `Metalbeast'
