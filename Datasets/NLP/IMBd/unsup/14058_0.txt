"The Public Enemy" is not a great film, but it features an absolutely incredible performance, by James Cagney. This was Mr. Cagney's first "starring" role; and he is great throughout. From the time he walks in front of the camera, moving his cap forward, until his final thundering scenes, Cagney is astonishing. The rest of the film is a mixed bag.<br /><br />For starters, filmmakers showed Cagney (Tom Powers) and co-star Edward Woods (Matt Doyle) as boys Frank Coghlan Jr. (young Tom Powers) and Frankie Darro (young Matt Doyle). Although Mr. Woods is directed to wipe his hand with his sleeve when he first appears, it looks like the boys' roles are mixed up with the adult men -- Mr. Coghlan Jr. (a fine performance, by the way) resembles Woods more than Cagney; and, Mr. Darro more closely resembles Cagney. The appearance of the boys' sister and brother ("sissy" Mike) is also confusing.<br /><br />Of all the strange supporting performances, Jean Harlow (as Gwen) takes the cake (but not the grapefruit). Though second billed, she enters the story late, and leaves abruptly. Ms. Harlow was, like Cagney, on her way to major stardom; but, unlike Cagney, she shows relatively little of her later charms. In fact, Joan Blondell is much more memorable (as Mamie, Matt's girl). And, famously, Mae Clarke receives the halved grapefruit, in the face, from Cagney; it's still a great scene, but "The Public Enemy" has much better scenes -- Cagney's visit to the tailor, his walk in the rain, and the film's ending are all superior to the "grapefruit scene". <br /><br />Watch out for Cagney.
