I loved this short. Not only for the light hearted plot but also for the music. Best of all is the location at which it was made, the now razed Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. So sad a national landmark is gone. So much history involving both celebrities of a bygone Hollywood era, but also political significance since it was in the Ballroom kitchen that Robert Kennedy was assassinated.<br /><br />This short but sweet clip gave a glimpse at the Coconut Grove nightclub and the Ambassadors outdoor grounds as it was in it's heyday. What a treat it was for me to watch it and for 19 minutes, in some small way, feel like I was there. Cool clip.
