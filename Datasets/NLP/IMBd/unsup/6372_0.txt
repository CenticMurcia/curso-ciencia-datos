This has been and continues to be one of my favorite cult films of all time, i first saw Dracula vs Frankenstein as a very young teenager, about 13, at the only theater in the town of Riverhead where they showed horror and cult films to pot smoking teenagers. That night, i fell in love with miss Regina Carrol and have been a fan of hers ever since as well as a fan of her husband, director, Al Adamson. I'm watching Dr Dracula right now and wonder why this had to be her last movie, she looked as beautiful as ever.Other favorates of the Regina and Al movies would have to be Satan's Sadists and Brain of blood. Still wating for Viva las Vegas to come out on DVD, haven't seen it yet in stores, but with Regina, Beverly Hills and Ann Margret together with Elvis, this is one movie that must be in any DVD collection.
