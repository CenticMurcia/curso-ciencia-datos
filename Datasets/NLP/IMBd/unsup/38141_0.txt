This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad script, bad acting...everything in this movie is bad. In this sequel to 1984's Children of the corn, the authorities find the bodies in Gatlin and the murderous kids responsible. The kids are all adopted by foster parents in the neighbor town next to Gatlin. But soon a boy named Micah is taken over by the evil corn deity named he who walks behind the rows. Micah gets the kids to go back to their murderous habits and soon the adults begin to die...again. I don't understand why the 1984 movie needed a sequel or sequelS I should say since there are seven of these movies. You know the original movie made 14 million dollars at the box office, so if it didn't do good why make a sequel (this movie made 6 million, a box office disaster). The only 2 good scenes were when the character Micah is possessed, he gets zapped and then he's falling through a strange shaft, gets his body dismantled, he who walks behind the rows enters his blood, and he gets pieced to together and falls out into the cornfield. And 2nd is the nosebleed scene. Take my word for it, don't see this movie.
