I use the F-word liberally myself, and this document just struck me as ridiculous. We start out with some talking heads pontificating about what the word means to them, then there's a childish montage of people dropping the f-bomb, then a bunch of people spouting the (untrue) theory that the word is an acronym for "Fornication Under Consent of the King" (actually, it comes from an old Dutch word for "penis"). There are some porn clips and a lot more celebrity interviews. They try to f*** with Miss Manners, which didn't impress me at all, as she could have wiped the floor with any of the interviewers but was just too polite to tell them to go back to the second grade. Ultimately this movie is just deeply boring. A total waste of a First Amendment.
