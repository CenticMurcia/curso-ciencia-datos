The Two Mrs. Carrolls was one of a handful of motion pictures done by Warner Brothers which were released to the Armed Forces overseas first and then to the general public. Saratoga Trunk was another. As if our fighting men didn't have enough to contend with.<br /><br />I disagree and even more importantly Humphrey Bogart disagrees with another reviewer who said this was Bogart's worst film. Bogart reserved that honor for Swing Your Lady. But you would think that in a once only teaming with him and Barbara Stanwyck they would have given him a better property. For instance I could easily see Stanwyck playing Mary Astor's part in The Maltese Falcon. But the Brothers Warner thought otherwise.<br /><br />By the way either before or after Stanwyck did a film at Warners, Christmas in Connecticut an infinitely better film.<br /><br />Bogart here is a psychopathic painter whose modus operandi is woo 'em, wed 'em, paint 'em and kill 'em. He's done that with one wife and Stanwyck is wife two. He's now got his eye on Alexis Smith and Stanwyck is being slowly poisoned.<br /><br />What bothered me most about this is that there seems no reasons for Bogart's psychosis. Hopefully someone who might have seen the original play by Martin Vale could inform us if that was something left out in the movie.<br /><br />If not, then it's a bad movie taken from a bad play.
