At first I wasn't sure this movie was going to be much. Prepared to give it a mediocre score, partially to just be nice since it contained work from big names like Robert Redford and Ben Kingsley (who's names didn't appear on the credits on the outside of the package) and more. But this movie did sneak in and grab my attention with it's subtle draw. These people are computer experts, Redfords character is blackmailed because of his past, into doing some work for the government. The task is retrieving a black box, that isn't your run of the mill black box like what is found in air planes, this one has a very powerful secret.
