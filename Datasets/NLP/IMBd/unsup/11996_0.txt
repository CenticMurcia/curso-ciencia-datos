"Devil's Prey" (2001) is the first movie to show the brutal reality of devil worship and virgin sacrifice-dull, boring, and stupid. It is an amalgam of vile scenes scotch-taped together to form a motion picture. A gang of devil worshipers, led by Seth the local minister, doesn't like a gang of ravers, led by David (Charlie O'Connel). Driving away from the rave, David runs over Seth's girlfriend Fawn (Elena Lyons) who is mysteriously immune from blunt object trauma and who just gets into David's car. <br /><br />In retaliation Seth forces David's car off the road and Seth's friends hit Joe (one of David's closest friends) with their car; Joe too is mysteriously unhurt from the collision but loses his glasses. In retaliation David's gang begins killing a bunch of girls because they are dressed in long black robes and running around in the woods at night with sharp objects. In retaliation Seth's gang sacrifices Samantha (Jennifer Lyons) because she speaks with the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel and they figure she must be a virgin. There's a lot of avenging going on. By the end David's gang seems to have pretty much wiped out all the citizens of a small California town along with Seth and Fawn. But you can't be sure because they come back in one of those moronically tacked on endings. <br /><br />The movie nicely balances scenes of Jennifer Lyon's tight abs with charming shots of the little chapel in the dell, so there's something for everybody. But frankly, there just wasn't enough virgin sacrificing. <br /><br />But seriously, "Devil's Prey" may not be the worst ever example in the horror genre but you are unlikely to randomly chance on anything worse than this mess. It relies on its target audience's inability to recall misdirection devices that have been in use for decades. You immediately know that the seemingly normal townspeople are in league with the devil worshipers and that Fawn is their high priestess. Fawn's revelation is so predictable that even cheating by introducing impossible things that point in the opposite direction cannot disguise it. <br /><br />Devil's Prey is an illogical story lamely masked by confusing plot elements. It relies on poor lighting and minimal close-ups to mask poor performances and direction. There is a puzzling lack of intensity, suspense, and fast pacing as each scene seems to get mired down in extended shots-all this extra air apparently was necessary to get the running length up to 90 minutes. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
