Silly psychological drama about Ma Barker and her sons who robbed and killed in the 1920s. Roger Corman directed this...it seems like he was actually trying to do a serious movie...sadly, it doesn't work at all. This movie has a following but damned if I know why.<br /><br />It is very well-acted but the script and direction ramble all over the place. Also I found most of the actors dialogue unintelligible -- they're all putting on stupid Southern accents which don't help. Also, the movie is VERY sleazy. Rape, murder, incest, torture, beatings, drug abuse, homosexuality (portrayed negatively unfortunately)...you name it. I'm no prude, but this movie rubs your face in it. For instance, the opening scene has a young girl (about 13) being held down by her brothers while her father rapes her!<br /><br />This is ALMOST worth seeing to see Shelley Winters chewing the scenery as Ma and Robert DeNiro before he hit it big.<br /><br />All in all, a must miss.
