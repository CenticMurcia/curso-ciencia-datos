Book Of Fate doesn't compete in the Major League, but it is nevertheless a Champion in it's own right. You'll have to put yourself in the right context: this is not a Hollywood production, not even a b-class movie with still decent budget. This is a very low-budget movie - we are talking about probably some few thousand dollars at most, no more. In fact the movie is a thesis for the two directors. Still they managed to get some of the finest Finnish professional actors in, and even the soundtrack is filled with internationally famous Finnish rock and heavy metal bands (like Nightwish with over 1.5 million records sold). These acts alone are noteworthy.<br /><br />The main idea of the movie are the struggles of an "eternal champion", and the idea is not very far from the themes of author Michael Moorcock. Also, it takes courage to select five totally different genres (horror, western, war, action thriller and SF) and combine them in an episode movie.<br /><br />This movie seems to divide opinions very much - and that's understandable. If you are a kind of person who is interested only in the technical details and finesse over the contents, you will be disappointed. But if you are able to see behind the financial and technical limits, you may appreciate the over-the-top pastiches of these genres, and the enthusiasm behind. Sure, the CGI-effects may be a little cranky - but so were the CGI-images of the excellent series Babylon 5. In my opinion, the only true limitations are in the people's imagination, not in the technical limitations.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, the results were highly satisfactory - I had no expectations of this movie, but I found myself entertained. And that's what this movie is all about.
