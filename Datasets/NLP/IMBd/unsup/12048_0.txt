Believe it or not, you still see this kind of shock-humor today, and you probably always will. This cartoon isn't some old-fashioned slam on Egyptians or their beliefs or way of life - it's just far-out absurd humor. For instance, in the very first scene we see a couple of the locals, dressed in Mid-East garb, waking up, beginning to chant and then - wham! - someone breaks out a pair of dice and a guy yells, "Come on, seven. Baby needs a new pair of shoes!" You see - absurd humor....and it IS funny. To emphasize that point, the very next scene has a veiled, what-looks-like, sexy woman with a great body passing by, the guys whistle....until she lifts the veil and we see a toothless old hag! A short time later, we see a long camel that can seat 10 people. Some of the humor is stupid or dated to the point where we miss it, but some are clever. <br /><br />Anyway, Porky Pig is there and he misses the long camel ride, hitches one of his own and begins a trek in the desert. Then, this settles into a short story of "desert madness" when the brutal sun (and I mean "brutal) knocks Porky's camel for a loop.<br /><br />At that point, this cartoon gets hilarious. Porky's camel (named "Humpty Bumpty") is delirious, hysterical and then thinks he's saved and begins playing bagpipes, doing an Irish dance, etc. - very, very funny stuff. Humptey is, by far, the funniest camel I've ever seen in a cartoon.
