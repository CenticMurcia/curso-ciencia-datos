One day I thought I'd try a Bollywood film not expecting much, the movie Dil Chatha Hai was suggested and was I surprised. The cast, story lines, song's (which I kept humming over and over) made me say 'Oh Yeah' there's someone else just as good as Hollywood. I have since watch other films to see if DCH was a fluke but for me there still was that Bollywood magic. I am also glad to see that some of the film companies are starting to expand into other more controversial subjects about the morays and tabu's because I find not only is the films entertaining but I have learned a lot more about the culture and it's people. The actors and actresses are diverse not cloned, that may be why I do not have a favorite each contributes to the Bollywood mystique. And I must not forget the song writers and singers whomever they are because to me they share as much credit as the cast. My movie library now has more Bollywood films than any other I am quite sure that I am just one of millions world wide that say 'thank you' to the Bollywood industry.
