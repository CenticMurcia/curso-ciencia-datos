I didn't know that this kind of movie was still made in HK. Leave it to an old Category III veteran like Billy Chung to make a movie like this in 2003. Although rated IIB, Devil Face, Angel Heart is Cat 3 sleaze all the way, complete with seedy sex and obviously censored violence (more than once I could hear the music score skip because of cuts).<br /><br />Luckily, I kind of like this kind of trashy thriller and this one manages to be a little above average. Daniel Wu's rather blase acting style fits his tortured character. Really, It works. I liked him in this movie. The movie is well directed, too, giving it a polished look and feel that a lot of HK moves don't have (for the past several years it seems they've been doing better, though).<br /><br />Now this isn't a great movie. The plot is a little thin. When the movie was done I didn't feel I had seen an entire story play out. What story there is isn't awful for this kind of movie. There's some twists and turns, but nothing surprising. If you're the kind of person who puts up with this garbage, then it's a decent diversion. It's probably pretty forgettable, but I enjoyed it while it lasted. This is fairly well-done genre filmmaking.
