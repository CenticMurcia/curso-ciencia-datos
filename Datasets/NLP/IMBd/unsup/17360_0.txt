I was. I went to this movie when it came out simply because it had Al Pacino in it, and half-expected some sort of cheesy love story. And so began my love affair with Ellen Barkin; one of the hottest babes ever to hit the silver screen.<br /><br />Here she is at her steamy best as a femme fatale with a mysterious past who is linked to a murder being investigated by alcoholic cop Al Pacino. Inevitably, she ends up exciting more than just his tastebuds and the result is a conjunction even more sizzling than her bayou romp with Dennis "Remy" Quaid. All of this is played out against the backdrop of continuing murders being investigated by Pacino and his partner (excellently played by John Goodman), and the result is a taut, sexy thriller in the best traditions of film noir.
