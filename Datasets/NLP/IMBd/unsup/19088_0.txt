This was a 1958 TV Series which I seemed to have missed and I must say the so-called Five(5) Spine Tingling Episodes: "Vision of Crime", "Girl On the Road","Jack The Ripper", "Summer Heat",'and" Return of Madam" were big disappointments. In some of these Episodes, Boris Karloff gives some minor performances which definitely spark your interest by his facial expressions and faces of evil which he so greatly performed for many many years. It is quite clear that having Karloff hosts these brief stories, it caused people to take an interest in viewing them on TV. In one of the stories, George Hamilton was very young and had a very brief role to perform. This is still a Classic film made in 1958 and ten years later, Boris Karloff passed away to the Higher Stage in the real Spiritual World.
