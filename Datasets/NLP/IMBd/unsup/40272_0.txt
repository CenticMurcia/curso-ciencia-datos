Whilst nearly keeping close to the traditional Robin Hood Theme apart from the missing Sheriff of Nottingham (Replaced by a Baron for some reason) this film starts well but is of course sadly lacking in any real acting talent apart from the actor playing Much The Miller and perhaps Ms Thurman.<br /><br />However for those that like to see really really badly directed movies then there's a treat for you in the last five minutes of the film. The fight scene has to be one of the worst ever seen eg "Are Robin and Marion going to make that balcony whilst swinging on the bell rope or are they going to smash into the wall because the rope is too long ? - no chance, cut scene, phew they made it".<br /><br />Funniest line ? - (To Uma) "you are the most beautiful bride in England" followed by a cut to Uma looking more like a rejected model for ET.<br /><br />Certainly the worst ever Robin Hood film EVER made, even the many TV series put this in the shade.
