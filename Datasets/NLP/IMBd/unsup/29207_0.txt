I did not enjoy this movie at all. It is one of the worst sequels ever made. All they did was alter the first movie slightly, take out some of the conflict, throw in some different actors...<br /><br />The fact that they found another actress to play the same character was already a huge disappointment. And this was before I even started the movie. Facts pop out randomly and characters that started out in the story just disappeared because of lame reasons.<br /><br />I did not find the 'big finale' very interesting, meaning I had to sit through an hour and a half of drama that I'd already seen in the first movie, just so I could see the poorly done finish.
