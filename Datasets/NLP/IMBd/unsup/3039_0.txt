Tupac Shakur for some reason decided to extend his talent to a film set in the Ghettos of America but he and his friends would look more comfortable in Paris dressed in 80's euro-fashion that they seem to wear in this terrible waste of time movie.<br /><br />Why oh why did you make this, an ego boost if ever there is one.<br /><br />It saddens me to say this, because i love Tupac as much as the next bloke, but on his form in this film it's no bad thing that he now lies six feet under.<br /><br />If this is tupac's legacy i feel sorry for him, well done Biggie for shooting him (allegedly) (though we all know its true). Though after watching this Frenchified supposedly American film it looks like Biggie did us all a great favour.
