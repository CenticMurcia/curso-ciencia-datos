Honestly, this is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen more than my share of stinkers. Seriously, there are lifetime movies with better acting than this. Effects and makeup look like they were done by the people that the Power Rangers production team refused to hire due to lack of talent. The plot is nearly nonexistent (and that's being nice). If you ever made silly home movies with friends on your mom's camera when you were young, it was probably on this level (the only difference being that they had about $50 more to spend than you did). This movie should have remained an inside joke between friends and never seen the light of day. Note: I'm not pretentious, I own and enjoy lots of B movies. I just don't want anyone to waste their money; if, after this, you still feel some strange curiosity to buy and watch this movie, remember that you will never have back the time spent watching this, and will hate yourself for that for the next year at least.
