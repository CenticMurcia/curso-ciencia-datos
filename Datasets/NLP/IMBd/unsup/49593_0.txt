Perhaps people who are fans of the Hercules/Xena/Queen of Swords line of TV shows will be able to sit through this. I only did to see if there was any way the movie would redeem itself. It didn't.<br /><br />My first complaint is simply that the screenwriters/director/producer seem to think they are better storytellers than R.E. Howard - they aren't. Howard was a legend from the pulp era, and any of his characters and settings can stand alone without modern tinkering for plot.<br /><br />My second complaint is in the dialogue and the execution of the dialogue. No one involved in making this movie seems to have heard of having their actors deliver their lines with any sort of cadence. They all sound like bored airline ticket agents. The characters also all speak in a modern dialect, with contractions and words that would have no place in 20,000 BC. Even the opening voice-over is lousy. In this they follow in the footsteps of the TV shows, which also take bad teen melodrama dialogue into the sword and sorcery genre.
