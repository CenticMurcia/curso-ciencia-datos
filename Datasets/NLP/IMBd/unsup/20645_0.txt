Classified by many as film noir, this one plays more like an overly dramatic melodrama and soap opera IMHO. Joan Crawford plays an unstable woman who slowly slips into madness after being rejected by Van Heflin. To make matters worse, Heflin is now dating Crawford's step daughter following Joan's rebound marriage to Raymond Massey. Sounds pretty sappy, and, it really is.<br /><br />I did like the performances of both Heflin and Massey but for whatever reason, I couldn't really take Crawford seriously in this one and found her role to be hammy and over the top. A lot of folks praise this movie and Joan's work but it must have slipped right by me. I didn't find it all that entertaining but it definitely was atmospheric in spots.
