Pretty awful! Only flat jokes, the movie does not make any sense at all. And Meg Ryan was supposed to be the hottest girl ever? What was that all about? That bot-ox face and that flat chest will even fool anyone? Stupid movie, stupid scenes, as someone once said, stupid scenes transitions (like Windows Movie Maker)...<br /><br />I could not laugh at all. I only waste my time and money watching this.... this... well... i think u got the idea.<br /><br />Please go spend your money elsewhere.<br /><br />Poor execution...<br /><br />Two thumbs down!
