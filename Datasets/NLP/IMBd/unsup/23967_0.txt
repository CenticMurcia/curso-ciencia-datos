This movie shows that Mark Dacascos is a very overlooked prospect. Drive showcases the talent that he is capable of (and he is VERY capable). As I mentioned, this movie has moves borrowed straight out of Drunken Master 2 (or Legend of Drunken Master to the newer U.S. audience), but is definitely better than half of the crap you see released in the theater. Supposedly, Brotherhood of the Wolf is going to introduce Dacascos to the mainstream. He deserves to be in better than straight-to-video films. Rent it, it's definitely worth repeated viewings. 8/10
