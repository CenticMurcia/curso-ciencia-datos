Warning this is an awful review so if you want to watch the movie skip to some one who wrote a good review or who liked the movie. Still reading? Here is how I would get through this piece of junk. What I did was get some work out and leave the pig rolling on in the background. I worried that the my work on my laptop might have suffered but I watched the pig and answered emails even with this diversion I still hated it. It was a study in futility. Bad Characters. Lifeless and unbelievable acting I mean truly awful. I feel bad for the folks who saw it in the theaters.<br /><br />OK so it had some great stars I liked looking at the film faces so I blame the director on this pig--Cut together like a story that never made sense to the director and if the editor convinced him to run it backwards maybe they could have saved the pig. The story line is a wanna be "Seven" With Brad Pitt. this so called female cop is boring.<br /><br />Again Don't blame the actors blame the director--He stunk this one up but good. In the end the stupid thing ends with the woman being saved and who cares. Watch it while your doing something else like waxing your car.
