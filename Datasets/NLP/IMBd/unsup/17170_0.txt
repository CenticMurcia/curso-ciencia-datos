MAN I FELT LIKE I WASTED 2 HOURS OF MY LIFE AFTER WATCHING THIS PIECE OF CRAP!! This movie shouldn't even be called a movie, it shouldn't even be on IMDb. I mean this movie has no story, no structure, no characters, no message, no nothing. If I actually took my time to write a detailed review I'd probably end up hanging myself for wasting more time than I already did watching this ridiculous pile of steaming crap that was actually supposed to be a movie. If you plan on watching this movie make sure you schedule an appointment with a psychologist for some therapy cause this movie will depress you for giving it the time you have. They ought to take this movie and stick in the cam'ron's rear end.
