It's a bird! it's a plane! It's a flying turd! So, this is the most irritating piece of grub infested rotted flesh that I've ever seen. It was just terrible. There were no redeeming qualities other than the fact that it was hilarious every once and a while, but it gets to the point where you just don't think you can finish it. So where do I begin? There's some annoying music and we see various shots of trash. Then we are introduced to the horrible monster tadpole thing, Hedorah, which was named s hastily as the graboids in Tremors. So then Godzilla comes in and drunk music plays, for some reason. Then Hedorah can transform and shoot laser beams and he looks like a big old dookie. Then Godzilla can fly, for some reason. Then some more crazy stuff happens and there is some singing and an annoying kid and the dookie monster dies, somehow.
