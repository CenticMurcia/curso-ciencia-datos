As you can tell by the summary line, I'm no big fan of the Tarantino scripted original, but it shines in the face of this effort. This second sequel, made back to back with the third, attempts to cash in on the profitability of the original movie. In a nutshell, this movie stinks! Really badly. No care or continuity has been taken in the writing. The endless use of pointless P.O.V. shots really grate the viewer (although, I'm sure the crew had a much worse time having to waste their efforts on such shots as an elevator button P.O.V., etc.) The effects are abysmal.<br /><br />But you've probably already seen this movie. You know how bad it is. What I'd like to know is how can we convince the industry not to waste their money on poop like this?
