If you can sit through this movie without killing yourself or someone next to you who may have been involved in the selection process, then you are person who has a will of steel and should not be wasting his time watching movies but teaching some sort eastern Shinto religion.<br /><br />This movie really really really sucks..I don't know how much more I can emphasize that!
