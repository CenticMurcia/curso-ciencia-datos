I have never really watched the show except I by chance caught one episode called If Not Now. Central to the theme of the show was the topic of abortions. I am extremely disappointed in how they misrepresented people and circumstances. A girl is raped and since her parents are Catholics they are represented as unreasonable. Furthermore, the parents explanation to the doctors as to why they do not want their daughter to have an abortion are presented as fanatical and not looking for the best interest of their daughter. This can't be farther from the truth. Most parents who are strongly opposed to abortion maintain more values than this show exhibited. Parents as these are not only looking out for their new grandchild, but they are also considering the long term effects their daughter may suffer. Further, a scenario such as this accounts for a mere 1% of the abortions that occur. This particular case supports the all too common misperception that the main reason abortions are an option is due to cases of rape and incest.
