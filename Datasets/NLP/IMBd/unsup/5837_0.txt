I only gave it a ten because Robert Duvall was in it, and also June Carter Cash.<br /><br />Sonny was a stupid SOB who thought he was doing the Lords work. Don't misunderstand me, I'm not a particularly religious person myself, but I think I'm intelligent enough to know that men of god don't go around drinking whiskey, and killing people with baseball bats, then running away, and of all the nerve, starting a new ministry.<br /><br />Some of the folks seemed to like him, but I couldn't stand the bastard he was a drunk, a womanizer, and by all indications a blasphemer.<br /><br />I loved the movie, because I hated Sonny so much, which is a tribute to Duvall for doing such a good job of portraying him.<br /><br />Thanks for letting me express my opinion.
