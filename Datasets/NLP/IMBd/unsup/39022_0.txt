When I checked out "Blackballed" on IMDb I thought it might be an enjoyable movie. The rating was pretty high, and all available comments were very positive. Now, after I have seen this movie I think it is necessary to warn people like me who know nothing about it: First of all this sure isn't an "awesome" and "hilarious" film to everybody. I would say not even 10 percent of all IMDb people would like it. <br /><br />It's a very flat documentary. A simple story is stretched out to one-and -a-half hours. It's very American and of very poor quality. What fascinated me though: It's all made up. It's all fake. They are actors playing roles of paintballers. The only problem is: It's so well done, it's very hard to realize it. That actually makes it a critique of people with very little braincells playing paintball all day long. A horrible mirror of todays society.<br /><br />So if you are not completely into the sport of paintball and if you don't know the people from that TV show who did this and if you are not an American citizen, you most likely won't have too much fun watching this.
