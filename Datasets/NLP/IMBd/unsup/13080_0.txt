After having seen this movie about four times I have to say that this movie is a biting look into the life of 4 friends that may make you uncomfortable, or hit you right where it hurts. Quaid and MacDowell and Kinnear and Collette are two married couples who have been friends, shared lives, stories and the raising of their families for 12 years. Collette drops the bomb, alone, on Quaid and MacDowell, that Kinnear is leaving her. The movie unravels the friendships by exposing that neither Quaid or MacDowell like Kinnear and Collette very much,individually, after their secrets and lies are exposed. I think true friends overcome, and real friends fall by the wayside, as in this movie.<br /><br />Great acting, dialog, direction, etc..But a intense, deeply emotional film that may cause you to look at your friends and your spouse differently. And ask the question: Could it all fall apart?
