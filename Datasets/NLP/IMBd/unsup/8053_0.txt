Lots to look at, as you would expect from an Italian film. Supernatural in theme, not much of a plot. This is not necessarily a negative thing, considering how effective if worked in Dario Argento's "Inferno". Plenty of nudity from Rita Calderoni which doesn't hurt. Somewhat similar in gonzo style (but not as frantic)to Polselli's "The Reincarnation of Isabel". Worth a look.
