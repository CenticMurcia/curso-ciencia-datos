As a female I rarely watch action films, but The Bad Pack is fun from beginning to end. The film has great characters as well as an exciting and often funny narrative. The Bad Pack doesn't take itself too seriously. The writer/director obviously has his tongue firmly planted in cheek. This film should have recieved more attention.
