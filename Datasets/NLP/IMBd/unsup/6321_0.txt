I must say that any John Hughes movie I have ever seen, I loved! Every character and plot line rocked. He is by far the best. Only being born in the 80's I am still able to appreciate his work. Any movie of his, was quickly repeated to watch over and over. Even the music is excellent!! How can anyone dislike him?! I would love to one day shake that mans hand for his fine creations. Mr. Hughes is a talented man to write several movies within a few days. If they sucked, then you tell me why they are being sold in the stores! My current favorite is Career Opportunities. It goes back and forth from Pretty In Pink to The Breakfast, and then there is Sixteen Candles. Those are the top four.
