I love a good old western, unfortunately this movie follows a plot common to the Hollywood movies of the last thirty years, wasting its A-list cast.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart, a real life war veteran, curiously agreed to play a role as a seemingly gutless pacifist sheriff who takes action only when events turn horrific enough to make any man thirst for vengeance. Henry Fonda is quite convincing as the leader of the typical sadistic outlaw gang, who unfortunately gets too much time to practice their cruelty on the meek townspeople.<br /><br />Only watch this if you enjoy evil men terrorizing innocent and defenseless townspeople for the vast majority of the film, only to be thwarted by somebody finally developing fortitude enough to dispense long overdue justice in the last ten minutes.<br /><br />I've never understood how movies which main content involves seeing people stripped of their dignity serves as "entertainment".
