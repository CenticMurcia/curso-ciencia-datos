In the scene where the brothel explodes I am wondering (as it wasn't released in New Zealand where this scene and others were shot) if they flash or pan to people watching the brothel explode as I was an extra cast as a guy walking home in dark trousers and white shirt.<br /><br />We weren't told the plot but that there was only going to be ONE take on the explosion shot and no one was to 'act like a hero' or do what they weren't supposed to do.<br /><br />Finally (I got there at 11.30pm) but the scene with the explosion wasn't shot at 3.45am sheesh I was tired but it was fun! As I live in NZ I've never been able to rent it so didn't see if I was 'centre stage' in reaction to the explosion of the brothel.<br /><br />Any one shed some light on this???
