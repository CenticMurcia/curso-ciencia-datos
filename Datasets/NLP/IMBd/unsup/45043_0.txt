So this guy named Morgan plays football and that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of this movie. Him and his friend end up on this island where the wasps, rats and chickens are gigantic. The rats, chickens and wasps are so fake looking that it's hilarious. The acting is so terrible that I couldn't help but burst out laughing. I could act better if I had been in a coma. Then this lady has this baby and the other lady who is a bacteria expert knows just how to deliver a baby. That was strange and it didn't seem to hurt without any drugs. Plus the baby was fake looking too and it's just the icing on the cake. I had to back it up just to see the giant plastic chicken because it was so funny. Other than that it's just a bunch of drown rats and a kid drinking some milk.
