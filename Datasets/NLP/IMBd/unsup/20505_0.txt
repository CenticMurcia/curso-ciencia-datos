I have always had a novel idea for Loren Michaels, the producer of Saturday Night Live. If some of the best actors on your series decide to strike on their own to make movies, they should be allowed to come back to SNL if the "first" movie they make winds up stinking as much as this one did. This movie always reminds me of how lucky I am that I stick to renting movies as opposed to going to the theater and shelling out $8.75.<br /><br />Having said that I would recommend to anyone reading this not to even bother renting this movie. It is not even remotely funny. It is pathetic and for all the guys like myself who rented it solely to see Gisele Bundchen don't bother. She's in it for probably not even 15 minutes and 90 percent of that time she's wearing a 3 piece suit. Believe me I've seen some bad movies but this one was a real stinker.
