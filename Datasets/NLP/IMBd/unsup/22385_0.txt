I enjoyed this movie! The Zenon series is very cute, with exciting events in each one. This Zenon Z3 was my favorite. The cast was very good, with Zenon pulling off another excellent performance. Margie and Cassie were good. It was fun for Raven to make a special appearance. <br /><br />The new Proto Zoa was FABULOUS! He was entertaining and performed well. Cosmic Blush gave an excellent performance and had a great voice.<br /><br />The new character, Dasha, was very cute. I thought she was energetic and made the movie entertaining. She brought youth back to the movie series for younger kids that enjoy DisneyChannel. She did a great job for her first performance!
