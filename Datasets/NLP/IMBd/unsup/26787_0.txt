I read some topics of this film's board,some turk is praising g.o.r.a,and some other people declare they don't even know what is going on,why i am comparing this movie to gora,because of same directors,and gora was utterly crap..<br /><br />anyway this movie is absolutely local,if you are not familiar with Turkish University Entrance Exam,probably there wont any empathy with feelings of characters,because in other countries the exam isn't same as ours..<br /><br />The movie brings us the feeling of wrong idea of this exam,and it also adds everyone has thought to make difference,but in the end you wont,only hard-workers will win in the end,so criticism of exam and showing the results of working is too balanced so,we can agree it both ways..<br /><br />Acting:Not the greatest there are some typecasting characters such as Big-Bad-Headmaster,Slutty music teacher,horny tea seller,punk-girl who was before a actual girl etc..But we can feel what students fell really,because of i was in that exam last year,i know that pressure and you feel it too..<br /><br />Scenes:Some kinda video clip style,which is absolute problem of director,and because of shooting you always feel like its Requem For A Dream,and it also gives you pressure too..<br /><br />Scenario:Good..The tie-in's are great,the evolution of characters are good,first the dream sequence which gives us emotions of characters to frp style evolution of their work style;first stealing math exam,second stealing their pre-test exams,then the final one..<br /><br />Jean Claude Van-Damme:We see him talking french and being himself and B type movie style kick and steal sequences,what can we ask for more for this film? Chuck Norris? Our country isn't concerned with his facts,by the way he is much more popular in here,and the poster of film actually have him..(although he made it 10 minutes max.) So,if you are some kinda evolved with University Entrance Exam,you definitely enjoy this film,but you are from another country maybe enjoy the feelings of students and-thankful for yours- because there is no empathy for you..
