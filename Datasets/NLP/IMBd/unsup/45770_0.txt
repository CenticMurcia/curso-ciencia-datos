John Wayne. Genghis Khan.<br /><br />It sounds like a bad joke, but no; in the ultimate ego-trip, Wayne, sporting a ridiculous moustache, has landed himself in one of the worst films ever made, an embarrassing, ludicrous historical epic, which plays more like a cruddy Oriental western than the sweeping Asian drama it would like to be.<br /><br />It really is a disastrous affair, shamelessly misogynistic, woodenly acted, filled with appalling dialogue like 'the city will fall like a ripe plum', this is one vanity project that should never have seen the light of day.
