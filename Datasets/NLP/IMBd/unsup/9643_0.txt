One of the great things about the internet having become a semi-official film distribution channel is it giving people the chance to view films they never otherwise would have had a chance to see, particularly first time film-makers and those trying to make a name for themselves.<br /><br />Little Erin Merryweather would fall into that category for me. I have no idea how writer, director and actor in this piece David Morwick, feels about his film being available in the high quality divx format on the internet, but maybe he should be glad, as it will create an audience for his work it's unlikely he would have had any other way.<br /><br />With the constraints of first time film making, especially lack of experience, it is always good to focus on the positives in reviewing these films. You will of course expect mistakes and it is a measure of the films success in how far the positives outweigh the negatives.<br /><br />Little Erin Merryweather succeeds abundantly in scoring positives.<br /><br />Already mentioned in its reviews here are its art work and photography, they're beautiful. Beautiful photography is always an asset to good story telling and in this case, along with the art work, ties in especially well with the theme of the fairy story within a story.<br /><br />That theme itself is another plus for LEM. The genre is turned on its head by it's rewriting of Little Red Riding Hood and I like the idea that that was played with. Also clever was the fact that the film doesn't allow it's self to be neatly categorised into any one genre, and that too is a strength that lends originality.<br /><br />All in all (and given that it had just turned midnight on Halloween!) I enjoyed watching LEM. However there always has to be negatives in criticising too! What puzzles me with LEM, given how much Mr Morwick got superbly right for a first film, is that it's actually quite silly things that let him down.<br /><br />The policeman and his intervention was very, very unrealistic. I realise there were budget constraints, but if a serial killer has killed three people in three days, there will be more than one police officer involved, who will not just be sharing information with a college lecturer.<br /><br />A small point maybe, but it made the last twenty minutes of the film seem more contrived and the eventual denouement a bit silly. I think he could have waited until further into the film before Erin's identity were revealed and that would have helped maintain tension for longer. If I had to sum up LEM's flaws, it would be that if explored just a bit more deeply, it's story would have had a great deal for nuance and subtlety to give up and that it would have elevated the film from excellent to something really special. Where Mr Morwick scores B+ here, you feel he definitely has the potential for A's.<br /><br />Still, given its freshness and originality, I'm glad I spent the time with Little Erin Merryweather; it has a lot to recommend it.
