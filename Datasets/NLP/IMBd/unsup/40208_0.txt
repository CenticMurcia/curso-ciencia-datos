Upon reading the other user comments about this film, I am left to wonder if any of them actually WATCHED the movie. Or maybe there's some other mysterious movie with the same name that was actually good. But I digress...<br /><br />This film, if you were to call it that, is atrocious in all areas. The acting is forced and wooden, the directing is confused at best, and absolutely nothing is cohesive and sensical. Perhaps my least favorite facet, though, was the writing. The diologue was strained and unnatural.<br /><br />All of that being said, I will give this film the benefit of the doubt... it's really great to watch and make fun of with your friends. Still, this movie gets only a 1/10, only getting the one because of how funny it is to watch.
