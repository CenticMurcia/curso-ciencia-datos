In the kind of movie that plays on airplanes, Marlon Brando stars as a crooked business tycoon who loves his Swedish chocolates and Rolodex computer cards.<br /><br />What follows is a thin story about the development and clandestine procurement of a new synthetic industrial material. Brando's nemesis is cop George C. Scott who tries to uncover the truth. Martha Keller co-stars, for what that's worth.<br /><br />Not much going on here. The most interesting scenes are expectedly whenever Brando is on the screen.<br /><br />Best line is when Brando finds a dead frog in his pool and says, "I hope he's got Blue Cross."
