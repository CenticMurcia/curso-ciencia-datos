I really love this movie... Yes, there are parts that are stupid, like when Bronson forces the french babe to drink alcohol.. What kind of technique is that?? And I didn't understand the walnut thing... I think Bronson must have been cracking them before he threw them... I heard he was one strong dude... I was only 14 the first time I watched it so one of my favorite parts was watching the french babe in her see through top... But the movie has stood up to time and it is as good or better, everytime I rewatch it... Since I live in the U.S. ,it is like taking a 1-1/2 hour trip to France, or at least what I would imagine France would be like, since I was never there... Great film, go see it... It is much better than most of the garbage films that are in the video stores today...
