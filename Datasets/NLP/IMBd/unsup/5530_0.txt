By accident I stumbled upon a couple of episodes of The Green Archer on a local TV channel. I had not heard of this serial when it came out. I stopped seeing local movies in the fall of 1940 when I was sent to boarding school. I enjoyed seeing this, hokey as it was. It was a surprise to see Victor Jory as a hero! The other bright spot was trying to ID the makes and years of the cars used. I could not quite make out what the roadster with suicide doors was--it looked like a Dodge or De Soto from around 1933-35. Prior to that time I had seen a couple of Jimmy Allen flying films but I can't recall if these were full-length films or serial episodes. In doing some searching I learned that these films were preceded by a Jimmy Allen radio series, but I had not heard of that, either, before now. Other radio serials I was familiar with were Jack Armstrong, The Phantom Pilot, Radio Orphan Annie and General Shafter Parker and his Circus. Ray Mac.
