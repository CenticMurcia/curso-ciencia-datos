A newlywed couple spend their honeymoon in their "new" house instead of going to California. They are invaded by the police, a retired hangman, an escaped prisoner, a band of crooks and several dead bodies, all looking for something, either the crook or the loot hidden somewhere in the house. a humorous mystery follows.(or not). <br /><br />This is a bad movie.<br /><br />Almost enjoyable it instead misses the mark and falls flat. Written by Morey Amsterdam it plays more as a series of loosely connected sketches rather than as a film as a whole. There are a good number of exchanges that have nothing to do with whats going on in the story (they are funny but belong somewhere else). There is humor but the acting by the two leads is so broad and over the top that the film becomes annoying rather than amusing. I kept wishing that someone would kill the happy couple so that I wouldn't have to do it myself. The whole film looks cheap and the sets appear to wobble as people pass by. The direction is a mess. Even allowing for a cheapness that often allowed for only one camera set up (count how many scenes are essentially done in one take) this film has been put together by someone who seems to know nothing about how people really behave. Look at the scene where the bride to be is yapping away on the phone with her friends; do people really stand around like that in real life as one of their number talks non stop on the phone? Its like the most annoying sitcom you've ever seen, only worse.<br /><br />Bad. Bad. Bad. While not quite one of the worst films of all time, there are some funny bits, this is a film thats sure to induce sleep or pained screams in most people who see it. Avoid.
