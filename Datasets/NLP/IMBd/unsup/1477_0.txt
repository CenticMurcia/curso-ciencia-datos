A simple thriller like so many others. A car accident, two orphans sheltered by the parents' business associates who are revealed to have been the killers to put their hands on the money the children represent, and all that for some shady business with criminal contractors. Banal. The elder child, the girl, will try to escape and will fail. And little by little things are going down but all is well that ends well and I can't reveal the details, except that the uncle will get the kids he should have gotten from the very start since he was the only family. The thrill comes from the details of the yarn we are told which is in a way a tall tale from some Calaveras County, California and its giant leaping jumping frogs.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
