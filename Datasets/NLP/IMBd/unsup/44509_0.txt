Why else would he and the rest of the big name stars in this travesty of cinema ever agree to be a part of it. I saw it in the theatre way back when. The lousyness of this film has only been surpassed in my mind by Saturn 3 (another film with great stars, Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel, but horrible story; perhaps Kirk did it because he could be cuddly with Farrah). The visitor makes no sense, is shot in a shoddy manner, and the production quality looks like super 8. I am sure the actors and actresses who participated are embarrassed and rue the day they ever agreed to do this picture. If their agents convinced them to do it, they should have fired them. Avoid at all costs! Don't encourage the makers of this garbage to make more films like it.
