For people who think movies like e.g. Independence Day are the best ever made, Le Boucher may seem like a slow and extremely boring movie. And it is slow but that is part of the movie's action. Though the movie has aged the movie's strengths and the thoughts put into the details of this movie make it work today too.<br /><br />Le Boucher is amazing in it's use of symbolism. Few things are incidental in this movie. Colors, shades, shapes, sound, stories in this movie most often contain a message. (The colour red? The obelisk?).<br /><br />Whereas the movie may work as suspension and entertainment the first time it takes at least another view to fully understand it and notice the main part of the details.
