First off, do not go into the movie with any positive expectations. You will then be decently impressed or just neutral about the film.<br /><br />Ultimately, the revealing of the bigfoot (a guy in a costume) is what makes this otherwise decent movie suffer in the ratings. I will have to add, though, that you don't see much of the creature until half way through the movie.<br /><br />The first half of the movie was pretty good. Nice, chilling music that complements the dark, scary atmosphere (which, of course is some deserted mountain cabin). The second half is pretty dumb, once you get a full view of the monster. It just isn't as scary anymore. Horror movies have to make you believe in the terror and the monster, but this movie shoots itself in the foot by showing the entire bigfoot. If the yeti had stayed more or less in the shadows, and if they limited the stupid roaring, then I'd have rated it at least a 7.<br /><br />The acting was par. For B list actors, they performed averagely. <br /><br />The ending sort of redeems the movie. But then again, please don't have any high expectations before watching the flick. It doesn't deserve any expectation.<br /><br />However, if you are a crypto movie fan, then you might just enjoy this anyway. There aren't that many bigfoot, nessie, etc flicks out there, so you guys might like this.
