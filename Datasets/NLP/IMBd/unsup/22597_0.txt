The use of silence and conversations filled with silence is one of the strongest aspects of this surprisingly mature and interesting film. This dramatic triad has as much problem facing feelings as it does wants and desires. As the masks come off, we learn just how fragile and messed-up each one is, and how difficult it is for all three of them to reach out and communicate. Understatement and silence and powerful parts of this movie, and it all has a very asian feeling, even if their dilemmas are acculturated and familiar to non-asian americans. Though the son who gets stuck with the family business out of obligation and something like filial piety, struck me as very asian. The film also manages to convey a significant existential quality to the main characters that is very nuanced and requires contemplation.
