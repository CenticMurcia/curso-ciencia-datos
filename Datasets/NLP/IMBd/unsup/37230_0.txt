What a colossal disappointment. Another movie with a great trailer that cons the naive movie goer. I would nominate the trailer for an Academy and a lawsuit for misleading advertisement. this is just a bad movie. It has an unimaginative plot, cheesy character development, lame action sequences, and an ending guaranteed to frustrate even the nerdiest gore-aholic. Save your money, wait for the rental. If you feel compelled to see it, take my advice and pretend you're going to a comedy. You will get more out of it, and laughter is always better than crying. Thank god my son lied about his age so I didn't feel totally ripped off.
