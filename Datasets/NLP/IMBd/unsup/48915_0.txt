If there's ever an award for "Most Boring Film Noir Ever Made," this little stinker would be in strong contention. It is a miserable, plodding police procedural with essentially nothing to recommend it. About the best you can say is that the last 15 minutes are marginally less dull than the rest. Edward G. Robinson is squandered. Set in Montreal, the film has all the French-Canadian flavor of Frank Sinatra singing "O Canada."<br /><br />IMDb thinks the above review is too short. Boy, they sure wouldn't think so if they'd had to sit through this turkey. I have already given it far more words than it deserves.
