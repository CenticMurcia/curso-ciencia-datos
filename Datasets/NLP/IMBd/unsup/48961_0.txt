I've been reading about it for years. I got to finally watch it. It's absolute rubbish.<br /><br />I'm not to happy with what I said because criticizing something doesn't mean attacking it or cursing it. And I'm a big Zappa fan. I listened to most of his music, read about him, read his book, watched almost all of his videos. I'm not fond of his dark egotistical sexually-obsessed cynical obnoxious side. I'm more for his unique, innovative, independent, genius, creative, pleasant musical side. <br /><br />He was intelligent. He was an articulate speaker. A funny man. <br /><br />He's not a god. And he's definitely not a filmmaker.<br /><br />The film is just boring. I lost interest after struggling with it for 1 hour. And it's not like I'm not open-minded or I don't understand. I like surrealism, absurdity, and the avant-garde. But the film was just tasteless.
