It is quite an obvious film to make, I just wonder why they haven't made it a proper film for the cinemas, or at least base it on the book I've read by Penny Ives. Basically Mrs. Santa Claus (Angela Lansbury) gets bored of the same job of helping the elves at the North Pole, and her husband, Santa Claus (The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning), so she decides to go on a explore of New York. She ends up getting a short term job for mean Augustus P. Tavish (Terrence Mann) making toys for the shops, and the only help she has is from the children workers. There are some good songs in amongst the almost corny story, but it is quite a pleasant film for Lansbury to be in, and it is a good family film for Christmas. Also starring Mousehunt's Michael Jeter as Arvo, Lynsey Bartilson as Nora Kilkenny, Bryan Murray as Officer Doyle, David Norona as Marcello Damaroco and Debra Wiseman as Sadie Lowenstein. Okay!
