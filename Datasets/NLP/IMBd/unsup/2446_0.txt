I gave this movie 1/10, although I have to say I watched it right the way through simply because it made me laugh so much. After I realized how silly and badly put together it was, I started watching out for all the things that didn't make sense - which was basically the whole movie. The acting, the photography, the script, the plot, the taking-off other movies - the whole effort was a joke. How could someone sit back after making it and think 'Yeah, this is a good movie, I'm pleased with it'? Anyway, it did make me laugh, but only because it was so bad.
