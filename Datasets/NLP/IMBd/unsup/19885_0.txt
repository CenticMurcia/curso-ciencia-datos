Having been a fan of Christopher Guest since Waiting for Guffman, I was extremely disappointed in his latest "For Your Consideration". Come on now Chris, the embedded yiddish is now no more than cheap schtick that does make Jews like me chuckle but is lost on the rest of the audience. In "A Mighty Wind", the schtick was an integral part of the picture, here, it's silly, contrived and totally without any underlying humor or meaning. Eugene Levy is getting old, and tired, and Catherine O'Hara was frightening in that horrific post-collagen, face lift, botox masque that she had done in anticipation of winning an Oscar. The storytelling as in "Best in Show" was not there, nor the cohesive underpinning of Guffman or Wind. It resembled a series of outtakes that were somehow strung together without any rhyme or reason. I rarely comment negatively about a movie, but in this case, a second choice to "The Queen" which was having projector difficulties, it was a total waste of time.
