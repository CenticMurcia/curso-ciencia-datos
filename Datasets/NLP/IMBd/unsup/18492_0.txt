I recently saw this movie in at a "Indie-film Theater" that only showed 3 movies, "The Limey", "Princess Mononoke"(Saw it, loved it!), and "Man of the Century". Since I had already seen "Mononoke", I decided to see what Harry Knowles called "Perfect". I sat through it with only 3 other people besides me in the theater. I liked it! I don't know yet if I loved it, but I definetely liked it alot. It was a cheery, happy, and witty film. There wasn't a moment when I wasn't smiling in this film. It was very good.<br /><br />I highly reccomend it for a smile time.
