Under the Sand was a haunting, touching movie. Charlotte Rampling was excellent as the denying, grieving wife. I think the film did a good job in examining the effects from the death of a spouse. It is not a young person's movie nor is it a particularly happy movie. It does have an effect on you. I wondered if I would be as strong or as weak as Marie Drillon if placed in a similar situation. The movie invited this introspection and that for me is the hallmark of a good film.
