Twins of Destiny is probably the only show I have ever watched, live to air, each and every week, and been so gripped by that I never missed an episode. Factor in that I was in primary school at the time, and this is something special. I remember being conflicted by the ending - not because it was bad, but because it was so (for me, at that age) adult that I really had to sit down and think about what it meant for all the characters. Now, I can only remember little snippets of the show, and I really wish - like the few other people I've ever met who've seen it - that it was available on DVD. It's a travesty to think of it mouldering away on celluloid somewhere, unwatched and unloved. If the technology and audience exists to put old children's shows like She-Ra and Tintin onto DVD, then surely Twins of Destiny deserves the same treatment.<br /><br />Anyway - this show had a profound impact on me as a kid, and I absolutely loved it. I'd love to recommend it to people, but seeing as how it's next to impossible to lay hands on, I'll have to settle with pleading quietly for its re-release.
