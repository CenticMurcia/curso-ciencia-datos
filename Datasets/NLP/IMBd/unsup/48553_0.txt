This movie was one of Australia's 'attempts' at making a horror movie, Peter Jackson-style, but instead turned out a turkey that went straight-to-video.<br /><br />The plot, (if you could call it that) is simple. A company manufacturing a 'health' drink in powder form decide to distribute it amongst a group of residents living in a cul-de-sac. Little do they know that anyone who consumes the 'health' drink end up mutating and dying in revolting ways that try to be humorous, but instead makes the audience groan in disbelief. This movie treads in the 'been-there-done-that' territory.<br /><br />All the 'characters' are as usual, Aussie stereotypes played way over the top by renowned Australian TV stars, such as Lisa McCune (of "Blue Healers"). One ridiculous storyline has a pair of young men ending up on a farm as captives by a group of mutated hicks. We even get to see the horny guy trying to hit on the big ugly sister which is really revolting.<br /><br />The deaths themselves are quite ludicrous. One woman has her tongue swell up she chokes to death. Another woman gives birth to a mutant baby that crawls around the room like one of the 'face-huggers' from the Aliens series. One man's face literally 'melts' off. All of this is either supposed to make you laugh or cringe. Instead, you will find yourself rolling your eyes at how incredibly foolish you were to either rent this movie or watch it on Cable.<br /><br />Give this movie a miss - there's nothing here to root for.
