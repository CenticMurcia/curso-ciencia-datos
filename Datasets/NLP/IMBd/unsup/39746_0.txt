Chevy Chase plays Andy Farmer, a frustrated writer, who moves with his wife, Elizabeth, to a farm in Vermont. Nothing seems to go the way the couple expected. The Farmer's bribe the township into creating a Norman Rockwell persona in order to sell the farm and return to New York.<br /><br />This movie is more stupid than funny. Pathetic jokes that keep falling flat and missing their mark. Jay Cronley's novel was done a disservice. Madolyn Smith-Osborne holds her own with what she has to work with. This is no where near the caliber of Chase's "vacation" movies.
