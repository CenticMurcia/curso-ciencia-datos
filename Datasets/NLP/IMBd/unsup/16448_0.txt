After seeing the Film ARC at the Indie Gathering in Ohio, I'm convinced that I'm in the right profession. This is the first time I have ever commented on a film at IMDb.com... and let me tell you... God Damn Amazing.<br /><br />Robert Gunnerson, I applaud you. This is your first feature film and you stole the show. Passionate and Raw. Dark and humorous. One man's journey to claw his way out of the self-loathing, drug induced, pathetically convenient Pit he fell into. I was more involved in watching ARC than Lord of The Rings or X-Men. The beautifully framed shots and artistic use of spot coloring make it impossible to keep from losing yourself in the film.<br /><br />I'm glad I had a chance to see it, and it was great talking to you about it. For anyone that hasn't seen this Movie... GO SEE IT! Pay huge money to have Rob send you a copy! Do Whatever it takes to see this film! YOU MUST SEE IT!<br /><br />Independent film at it's finest!
