This show is different, thats for sure. It lacks the slap stick humor your used to when watching a cartoon. And you have to actually watch the show to understand it. Typical cartoons jump from scene to scene without really relating to one another. Don't turn it on in the middle of the show and expect to enjoy it like you would a Family Guy because you will have no idea what Tim is talking about. Its on HBO and it is only 30 min long with two 15 min sketches, so it's easy to miss a lot. So do yourself a favor and watch it from the start.<br /><br />Tim always seems to find himself in awkward scenarios. Usually because he puts his foot in his mouth. He has good intentions and is a smart guy but is always surrounded by stupid people who misinterpret him.<br /><br />Don't expect too much from this show visually. The art looks like it came straight out of a comic strip. I won't say this show is for smart people, but it definitely calls for a different type of sense of humor. It's no Simpsons, but it's not trying to be.
