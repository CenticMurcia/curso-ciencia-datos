Screen writer-director John Hughes has aimed his sights once again at the easily pleased young audiences, and it is surely the only target he is likely to strike with this rather misfired teen comedy.<br /><br />Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, two Hughes regulars, star in this Cinderella story about a sixteen year old birthday girl whose parents have forgotten her special day because of her older sister's imminent wedding, and whose dream man doesn't even know she exists. And to make matters worse, poor little Sam Baker (Ringwald) is being vigorously pursued by the king of the school geeks (Hall). Unlike the dramatically sound 1985 hit "The Breakfast Club", both Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall fail to entertain whilst Hughes' flat and predictable script struggles to make us laugh, as it mostly resorts to tasteless or weak sex jokes and cheap shots. The funniest scene in fact would have to be at the church near the end of the film when Sammy's rather heavily sedated sister attempts to walk down the aisle with daddy.<br /><br />Otherwise "Sixteen Candles" is a disappointment from John Hughes and hardly a creditable teen flick.<br /><br />Saturday, August 20, 1994 - T.V.
