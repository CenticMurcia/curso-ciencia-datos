I don't know why this film has such low ratings. If you see this on the front page click through and read the reviews. Then you'll see what a good film this is.<br /><br />As the title foretells this is four short stories. They are a mix of horror and psychological thriller. Nicely sequenced and told. There are not special effects. The budget is low. The direction and acting could be better but is still not bad. But the end result is good. Personally I think most people don't get this movie (and hence rate it lower than they should) is because the endings are not pat like most Hollywood shows. They leave a lot to the imagination and things are not wrapped up with respect to where the characters involved stand.
