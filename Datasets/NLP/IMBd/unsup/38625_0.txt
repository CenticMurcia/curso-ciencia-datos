In 2004, I went to Anime Weekend Atlanta. At the convention, Cartoon Network was having a panel on some of the new shows coming out, like IGPX and Tom Goes to the Mayor. To quote mc chris (who was a programming director for Adult Swim) "This is one of the funniest things we've ever seen." So when the show premiered, I watched it. I gave it 3 episodes to not completely suck...and wanted to drive to Williams St. to beat up the entire comedy staff at Adult Swim. Then came this flaming pile.<br /><br />Look, maybe I don't get it. Maybe it's so funny that it isn't funny. Or maybe not.<br /><br />It's terrible. How they get people like David Cross, Tenacious D, and various other celebs to do the shows is beyond me. Check the AS message boards and you'll see what I mean. This show is not "avante-garde", it's not "Kaufman-esqe", it's just a joke. It's Tim and Eric's joke on anyone who watches it, and they're laughing. The only good part of this show is the cute busty girl in the episode "Abstinence", and as soon as the faux-porn set-up ends, the shows goes back to a huge vacuous waste of time.
