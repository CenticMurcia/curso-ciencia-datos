I learned a lot watching Reefer Madness (AKA Teach Your Children...hey did you know that the CSN song "Teach Your Children" is also also known as "Reefer Madness?" Small world, huh?). Amongst the points I learned, marijuana is a dangerous narcotic (actually narcotics are specific type of drug that includes opiates...oh well). Also, it can produce fits of horrible violence, and near incurable insanity. It's a good thing I don't do drugs, but even if I did this movie would have scared me straight.<br /><br />I hear conflicting reports whether this movie was made as propaganda, or simply as a piece of trash meant to cash in on 1930s drug paranoia. Either way, it's a pretty inaccurate and humourous look at the effects of marijuana on some rather dumb teenagers. <br /><br />Besides the rather loose and fast rules about drugs (Calling marijuana more dangerous than heroin for example), the producers also tend to have difficulty with things like suspense and continuity.<br /><br />Perhaps the film was actually presenting that of an alternate reality, one in which marijuana really can drive a person nuts, not to the refrigerator. That would explain a few of the gaffes in the film, like the time when the car runs over the human at top speed, leaving neither the car nor the human with any visible physical injury. Or the time when a character is shot from across the room (in the back) by two men struggling on the ground with the gun. Even the Warren Comission wouldn't have bought that trajectory. And my very favorite moment of the film, when a woman leaps out of a high window, the old woman she's walking with has to run to the window and look down before reacting in horror. Cause, you know, she might have landed on a flag pole or something.<br /><br />Then again, maybe this wasn't an alternate reality. Maybe the filmmakers were the ones all hopped up and they decided to goof around with the camera for 70 odd minutes. In any event, "Reefer Madness" will definitely teach your children that it is made by people who clearly had very little information on their subject, or how to make a good movie.
