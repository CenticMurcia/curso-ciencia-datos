Ok, here it is: the plot: Father Tyrone. An ex-street-thug, now turned priest, is the main suspect in a murdercase, in which a girl gets killed by a mad painter. The police can't find any other suspects, and Father Tyrone is in trouble. He then tries to solve the case all by himself, and the police follow him around.<br /><br />Fun to see Dourif as the main character, and even as a genuine good guy!.. And some of the paintings were quite good actually, but I got bored of seeing too many frontally nude strippers, which I thought spoiled the movie a bit.. but it is worth watching, if you like art and/or Dourif kicking ass!
