I loved the story told in the TV series and felt each of the characters was interesting and believable. Sam Loggin was a super Lucy! I thought Gus was suitably sleazy, and Daniel was a decent guy with his true qualities not evident at first. The 3 girls at Lucy's flat were each definite characters with good story lines of their own and their interactions reminded me of some of my experiences with a roommate. The office life portrayed was realistic and very funny! Each character was a clear individual and well-portrayed by the actors. I saw the show before I read the book so for me this show IS Lucy Sullivan. I read the book afterward and noted a number of differences from the TV show but felt the show still stands as a brilliant entertainment in its own right. It remains one of my favourite TV series and I'd love to watch it again if someone airs it again or if it comes out on DVD.
