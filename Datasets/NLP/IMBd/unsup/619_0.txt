As a mother who has lost a child, I think DOOL's portrayal of Hope's and Bo's grief and anger was very realistic. I've been a fan of Days since the late 70's. Some story lines and actors are better than others but on the whole is is engaging and often deals with current issues. Frequently though, the story lines drag and are plots are repeated. There could be less of the cutesy early 20 somethings, and more middle-aged characters. I don't think there's one ugly man on the show and the women are all gorgeous. Bringing back Steve and Kayla is really fascinating to me and a great idea. Steve Johnson and his love Kayla were like the "Beauty and the Beast"; it was one of the best love stories on daytime TV. May Hope be carrying Bo's baby...although I don't know how old she is supposed to be. May Sami get what's coming to her...LUCAS. May Jack live forever!
