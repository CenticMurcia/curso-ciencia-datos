I believe the writers of this film started off knowing that they wanted some boob shots and a "sex scene" at a cheerleader camp and then wrote a "horror" plot around it. <br /><br />We rented it just because we saw that Leif Garrett was one of the stars -- and he's just as believable as a horny high schooler as the fact that you will never guess who the killer is! The cheerleaders spend more time swimming and laying out in the sun than practicing their cheers (although Garrett's rap was bad enough that I only needed to hear him practice it once) and the main character Alison wonders around into creepy shacks in the woods looking for soda.<br /><br />Of course, like most horror films, the characters are stupid, but the sheer idiocy these "cheerleaders" display will make you laugh out loud. The gore is silly unless getting your wrists slashed by pom-poms frightens you. Finally, undoubtedly, the hysterical pep-rally-like "sex scene" is what makes this movie worth seeing. If you're looking for a scare, pass this one up, but check it out if you and your friends are looking for a funny slasher flick that is nothing but pure cheese.
