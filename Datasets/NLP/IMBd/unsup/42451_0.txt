When I walked into the theatres to see this movie I was not expecting much, but, Wow, what a piece of crap!<br /><br />This movie does in no way meet the high standards set by the other Bond movies. Some say that it is still a good action flick, but hey, which movie did those people watch? Well, I suppose not this movie, or they've maybe fallen asleep during those awfully boring poker scenes. That would explain how some say, that it could go through as a "good" action movie. Because if you cut out that poker crap, you really have some decent action here, but those fifteen minutes can't help the movie.<br /><br />So, in order to help those fans, that still want to see the movie, to save some money, I'll round up the story now:<br /><br />Bond kills one guy in a loo, then kills another guy in an office.<br /><br />Music.<br /><br />Bond kills a terrorist after chasing him. (Until now roughly ten minutes have passed)<br /><br />Bond plays Poker, and does some advertising for SONY, OMEGA and FORD. (Now there are only 20 minutes to the end)<br /><br />The bad guy captures Bond and his Lady, tortures him and gets killed by another bad guy that has not yet been introduced to us.<br /><br />Bond awakes in a hospital, travels to Venice with his girl. A house collapses, she gets killed and Bond kills the other bad guy that inexplicably seems to be the mastermind.<br /><br />An I paid money for that!
