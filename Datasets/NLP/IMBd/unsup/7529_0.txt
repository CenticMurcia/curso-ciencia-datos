<br /><br /> Quite simply the greatest Made for Television adaptation of a comedy ever! Robards delivers one of his greatest performances ever. He was born to play loveable,blunt and carefree Grandpa Vanderhoff. his timing,delivery and facial expressions are those of an expert comedian. George Rose shines as the Russian Choreographer.Rose was one of the last great "music hall" style comedians and This role along with his Major General in "PIRATES OF PENZANCE" have given the general public a record of his great gifts for all posterity. Hart and Kaufmann's Play has held up remarkably over the years and Director Rabb has created a loving homage to 1930s theatrical comedy, and to this particular play in general. Avoid Frank Capra's 1936 film version it is nothing like the play. if you can find this gem ( I did for 9 dollars at a local Kmart) purchase it on the spot!
