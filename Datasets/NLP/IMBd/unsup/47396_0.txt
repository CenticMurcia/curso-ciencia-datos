I couldn't tell what was supposed to be the point of "One Night Stand". So there was a bunch of stuff about interracial relationships. Many other movies have done a much better job with that stuff. How could Mike Figgis, after creating a masterpiece like "Leaving Las Vegas" create something so disjointed with this movie? It wastes Wesley Snipes, Nastassja Kinski, Kyle MacLachlan, Ming-Na, Robert Downey Jr and John Ratzenberger on complete nonsense. If this movie has any redeeming qualities, it's that it gave Thomas Haden Church an early starring role, paving the way for him to star in "Sideways".<br /><br />So, in conclusion, Wesley Snipes's character says that anything's better than LA. I, for one, would rather choke on LA's smog than have to watch this movie again.
