I believe this was the worst movie I had ever seen in my life. Freddie Prinze, what were you thinking!?!?!? I wont reommend this to anyone. I almost cried because I had to sit through it in the theaters. On top of it all the two characters, aren't believeble lovers. There was no chemisttry whatsoever. WARNING! Do Not See This Movie. I gave it a 1 b/c there is no 0. It doesn't even deserve a 0!
