The star of this show is the hotel, it is a awesome and atmospheric set piece.<br /><br />The acting is fairly average, which is fine for a movie like this. The direction is strong and the camera work good. The story is a remake of an older movie that i have not seen.Basic story: A being/man is killing people to feed off of them in some evil ritual that keeps him alive. The death seems are a blast, reasonable gory and full of jumps. I have not had this many jumps in a movie in a long time, makes these fun to watch.<br /><br />All in all a great bargain bin movie or 2.00 rental.
