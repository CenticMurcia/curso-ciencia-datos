Longford was a bit of a twit wasn't he? Or at least in this movie, no? He's made to say: "She has enriched my Spiritual Life" and "No matter how evil (one is), one can be redeemed." Oh really? By whom, one may ask? Isn't that someone else's job? Lady Longford is made to say (shaken to her core): "I had no idea (about prison conditions)". It reminds me of 19th century upper-class mad house viewing but modernized for progressives. Its really about their own feelings. The kids? The real victims? Oh, yeah. Well, whatever . . .<br /><br />We have people like Longford in the States. They are called ACLU lawyers and they are definitely not trying to find God through slumming. There's a French phrase for this, three words that begin with NdB, but I can't get IMDb to accept.<br /><br />I did like the camera work and thought the acting superb. Cheers, everyone.
