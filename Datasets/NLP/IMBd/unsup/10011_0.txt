I've rarely been impressed by the Cinerama style of film-making. While I'm sure that the gigantic scope and vivid color made for a great experience at the time, it often doesn't stand up today. "Love Me or Leave Me" is one of the few such films of real quality, due in no small part to the presence of James Cagney and Doris Day. Few have seen any of Doris Day's dramatic efforts. After all, this is only one of a handful of dramas she made (others including "The Man Who Knew Too Much", "Young Man with a Horn", and "Storm Warning"). James Cagney is most impressive in an almost standard role (for him), but covers an interesting level of emotion.<br /><br />In the end, it's a very interesting and entertaining spectacle. Charles Vidor's direction, though rather static, is fantastic and showcases his stars well.<br /><br />7.5 out of 10
