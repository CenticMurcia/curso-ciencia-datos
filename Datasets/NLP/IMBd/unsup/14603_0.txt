For the most part, the movie was okay. Mimic 1 was much better, but for a sequel to a fairly cheezy horror flick, this was alright. The chick in it is fairly hot, and the director capitalizes on this several times. The science part of the film is pretty good for the most part.<br /><br />My main problems come from the ending: 1) So the bug is in love with her? WTF? They spend so much time in the two Mimic films explaining how these are genetic super-insects, who are programmed by nature to hunt, blah-blah, and this bug falls in love with a teacher? When it approaches her, and the director is going for this all romantic it shot, I honestly sat straight up and checked to make sure that I hadn't drank too much and had passed out and dreamt up that ending.<br /><br />2) And larvea can heal fatal wounds? Specifically, when a person has multiple impale wounds that go right through her torso? Absolutely retarded.
