this is a good movie...if you want to do the equivalent of burning 4 bucks for a crappy dvd. my god, this was bad. i only got 10 min into the movie before the picture went and i just shut it off. here are the bad points:<br /><br />1.) The plot does seem interesting, but it doesn't work the least bit. If you can relate to even one character, you need help. 2.) What the hell is up with the makeup? Was this filmed on halloween? 3.) What bad acting. Were they stoned for real? 4.) Bad quality. this isn't low-budget, its NO-budget. 5.) No plot. At all. 6.) Impossible to follow. 7.) The most unrealistic ANYTHING i've ever seen.<br /><br />My all time worst movie. Do NOT rent unless insane.
