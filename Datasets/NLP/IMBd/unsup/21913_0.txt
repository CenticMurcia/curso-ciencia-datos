I would definitely rent this one before I seriously considered buying it. I had read some of Leonard Elmore's western stories and seen some of the movie's of his books that's why I wanted to see it. And off course I was familiar with Burt Lancaster (Birdman of Alcatraz), No comparison by the way. So I had some expectations of it might being pretty good. Well it just wasn't, Lancaster is trying to play a Mexican and is accent is down right comical. If he just would have used is own it might have made it a little better to swallow. As for the story it's about revenge, and one's honor, but it was just way to short and I thought the very ending was disappointing, no Gun fight or even a struggle. It wasn't a horrible movie just not a keeper in my opinion. Maybe you'll find it to be funny, when you watch a movie that's so bad that it's funny? 4 stars for effort
