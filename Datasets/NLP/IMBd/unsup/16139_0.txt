If you read the book, it's really not a spoof. Justa funny dog movie where the dog is more human then dog and nobody seems to notice. I loved the movie and book. This is a great family movie, especially for those with younger kids, although it has many scenes more older kids and adults would understand. it was a GREAT movie. I don't want to spoil anything so i don't know what else to really say. the movie is a great movie for a cold day when you want to light the fire and watch a movie with the family or if there are many kids around for a party or something and you want to quiet them down. They will start to watch it and forget everything else (check on them to make sure they remember to breath) :)
