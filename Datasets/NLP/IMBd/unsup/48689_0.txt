Despite the title, this movie really has no similarity to the TV show WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE. In fact, it's an incredibly violent and mind-rotting piece of garbage without a single interesting moment. I remember when a co-worker rented this piece of &*@@!*$ when we were both doing an overnight shift at the hospital. He thought it was pretty cool, but everyone else there just was horrified by how violent and stupid the movie was. There didn't seem to be much plot--just Gene Simmons killing a lot of people and the good guy(?) Rutger Hauer doing the same in the name of law and order! And, in the end, we were treated with one of the most gratuitous and violent endings, when he shoved a hang grenade in Simmons' mouth and pulled the pin. I just wish the pin had been pulled a lot sooner and ended this mess! <br /><br />This movie should be of interest only to psychotics and sociopaths--all others, steer clear at all costs. This is exactly the sort of film that demeans our society and desensitizes us to evil. Don't watch this film!<br /><br />PS--Instead of Gene Simmons from KISS, using the actress Jean Simmons might have made this movie a lot more interesting! She could do more than just make evil leers, so she couldn't help but improve the part.
