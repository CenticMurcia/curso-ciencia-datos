OK, I've seen some doosies in my time, but this one is pretty bad. Continuity is apparently a foreign concept to this writer/director duo. I understood "The Wall" and "Pulp Fiction" right off the hop. Discontinuity was a good tool used in an expert fashion in both those films. This movie however just seems to have randomly placed cuts in which the DVD seems to be faulty and just randomly skips ahead. <br /><br />The characters have zero depth. You might as well entertain yourself with sock puppets, you'll get more out of it. We spend time with one actor in the finale as he cries over the loss of his son. I had to ask myself, where did he come from and did the camera even land on his son once? Why the play to feel for him? There's no attachment here... just very poor acting. <br /><br />The good stuff... hmm...Let me see:<br /><br />Well, I didn't pay to watch it. I stuck it out to the end just to see how bad it would be. <br /><br />Perhaps if the story was written by a different writer and was spread out over a few good novels, it would be decent.... but it isn't. <br /><br />Just avoid this one folks, this is fair warning. If you're looking for little known good science fiction you haven't already seen, try "The Quiet Earth" instead.
