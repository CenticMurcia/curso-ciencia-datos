Definitely a rare and wonderful find for a movie which includes a cast of REAL (instead of hired hearing-actor-pretending-as-a-deaf-person actors that you see sometimes in films!) deaf actors in the movie world nowadays.... <br /><br />Also, it's a bigger plus when you consider the directional approach chosen for this film -- it's an appreciative success.
