-the plot here which has been stolen from EVERY action movie ever made consists of a planned hit on the president's life or something like that and since no one else can stop the masterminds behind it only XXX can save the day. man with a winning story like that what could possibly go wrong. i mean it's not like the public ever get sick of seeing loud generic movies that wastes everyone's time<br /><br />-the biggest drawback with this movie is just how unoriginal everything is, there is literally not a single shred of originality in the movie. Every line, every frame, every editing technique, every musical cue, every costume, every joke, and pretty much everything about the movie has been done before and a lot better in other movies but a movie being clich√© is bad if it knows how to do it right which this movie doesn't. Ice Cube has no place what so ever in a big budget action movie. watching him fire a gun and try to beat up a person looks so fake and so rehearsed that it makes it impossible to enjoy whatever action scene he's in. plus he doesn't have that tough badass action aura that Schwarzenegger or even Vin Diesel have. When he gives a mean mug to the camera he looks like he's taking a dump rather than looking tough. The movie can also be looked on as promoting an unhealthy stereotype of the goofy white guy that knows nothing because the token comic relief in the movie is a white guy that's always out of whack. Wilem Dafoe needs to fire his agent super fast because the man has played way too many bad guys. He's an amazing actor as he's proved in the past so he should be able to do more than play the villain in some bulls**t PG-13 action movie. <br /><br />-the first XXX wasn't that good in the first place and this sequel is a lot worse than that. I really hope there isn't another one and judging by how well it did I'm guessing there won't be another one
