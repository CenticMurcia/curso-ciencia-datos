When you look through a binocular you see one image... not two! And this film got it right!<br /><br />Hollywood can't even get this simple fact right and it annoys me immensely. The annoying thing is that directors can get access to so much money and are not intelligent enough to get it right. If they spend a hundred dollars more they could buy a consultant to tell them things like that! But the directors are too dumb! Amazing.<br /><br />So a big HOORAY for The Fourth War!! The ONLY other film I remember that avoids this Hollywood dumb clich√© is The Bridge On The River Kwai.<br /><br />And that's not all folks. The Fourth War lets the Russians speak Russian. I'm close to tears with enthusiasm! In the Hollywood world where Germans, Russians, Chinese and every alien from outer space speaks American this is groundbreaking. I know that most Americans are too dumb to read subtitles (or rather Hollywood think they are) but it renders authenticity in wast amounts to a movie.<br /><br />The ridiculous script is totally forgiven on these two grounds!!
