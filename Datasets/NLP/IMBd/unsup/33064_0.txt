I'm not much for writing long winded reviews so I'll keep it simple. This film was disappointing. <br /><br />You know how you grab pick up a pizza and once you're home with it you get the toppings that you never ordered,you know the ones that you avoid? Well thats this film in a nut shell. I like good horror like the next guy,I don't ask for a whole lot but I do expect a decent film to keep me entertained for 90 minutes. The cover on this movie had a zombie rising from the grave,but in reality you'll get no more than 2 minutes of that,mixed with a dull story that drags on and on. <br /><br />See this film plays out more like a mystery about a priest who walked away from God to choose a higher power,that being to rise from the dead. I won't go any further but let's just say the plot sounds better than the results of this film,just avoid it if you can. Btw-there's hard;y any gore in this film,hey that sometimes can save even some of the worst films out there but we don't even get that in this wannabe zombie film. Simply put,write this one down and remember to stay away from it. Some of the folks who give this film a decent score are either delusional or don't know what a good scary horror film is. This is like a slow paced mystery without the suspense and story to play itself out as anything worth viewing. Hope that helps you out,I just wish I had read a few warnings before viewing this lemon,he he.
