I'm not going to argue with anyone else. This has "fortnight old turkey, should have been chucked in the bin after Christmas", writ large upon it.<br /><br />Ice and Costas have worked a lot together. They're obviously mates, the fight scenes are laughable. The only reasoning I can see behind why they would want to be involved in this, is that the gas bill must have been pressing again.<br /><br />They are both capable of much, much better.<br /><br />C'mon boys, don't do this kind of thing again. Please. Pretty please!
