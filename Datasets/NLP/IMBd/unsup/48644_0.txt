I sure got suckered into wasting time and money to see this turkey. If you like the Arnold Schwarzenegger genre of movies you would like this one. Russell Crowe plays Arnold. It's full of violence, cruelty, lies, treachery, profanity, sex and, worst of all, improbability. The good guys can't even deter the bad guys with a Gatling gun but one lone Mexican sharpshooter shooting from "miles" away, fells the good guys. When the bad guys see the good guys with a Gatling Gun they just laugh because they know the good guys can't hit the broadside of a barn with anything. The good guys can't even hit a horse with their Gatling Gun! And Ben Wade, the toughest, smartest, most ruthless outlaw of all times, remains in town, in a hotel room with a girl, with his horse tied up outside the bar until the Sheriff and his men ride back into town and easily take him into custody. (He has to be taken into custody early on in the movie in order to start this parody of getting him on the 3:10 to Yuma!) In one scene, toward the end, the gang offers the townspeople a $200 per person bounty on the Sheriff and each of the good guys and the townspeople go crazy in their desire to make $200 or more. And, in the end, Ben Wade, who, himself, or through his gang, has dispatched everybody who matters to their eternal rewards, is so impressed with the truth and courage of the opposition, that he voluntarily gets on the train to go back to the Yuma Prison for his third time and, most likely, to a date with the hangman. And then along the way there's some mention of the Bible, some Bible verses, and then some sort of cross or crucifix on Ben's gun handle. Yep, it's SOME movie. Recommend it to your friends who may have steered you to a similarly stupid flick or some friends that you would like to hear less from.
