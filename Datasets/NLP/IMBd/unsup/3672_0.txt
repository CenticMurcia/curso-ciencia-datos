Do you remember "Before Sunrise", with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy?<br /><br />If you do, the general premise of this movie goes more or less like this: It's "Before Sunrise", but instead of Vienna you get a motel room, and lots of steamy sex.<br /><br />It's quite simple, really. Daniela (Lewin) and Bruno (Valenzuela) meet at a party, and end up in a motel. And they have sex.<br /><br />While I certainly can't complain about the sex scenes, the interesting part of the movie is what happens after (Or, uh, in between) them. <br /><br />From being two total strangers having sex at first (They can't even remember each other's names!), they end up revealing themselves, their lives, their fears, and all that jazz.<br /><br />The talk starts sloppily at first, but soon they get all the big topics covered. Past relationships, religion, fate, sex, 80's cartoons, death, etc. <br /><br />It's somewhat tender and ironic, too, when you notice that, in the end, they're trying to seduce each other in a very childish and innocent way when they have already spent three condoms and about half an hour doin' it.<br /><br />The dialog flows really good and it's very well paced. The acting is superb. Valenzuela is known around these lands for being somewhat of a expression-less actor, but he achieves a good performance.<br /><br />Blanca Lewin is, however, the one that steals the film, in my opinion. I've always been her fan, so perhaps I'm a bit biased when saying this, but you're completely captivated by her character. As Daniela starts revealing herself, all the way to the (shocking!) revelation in the end, (Well, not that shocking, really) you just can't turn your head away from her.<br /><br />So, really good writing, high doses of eroticism, acting that's not only above-par but a hole-in-one (or whatever better than that, I'm not much of a golf person), good directing and Blanca Lewin. What else can you ask for in a movie? Okay, maybe explosions and ninjas, and this film doesn't have those two, but it's pretty much covered in all of the remaining categories.<br /><br />It gets a 9 because the ending comes out as a little bit too abrupt, in my opinion. But then again, 90 minutes seems to be just the right time.
