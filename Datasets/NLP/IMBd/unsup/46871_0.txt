SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE just doesn't live up to its sensational title. Films like SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE and this one have pretty much turned the word "massacre" into a joke. Except for the two first Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE films, if there's a movie with the word "massacre" in its title, it's gonna suck. And this one is no exception.<br /><br />Bland setting, stupid story, bad acting from plain actors, and tons of continuity errors make SHM barely watchable. The idea of student returning to the same house where her family was killed when she was young (with the student having a psychic bond with the killer) is simply too stupid for words, so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />What's remarkable is the fact that they actually made a couple of sequels. I just can't believe it. And I won't be watching them. There's nothing remotely interesting about SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE.
