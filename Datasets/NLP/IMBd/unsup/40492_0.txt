I have to disagree with Emma Burridge, except for her statement that it is on a par with On the Buses as an example of 1970's comedy. The 1970's are almost certainly the worst years of British comedy - we had such "greats" as Love thy Neighbour, George and Mildred and Robin's Nest - the story lines and (supposed) humour of which were not only obvious and transparent but very shallow and unsophisticated. That is to say that they cannot cause even a ripple of mirth now, and it surprises me that they would have done when they were filmed. I do think that there were some good comedies in the 1970's, though, and these include Dad's Army (although after James Beck's death these were considerably weaker, relying on slapstick from Clive Dunn and to a lesser extent Arthur Lowe) but of course, this was really a 2060's comedy; altogether a different era of quality. As for the "Confessions" films, not one of them should raise a laugh at any stage, and it really does seem barely credible that standards of decency and morality have dropped so far that most people nowadays would find it hard to credit that these were X rated films when they were made.
