"House by the Cemetery" is one of the weaker movies I have seen from Lucio Fulci. It has a weak, unconvincing story that seems to rush by at an unsatisfying fast pace, leaving us humble viewers with nothing even remotely pleasing or memorable. It is about a family who moves into a creepy house that is haunted - not by a ghost - but by a psychotic killer who inhabits the basement. He kills some unsuspecting visitors to the house, who happen to wander in as well as the eerie babysitter. All of the death scenes are very weak and poorly presented, which is surprising for a Fulci film. The ending seems to make an attempt at some suspense, but fails along with the rest of the movie. I must say, with all the disappointments this movie threw at me, I did like the gloomy look to the film as well as the house which deserved a little more attention considering how creepy it was. This is not at all a good movie, but you can't get it right every time - can you Fulci?
