This is a great show. I always somehow manage to laugh my bag off whenever it was on. It's from Matt Groening man! It's got to be hilarious. I may sound a little one sided here, but I find this show to be better than "The Simpsons" in some ways. While Simpsons humor is starting to dry up, Futurama manages to stay fresh and new. I just wish they would keep it on the air. Great show!
