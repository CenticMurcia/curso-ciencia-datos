Rather than waste your time and mine pointing out which similarities this show has with everything else that came before it, I'm going to tell you to watch it.<br /><br />I'm also gonna say, if you like The Office (british or American), you may or may not like this show. To draw your opinions from whether or not a show is similar to another, and to formulate your entire critique based on that rationale, is lazy and paltry.<br /><br />Yes, the main character has likenesses to the boss Steve Carell plays on The Office, being that they're both trying to be funny, likable bosses and they're both men. <br /><br />Yes, there are other characters on the show too, just like in The Office. On both shows, it's a mix of men and women... a few different races, as well. <br /><br />Rest assured, this show is exactly like The Office because they both take place in a grocery store. Wait, no they don't.<br /><br />Okay, if you're gonna split hairs every time you sit down to watch TV, you might as well hide the remote for good. This show is nothing like the Office, other than they both have silly bosses who are trying to be liked by their employees.<br /><br />Something everyone can relate to... so i'm sure we can deal with more than one show depicting someone in that role.<br /><br />This show is something you need to Tivo to watch multiple times, as there are things that get funnier the second time around. The characters blend well together and the central driving story of 'screw-up son inherits dead father's grocery store and is being outdone by huge conglomerate' often leads to riotous outcomes.<br /><br />I'm sure if this show were on one of the more major networks, it'd be taken more seriously.<br /><br />God forbid we like something on TBS, right?
