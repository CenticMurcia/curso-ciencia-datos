This is probably one of Alfred Hitchcock's worst films. He would certainly redeem himself the following year with the classic "North by Northwest."<br /><br />Other than breathtaking cinematography of the French Riviera, this film really has little to offer. <br /><br />It is said that Cary Grant came out of retirement to make this. Thank the lord that he didn't resume retirement after it.<br /><br />It's basically the story of someone copying the cat burglar techniques of former cat burglar John Robie (Grant.) There are chase scenes throughout the Riviera but the film is dull. We really reach the point where we don't care who the guilty party is.<br /><br />As in the fabulous "North by Northwest," there is an exciting climatic scene but even that fails to realize the emotions needed.<br /><br />Grant gives a fairly good performance but is hampered by the written material. Grace Kelly was still probably with a swell-head for her undeserved Oscar win, the year before, for "The Country Girl." The part of a rich, snobby, girl in the fast lane was good for her but she fails to capitalize on it. Her mother, Jesse Royce Landis, has some scene stealing scenes. Note that Landis appeared the following year in "North by Northwest" as Grant's mom.
