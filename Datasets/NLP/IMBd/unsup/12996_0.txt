Candyman is an elegant little gem of a horror film, combining the best elements of the Clive Barker story it's drawn from with the imaginings of the director/writer of the film.<br /><br />Starring Virginia Madsen, who is at her absolute best in this film, which is reason enough to see it in my opinion, Candyman tells a wonderfully dark tale of love, death and revenge. This is brilliantly set against mirrored worlds in Chicago, Virginia Madsen's character's posh upscale condo and its twin, the project Cabrini Green. There is much going on within this film, beyond just the surface tale of horror, as there is in any good horror film. It's a morality play, a story about how we deal, or rather don't deal, with race relations, and a really beautifully twisted love story as well, as all of Barker's works are.<br /><br />If you've never had a chance to see this wonderful film, please give it a chance. Tony Todd's voice will tingle your spine, there's enough gore for slasher film addicts to keep interested, but don't let that blind you to the smart, elegantly crafted story underneath. This is one 'Candy' that only gets sweeter with each repeated viewing.
