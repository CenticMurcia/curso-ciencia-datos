OK, so its not the shiznits. Its just funny. I give it a 10 because: 1. Jim Howell from Michigan can't like it because it failed to be "an examination of the racial issues pervasive in our society". What the @$&*! are you talking bout Jim. They learn you that stuff in film school, Jim? 2. Bo Derek. 3. Kumar. 4. SOme other guy says its only for rappers or J Kennedy fans. Huh? I never heard of JK before & I hate rap/hip-hop/etc. Get real. It is for people who know how to laugh at other people. 5. Its not for people who take themselves soooooooooooooo seriously. You still there Jim? Go give a "10" to some poorly-made film about deep-thoughts. 6. JK was OK, but A Anderson and T Diggs were great. Shondra, who I think is the girl from Scary Movie, was good & so was R Oneill. As for Bo? Oh yeah!
