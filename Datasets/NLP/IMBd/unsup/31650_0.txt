Well its about time the Philippines made a movie and not stick to the old American formula, of the illness of the week syndrome.<br /><br />This film did not shock you every few minutes, or give you eccentric characters. It went at a pace where life just goes on. We were shown the life in the village and the people living there.<br /><br />I would of liked to see the reasons the older brother did not like school, and a bit more of Magnificoes friend, but overall it was a good film. Like Milan, the powers that be are thinking about the story a bit more. In the past Filipino films have been guilty of getting a thin story and stretching it for the film star. For example, do we have a role where Sharon Cuneta can cry? Ther was not a bad performance in the whole film, the father with his Rubic's cube, the mother with her pain, the grandmother who just wants to be a grandmother, and Magnifico who just wants to be a...boy.
