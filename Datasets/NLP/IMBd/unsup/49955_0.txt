I've never seen a more obviously stupid TV show that insults the viewers intelligence more than this one. (But there are probably a lot of contenders out there.) The judges are hams, led by Mr. Cheese Fest himself David Hasselhoff, and rounded out by everyone's favorite biyach - Sharon Osborne. The British judge is another nobody, and the black stage hand gives out the oldest and worst reused one liners in comedic lore. "This is crazytown and that guy's the mayor." AAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! Obviously the really bad contestants are placements or fillers. Nobody is that stupid to believe these lame acts are serious. (Or are there wrestling fans out there?) There is some talent in the mix of stupid acts and serious acts no doubt, but wading through the imbeciles is not my idea of entertainment. It's insulting to think that the producers actually believe that the audience falls for this.<br /><br />I saw all of this in the 70's with The Gong Show which was fresher and funnier. This remake gets a 1 out of 10. I got up to write this review after the first 10 minutes of the July 7th show and I'll never watch this show again. Skip this if you have a higher IQ than a fern. Fans - you're a bunch of morons.
