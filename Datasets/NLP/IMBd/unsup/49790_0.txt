Well basically the premise for the film itself does not bode well really. Genetically modified hounds? I think I can see what's going to happen. Oh s**t lovers! And rain! Would more would I need to know there's dark times ahead? S**T DON'T GO HUNTING AND TALK ABOUT DOGS! HAVE YOU NOT READ THE BLURB! Is it called blurbs when referring to films? I'm not too sure. Don't bother talking about relationships. Chances are either you or your love interest will die. NIGGA GONNA DIE! Oh creepy shots. Oh noes he is surrounded by the doggies! THE DOGS DON'T WANT YOU HERE. Fair enough, but do they really need to tear him apart? Just send him on his way. I'm sure that would work. F**K YES HE SHOT THE WOMAN WITH AN ARROW. (is shot the right word?) They are genetically modified by giving them rabies that don't kill you? So basically the rage virus from 28 days later but for dogs. A DOG IN THE HOUSE. S**T I DON'T THINK THEY REALISED DOGS CAN SWIM TOO! Back to the house! Should have listened to the brother. He knows where its at. ZIPWIRE IS THE FUTURE THEY SAID. Haha it stopped short. Dogs are an awful enemy. Dolphins would be much better. HOW THE HELL DID THE DOG JUMP ONTO THE ROOF? DOG? IN HOUSE? HOW MANY TIMES? In the attic! (Not) making a porno! S**t you're IN A CAR. There are DOGS running at you. What do you do? DRIVE OFF A CLIFF! (almost) F**K THE DOG IS IN THE WINDOW. The dogs whelps are possibly the best thing about the film. Yep. love interest died. No one cares. NIGGA GONE MISSING. No one cares. On a boat. No one cares. OH S**T THEY HAVE DOG AIDS. THE END. FIN. Bare in mind I stopped writing the s**t that happened at the end. It was awful. Well they did get dog aids at the end. But before that it was simply s**t.
