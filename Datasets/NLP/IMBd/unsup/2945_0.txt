I was pleasantly surprised by this flick. I expected another low-budget bad zombie movie, and what I got was a very good low-budget zombie movie. Once I got past the very cheap zombie makeup, I enjoyed the humor and the frequent nods to the zombie horror genre. Much of the humor in this film will probably play better to people who've lived in the South, but I think it has appeal for many genre fans.<br /><br />"Hide and Creep" is a nice change from the usual crop of poor straight-to-video horror films that have been coming out of the South over the past few years. Unlike some of the terrible works by rather talentless directors such as Jeff Thomas, et al., Hartsell and Shirley's film isn't heavy-handed and full of religious agenda (see "13 Seconds" if you'd like to see what I'm talking about). Despite what was clearly a non-existent budget, the directors here did keep production values in mind to the extent they could afford them. I'd really like to see what they could do with a real budget and hopefully they've gotten one by now because these folks have a shot at doing something great in horror if they're given the chance.<br /><br />Considering that this was Hartsell & Shirley's first film, it's an excellent effort from two people who are obviously fellow horror fans. I hope to see more from them!
