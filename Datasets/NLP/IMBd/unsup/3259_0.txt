Two words: Pod racing. I haven't payed much attention to the end titles of Star Wars Episode I, but there really should be a "thank you Caprino" in there somewhere. Of course that's an entirely different picture, but still the racing scenes are conspicuously similar to the ones in the thirty-some years older Pinchcliffe Grand Prix.<br /><br />Yeah, this film is what makes me proud to be Norwegian. Reading the other comments on this film simply fills me with joy. I see it's hard to find abroad, but I'm sure it's possible to order an English version on the internet, and possibly the latest Caprio Collection DVD set with the ingenious short films that predates this full feature masterpiece.<br /><br />If only the the up and coming Norwegian filmmakers could make something like this... It doesn't even have to be better, so long as it's close. But then again, that's why masterworks are masterworks, and everyone else are mere mortals.
