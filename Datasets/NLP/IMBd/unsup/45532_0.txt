i just don't like this director and his idea of entertainment at no time did i find it funny or worthy of my attention the talent was there but the lines were LSD material dreams means confusing? dreams mean ridiculous? dreams are strange but most have an unconsciousness development. this movie lacked the ability to hold on to its public or to properly show the actors talents. When you loose the viewing audience with boredom, then the talent takes a back seat and no one cares. they simply wait for it to finish or leave the environment.. sad........a woody Allen on crack. save film and stop the madness, Mr director.
