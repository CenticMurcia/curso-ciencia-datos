While it's hard to take Rock Hudson as a stud since he came out of the closet, you won't care...you'll be too distracted by the numerous up-the-skirt shots of the "Pretty Maids" in the movie (where were the parents during the filming of this??), not to mention Angie Dickenson's take on Mrs. Robinson with the virginal creepy kid. Also, it's weird to hear Scotty from Star Trek speaking without his brogue; Telly Savalas playing Kojak (essentially) without a lollipop and "Who Loves Ya, Baby?"; Angie Dickenson (Police Woman) acting all slutty: and some unknown kid actor (I don't think he ever did anything else noteworthy)trying to take this mess seriously. I won't give the ending away, but you'll find it pretty implausible.
