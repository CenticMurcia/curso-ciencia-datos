After over a year, I watched Across The Bridge again, as companion piece to Treasure of the Sierra Madre. I had forgotten some of the twists and turns it takes, but enjoyed it just as much the second time around.<br /><br />My spontaneous reaction at the first time ("Citizen Kane meets Casablanca") still holds. It has the downfall of the rich and powerful man theme, as well as the strandedness under the whim of border bureaucracy. And much more... not to mention the dog.<br /><br />Of course it's dated, but that is no point against an old film. I loved watching it again, and reconfirm that this piece has several topics that I haven't seen in any other film - just to start with the borderline drawn across the bridge. I look forward to watching this again. 9/10.
