SPOILERS<br /><br />Well, I am back to commenting on silent films. After the atrocity known as the Old Maid Having Her Picture Taken I am happily treated to an experimental English film. After I saw this I imagined how the audience back in 1900 were like after they saw this. They must have been freaking out. Then the Great Train Robbery traumatized the audience more. Okay, back to the film. I guess you could call this suspense of 1900, as a stage coach hits the camera. This was a great silent film, and different. <br /><br />Here is the "plot" of How It Feels Like To Be Run Over. This is not really how it feels like to be run over, but still. A stage coach slowly appears on screen. It then is very clear on screen. Then it leaves as quickly as it came. Then another stage coach appears on screen. It becomes clear, but then it changes directions and goes towards the camera. The people in it flail their arms wildly, but it is too late. The stage coach hits the camera. The camera goes blank. Then unreadable words appear on screen quickly.<br /><br />Overall, this is an interesting little silent experimental short. It may be a bit disturbing for audiences back in 1900, but this is not 1900 any more. This also created the infamous thing-hits-camera-and-camera-goes-blank. Well, not really, but this is the first movie ever to do that. The acting was good. You may not be able to see that, but it takes talent to wave your arms. Anyway, this is a surreal silent film that does not really teach you how it is like to get run over.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Recommended Films: Roundhay Garden Scene, Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge, and the Great Train Robbery.
