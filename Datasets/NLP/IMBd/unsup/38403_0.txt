Is this movie a philosophical journey, a love story, or a National Geographic documentary? Good luck figuring that out. What is easy to figure out is that it is definitely NOT a movie about war. It has many historical and technical inaccuracies which might be forgiven if the movie actually had any redeeming qualities other than beautiful cinematography. Pretentious philosophical monologues and amazingly beautiful scenes of native wildlife do not make up for a complete lack of character development or a stream of consciousness style plot. Undisciplined and Pretentious!
