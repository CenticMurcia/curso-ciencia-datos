After fans of McKee's first film, "May," waited and waited as this was shot and reshot and constantly pushed back by the studios, "The Woods" is finally here. And while it is definitely a fun ride, it's a bit on the disappointing side. This had a budget 24 times bigger than "May" and it has about 24 times more flaws. Glaring anachronisms abound, and a climax that feels very unfinished (I wonder if we'll ever see any other cuts?), as well as some questionable CGI. However, an intriguing story and script, witty dialogue, fantastic style, great music choices, a large dose of estro-infusion, and strong lead performances (Bruckner and Clarkson especially) all make this one a nice enough addition to McKee's small but noteworthy filmography. The film is a obviously bit of a nod to "Suspiria," but has its own sense of style and humor that keep it from being a complete ripoff. It should have gotten a theatrical release, as this is probably the best horror with a primarily young in years. Still, one has to wonder what this movie would have looked like if McKee were given free reign with no studio interference.
