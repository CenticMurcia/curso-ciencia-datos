I know that Canadian cinema is noted for its contributions to the Horror genre but this is horrible horror. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />I had to write 10 lines of commentary to get this comment published. So I am going to fill up 10 lines of commentary to comment on this film. I do this so that I can get my 10 lines published because they won't publish it unless I submit 10 lines of commentary for publication. So here I am writing the 10 lines they demand before I can get it published. Once it is published you will read it. Once you have read it, you will understand. You will understand how boring and pointless this exercise was. And you will have some idea akin to just how horrible and boring this horror flick was. Get it! sorry to have had to waste your time.
