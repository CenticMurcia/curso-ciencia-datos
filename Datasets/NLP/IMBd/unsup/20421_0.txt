The first Goal was a great movie that i believe every soccer fan should view. With my first beliefs this one could not catch up I stand corrected. This movie had just as much passion and love for the game and the characters as the other one. Great camera work, amazing/thrilling moments throughout all to form a great movie experience!!! Definitely worth the watch for any soccer fan. All characters are well presented, and the movies plot is not lost throughout as young Munez finds his way as a real first class soccer player. My favorite part of this movie is that all of my favorite players are seen as players who play with Munez.
