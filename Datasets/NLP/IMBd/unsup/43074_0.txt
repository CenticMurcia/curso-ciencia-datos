this has GOT to be THE worst Dominican movie EVER MADE! .... it's even embarrassing to say that i'm Dominican and that THAT movie is Dominican too, i really think this movie had a bad star with one of THE worst posters i've seen in my life, it looked like it was done in Paint, by a 5 year-old!, then the trailer came and just confused me, us, even MORE, trying to make it see like it was a comedy, or a romantic movie, hell, even a drama and some horror they threw in!!!, but no, that wasn't enough, they HAD to release it and make a BIG fuzz about it, calling it ''great, spectacular, like nothing you've seen, the best Dominican movie ever!'' and that's just a couple of things that the actors themselves said!, the movie, it's just plain wrong, the acting could NOT be any more wrong, the editing does NOT even help the movie WHATSOEVER, i mean, seriously, i don't even know what the movie is about, AND I SAW IT!!!!, the lighting was poor and the whole love thing between Zoe and the priest was just so unbelievable (and i mean that in a BAD way), so, please, oh please, avoid this movie at ALL cost!!!!
