This movie was just lame on every level.The lead actor was as weak as water.The story was suppose to be disturbing, with urban "street smarts", and it reminded me more of a cross between an "after school special" and a Lifetime movie, but with some horribly delivered and unconvincing mature language.The plot was suppose to be a loosely based "true to life" story about a juvenile sent to an adult facility, and the hardships he endured, with rape scenes that I guess were meant to be disturbing. But as I said before, the acting and delivery of dialog,were so weak in this film,( I am ashamed to use the word 'film' to describe this crap ), that it turned it into a comedy for me.I have seen "movies of the week" that were more convincing.It didn't, at any point, bring any emotion, except extreme disappointment.Please don't waste your time. I gave it a 1 out of 10, only because 1 is the lowest # I could rate it.
