I have to say... This is quite possibly the cheesiest and gayest movie I have made myself endure. Don't get me wrong... I can appreciate certain elements of the movie that were done really well, such as the story and the art direction, but, come on, a girl named Belldandy? Are you serious? It was painful to hear this name be spoken time and time again, and though the story was interesting, the script could not have had more cheese ooze out from every single word of it. Unless this movie was made for 8 year old girls, which I doubt because of the almost constant presence of a half-naked woman (get a real woman you anime perverts, or at just go ahead and show them naked if you're gonna do something like this), I would never want to put someone else through the pain of watching this... thing. Pretty to look at, +1, interesting love story, +1, gayest script ever, -100. You want good anime? Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Ghost in the Shell 1 & 2, Rurouni Kenshin, even Dragonball Z/GT and Afro Samurai. Belldandy?!?! WTF!!!!!!!!
