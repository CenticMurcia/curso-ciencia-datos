This film is an exercise in masochism on the part of the film makers. Comedy isn't just murdered on screen, but murdered, buried, dug up and murdered again. A storyline exists, but plot points are lost in layers of cheese so thick you'd walk out constipated, and probably half-way through. I would consider this film one of the worst I've ever seen. The character of the Reverend comes across as evil, creepy, disjointed and manipulative. The trouble with the this character is symbolic of the entire problem with this film. It IS good for one thing, though. If you took a date to see it and they liked it, be worried.<br /><br />In a word - Awful.
