The entire set up sequence which runs for a third of the film has more gags and is more fun than the latter two thirds set at the training camp. The sheer lunacy of "roughing it" with all the comforts of home, including one's own butler, is inspired. This sequence in the wilds contains all of the best gags: wildfowl all around but unobserved by our hero; the duck who keeps ducking under the boat when Buster is trying to get organized to shoot it; the dinner table slowly sinking in the mud; the heroine walking a lost Buster back to his camp after he has gallantly walked her home.<br /><br />In contrast the rest of the film has only the eight mile run dupe and Buster combating with the fighting ring ropes to make us chuckle. That's a lot of film time with nothing amusing happening. Buster seems to have become uninspired once the pathos of the mistaken identity narrative take over. Still it's worth seeing the film for the first sequence.<br /><br />KINO's print is crisp and clear and the music accompanying their print is made up of player organ, drums, violin and triangle.
