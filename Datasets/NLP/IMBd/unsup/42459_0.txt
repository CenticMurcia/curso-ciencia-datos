If I wasn't with a bunch of other friends at the theater, I would have walked out after the first ten minutes and got my refund before it was too late. To will Ferrell,I think he should be embarrassed to be in this movie. He has produced hilarious pieces of acting but in this one he just was plain annoying. To the rest of the movie, terrible story line, terrible script, and terrible just about everything.......Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie ( If you have to just rent it) I think giving this movie a 2 out of 10 in generous.It seemed cheaply thrown together.....I did not like it at all. It was not the comedy I hoped it would be!
