I don't know why, but it seems like the makers of the film had a 3-week deadline to get the film done. Many of the shots are poor, and a few reshoots could have done it well in the long run.<br /><br />But, overall, I did enjoy the movie. I admit that the starting was not great, but towards the end there was so much going on, you just couldn't stop watching!<br /><br />Many cameos make this a worthwile watch, with Jabba from Channel V even making a star appearance as the new Fat Pizza employee, who is hell bent on whatever drugs he can find.<br /><br />The story is not great, but it ensures many events to happen along the way. There's Bobo's wedding and his (extreme) bachelor party, Sleek being stalked by fat women, Pauly looking after Bobo's wedding ring, and Habib growing even more afraid of police activity, whilst trying to get any chick he can (and if you've seen the movie, ou'll know what I mean!).<br /><br />But, even these many events cannot overpower the production values. Much of the acting is poor, and nesarly every culture or group is attacked in one form or another. What I mean is, some people may get offended.<br /><br />Overall, I give it 4 out of 10.
