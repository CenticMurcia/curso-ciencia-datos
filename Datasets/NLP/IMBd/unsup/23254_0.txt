I'm drawn to any Duvall movie simply because of his past movies and his compelling screen persona. This film takes a little time to settle into because the assassination is more of a subplot in the movie. Once this point sinks in, I really enjoy the film because the Argentinian tango dance scene is enthralling. The tango scenes are filmed so subtly and beautifully.<br /><br />You really feel as if you have been taken along for the journey as you're never quite sure of your surroundings or the people in it as you move beyond the sinister folk and the tango theme fully emerges. Ms. Pedraza's Manuela character is very interesting as she keeps to herself before finally opening up to reveal herself to Duvall. This is when you realize that it's a tango movie . . . something many would never watch on their own, but now that you're there, you're drawn into the story.<br /><br />To me, the interesting thing about Duvall's character is that he is a hit-man who must disguise all of himself to others ( he even leads his benefactors to believe that he would carry out the hit at a specific time when in truth, he always has his own cautious agenda -- and he is correct not to trust anyone ). He hides himself from the tango people he mingles with, and yet it is speaking with Manuela and her parents that he is most honest and sincere about himself and his feelings about tango and relationships. But his next move is to be the ruthless hit-man.<br /><br />Admittedly, you're a little confused initially, but looking back on the film, you feel pretty good about most of it.
