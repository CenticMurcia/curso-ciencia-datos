terrific script, great performances, grant & russell are terrific together. the film is full of funny little inside jokes from cary grant's "the last person who said that to me was archie leach..." to "you know, bruce. he looks like ralph bellamy." love it, love it, love it. and rosalind russell is my kinda babe! <br /><br />- bdp
