Nathan Lane all but steals the show, but this movie is also powered by the likes of Victor Garber and Saul Rubinek, among others, a rich and varied ensemble that aid the cause enormously. Neil Simon has given them a script chock full o laughs, with the occasional sappy moment. I found the direction lacking and average, and the music poor, and the location was obviously NOT New York. I'm beginning to recognize Canadian cities! But overall a very nice effort that hold up with the best of the cable movie genre.
