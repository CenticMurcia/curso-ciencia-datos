[ possible spoiler(s) - although I think I could dictate exactly what I saw in this particular movie from beginning to end without really giving anything away. It's that peculiar. ]<br /><br />I'm not sure what movie the last reviewer watched - I have no idea what all his comments about cherubs and seraphs are about. Perhaps he saw heavenly references in the naked children chasing/wrestling the hog. But that doesn't explain the sheep; the turkeys; the huge talking rat; the short, shaggy, talking unicorn; the war; the WWII radio; the mother, brother, and sister's relationship; Lily's actions from beginning to end; the costumed houseguests; the black eagle; eating the ant infested cheese; nursing granny; etc, etc, etc...<br /><br />I suspect the movie may be full of symbolism and hidden references but all I saw was one long surreal visual nightmare (with surprisingly very little dialog). Even if the writer explained exactly what each symbol meant to him I think that each viewer would get something different. Me? I got confused and more than a few unintended laughs. But I did find it somehow compelling enough that I watched it all the way through (after falling asleep a couple times because there are long stretches with no dialog or "action"). Perhaps that's the best explanation; I fell asleep early and had a very strange nightmare instead of watching the actual movie.<br /><br />Unless you've seen and enjoyed movies like "Eraserhead" and "The Naked Lunch" I can't recommend this movie to anyone except as a way to recalibrate the low end of your movie rating scale.
