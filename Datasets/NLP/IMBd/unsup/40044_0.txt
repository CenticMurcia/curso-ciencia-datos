crap storyline....long story short. Three kids, one of em is called Mike and he has an older brother (who steals 3 gold pieces of prism from the rainbow) and 2 other of Mikey's friends chase a rainbow and travel through the rainbow. By the older brother's greedy action to steal the gold which make part of the structure of the rainbow, it starts to affect their world. Without light, there is no colour, no photosynthesis...no oxygen. This movie is a cross between Pleasantville and War Of The Worlds, but kids' style. This movie bored me to death. Ending was so predictable. Bad stunts and bad acting. Bad concept. Overall..it sucks...it's categorised as comedy. Throughout the movie, i did not laugh. I only laughed once, was when one of Mike's friends, sucked in helium n began 2 speak in that squeaky voice.
