This USA/Brazlian film is depressing for awhile as it concentrates of the abandoned street kids of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, of which they are thousands and thousands, unfortunately. Since it's carnival time in Brazil, however, the mood picks up and so does the sex as Rae Down Chong leads a parade of naked women. <br /><br />The executive director of this movie, Zalman King, is known for his "soft porn" flicks, and this turned out to be just about in that category. It really isn't a memorable film and certainly your time or money.<br /><br />If you want a better film dealing dealing with the horrors of the street situation in that area, check out "City Of God."
