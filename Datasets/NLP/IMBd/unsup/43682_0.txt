Okay, the Star Wars saga is officially DEAD. It is nothing more than a meaningless, cold, moneyspinning franchise machine. The Phantom Menace was the first nail in the coffin, but Attack of the Clones buries the Star Wars magic once and for all. So much so that I don't think I will even bother seeing part 3. George Lucas, you have really disappointed me for the last time and you have lost a previous admirer. This movie was nothing but a predictable pile-up of meaningless eyecandy that is really nothing special compared to any other shallow blockbuster. On the contrary, it is worse, because the dialogues are so ludicrous and so inane that they make Lara Croft seem like a Shakespearian heroine.<br /><br />Nuff said. Let's bury this movie and henceforth think of Star Wars as a trilogy that was rounded off in 1985.
