I saw this movie when it came out in 1987, but it was released under the original title, "Love is a Dog From Hell." For years, I've searched for it under that name to no avail, until today. I saw it in a mid-sized theater in Washington, DC...and I was the ONLY...and I mean only...person in the audience! The owners lost money that day, but I wasn't complaining. This movie made such an impact upon me, and I cried big, salty tears. Any adolescent who has had acne and/or been socially awkward (hello, everyone?) can relate on some level to the protagonist's horror and pain and gut-wrenching loneliness. Not everyone would ultimately go to his extremes, perhaps, but nonetheless.... I recommend this movie for folks who like their movies without the happy, crappy endings tacked on...and which show life as it really can be in that roller-coaster period called being a "teenager." Great direction and acting, too.
