This is a truly remarkable film. I have only ever seen it once and that was over sixteen years ago. It is not normally my kind of film but found myself watching it one wet afternoon and I can still vividly remember not only the film itself but the impact it had upon me. William Powell shows just what a good actor he is. A convicted murderer being returned to San Francisco to be hanged he meets a terminally ill woman and they fall in love. Foregoing the chance to escape Powell returns the sick Kay Francis to the ship which is taking him back to his doom. The occasional relief of the awaiting gallows underlines the sacrifice he has made. Once back on board they play out the charade that their romance can continue, each hiding from the other their own known fate yet secretly knowing their own and each others. At once almost unbearably sad yet uplifting. On reaching harbour they bid farewell and agree to meet at a night club at New Year. The dramatic impact of the ending sent me into a flood of tears. even though this contains a spoiler alert I can't bring myself to describe the ending - you simply must see it. Tragedy played with Powell's usual diffidence but here it is only superficial. Great performances all round.
