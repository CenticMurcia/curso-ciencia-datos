I recently rented this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Good plot and great acting. Morgan Freeman shows how versatile he has always been as an actor. It is no wonder his career has lasted so long. Christipher Reeves should be remembered for this movie along with the hyped Superman exploits. For me it was the first time I had viewed him as a serious actor. The soundtrack featuring Miles Davis is treat to the listener of such things. The action and resulting end are as applicable today as they were when the movie was released. The protected right of journalists is always under fire by the government and has been exploited in other movies as well. But not as realistically as in this movie. Thumbs up!
