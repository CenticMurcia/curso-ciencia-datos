My hat is truly off to anyone who has the commitment to get off of the couch and actually make a movie. It is an enormous undertaking. But the gushing reviews listed elsewhere were so contrary to my own experience that I felt compelled to offer another point of view. This film seemed to appear in the newspaper listings with no publicity so I researched it in advance on IMDb. The background information pointed clearly toward "Mormon cinema". The problem with the genre is that it leans on the inside joke and preaches to the choir to the exclusion of the broader audience. The LDS references were frequent and heavy-handed. To my ear, the main character's accent sounds more like Alabama than Montana. And how could anyone not know after even the most superficial first-date small talk that he was getting involved with his boss's grand-daughter? On the technical side there was enjoyable urban and rural photography of Britain but there were also several very over-exposed sun-bleached shots. The soundtrack reminded me too much of a soap opera Wurlitzer.
