all things considered this movie is pretty unremarkable.it has too many slow spots with nothing happening.then when there is some action,the scenes are way too long and protracted.it's your typical "nut job takes control of an airplane and the good guys try to regain control" movie.i also found it even less realistic than most movies of the genre.the dialogue was pretty lame too.the characters are your run of the mill characters for these types of movies.the acting wasn't great,either,though i did like Ice-T,who plays a federal agent in the movie.the runtime is about 94 minutes with end credits,but it sure felt a lot longer.the bottom line for me,this movie added nothing new to the genre and was certainly not as good as any of the other movies of the genre.if i were you,i would check out "Turbulence" Passenger 57",Executive "Decision" and "Con Air",which are all better examples of the genre.for me,Sonic Impact is a 4/10
