The insentient world of machines and the people who cohabit it. I love the sight and sound of machines, so Two Lane Blacktop is a natural for me. In this case the machines are cars with their drivetrains at full tilt. A wonderful flavor is the whine of the special cut gears of the '55 Chevy's M22 transmission handling the power of the big 454 motor.<br /><br />The austerity and robot blankness of the characters and plot mate perfectly with the barren mechanical environment. The cross country scenery and coffee shop settings highlight the theme as well. Nothing pulls away from the dominating emphasis of machines. A very singular movie.
