This is basically a Dwight Yokum w**kfest. The writing is dire, various characters launch into long, boring, long, cringe-worthy, long, and pointless, and long soliloquies from time to time. And the movie just grinds on and on and on and on. I was fortunate in that the DVD I have has been gut to 1:43mins, but still had to reach for the fast forward button after 1:30mins. And believe me I really, really tried to see it through. In fact I go a shock when I check the clock and found that I had only been subjected to it for 1:30mins... it felt much longer. In fact it felt as though I had been up all night.<br /><br />Now for the ***SPOILERS*** I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU READ THIS BEFORE WATCHING THIS MOVIE AS IT MIGHT slightly ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE:<br /><br />Everyone in the film is dead. The film is set in purgatory. This is not obvious. In fact there is no explanation regarding this. Perhaps DY decided to make a Western, then after finishing the script watch Sixth Sense and thought "WOW! That's a neat twist. I'll make everyone in my movie dead too!"<br /><br />I do not recommend watching this movie if you are female. Women get something of a raw deal in it, and also DY seems to think that everyone fancies him as much as he fancies himself. <br /><br />Although the film was only 1:43mins long, watching it was like being on acid as it seems to take much, much longer. I fear I may have lost somewhere in the region of 3 years of my life through watching this DVD. My recommendation: rent Open Range instead!
