This underrated film is often surprisingly effective in evoking a believable atmosphere of the supernatural. Count Dracula arrives in a small Southern town in the U.S. in the early Forties, to marry a wealthy heiress. Their strange courtship, and the jealousy of her former fianc√©, set in motion the mysterious and startling events that follow.<br /><br />Lon Chaney Jr. is effective in the role of Dracula, affecting a rigid, slow moving style of body language, and an underplayed manner of speaking, seldom raising his voice, and standing almost immobile most of the time. The moment when he effortlessly flings the jealous Frank Stanley across the room, with a slight movement of his arm, while standing impassively, barely moving, is extremely effective.<br /><br />The effects are well done, with some good scenes of Dracula transforming from man to bat and back again. The backgrounds and interiors are excellent, with the music contributing to the eerie tone of the story. The acting is good throughout, with performances of unusual strength for a low budget horror picture of this period.Louise Allbritton is incredible in the role of the vampire bride. Like Dracula, her soft voice and low key manner do not conceal a dangerous quality both alluring and frightening.<br /><br />The movie isn't quite as good as it could have been, but is nowhere near as bad as some have described it over the years. It works well as a thoughtful, atmospheric little horror picture, with plenty of imagination and talent behind it. Well worth seeing for vampire movie fans and lovers of old Universal movies.
