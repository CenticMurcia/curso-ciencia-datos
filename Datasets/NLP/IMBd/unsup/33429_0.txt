OK, I 'll admit it: I was fooled by the salacious DVD cover for Sisters of Death, which claimed that the film contained 'images of a graphic nature which may cause offence' and featured two images of hot, scantily-clad women (who aren't even in the film). The reality is that this cheap slice of 70s drive-in fodder is extremely tame stuff, featuring very little violence, no sex, and almost no nudity (although it does admittedly feature several hot, scantily-clad women that aren't shown on the cover, including Playboy Playmate Claudia Jennings).<br /><br />The story revolves around a group of young women who are invited to a reunion party seven years after a bizarre initiation ceremony at their sorority claimed the life of one of their 'sisters'. After arriving at their remote destination, a house surrounded by an electric fence (NOT a castle, as stated on the DVD cover), the girls become trapped and begin to die one by one...<br /><br />Poorly acted, and with shoddy production values (the film has a tacky made-for-TV vibe), Sisters of Death is rarely scary, never shocking and, as a result, very disappointing. If 'This is the version they didn't want you to see!!!' (as the cover also warns), I hate to imagine how lousy the version they did want us to see is.
