Again, one of those movies that never had a proper release. You will only find it on Japanese VHS, NTSC format. Okay, bootlegs are available but be sure to have this full uncut, or not. I guess that if you watch it uncut nothing happens because in the full uncut nothing really happens. to be clear, a lot happens but it's a mess, storyline goes from here to everywhere and back again. Is it bloody, no, in fact most killings are off screen. Is it creepy, not really, the demon is laughable, those hands are childish, the green vomit is green...there is no suspense, no gore, no nudity but why do people hunt for this flick. Because of two names, Brett Halsey, for his part in The Godfather 3 and of course for his role in another OOP To Catch A Killer, a must have but VHS goes in the 100$ luckily I have got mine from a retailer for 2 euro's. Anyway, the other hunted actress is Caroline Munro, best know for Maniac, Starcrash, The Last Horror Film and Slaughter High. She's well known for her body which she shows off in every flick except this one. But still up to today, freaks are hunting autographed stuff or OOP flicks from her. But here we see the downfall of the James Bond girl (The Spy Who Loved Me). If you have some spear time then this is one to watch.
