you wont believe this...i was 16 when i saw so proudly we hail....thirty years later i resaw it and remembered everything about it...even the theme music of claudette and george. what a flawless film...the acting...paulette goddard sublime...lake..her first real good effort and colbert gracious and sonny tufts...really credible. the story so true so heartbreaking...the special effects...truly pure Spielberg and lukas. i spent 200hundred dollars.of my vacation money to buy an uniform worn by goddard in spwh and i have a whole living room wall filled with lobby cards and posters of so proudly....im that nutty. proud of paulette goddard...tag just a pretty pretty but...praised in the film. just sad to know that the whole cast has deceased...maybe lorna gray is still with us. anyways it feels good to give you my view...and thanks for understanding a spwh freak.
