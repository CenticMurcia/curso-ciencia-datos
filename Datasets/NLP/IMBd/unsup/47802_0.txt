I'm not going to try call the art 'where are thee?' because Avatar isn't trying pretend to be deep anyway. However I'm very concerned about the amount of the 10/10 reviews here at IMDb. It probably shows something. People don't think anymore, they want candy. So they got it. But you can't feed on candy only, you know. At the time when I'm writing this review, Avatar sits on the 24th position of the TOP250, between 25th Silence of the Lambs and 23th Once Upon a Time in the West. If this won't change, it's quite obvious where the TOP250 on IMDb is going.<br /><br />OK, so why it sucks?<br /><br />Story - Main character, Jake, infiltrates a tribe of aliens on some planet. This tribe resides on the source of some highly expensive mineral. The tribe must be wiped out because of it. Jake starts to like his new friends, because they seem to be cool and in harmony with their nature. He also fell in love with female alien, Nscho-tschi, er... Neytiri. Battle between humans and aliens. The end. -- Well, not only has been this around thousand times over and over again, but it (go figure!) might have taken some bits from the history as well. Dances with Wolves have been mentioned in some reviews and I can think of even more accurate example - Enemy Mine (1985). Wiping the native Americans was a damn shame from any angle, but please, we all have got the point that it was wrong, OK? Get over it and don't breed the hate among the dumb mooing cattle. If you need some movie history lesson from this area, go see the Little Big Man (1970), the plot is exactly the same, only you won't need the 3D goggles.<br /><br />Script - None. The pattern could have been written by anybody, who has seen the standard action flicks. First few minutes, we get the direct explanation about what, where, who and why. And you know this type of explanation, right? Actors talking to each other and explaining the situation, like they never met before. The lecture from Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) given to Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, why?) in their first dialog raised my palm to my face. The intellect of the audience has been lowered down again. Then standard romantic part with a twist in second part, the main character is obviously the chosen one, because some force says so and of course we have a baddie from the army and the stupid leader who just wants money too. The aliens win the final battle and the lead character becomes one of them. Duh.<br /><br />Actors and setting - Who the hell need actors when we've got CGI? I was in the theater with my brother, who plays computer games a lot. After we came out of the building, he named me several things, which have been taken out straight from several PC games, like Command and Conquer, Heroes of Might and Magic, Warcraft and so on. So another rip-off. <br /><br />Visual effects - You've got this right. But wait another 20 years. It's like silicon breast. Now it looks good on your 20 years old body, but wait another 20. I still can't believe the score on IMDb is based solely on visual effects. It's so wrong!<br /><br />I have a theory about the whole thing. I think Cameron has been paid a fortune to do this. Why? Let's say the movie entertainment industry has a problem, that people don't go to theaters anymore, because they can watch movies from home, especially when they can get it on piratebay, right? So the industry needs a new type of movies. Movies with lame story, lame script, lame everything, but top CGI, 3D, IMAX, ultra-mega-realistic screening, so the movie downloaded from the internet is, in fact, useless. I've got nothing against this strategy. I don't give a damn about these mindless flicks, but they just don't belong among the TOP250, that's why I went to see Avatar. Out of curiosity. And my jaw did drop. From a shame where the intellect of the majority is going. I'm also ashamed that I went there and paid the money to see it. It's utterly trash. It's like porn movies. Only this time we jerk the eyes.<br /><br />0/10.
