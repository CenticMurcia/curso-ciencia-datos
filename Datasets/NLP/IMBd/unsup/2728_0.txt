My father-in-law bought this on DVD for our young boys to watch, (aged 4 & 2, as I write). I believe this DVD version was released under the title "Cartoon Classic" and it probably cost $1! The first time I saw the film, I saw the "trippy" opening titles and a little of the film some way through, (where Hans gives his father the red leather that ends up being the princess' shoes) and found Uncle Olie a little freaky. On a second viewing, (all the way through, this time), the Uncle Olie character is not so freaky, and the whole film is very nicely done, though the sound quality is a little off and the opening titles are still very trippy.
