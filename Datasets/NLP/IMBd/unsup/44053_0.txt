This movie could have been set up a lot better and would have actually been a decent movie if it would have been set up right. For starters the majority of the movie should have been night. Night is what instills fear in most people anyway. Also the death scenes were horrible. The one where the guy gets a can stuck into his head is probably the worst. I guess I wasn't aware of the type of material this can was made of obviously to go through someone's head it must have had a razor sharp bottom and been made of something far stronger than an aluminum can. The most expensive piece of equipment that they people who filmed this owned was obviously an underwater camera which they used way way way to much. May have cost you more to get it but it actually made the movie look cheaper than it was. The plot was not terrible overall though it actually showed some potential but it wasn't without flaw. I would however be interested in viewing some other movies by this director if anyone knows of anymore of his movies.
