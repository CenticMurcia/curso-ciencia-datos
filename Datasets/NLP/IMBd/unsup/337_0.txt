This series (mini? ) is hands down the best show ever on TV. I loved "Winds of War"," War and Remembrance" , "thorn Birds" etc. But none can match this one. I have watched Season one and two twice on DVD and season three over twice as it shows in HD. I did not watch this when it started as it seemed to be vulgar and violent in the first few episodes in the bits and pieces I saw. Then in June 2006 I rented two disks from season one and I was hooked. I searched near and far to rent the shows and Then ordered the Dvds.<br /><br />By the 4th episode you are part of the story and even starting to love the "bad Guys". I do believe if a wider audience could have been exposed to this show It would be recognized for the unparalleled cinema it is. I can not imagine many of the actors being able to top this. I recommend investing in the Dvds as it will be something to watch every year or so as it is an experience not a show.
