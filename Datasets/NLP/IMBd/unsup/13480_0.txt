This is Peter Weir's first feature film and a fantastic comment on small town culture in Australia. Like almost all of Peter Weir's films this is compulsory viewing for anyone interested in Australian film. The story goes: In the fictional township of Paris (Australia not France) live a group of ragtag characters that set up traps for drivers nearby. They then salvage the car and possessions of the killed drivers. One day a man named Arthur gets injured by a trap. But he is the only outsider to survive in the town. What will they do with him? The movie is great and well shot with a funny and tense script. Very unique and like a lot of Peter Weir's films, deal with technology and itsbattle with mankind.
