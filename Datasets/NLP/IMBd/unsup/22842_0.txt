I loved this film. It was full of clich√©s and rubbish effects (the budget was so obviously spent half way through so the second half is more cardboard cut outs than CGI's) The square looking college journalist who's obsessed by UFO's can't get a break with her editor. Then, what a coincidence, a wrecked space shuttle pretty much lands her back garden. By the end, that square looking journalist has lost the specs, her shirt and her hair is hanging down. Then the brave tyke takes on the giant spider with a bazooka whilst hanging from a moving helicopter. Talk about multi skilled. (By the way, this was shortly after the spider had rampaged through down town LA growing bigger with every person it ate).<br /><br />This film was so wonderful, me and a friend have decided to write our own monster horror. If this can get made, then the studios are going to be snapping up ours. I fancy Spielberg to make the film "Budgies"...
