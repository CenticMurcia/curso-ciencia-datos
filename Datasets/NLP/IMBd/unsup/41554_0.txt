Wait a minute... yes I do.<br /><br />The director of 'The Breed' has obviously seen Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' a few too many times and asked himself the question, "If 'Brazil' had been an ill-conceived tale about vampires in the near future, what would it be like?" Well, I'll tell ya, it'd be like 91 minutes of a Swedish whore kicking you in the groin, only not as satisfying. The dialogue was laced with gratuitous curse words and trite one-liners, and whoever edited this piece of crap should be shot. I have no real idea of exactly how the whole thing ended because I'm not really sure what happened during the first part of the film. With so many subplots your head begins to hurt and so much bad acting your head wants to explode this movie should only be viewed with large quantities of beer and at least two other people you can MST3K with. The only thing that made me not stab myself in the eye with a dirty soup spoon was this line: Evil Doctor Guy: "That's it, you are not James Bond, and I am not Blofeld. No more explanations!" Dude From Jason's Lyric: "I'm getting paid scale!" The cinematography was shaky at best and the acting was putrid. Also, what was with all the pseudo-1984 posters and PA announcements? The costumes were from the 50's, the cars were from the 60's, the music was from the 90's and I wish I were dead. This movie sucks.
