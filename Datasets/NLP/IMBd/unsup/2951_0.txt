Well, what can I say. When you are only about five minutes into a movie and you see a guy wearing a white tee-shirt....and NOTHING else! I got this used at a game store, (three movies for ten bucks, how can I go wrong?) I got my money's worth. Another in a seemingly endless stream of brand X zombie movies. Everyone involved seemed to be having fun. The makeup was subpar, all the zombies looked like people that needed a good night's sleep. Some of the guns were obviously starter pistols, or something. This time, an infestation of "R.C."s, reanimated corpses, invades Dixie. Played about half for laughs and half for horror, neither half ever delivers the goods 100%. Does that make sense? The plot is fairly straight forward and involves aliens, lesbian strippers, good ol' boy gun nuts, a pretty cool video store owner, who was also the director,(he kinda reminded me of Joel Robinson from MST3K), and a feisty, fairly hot secretary. The copy on the box compared this favourably to Shaun of the Dead, lies! all lies! I did laugh though when one guy who was starting to "turn" tried munching on himself and a reverend also turning after being bitten, cut loose with a stream of profanity in the pulpit. If you can get it as cheap as I did then buy it, otherwise, it's good for a rental. Get some barbecue and a six pack of Coke, (not Pepsi) and soak up the Southern hospitality.
