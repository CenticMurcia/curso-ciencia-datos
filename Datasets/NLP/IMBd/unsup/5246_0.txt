Having just watched this movie for a second time, some years after my initial viewing, my feelings remain unchanged. This is a solid sci-fi drama that I enjoy very much. What sci-fi elements there are, are primarily of added interest rather than the main substance of the film. What this movie is really about is wartime conflict, but in a sci-fi setting. It has a solid cast, from the ever reliable David Warner to the up and coming Freddie Prinze Jr, also including many British TV regulars (that obviously add a touch of class :), not forgetting the superb Tcheky Karyo. I feel this is more of an ensemble piece than a starring vehicle. Reminiscent of WWII films based around submarine combat and air-combat (the fighters seem like adaptations of WWII Corsairs in their design, evoking a retro feel) this is one of few American films that I felt was not overwhelmed by sentiment or saccharine. The sets and special effects are all well done, never detracting form the believability of the story, although the Kilrathi themselves are rather under developed and one dimensional. This is a film more about humanity in conflict rather than a film about exploring a new and original alien race or high-brow sci-fi concepts. Forget that it's sci-fi, just watch and enjoy.
