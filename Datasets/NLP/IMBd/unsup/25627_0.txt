The premise for this movie is actually very interesting. The title alone drew me to watch this movie. What the viewer is left with is cheap production, boring idiotic "jokes" and mundane repetition of news scenes with bad acting. Some of the actors seem like they were picked off the streets or from community college acting classes.<br /><br />The movie doesn't draw the viewer in, instead it psychologically irritates and alienates the viewer by butting unrelated scenes together (which one would think might have some overall meaning in the end, however this is not the case). Viewers are more so alienated by the constant fake news cast scenes. The movies banks all it's value on the fact that viewers will be able to relate to ignorant racist white Californians. Many scenes of this nature are played out to exhaustingly boring exaggeration.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this movie as it has nothing to do with the reality of the Hispanic/white culture of California.
