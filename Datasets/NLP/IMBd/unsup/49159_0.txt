...this is like watching some movie from Yugoslav era, it gave me eeries. Same plot as always when it comes to Yugoslav film school-everything begins with funny plot and everyone think it will end funny, too. But for people from ex-YU it is always predictable-IT HAS TO END WITH A TRAGEDY. That is how all movies from ex-Yugoslavia end. That is how ex-Yugoslavia ended its existence. Also this movie is not Croatian only, unfortunately, it is Croatian-Bosnian-Serbian-Macedonian-Albanian production. Actors did their job excellent, three main male characters were superb, female role is a little bit pale and unconvincing to any foreign viewers. Rajko Grlic did an excellent job with "Stefica Cvek-U raljama zivota", I think he should stick to urban sophisticated stories as Stefica was.
