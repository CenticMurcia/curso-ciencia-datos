This operatic action movie abounds with nods to various directors: Woo, Coppola, Godard, Tarantino, Penn, they're all there. From O's "Resevoir Dogs"-like killing suit to Tok's pinning an opponent's hand to a bar with an icepick to O and Chin's "Bonnie-and-Clyde"-like moment in a field, the movie is an homage to cinephiles everywhere. While it's billed as a film about two hitmen--one vying for recognition, the other for anonymity--it also peers into the lives of the supporting characters. The film takes interesting turns (no spoilers whatsoever here). If you find some of the camerawork a bit florid, keep in mind that that's the MO of Tok: flashy, show-offy, but gets the job done. The film is fast, meditative, and just plain cool.
