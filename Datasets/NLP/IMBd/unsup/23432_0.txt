I watched this movie tonight on the Sundance Channel and could not believe how absolutely pedestrian this film truly is. I mean come on, who can really care about whether these two guys find true love or not? I felt like I was watching a very mediocre version of an attempt at The Brothers McMullen and all of a sudden, I found myself appreciating Ed Burns alot more than I ever thought I would.<br /><br />The film centers around two brothers who live together in L.A. played by the Martini brothers. From the outset, we see that their lives seem to revolve around the women they're dating. But that's about where the movie stops. There doesn't seem to be any driving force for their quest for meaningful relationships, there doesn't seem to be any back history between the two - besides from the V.O. at the beginning that explains that their grandmother gave them the nicknames of Goat on Fire and Smiling Fish. And we also realize that their parents are deceased. But no family issues are ever bought up in the film, nor for that matter is any direction of any type.<br /><br />I'm utterly amazed that this went to Toronto and won an award. What is happening to the top festivals? Are they all being run by who you know? Because for this film to have gone to Toronto someone had to have been pulling strings. Or perhaps having "Martin Scorcese presents" is all you need. Needless to say, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you're interested in this kind of film, there are so many out there that blow this one out of the water. Smiling Fish? They should be swimming with the fish.
