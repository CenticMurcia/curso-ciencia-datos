I saw the original on TV years ago when I was a kid. The movie had to be edited down for TV viewing, because some of it was too graphic. The film was dark, noir and a bit Avant garde. Caine's acting was creepy and strangely sadistic and evil. Yet it was a bit hard to accept Caine as a tough guy.<br /><br />Stallone rebounds in this thoughtful remake. He's a different kind of actor than Caine, perhaps not as eloquent, but definitely more convincingly tough. Sly's Carter has a heart, soft spot so to speak. Caine's Carter was a sadistic pig with barely any redeeming quality. Both versions work in their own way, however. But I'm glad Sly chose this project. See both versions for yourself and decide.
