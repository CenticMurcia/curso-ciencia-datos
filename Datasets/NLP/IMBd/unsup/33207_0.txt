As a life-long Trek fan, I am SO disappointed with this series! It is bad. It is SO bad. It is so WAY bad. It is just terrible! It stinks! It reeks! It... did I mention that it's bad?<br /><br />Janeway is a pathetic leader, but given the crew she has, her limited abilities are far more than needed.<br /><br />This series is "Lost in Space" all over again, just without the Doctor Smith character. As horrible as he was, even he would bring some life to this otherwise horrible production.<br /><br />The worse part of this series is the total lack of imagination by the writers. Every other episode is a time/space discontinuity. Maybe we could luck out and Janeway and her entire pathetic crew could slip into some time warp and we'd never hear from them again? Even the final episode was a time/space discontinuity.<br /><br />Danger! Danger Will Robinson! Turn off the TV set, now!!!
