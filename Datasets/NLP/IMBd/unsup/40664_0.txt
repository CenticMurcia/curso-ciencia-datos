I've been watching quite a few ho-hum films lately and this one doesn't quite reach even that status.<br /><br />We are first assured that this movie is 100% factual, and I guess it came close. I see how the story of a criminal couple on a short crime spree sold tabloid newspapers, but it just didn't make an interesting movie. It aspires to a forties look, but is too ninetiesh for me. <br /><br />The acting is okay, but no outstanding performances. Directing...well, not very good. Scrept's sorta blah. <br /><br />There's maybe one good though lurid scene in this and that isn't enough to make sitting through the movie to see.
