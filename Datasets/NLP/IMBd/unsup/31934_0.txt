This is the 80's greatest cartoon movie, one of the best of all time.<br /><br />As a big fan of a good cinema, I want to watch every type of movies, including cartoons. Since 85, when I was only 11 years old, i have been watched every type of movies. The secret of the sword is unforgettable to me for 2 reasons : Beside to be the first movie I have ever watched on a big screen, until Ratatouille, i wasn't found no one other cartoon like this one. You'll find everything that you looking for in a cartoon in here. Family entertainment with comedy, action, even drama, without forget some values that the digitalized cartoons that fulfill the lives of nowadays kid's forget with extreme facility : friendship, union and family values.<br /><br />This cartoon still have the power and I believe that will have forever -<br /><br />10/10
