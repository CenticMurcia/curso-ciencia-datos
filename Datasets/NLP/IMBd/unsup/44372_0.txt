I enjoy movies. They just have to be entertaining. This movie might be shocking to you if the only movies you've seen were after-school specials. The scenes are not that vile or outrageous either, which is both shocking and sad for this kind of movie. As I watched, I waited for something interesting to happen, only to see the most predictable scenes acted out by the worst possible actors. Dialog, plot, acting, isn't really B movie material, its just shoddy. After a while of watching you realize this is all there is and you can't help but feel a little cheated. It might have helped they made an attempt at a plot that made sense, or better yet actually did something with the characters. I saw this movie expecting a revenge film and got some director's attempt at trying out his camera angles. I could probably watch two cows chewing grass for an hour and half, and came back with more than this gunk.
