The movie is good and the some of the plot is well written. The fact is that only 10% of the story itself match the game. The sound and music don't even correct and this doesn't give the audience an eerie feeling of being in the movie.<br /><br />The effects are good, especially at the part when the laser beam starting to move, down and up or in the middle, now, that's something. Other than that, the story has same introduction and ending with the past zombie movie.<br /><br />By the way, where is the puzzle, doors, small and smelly hallway, zombie lying around or grenade launcher, ammo. It is advisable to have all that stuff in this movie, then RE can be graded as class A pictures.
