Let me first say I am not a fan of this show. I can find some humor in the show, but it's brought down by the fact that nothing makes sense ever at all. ATHF can barely sustain a 12-minute show. This movie lasted about 80 minutes, which was just too long for anyone to stand. In this film, Frylock wonders who his father and mother were, while a giant exercise machine takes over the town and makes Carl, the idiot human neighbor, buff. There's no real plot here, and often any plot will purposely be sidetracked to include characters from the show that have the fans screaming for more and everyone else (if anyone else saw this) wondering what exactly just happened. The ending to the film is the part that made the least sense, and perhaps if they would have tried harder to come out with a better ending then I would have been happier, but they didn't. They tried to make the ending as stupid and as anti-climactic as could be. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the occasional funny dialogue sprinkled among the poorly animated frenzy. So, in summation, the only people who will want to check this out are fans of the show, and people who enjoy singing concession stand commercials and talking watermelons.<br /><br />My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 81 mins. Rated R for some language, violence and some sexual humor.
