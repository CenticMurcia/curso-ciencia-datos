I saw it tonight, and do yourself a favor and read what I say here. This movie goes way beyond simply being a waste of time and money - I feel that almost two hours of my life have been MURDERED. I try to have a policy of not walking out of movies because I can usually find something good about them. I am as forgiving as an audience can be, but once I had finally had enough of this one, I had a headache from the anger it caused me. Without going into specifics about the multitude of things that were bad, I will tell you that the hack writers and producers should be arrested and sued for trying to make money from something that puts the world in reverse and robs us of our time on earth ...they even had the gall to make it more than 90 minutes. I could have put up with the poor story and the awful characters if the jokes or the actors were funny, but they weren't. I'm a peace and love kind of guy, but right now, four hours after seeing this, I find myself still wanting to fly to LA to find Jamie Kennedy and kick his ass. Anyone who gave this a good review has got to be on the payroll of the production company. I have to stop writing because I'm finding that words can't describe what an awful experience it truly is.
