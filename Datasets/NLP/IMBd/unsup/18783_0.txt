For some reason (or reasons), I found this "Harry" episode a little more entertaining than the others. Maybe it's the Tyne Daly interview scene with the woman's rights liaison sanctimoniously commenting on equality while Harry lam-basts her with a "what would you do in this situation?" scenario. Maybe it's the rich kid who metamorphosed into the smarmy old man quasi-liberal mayor, with his "Jimmy" sycophantic aide at his side resembling a blathering French poodle. These mayoral scenes take a really sarcastic swipe at so-called liberal politicking by mostly all the brass bigwigs.<br /><br />Also enjoyable is the opening scene at the restaurant where Harry bum-rushes Freddie the Fainter, the food-"poisonee" faker who fools everybody but Harry. How about the Tyne Daly/Harry partnership which develops nicely as we segue from the soul-brother barbershop scene (great one-liners here!) to the foot chase segment, with the accompanying jazzy-funky score and with Ms. Daly at his back (well, sort of!)? She finally does really cover his back later on, but I won't say how or when (no spoiling!).<br /><br />All the above plus a well written and nicely paced story line, a gorgeous cinematic backdrop of 'Frisco and the adjoining Bay area and a more understated execution of this film makes it a little different from the other "Harrys". It's not necessarily better than the other "Dirty Harrys", but I just enjoyed this one more, especially the unique ending.
