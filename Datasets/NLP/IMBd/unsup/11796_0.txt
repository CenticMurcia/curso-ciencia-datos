To be honest I cant get enough of 'Better than Sex'(BtS). I was thoroughly disappointed when the end credits began to roll. Since I viewed it on cable TV, I flipped a channel and watched it all over again. I hold very few movies in such an esteem to rate them 10/10. But BtS is definitely one of those rare diamonds.<br /><br />BtS is a very intellectual and honest look at the dynamics of the one night stand, the following passion, the possibilities of more. Seen from both the male and female perspective it's so engaging to see and feel the raw honesty. As a male I was constantly agreeing, laughing, nodding and completely understanding Josh's (David Wenham) position with his actions and thoughts. I so loved the balancing female - Cin's (Susie Porter) perspective. I felt this was how it really is. BtS is an optimal example of reality.<br /><br />From the initial meetings to the scared first steps, the initial sex to the first words the next day, the progression of knowing nothing to seeing the unfolding of a relationship not yet defined and blossoming. The doubts, insecurities, the ensuing pointless fights, walking out then making up. The development of passion and the emotional content that creeps in uncontrollably is magnificent in its simplicity and handling.<br /><br />As an audience I became so drawn to the characters. I felt in tune with David Wenham's Character and was left with a crush on Susie Porter. This movie is all about character, development and that proverbial 'human condition. So basic I would assume it was filmed on a shoe string budget, but you never know it. The cinematography, camera angles, accompanying music, the introspective and intermittent 'interview' style was perfect. The sex scenes are tasteful and never 'dirty', the chemistry was electric between Josh and Cin.<br /><br />I am not usually a fan of pure Australian film. But BtS showcases how an intellectual, witty, and powerful character driven story tackling a very real plot should be done. A definite movie to get... a saucy, raunchy and potentially winner of a movie to see with a new partner. However be warned, BtS is clearly marketed for adults that demand that bit more depth in the intellectual and honesty stakes.<br /><br />A challenge: Try not to fall in love with either one or both of David Wenham or Susie Porter and their characters. And I bet you will love the Taxi driver :D
