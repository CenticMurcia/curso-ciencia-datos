"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past" was a total failure. In particular, Matthew McConaughey proves he is a mediocre actor at best. <br /><br />The cinematography was the only acceptable part of this film.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that one of the writers of this film, Jon Lucas, went on to write "The Hangover". How is that possible? This film is so bad Charles Dickens would roll over in his grave if could see his classic tale of redemption bastardized in this fashion. This film was neither romantic or comedic.<br /><br />Further, the director made the wrong choices at almost every step in the making of this film. I cannot believe it was directed by Mark Waters, who has directed movies I loved, including "Mean Girls" (with Tina Fey), "Just Like Heaven" (with Reese Witherspoon) and "Freaky Friday" (with Jamie Lee Curtis). How did he go this far off?<br /><br />Someone at some point should have pulled the plug on this film. When the dailies came out, why didn't the Executive in Charge of Production or someone from the studio say none of this was funny. At a screenplay level, what did someone see when they green-lit the script?<br /><br />The main character, Connor Mead played by Matthew McConaughey, is such a callous, self- centered, womanizing jerk that there is no hero or anti-hero for which to cheer. His younger brother, Paul played by Breckin Meyer, was not developed as a character. Paul's bride-to-be is written so emotionally and psychologically defective that the audience needs to ask: "why is Paul marrying her?"<br /><br />To the great actors Michael Douglas and Robert Forster, I ask: "What were you thinking when you agreed to appear in this film?" Mr. Douglas and Mr. Forster did the best they could with the material they were given, but everyone associated with this film needs to be embarrassed.<br /><br />It was a complete an utter waste of time to watch this film. I hated almost every frame of this film. It is one of the worst films of 2009.
