What kind of genre would you put this movie in? It's not horror, thats clear from the start. it's supernatural, but just because there is some gore in it, you cannot class a film as horror. It's not a thriller, as it's neither thrilling nor tense.<br /><br />This would need it's own sub-genre entitled 'EMO movie/Teen Zombie Floozy'. and still that wouldn't give the movie a genre.<br /><br />In this mixed up movie, we get two guys who bunk off school and go to the local abandoned Lunatic Asylum (theres one in every town) and get drunk. They go down into the basement and find a zombie (i know it's not mentioned at all in the movie, but she bites others, and son they become dead. Textbook zombie). <br /><br />One leaves, the other investigates and realise she cannot be killed. So what do they do, get their rocks off, apart from the main character who is obsessed with another girl, but is very shy so just stares at her from afar like a chubby Joaquin Pheonix.<br /><br />And thats the film really, apart from the old clich√©s we get in these films, main characters friend becomes a bit mad towards the end and starts acting like a Shakespearian villain, the Jocks have revenge taken upon them, and their is a pointless twist in the closing seconds.<br /><br />And it's all made very badly. The acting is okay, but the story and the script absolutely stink more than the titular character, which is a shame because the film rally had a lot going for it.<br /><br />If it dared to be a little more left-field, rather than ticking the predictability box, it could have been a lot more, but it chose to stay on the path, rather than stray away.<br /><br />Boring
