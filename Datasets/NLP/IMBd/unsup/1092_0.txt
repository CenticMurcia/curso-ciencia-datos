Twins separated at birth meet again blah blah<br /><br />But it's fun to watch and you get to see Jackie Chan's hilariously imaginative fight scenes!<br /><br />With a couple of babes thrown in and the inadvertent swapping of partners from one twin to the other, you can but tempt to imagine the glorious fun that results. This is Jackie at his silly best, a dignified world-famous conductor in one role whilst a bumbling bad-ass mechanic in the other, we get to see how versatile, if unique, an actor he is.<br /><br />For much of the film, both twins keep meddling in each other's lives causing havoc and confusion without knowing the cause until finally they come face to face...<br /><br />I saw it 10 years ago, several times because of its watchability. The soundtrack was excellent -- I still remember some of the tunes now.<br /><br />Feeling down, need a lift? This flick will rejuvenate your spirit for open-hearted fun living.<br /><br />9/10
