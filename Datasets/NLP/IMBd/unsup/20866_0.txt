Probably the best sketch comedy series to come out of Britain since Monty Python. You'll love (or love to hate) the brilliant characters and situations created and performed by the freshest British talented right now: Matt Lucas & David Williams.<br /><br />'Little Britain' is ported from a popular radio show. It's dry and crude British humour that everybody gets, except maybe the French.<br /><br />All three series (1-2-3) are musts and will entice repeat viewing.<br /><br />Just a few recurring characters: Lou selflessly dedicates his life to looking after wheelchair-bound Andy and Andy selfishly dedicates his life to making things as difficult as possible for Lou. What Lou doesn't know is that there's nothing wrong with Andy's legs, and whenever he turns his back, Andy's off out of his chair and gambolling about like a fat, balding, semi-naked spring lamb.<br /><br />Stage hypnotist Kenny Craig has no worries about using his skills to get his own way.<br /><br />Whether nicking stuff from the supermarket or swapping her baby for a Westlife CD, Vicky Pollard reacts to any accusation with indignant outrage, while filling you in on 'this thing wot you know nu-thin' about'.<br /><br />Daffyd is the only gay in the village or is he? Marjorie Dawes is the terrifying leader of weight loss support group Fatfighters.<br /><br />Emily Howard and Florence are two ladies going about their ladylike business, like any other normal ladies<br /><br />Everything stops when high society Harvey wants bitty.<br /><br />Not always laugh-out-loud but constantly in your face, will keep you amused for a long time, especially when they pop up in your thoughts in everyday situations and trust me they will. Ee-Ee-Ee!
