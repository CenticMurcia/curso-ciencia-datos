Horrible. That's all I can say. The killings are dumb. For a waste of your money, please do not rent this one. I rented this movie and stopped the movie at the middle. Also, It used to be scary for me when I was young. But, now it's stupid, rotten and dirty. This movie appeared on Slashers. Poor death stages to boot too. Not to mention a rotten script. It also has laughable lines. Skip this one and rent "Friday The 13th" or "Sleepaway Camp". I want my money back on how wasted all this time on this piece of garbage. This movie should be burnt, Fried and Destroyed. Now that's all I can say. AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! <br /><br />Rated R.
