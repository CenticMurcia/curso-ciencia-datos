It is said, that this human race is always progressing but after a point all is destroyed and God will again create it from the very beginning. So I can imagine that it is not possible that this kind of movie can be made again ever. The world has to be created again by God and only than this kind of movie can be made. I slute Shakti Samant Sahib and his team for their eternal contribution to the society. It is not possible that these people will born again for thousands of years. This film also shows Indains have talent and qualities as these people were born and brought up in India and were Indian by heart.<br /><br />I admire Mughl-e-Azam but in Mughal-e-azam there is king, armies, and glamour to support the story line and creenplay but Amar Prem is purely natural and close to common man therefore it is a lesson and a great satire on our society specially in the subcontinent.
