Sure, this is pretty much a kids' movie, but it's still fun. I didn't care for the boy who starred as the Brody kid (they could've picked someone better), but I really liked the dog voices (Alec Baldwin, Tobey Maquire, etc.) & some of the cats too. Yes, it was an "animal" movie--I wasn't as interested in the humans at all--& their acting wasn't great (although I did like Sophie the Maid for some reason). But the movie did have some funny moments. As a dog lover I especially liked Lou (Tobey Maquire) & Butch (Alec Baldwin). As a Chihuahua lover, I would've loved to see at least one in the movie. Oh, well. Btw, the person who commented that the boy was drinking Hi-C was wrong. It was Capri Sun (but, yes, blatant advertising--uncalled-for). Still, I liked the movie. I thought it was cute & funny. Besides, I'm still pretty young at heart even though I'm past 40 (not immature, mind you! LOL). I gave it 8 out of 10, maybe a bit high, but so what? *grin* If a movie can give me at least half a dozen or so laughs, it's OK by me! LOL (Too bad so many people are SO serious & old-thinking--stay young at heart!) :)
