This is one of the worst movies of all time. It is slower than watching hair grow on your dog -nothing happens for the first 45min. The story is terrible and the characters are weak, contrived, unimaginative, unoriginal, and uninspired. And the actors playing them are not better.<br /><br />Chris Penn yells the whole time and the others are mumbling most of their lines (probably because they are embarrassed by them) so you can't understand a thing, which is probably good because one would realize even more how stupid the story is. Most of the performances are terrible, but the worst among them is Annabella Sciorra - who just happens to be a producer on this atrocious piece of junk. >
