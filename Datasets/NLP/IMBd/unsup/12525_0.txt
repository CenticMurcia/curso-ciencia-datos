This movie, "Gracie's Choice," is perhaps too close to home for me. This movie inspires me to do what she has done. The only difference is, I am not wanting to adopt my siblings, I am wanting to adopt my son. Previously, the courts were not in favor of me, despite my efforts. And, I had lost hope of ever adopting my son from his mother. But, now, I hope to. I had always been concerned about my upbringing/childhood, but perhaps I will be able to overcome it and make some progress with my family. Allow me to share one of my quotes that I find inspirational: "It is within you. When it is time, it will happen." Norman from Omaha, NE.
