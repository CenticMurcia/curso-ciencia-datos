I have to confess that I had never until today heard of this comedy trio called "The Ritz Brothers." They seem to have been a sort of toned down version of "The Three Stooges," and - not being much of a "Stooges" fan - I actually appreciated their more toned down style of comedy. Here, they play a trio of inept detectives trying to protect a wealthy businessman (Lionel Atwill) who's been threatened by a mass murderer known as "The Gorilla." There is, in fact a "real" gorilla on the loose (played by Art Miles - the makeup, while not great, wasn't as bad as some that I've seen), who can't be the murderer (because first, gorillas can't write notes and, second, he hasn't been on the loose long enough to have committed the murders) but still he provides plenty of comic relief in his scenes with the Ritz Brothers. It's a good mystery. We're kept guessing from the beginning about who's actually committing the murders, and there's no way of really knowing. Bela Lugosi is featured as the butler, Peters, and he plays the role perfectly straight (in a sense perfectly cast, because I can't picture Lugosi doing comedy) and that straight performance adds both to the comedy and the mystery (Peters comes across as mysterious throughout.) Overall, it's not a classic, but it's quite enjoyable. It will offer some laughs and keep you guessing all at the same time. 7/10
