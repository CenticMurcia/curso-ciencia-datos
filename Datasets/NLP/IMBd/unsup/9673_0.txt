There is a vaccum in space because of this movie. This takes pathetic to a whole new level. The acting is lame, the story line is incipid, the plot, oh yeah, what plot? The insult to Latin women - come on, the old "keep 'em barefoot and pregnant" is the only line missing. Don't bother not even from Blockbuster.
