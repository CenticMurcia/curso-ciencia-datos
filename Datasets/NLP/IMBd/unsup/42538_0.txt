I loved the first couple of seasons of the TV show and I love Paris! So I thought this would be great fun -- afterall I could imagine the kids getting lost in the Louvre, or dangling over the edge of the Eifel Tower, or falling off a bridge and onto one of the tour boats on the river, etc. But, this film takes place in a pseudo-Tokyo theme park named EuroReptarLand (can you say EuroDisney?) There's jokes about sushi, not escargot, sumo wrestlers as waiters and floor show entertainers, and some ripoffs of the "Lady And The Tramp" film, etc. All in all, a huge disappointment.
