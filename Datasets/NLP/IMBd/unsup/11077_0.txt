I just bought the movie because it has James Spader in it. He's hot, and the movie you can see his nice buttocks 'wink'. Cute story, funny quotes (i.e. 'How can you be out of coffee?' 'There's no dust in her dust buster!'), not quite as good as Secretary, but it will fulfill its purpose when I put it in my DVD player. He's cute when he plays drunk, and even better when he's being molested by Susan Serandon... sp. By the way where was Jeremy Piven in this movie and if he was in it why didn't they try to put him in it more. He's a lot hotter than Jason Alexander, who by the way is really annoying. I know I don't watch movies because of people's looks but if it wasn't for Spader I'd have never seen this one... It was cute. Thanks and farewell.
