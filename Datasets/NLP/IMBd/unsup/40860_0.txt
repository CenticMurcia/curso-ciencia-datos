It's disappointing enough to see Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard in this turd (I missed the Crispin Glover as Willie Wonka) but it's a severe disappointment to see Kal Penn in this, who'd recently starred in the thoughtful and, well, epic THE NAMESAKE. This is a rather extreme step down from that movie. Heck, this is a step down from HAROLD & KUMAR, which is was amusing and entertaining. IPECACE, sorry, EPIC MOVIE is just epic trash. Penn and the others named couldn't have been in this for anything more than the paycheck.<br /><br />It's almost inconceivable that this was even meant to be funny. Almost as if the aim was to make a purposely unfunny movie and see who would be dumb enough to laugh. Just RELENTLESSLY unfunny.
