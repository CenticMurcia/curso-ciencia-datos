The comment from the person who saw this as an 8 year old certainly brought back memories for me.<br /><br />I must have seen this film at least three times during the pre-TV days of Saturday morning special programs for children.<br /><br />If you've ever sat in a theater packed with eight to twelve year olds all bawling their eyes out together, you know it is something you'll never forget. <br /><br />I was able to find a VHS of the movie in later years and was astonished to find how charming the picture is on the adult level as well. <br /><br />Kudos, hugs, and kisses to anyone still alive who helped put it together.
