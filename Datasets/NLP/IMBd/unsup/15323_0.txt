I thought Bones was okay, and here's why:<br /><br />The cast are pretty good, the story is simple (but nothing wrong in that), and it makes a change to see a mainstream sort of horror (in the same vein as Scream, or IKWYDLS) with a virtually all black cast - but without resorting, too much, to street-slang and negative stereotypes. There is some flashback in the narrative, but I didn't see this as any attempt at mystery - it's obvious from scene 1 what happened.<br /><br />On the plus side, the ghost effects were pretty slick - even if the blood was totally unrealistic (like thick paint), and the model/monster effects were only at the Clive Barker level. Which fits with the whole Hellraiser aspect of the movie.<br /><br />Apart from the paint, my only other quibbles would be the very silly aspect of Snoop's revenge on his two main enemies (more like a comedy sketch), and the way Pam Grier COULD have just got naked to save the day (dammit!)<br /><br />Yes, the film could have been so much more (scarier, longer and deadlier for three things), but I still enjoyed it, If nothing else, I spent a good 20 minutes chuckling at the outrageous design of the house, and I don't remember 'Kendra' being nearly so beautiful.
