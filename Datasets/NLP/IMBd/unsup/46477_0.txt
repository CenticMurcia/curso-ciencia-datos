I actually created an IMDb account just to state how bad this movie was. The bigger Street Fighter fan you are, the more angry you will be at inconsistencies with the film. I knew it would be bad, but this was painful to watch.<br /><br />I don't consider these spoilers (but will leave the warning on just in case) but more of a vent. These are things you will pick up on and say "wtf?" There are more, but no need to spoil this already bad movie.<br /><br />1) Vega is an ugly looking Japanese guy instead of a handsome Spainard. 2) Chun-li's dad is not working for Interpol, but Nash is? 3) Gen never performs a fireball in any Alpha or other games...never. 4) Last I recall, Gen is not "old friends" with Bison. 5) There was no point in adding that random hot chick with a non-existent organization.<br /><br />Regardless, I stand by my summary that this is worse than the first as those actors at least looked much closer to the actual characters and there was much more action. All I could say after watching this was "I waited 15 years for this?!"
