The first time I saw this movie I thought it was kind of dumb but after seeing it again I began to realize it was'nt so bad. Sure a lot of the scene's are pretty much exactly like scene's in the first one but there was plenty of good action and new scene's to make this movie strong. the ending gunfight in the strip club was pretty cool(Ive never seen so much glass break in my life), and the bus rolling over scene was cool too. Also, the dialogue scene's with Nolte and Murphy are just as funny as the ones in the first. I dont know why so many people think this is such a bad movie. Sure its not as fresh and original as the first one, but its still entertaining. 3.5/5
