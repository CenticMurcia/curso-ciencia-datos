One of the first mainstream pictures that Li made outside of his career in China. And boy of boy,if u are a fan of fast paced kicking and punching and incredible stunts then this the movie for u. The story is quite thin, but that is usually the catch with this kind of movies. But the supporting roles are superbly performed by Mira Sorvino and Tcheky Karyo. Also nice to see was the cameo of Kato (u know the sidekick of Peter Seller's Clouseau) and a young french stuntman called Cyril Rafaelli (or something like that) who plays the little small fast kicking and flying twin. He is awesome in this movie and if u want to see more of him in action. I would highly recommend getting District-13, there he is the co-lead and u can really see what this guy can actually do. Anyway this movie is highly entertaining, but a word of warning tho, it is not for the fainthearted as there are some very brutal scenes in there.
