One of those slasher films that give a bad name to the entire genre. Anonymous characters that you can barely tell apart, lifeless acting, a director who shows no skill in establishing his premise or creating a scary atmosphere, and a pathetic ending. The movie has one useful function: it will help you appreciate mediocre horror films more, because you'll know the difference between simple mediocrity and outright badness. 0.5 out of 4.
