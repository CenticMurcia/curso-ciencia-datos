I always like days in Spanish class when my teacher is out, because she gives us some movie to watch. It's invariably no good, but it's a good opportunity to do homework for other classes or study. However, when she told us we were going to be watching SELENA the next day, all the girls who'd seen it seemed excited. I know enough not to trust their judgement (these are people who's favorite movies include Napolean Dynamite and Cinderella Story).<br /><br />I was right. I was interested in Selena, the person, when our teacher told us about her. The movie, however, was extremely clichéd. Jennifer Lopez's acting was terribly overdone. The movie held every clichéd scene from movies ever, which I realized from the moment we had a shot of Jennifer staring sadly at a couple kissing, with that look 'oh poor me, I have no one.' What follows is a corny string of scenes such as the "I'm sick of everyone telling me what I want" and the forbidden love with the line "But I love him, Daddy!" J.LO shouted a lot. When rewinding it to find the right place, we played in four times to check; she was crying in three of them.<br /><br />The writing even stooped as low as "We got married and it's okay with everybody!" followed by "I feel like I could fly! I feel like I AM flying".<br /><br />The guy who played Selan's father gave the best performance. The best I can say about J.Lo is she looked gorgeous...so much better then the slutty look she has today. I enjoyed the music in the movie (Which i understand was J.Lo lip-synching to the real Selena) and the end footage of the real Selana was nice. Half the people in my class loved it...that would be the other teenage girls. Not the worst way to spend a day in class, but I wouldn't watch it outside of the classroom.
