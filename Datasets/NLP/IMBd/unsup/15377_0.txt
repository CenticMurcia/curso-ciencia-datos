This series deserves to become a regular next season or at least a regular mini-series. The great plot points for the family and extended relatives have all been laid out. There was a surprising amount of depth to the episodes, ranging from the thoughtful to the hilarious. One thoughful point was the class snobbery, prevalant in Mexico, played out between the Senator and Miguel Cadenas. There were some laugh out loud moments, from Jacob Vargas' entire character of Ernesto (killed too early) to Dr. Klein's (Brian Benben) realization that he had been mispronouncing Romolo's name all along. "It's not Romuulo, it's Rrrromolo!" The only negative can be that we're asked to root for a drug kingpin. I thought perhaps America was not ready for that, but after seeing the "admirable" qualities of the beloved Sopranos I now ask-Why not?<br /><br />
