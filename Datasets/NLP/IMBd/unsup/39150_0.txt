I am so sorry, but James Franco should start looking for a career in renting movies for people rather than making them. The plot was awful, but not as bad as the acting. SPOILER ALERT: The "Ape" was actually a guy in a really BAD gorilla mask, although I have to admit I did get a pretty good laugh every time the Ape sat next to a lamp or a wall and turned his head so you could see the empty eye sockets. Even better was the mouth of the mask that just gaped open and was hanging at an angle to one side. It looked like the Ape mask was recovering from a stroke. I had a field-day with this movie picking out all the mistaken cameramen caught in a reflection or the cameraman going through the DT's. Which reminds me, was this James Franco's "acting" or was he just constantly high. I wonder what their budget was for the wardrobe, the apartment, office area, and props like fake feces or extra gorilla hair ????? I guess the budget couldn't afford a tripod. My theory is this movie is so deep it's gonna take me awhile to GET IT....... I think.
