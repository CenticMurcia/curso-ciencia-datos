The atmospheric opening sequence in 'Chinatown'... the father who is a klutz of an inventor... the local harridan... the Mogwai. All of these elements will keep you entertained during the first portion of the movie, "Gizmo" especially, but it's when the Gremlins arrive that the real fun starts! Ever heard of the phrase 'Build it up, tear it down'? Well that's exactly the technique that Dante and Spielberg use here, building up the aura of quintessential small-town America and then gleefully allowing their malevolent little protégés to tear down that image by running amok!<br /><br />As mentioned, the first segment is still entertaining. Mrs Deagle, the harridan, is wonderfully evil and still scares me to this day (As does "The Wicked Witch of the West" in "The Wizard of Oz"!), Gizmo is cute enough to have kids all over the world screaming petulantly at their parents "I want one!", and there is constant delight at seeing such inventiveness being practised. Once Gizmo gets wet, however, the movie cranks up several notches and never slows down. There are several great set-pieces, which I won't spoil here.<br /><br />Particularly satisfying is the sense that Spielberg is poking fun at the schmaltzy nature of some of the previous projects he's been behind. There is a wicked sense of humour on display here, from both director and producer, and several scenes might scare sensitive kids. However, I used to love getting scared and thrilled at the same time, and that's what this movie does so well for youngsters. Part of its attraction when I was growing up, I think... To give the impression that only kids will enjoy it is false though. This is a fun movie for all the family that continues the tradition of great 80's flicks with something for everyone, a la "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Back to the Future". A real treat.
