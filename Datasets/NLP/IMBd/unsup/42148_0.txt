I don't want to be mean, but I couldn't even laugh at how hopeless this guy was. I felt bad for him for about 5 minutes and then just wanted to beat his ass. That's right, this movie is about a loser trying to meet Drew Barrymore in 30 days. Problem is he only seems to spend about 2 hours a day doing any semblance of work to achieve this goal.<br /><br />*Spoiler* The guy gets a chance to meet her at a movie premier and he can't even talk to her. How can you set out to make a documentary about asking someone out when the protagonist is such a pussy?? Anyways in the end Drew's publicist finds out about the project and probably said to her, "Look Drew, you're gonna seem like a huge bitch if you don't meet up with this guy," so they get together for an awkward 20 minute lunch. This is supposed to be the climax, but it's actually the low point of the movie. It plays out like a make a wish foundation story; Celebrity who feels sorry feigns interest in someone so pathetic that they have to be nice but don't want to touch them for fear of catching anything. If you read between the lines of her comment about her being an "instigator" or "motivator" in his life, you can hear her really saying, "Get a f@cking job."
