Sorry but this is a vent more then a comment.<br /><br />How could anyone call this a western. It may have taken place in western times but the stupidity of the plot is incredible.<br /><br />A contest where people compete by a quick draw shoot out. Not very well done I might add. Oh please.<br /><br />I admit the final shoot out at the fort was entertaining but you have to suffer through the entire move to get there.<br /><br />I was offered a free copy of this movie but refused to include it in my collection. Maybe I should have accepted that way I could have trashed the DVD.
