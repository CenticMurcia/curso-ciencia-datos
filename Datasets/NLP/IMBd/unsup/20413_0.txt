Problem with these 2 'Goal' football (yes Americans, the game is called FOOTBALL not soccer) movies is that they are blatantly ridiculous. And actually -a fact that no one seems to notice- there's a lot of interesting stuff going on in football's REAL LIFE -more interesting i'd say, then in these stupid 'goal'-movies where the hero goes from illegal immigrant to winning the champions league in approximately one (1) year. That's the level of a ten year old, i'd say, or as i may add, of an American audience that for some strange reason never seems to get bored by the same old storyline in a different movie. Let's throw in a car chase, let's throw in some kissing, let's throw in some celebs ,oh yeah, some unrealistic football action before we forget, and ready is our SOCCER movie. That's the biggest problem. Hollywood doing a football film will NEVER NEVER work. Any volunteers from other sides of the world?
