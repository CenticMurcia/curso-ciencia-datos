This movie didn't rate well with critics (sometimes a really good thing). It's too bad, though, because this is a terrific flick. Our entire family (ages 6 to 46) enjoys this movie year after year. It's just a lot of fun.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman is very funny, even a tad twisted, as Cap't. Hook (and I'm no Hoffman fan as a rule). Robin Williams is in better control of himself than he often can be, and makes you really believe that Peter Pan is and does as Mr. Barrie's original character did. And Bob Hoskins (Smee) is a gem of an understated comic here.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the detractors or critics -- see this and believe in some make-believe for yourself.
