Routine, predictable, you-know-what's-gonna-happen "nature strikes back" schlock with C. Thomas Howell (ya gotta feel bad for him, being reduced to participating in this kind of thing) playing a rural sheriff being forced to contend with an enormous swarm of deadly killer bees.<br /><br />Well, I guess we get what we expect with this underwhelming tale. Bad special effects, stock supporting characters and unimpressive performances, too many moments that only produce laughter. It would have been better if all involved could have some fun poking fun at their cruddy material, and played it with more irony and humor. But no, they had to take themselves seriously.<br /><br />I sort of liked the main characters (particularly Fiona Loewis'), to be totally honest. If for any reason I found it a little better than completely worthless, that would be it. But that doesn't change the fact that the film itself is so unimaginatively hacked out - "hack" being the operative word there. It's simple, cheap (and, yet again, filmed in Canada, to save even more money) and silly.<br /><br />Then again, one could always derive some entertainment out of it for the unintentional humor. It's amazing to see all of these people perform this material with such straight faces.<br /><br />3/10
