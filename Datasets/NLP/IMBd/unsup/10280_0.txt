Add to this unbelievable stunts and special effects... If you like these, don't watch this movie.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you like real spy flick like this 1985 movie, with a twisted plot and betrayal this one is for you. The action is believable, the storyline is intriguing and the ending is surprising...<br /><br />A must see for people who like real spy movies. 3.5 / 5 stars.
