I love this movie. It is a smart, sweet, suspenseful story. I've always loved time-travel stories. This one doesn't have classic time-travel, but it's similar in that there is the ability for father (in 1969) and son (present-day) to communicate and effect change in the future. It's a strong story with twists and turns as the son tries to save his father's life (in 1969) and accidentally messes up things in the present day.<br /><br />When I first rented the movie, I had never seen the trailer. I am very glad, because the trailer gives away a big plot twist, which occurs halfway into the movie and I think it is more exciting if you don't see that coming (so I won't elaborate on that part).<br /><br />This movie has authentic characters that I really cared about, which makes the suspense so much more real because I felt invested in what was going to happen to them. The strong directing and cinematography (atmospheric) ties this story together into the perfect package.<br /><br />I also loved the small hints and moments that are sprinkled throughout the film that tie back into the larger "time travel-ish" story, which makes it great on repeat viewings. I thought the moments of how the past affected the future were all plausible except for one moment toward the very end of the film, which was clearly done for dramatic effect, (so I'll let it go).<br /><br />Overall, one of my favorite movies!
