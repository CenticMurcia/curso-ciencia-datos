This is one of those films that sticks in the mind for all the right reasons. Great acting, great script, and utterly gripping. Paddy Considine was outstanding as the psychotic ex-paratrooper hell-bent on revenge for the death of his brother Anthony, played by Tony Kebell. Kebell's portrayal of the retarded sibling is just terrific. The supporting cast were on form too. I'm still both haunted and mesmerised by that long black & white sequence leading to Anthony's death and Richard's lonely face at the bus stop, quietly grieving for his little brother. Together with the music, it's powerful stuff. I've never seen Shane Meadows' other work but after seeing this, I'll definitely keep an eye out for his next movies.
