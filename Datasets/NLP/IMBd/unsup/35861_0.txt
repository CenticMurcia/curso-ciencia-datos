Well, let me tell you...it's a real let down. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. I watched the original Mortal Kombat when I was about 10 years old, and it was bloody brilliant to me back then, it's still "ok" not absolute garbage, unlike its sequel.<br /><br />Mortal Kombat: Annihilation has no substance, form, direction or anything remotely resembling a competent cast of actors. The director must have been a coffee machine or something, I really can't see why they decided to make a sequel. The first movie beats it easily.I quickly hit IMDb to check the scores of both the original and MK: Annihilation...<br /><br />A dismal score of 5.0/10 for MK, and an even lower 3.0/10 for MK:Annihilation. So I was like..."Damn, this is a glorified power rangers..." I could see from the start it was, when Raiden fires lighting at the beginning, it looks as though someone has put a giant bitmap overlaid onto the movie and moved it around a bit. RAIDEN btw, is now a less-hardcore version of the original kick ass Christopher Lambert Raiden, if you're gonna remove Lambert, then you need someone fairly bad ass, so what do they do? They give us a Doogie Howser lookalike who is in need of orthodontic work. Every time we see him he's through a brick wall or falling off something high. He's like a piece of ham, but with less acting ability. All his words of 'wisdom' are like "We have to work as a team, courage...courage...look within yourself at your...courage." Jax is just a token black guy, Sonya is admittedly hot, but not as hot and/or as kick ass as the original Sonya. Johnny Cage gets instantly killed by some 'thug' in a skull (the final 'boss') at the very beginning. Kitana and Liu Kang are just like the 'sexually' tense element of the film. They have the funniest (not meant to be funny) part of the movie, where the "hardcore" Sheeva, with 4 arms, having spent the entire movie looking fearsome and generally like a big, brutal beast...runs in and says "The date is over." In 5 seconds she gets killed by a falling cage, now that is comedy folks. 10 seconds of pure "Why was she even in the movie?" goodness.<br /><br />There isn't a semblance of a decent camera angle, all the scenes are "misty" and "firey/smokey" and really don't add well to the overall ambiance of the movie, they make it seem more like an 8th Grade production of some bad Shakespeare play no one cares about.<br /><br />OK, the first movie wasn't THAT good, but it was a 'heapload' better than the sequel, which IMHO should never have been made, I mean...they can't even use "We needed to make money" as an excuse, because I'm sure even the caterers who worked on this film have never been able to find work since.<br /><br />Ah well, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it's like the biggest disappointment to me, as for years I was like "I have to see MK annihilation" because the first one in my mind was embedded there as something "good". Thanks a lot John R. Leonetti I know now that you can't direct. At least not anything past Power Rangers or something? Anyhow, thats just how I felt about this movie. T_T
