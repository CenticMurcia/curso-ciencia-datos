I watched this film at my husband's suggestion and hated it. There are "guy flicks" that I like ("Resevoir Dogs" for example), but this ain't one of them. The violence level is to be expected, and Steve Buscemi is his usual engaging self. So much for the good points. What really put me off this movie was the female characters. Each is completely one-dimensional and fills space with all the umph of a zero. Better not to have included any women in this outing rather than settle for such unworthy additions. <br /><br />If you're a male who wants to have something stupid running in the background while you access your computer, you may enjoy this movie. All other potential viewers: avoid this turd.
