One would expect a film all about mobsters and hit men to at least be mildly interesting. Why not? "The Godfather" did it. "Married to the Mob" did it. Heck, even the spoof flick "Mafia!" managed to do it. All "The Funeral" will do is put your to sleep. <br /><br />It's unfortunate in many ways -- there is an excellent cast in this film, and normally the actors are more than able to keep my interest, but the characters had no redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Although many of the characters are well-written and very believable, there are too many holes in the plot and inconsistencies throughout the movie to save it from the hangman's noose. Wake me when it's over.
