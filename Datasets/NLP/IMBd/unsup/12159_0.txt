I've finally found the DVD and I'm really glad to see M.McDowell in a so different role before the legendary performance in Clockwork Orange. He plays a young typical middle-class English guy that has just begun to watch the girls as an unknown new universe; he has a family, a brother next to the marriage, and an ordinary social life. His destiny twist suddenly when he loose his senses the evening after his own brother wedding, and waking up the morning after in a bad hospital he discovers to be paralyzed from the belly down. We don't know, He doesn't know and worst of everything the doctors don't know the root of his illness. He takes the hard decision to move on an institute for paraplegics but even on a wheelchair he won't be able to hide is rage being apart from the usual guests of the institute. This unusual character is soon noticed by a beautiful patient,Nanette Newman excellent as ever,they will have the chance to go over the fear giving a kiss sitting on a wheelchair knowing the real love.<br /><br />A big clap to Brian Forbes light and strong where and when necessary.
