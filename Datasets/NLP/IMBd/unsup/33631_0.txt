First of all, I am a huge fan of the seminal series Spaced. It was, to my formative mind, as significant as This Life. Nothing much has impressed me more since then.<br /><br />However ..<br /><br />Hot Fuzz simply wasn't funny. Shaun of the Dead reminded me of a Final Year Project for a Media Studies undergrad.<br /><br />This latest offering is truly dire.<br /><br />Its not that it doesn't try to entertain, it does. It just isn't _funny_.<br /><br />Asinine, predictable, low brow and spun to death.<br /><br />Its a great great shame, but its becoming more obvious to the world that it should be Jessica getting all the plaudits not Simon. Evidently, among the entire creature genius assemble that produced Spaced, she was the one with the sense of humour.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this, go watch Bourne instead.<br /><br />You might get this off TPB at some point in the future, when there's a dry spell in the winter. You'll wish you hadn't bothered.
