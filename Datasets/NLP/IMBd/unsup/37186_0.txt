This movie is a total joke in my opinion. From the lame story line to the absolute stealing of ideas from other movies such as "Harry Potter", "Lord of the Rings", "The Matrix" and "The Goonies". That would not be so bad had it been executed well. I couldn't find anything good about this film at all if I am being honest. Perhaps some of the special effects were okay but that is very easy to get done properly these days I think. I thought the story was bad, the music was the bad and the acting was terrible. Probably the first time I ever felt I wanted to leave the cinema during a film. I cannot understand why this movie made it to the cinema if I compare it to other ones which do not. This movie simply insults the intelligence of the viewer and that is made worse by the fact that it is more aimed to children. Absolutely awful and a waste of time.
