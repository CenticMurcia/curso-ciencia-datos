Boring.<br /><br />If you are going to treat us to nothing but two actors for 85 minutes, at least have a decent script. The acting is good, but the actors can's salvage the script.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a little like fusion jazz or extreme prog rock: made by musicians for musicians - anybody who isn't a proficient player (and appreciates great technical skill) will find it boring instead of marveling at the odd time signatures and fast scale runs. My brother (who is a movie maker himself, his short films have been featured in film festivals in Cuba, L.A., France, Russia, etc) and his movie-industry related friends liked it, nice photography, editing, etc.<br /><br />But for "plain old me who doesn't make movies", the script is boring, and the "plot twists" are so far-fetched that I simply couldn't maintain the suspension of disbelief. **SPOILERS** "Boohoo, I killed my little brother"?! A big stack of unsent wedding invitations a week before the wedding?!? Give me a break! A beautifully-shot dancing sequence... that doesn't do squat for the story, character development, hello? Maybe it was inserted for giving the film a bit of energy?<br /><br />My opinion: A waste of money. (And my wife went as far as declaring it "Worst Movie Ever" ;)
