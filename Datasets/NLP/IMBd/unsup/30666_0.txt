I wound up with this movie on one of those dubious Â£3.99 four-packs full of 'films you've never heard of'. And, well, on a slow Sunday, I treated myself to the experience...<br /><br />And, frankly, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Snappy banter plus strong performance from the leads made up for a transparent plot and lackluster 'action' sequences.<br /><br />Gangsters, reporters, dames in distress (and even a particularly dismal 'car chase scene') - all the traditional trappings of the 'noir' genre, but given a slightly humorous edge by Ayres' enjoyable performance as a wise-cracking reporter.
