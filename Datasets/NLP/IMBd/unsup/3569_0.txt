"The Christmas List" with Mimi Rogers is a wonderful Christmas movie for adults and even school age children. This is a hopeful, funny, moralistic and rather off beat movie. It should be available with other favorite Christmas Classics. It has a good cast, and does not drag like some Christmas movies that tried to capitalize on big star power. Actions that seem like pure fantasy are explained with possible reality and give us a glimmer of hope for a fairy tale adventure in real life. Many viewers are able to relate to Mimi Rogers, young Bill Switzer or Rob Stewart; I do not understand why this movie has not been released on DVD. Every year I check, with no avail, to see if The Christmas List has been released.
