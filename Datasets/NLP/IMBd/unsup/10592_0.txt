I don't understand why everyone else thinks the sequels are a waste, I've just bought the second and third movies today on dvd. I've just finished watching the second movie for the first time, it's really good! In my opinion it really improves on the original and beats Frankenhooker in entertainment value although some of the ideas in Frankenhooker were possibly more interesting. It leads on directly from the original movie and yes it does look like a studio made film rather than the location shot original but that doesn't matter, what matters is the plot is not as simple as the original which really just told how they came into being and then they went around killing a few doctors. This has more humour it's more creepy in places the special effects are better. In fact it is all just better than the original, except of cause it doesn't have the rough edge of the ultra-low budget original but this is replaced with a much more enjoyable to watch film. I wasn't expecting much from this but what I got was a very good hour and a half's entertainment which was even sicker than the original! The 'baby' part was surprising! Ignore the other comments trust me, if you like Henenlotter's other movies and Bryan Yuzna's Society you're pretty likely to gain plenty of entertainment from this. I think the original had more emotion but this has more action, take your pick. I give it 8/10!
