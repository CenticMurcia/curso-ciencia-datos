Together they will uncover the truth, the truth that haunts Laura.<br /><br />Overview : *Atmosphere A wonderful setup with the beginning of the film, to give us a feel of what it must be like for Laura to be so paranoid she can't leave her apartment. We are in her shoes yet the reason WHY she is this way isn't shoved down our throats.....it's a gradual discovery. *Story Smooth storytelling, writing, and execution. A genuine ghost story with some modern twists.<br /><br />*Cast/Characters Some truly talented actors in this film. No overdramtic scenes or poor stage direction. Keep your eyes peeled on this cast to appear in more films down the lines. The characters had depth, they were individuals and showed all different aspects of people you may know.<br /><br />*Pace The movie was over before you knew it and has you craving for more! Good transistions between acts to bring you to the finale where everything falls together nicely.<br /><br />*F/X Amazing effects team on this film because the there were moments that were just so eerie and even one scene made me cringe so bad my tummy flipped!!<br /><br />*Cinematography Filmed in and around the Maryland area, you felt like you were right there. Even job well done in the limited space of the apartment that Laura never leaves.<br /><br />Jekyll's Rating : It was a true pleasure to be able to watch this film and also meet the guys in charge of it. Very talented individuals and I look forward to checking out what they have in store for us next.<br /><br />
