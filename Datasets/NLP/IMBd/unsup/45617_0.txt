Takeshi is the master of stretching 15 minutes of story into 2 hours. The first hour of this movie consists mainly of the main character (and others) slowly walking around. I estimate more than 30 min. of the first hour consists of sitting, walking, and 2 characters making small talk with no story significance. Occasionally, Azuma will punch or kick someone and continue to mope around. After more than 1 hour of not a single plot point something finally happens. When the story finally gets going, it is so unremarkable and predictable that you can barely keep your eyes open.
