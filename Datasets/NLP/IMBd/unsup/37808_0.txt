Although there are some positive points in this movie (pretty few), I found it generally uninteresting. The small romance shown in it, does not fit the otherwise cynical character played by Ruppert Everet. The unveiling of the plot is slow, uninteresting and does not excite the spectator in any way. Humor, is also fully absent. The time gap between the scenes in Russia and the story telling in England is huge and should have been better managed and explained. This is not a total waste of time, however there are much better movies to see out there instead!
