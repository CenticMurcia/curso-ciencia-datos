This movie is fun for the entire family. It features one of the greatest "drug-trip-sequences" ever captured on film, it has the last performance of the classic movie star, Lon Chaney. You've gotta love any flick that somehow packs bikers, classic monsters, hippies and a blond with a body and cleavage that won't stop all in one movie. I don't know how to exlain it better than this... the acting is bad, the directing is sub standard the effects are complete crap but it's still an excellent flick. duh, go buy it:)
