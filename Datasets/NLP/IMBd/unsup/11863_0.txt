Ram Jaane is a Bollywood attemp in the gangster genre. Does it succeed in entertainment and is it worth the watch. The answer is YES, and this is only because of Shah Rukh Khans performance. Ram Jaane (Shah rukh khan) is about a orphan who is dumped in the bin and grows up to be a street wise smart gangster. Once Ram Jaane becomes a gangster, there is no proper plot. Its Ram Jaane and his way of life. Shah rukh Khan delivers a Great Performance. Why doesn't he make more of this kind of role. The movie also stars the very sexy Juhi Chawla in a decent role. The other actor is Vivek Mushram who is long gone and forgotten. Pankaj Kapoor is amusing as the Funny Gangster. This movie is absolutely entertaining. The Ram Jaane character is so amusing, his style and way of speaking is madness. If you like action movies and Shah Rukh Khan. It is worth the watch.
