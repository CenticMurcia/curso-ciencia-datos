A disturbing documentary on a Capitalist electricity company trying to "bring the light" (efficient electricity service) to Georgia, the former Soviet republic, which has been tauted as "entertaining" and "funny", as if it were a "Saturday Night Live" sketch. One has to have lived in a Socialist country (as I did) to fully understand the situation of the Georgian people (or any other country previously ruled by a Socialist regime.) I found nothing funny about the situation of Georgia. It's rather tragic. After you've lived in a system in which you may have paid 40 dollars for rent, 5 for telephone or 10 for electricity, it becomes completely absurd when your bills take most of your salary, as in the Capitalist society most of us live in, to pay for the wealth of the Earth that belongs to every single soul on this planet. The sudden presence of a transnational company (that is ruthless, no matter if its officials claim the opposite) in those countries, where political corruption, greed and totalitarian methods helped to mine its social and economic system, has very little to laugh about. On top of that, foreign official in Georgia Pier Lewis, who constantly makes fun of the company's methods (as cutting power for a few minutes in an airport for not paying its bills, when a plane was about to land) and the Georgian people's reactions, is a rather pathetic character, making one wonder if he's ever heard the word humanism. 2/10.
