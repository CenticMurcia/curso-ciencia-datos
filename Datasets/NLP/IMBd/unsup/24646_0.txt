This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. My wife, some friends, and I rented this because we thought we could at least laugh at how bad it was. We were wrong.<br /><br />The basic story has some, but little, promise or value, while the plot development and screenplay are extremely forced, contrived, and, in a word, cretinous. The basic story itself is ludicrous but could have been the core of a much better film had the development been handled with at least some skill, and had the makers not thrown in seemingly haphazard, unexplained scenes or focused on apparently irrelevant events that seem destined to have some role only to be forgotten half way through. The directing, acting, etc., are all utterly dreadful and the cinematography is little better than that of a home-made movie. Richard Jaeckel, befitting his vast experience compared to the other cast members, is a bit better than the others and only he sometimes has some dim spark that brings his acting up to a mediocre level. The other "actors" are universally abysmal. I could add more, but this film really isn't worth much effort.
