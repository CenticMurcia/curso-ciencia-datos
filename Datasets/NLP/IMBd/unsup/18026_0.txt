I bought this video from a seller on Ebay a couple of days ago and it arrived yesterday. Finally sat down to watch it today. Before I saw it I had mixed feelings about how it as I love watching Little Women. The version with June Allyson and Janet Leigh is my favourite, however, I also enjoyed the other two versions that I have seen. <br /><br />This film is GOOD !!! It is very close to the book. OK, there are a couple of variations. In the book it is Laurie that sees that Nat goes to Plumfield, and John Brooke passes away at his own home, not at the school, but nonetheless, this film is a very well done adaptation.<br /><br />Spookily, I noticed a few things all to do with the character of Jo. First off I thought that Mariel Hemmingway bore a strong resemblance to Katharine Hepburn who also played Jo in the 1930's film, and a number of times I thought that the boy who played Nat reminded me of Winona Ryder who played Jo in the 1990's film.<br /><br />All in all a thoroughly enjoyable film and a must-see for fans of Louisa M Alcott's books about the March family.
