Out of the internet cartoon craze that exploded in the early 2000s, Queer Duck was one of my favorites. While not particularly clever, it managed to have an odd charm to it that kept me tuning in every time a new episode was released online. As the internet animation boom died down a few years ago, one would expect that there would be no continuations of such series as Booty Call, Lil' Pimp, and Queer Duck. All three series have now been turned into movies, none of which have been given a theatrical release. I was unimpressed with the Lil' Pimp movie, unable to find a screening of the Booty Call movie, and was only so-so with this feature length outing (pun intended) of Queer Duck and his pals. The charm of the web cartoons is present, though being much longer in running time, the hit and miss ratio is more uneven. About 60% of the jokes in QUEER DUCK: THE MOVIE hit, but when jokes bomb, they bomb big time. It doesn't help that gay humor isn't as shocking or original when the series came out in 1999. Slightly recommended to fans and the gay community only. 4/10
