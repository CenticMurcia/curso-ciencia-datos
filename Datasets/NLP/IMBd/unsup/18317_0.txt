Mary Tyler Moore was such a nice sweet woman. She was always thinking about others and trying to please others. She was naive, but she succeeded in a man's World. She started out as a secretary, but made it as a television producer. The pilot episode is a classic. She meets her new boss, Lou Grant, a complete grump from the traditional manly, man World. He is fierce, crude, and brutally honest. At first you are terrified of Lou Grant. Once you get to know him, he is really a nice guy. Don't say that to his face, though. Ted Knight makes the show. His character Ted Baxter is a lovable, pretentious, dolt, who thinks that he is actually competent. Then there is Rhoda. She is obviously from out East, and is more vocal than the average Midwesterner. I really think that this show was one that showed a woman making it in the man's World, but doing it with a lot of class. Perhaps the best episode was when Betty White's character was cheating with Cloris Leachman's character's husband. Betty White's character insists on continuing the affair, so Mary Tyler Mary says that she will let everybody know about what she is doing. That ended that.
