This film is so worth watching. Just as a study. It's no master piece but it's so full of potential that's not realized and actors making the best of what they got. Not all the acting rises to the occasion but this is a lesson on what to do and avoid in film-making and story telling.<br /><br />I've seen so much wasted money and film in Hollywood. Pare and Mark Belasco rescue this film and any money invested in this one. The mentor relationship is the best thing in this film! They are uncomfortably good in this low budget thriller. It seems misplaced. The first 2 acts cry for a detective series with Pare and Belasco. Call FX! ... The 3rd act makes you realize they've been holding together a mess that was breaking at the seams... Good for them and Brooke Lewis who plays against her bombshell casting perfectly. She is without a doubt a a indie star on the rise and an actress to watch. Mary O'Rourke is wasted in her role. She is cute as hell. I would have loved to see her and Mark Belasco have a battle about the strain his job put on them... or she her anywhere else. Once again talent wasted.<br /><br />Ken Del Vecchio and his 199 credit's should be proud to be the flaw on the Charles Durning's flawless career. <br /><br />MEMBER OF THE CAUSE! PROJECT 8 FILMS
