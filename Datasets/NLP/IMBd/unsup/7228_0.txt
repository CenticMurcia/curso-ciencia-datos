This is another of my favourite films and I never get tired of watching it again and again and always laugh at the funny scenes.<br /><br />I can't imagine anyone else in those roles than Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei, I don't think it would have worked as well as it did. They are one of the best on screen couples I have seen. They act like a old married couple. They just work so well together and have the right chemistry. They make me laugh more than anyone else in this picture, the scenes I particularly laugh the hardest at is when Vinny has been invited by the prosecuting attorney to go hunting and he doesn't know what to wear and Lisa goes into a tirade about the deer being shot and his brain lying on the floor and not caring what the "son of a bitch" who shot him was wearing. Another is when Vinny is trying to prepare for a case and she heaps on more pressure by talking about her biological clock, it is a lot more funny in the film and you should watch it for just those scenes alone.<br /><br />What I find entertaining about Vinny's character is that he is not a practised lawyer, he hasn't had any cases and doesn't really know what he is doing. He doesn't even know about disclosure till Lisa tells him. He also has to convince his cousin, the cousin's friend and the judge that he knows what he is doing. On top of this, he hasn't had a good night's sleep because it keeps getting interrupted by loud noises throughout the night, the judge doesn't like him and keeps putting him in jail for contempt, a local idiot who wants to fight him for $200 that he owes Vinny so there is a lot of factors working against him. You cheer for him when he starts to do the right things in court and will him on to find evidence that will prove his cousin and friend innocent of murder.<br /><br />I have to say one of the scenes that has me falling about laughing is the scene where there is a stuttering lawyer who is trying to do his opening statement but keeps stuttering through it and the jury's face is a picture and really it is their expressions I am laughing at.<br /><br />I like that the film is unpredictable. You don't know how it will be resolved, you are in a way in the same boat as Stan and Bill as you watched them leave the Sac o' suds without killing the clerk and you wonder who could have done it and how the witnesses are so convinced that Stan and Bill did it and at least at the end, you have a satisfying conclusion when you find out they have caught the bad guys in another state.<br /><br />It was good to see Ralph Macchio in something else other than The Karate Kid. I hardly recognised Fred Gwynne without the makeup of Herman Munster. He was such a treat especially when he couldn't understand what Vinny was saying when he said "yutes" and couldn't understand some of the other words Vinny said with his thick Brooklyn accent.<br /><br />10 for the actors, 10 for the directing and 10 for the writing which makes this film a joy to watch.
