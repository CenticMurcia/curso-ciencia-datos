I really like this movie. It is a very clever movie and has a great sense of humour. I can't compare it to any American comedy. This kind of humour is completely different. This movie is for those who want to use their brain while watching and not only laugh. I really like European cinema and this movie as well as Run Lola Run prove that European cinema can go on. 10/10
