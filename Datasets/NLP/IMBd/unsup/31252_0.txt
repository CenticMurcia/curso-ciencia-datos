The directors have broken some boundaries with this film. Not only is "?" one of the funniest, pseudo-realistic depictions of our nation's outcasts, but it also brings out a bizarre fear of not dealing with this element of our population closer to home.<br /><br />Parts of this film are not fictitious works, rather raw, honest cinema, but to those who haven't seen it, I won't give any of this away.<br /><br />While many will knock this film because of the pornographic nature, I saw past that and witnessed the birth of a twisted and compelling storyline. I never once saw this as a shock film or disgusting; I saw honesty, truth, and a truckload of humor behind every scene. This is the modern world, and there are new forms of entertainment for us to adapt to and be entertained by.<br /><br />"?" is a film that may not leave a very good taste in some peoples' mouths, but then again it isn't supposed to. It is better, more honest and a whole hell of a lot funnier than any reality program out there, and it may even freak the daylights out of you.
