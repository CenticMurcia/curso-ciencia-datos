This movie must have been made off a bet that Van Damme couldn't have a successful movie without having helicopter kicks in it. And what does he do? He does no kicking at all!!! All he uses his legs for is kneeing some heads. This movie might have a story, but if I wanted that I wouldn't be watching a Van Damme movie. I love his movies and kicks. That's why I don't like this one. 1 out of 10.
