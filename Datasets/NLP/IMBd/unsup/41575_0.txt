This is the second Poirot I've put back in the box before finishing. The first was Sad Cypress, and the reason is the same. Both come across as overly melodramatic to me, with the romantic elements so pained that it seemed the character's heads would explode. I like my Poirot in a lighter mode, and these to episodes seem to be spoken in a different language from the rest I've seen. I can imagine people liking this sort of thing, but I find it out of character for the series.<br /><br />As with someone above, I was bothered by the cuts between segments. A scene ends outside, and you're suddenly in a room and different people are talking already. I understand television breaks, but a few seconds to get you into a new setting would be appreciated. I certainly don't notice it in most Poirots, but the last 2-3 I've seen have had the same problem.<br /><br />For all of you complaining about changes from the book - do you really want to know what happens next in every scene? How can you watch a mystery when there's no mystery? If I had read the books, I'd certainly want the dramatic version to have new elements to throw me off.
