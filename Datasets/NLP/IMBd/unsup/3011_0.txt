This is the first time I decided to write a review. At the time when Cousteau's documentaries aired regularly, I was still a child. Cousteau and the life he led captivated me and evoked in me a sense of adventure-seeking and fascination with the sea. Wes Anderson managed to not only recapture the Cousteau mystique with a twist but to also take me back to this wonderful time.<br /><br />The Life Aquatic is a brilliant and unique work of art with a wonderful cast. The various subplots are beautifully thought out. Those who cannot connect with this film were simply born at the wrong period. Those who cannot appreciate it are simply much too rigid to understand creative movie-making.<br /><br />I truly hope they make a sequel! Afterall, Cousteau is known to have faked some scenes. Esteban's death could have been part of a ploy. Alternatively, Esteban could have truly survived the attack and was later spit out by the shark near some island ... Let's go Wes! Give us another! You have a winning formula ...<br /><br />Best regards, Marc
