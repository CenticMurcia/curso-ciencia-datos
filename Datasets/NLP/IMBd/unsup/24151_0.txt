The film adaptation of Terry Southern's book is a fine mess! There's no real flow or purpose, but the stars have a ball and Ewa Aulin seems exactly right as Candy. Marlon Brando, as always, is interesting and unique and Richard Burton should have made more comedies. John Astin is excellent in a dual role, but James Coburn really steals the show as Dr. Krankeit. I'm not too sure what they could done with this material and some of the scenes are simply unplayable, but you can have fun with this.<br /><br />I'm sure this was a total bomb in 1968, but I really can't remember how it did box-office wise. Best performance = James Coburn. Elsa Martinelli is also creepy and sexy and John Huston lends gruff support. Very similar to The Magic Christian, but slightly better. I know some critics at the time called it the worst film ever.
