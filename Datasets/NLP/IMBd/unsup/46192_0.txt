PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING!!!!!!!!! OK, anybody who says they "liked" this movie or thought it was "intellectual" is a complete idiot. this movie had absolutely no plot, fun, entertainment, point, theme, message moral, or anything else that you would watch a movie for. seriously, was the first scene with the woman driving and hitting the badger or whatever really necessary? and the part where she drove down a hill and saw some weird guy and some sheep was totally pointless and gave me a headache. and another thing, what was with the naked little kids runnin around? that was just stupid. and is there really a war going on who was that old lady callin on the radio? one more, couldn't they make a more believable unicorn? it looked like someone rolled up a newspaper and taped it to a donkey's head. they only give me 1000 words to review this move, but that most certainly isn't enough. i could write at LEAST five hundred pages on why this movie was awful, but i would have a stroke if i had to relive this piece of crap again. you would have a more fulfilling experience if you boiled garbage in cat urine and ate that while having weasels gnaw on your feet, and that would leave you feeling much better about yourself than if you watched this movie. whoever decided to curse the world with this grotesquely bad film should be forced to watch it over and over for the rest of their lives. seriously, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.
