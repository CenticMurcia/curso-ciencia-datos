Blood Lake (1987) C-90 min. D: Tim Boggs. Doug Barry, Angela Darter, Mike Kaufman, Travis Krasser, Tiny Frazier, Andrea Adams. This has to be the most hilariously awful movie I have ever seen, and clearly the worst slasher film ever. A chunky killer begins murdering teenagers in a secluded house on the lake. Why? Who cares? Features probably the worst acting of any film in recent memory. Also features several long scenes in which nothing happens (such as the card playing scene). And what the hell is with that ending? RATING: 1 out of 10 (ONLY because you can't have 0 out of 10). Rated R for graphic violence and strong language.
