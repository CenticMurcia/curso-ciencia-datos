I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of the book and I can't believe that I waited for THREE YEARS to see this load of crap. The best part of the movie was the end. It barely followed the plot of the book, cut out more than half of the major events, and was cut way too short. I wouldn't see this movie again if someone threatened to force feed me nails. It was very cheesy, especially the two minute period in which Saphira magically grows up; also, periods that spanned two months in the book spanned several hours in the movie. The ONLY reason I gave the movie a three out of ten, was because of the good animation on Saphira. This movie is an insult to all loyal Eragon fans. To summarize: if you have read the book, don't see the movie. After seeing the movie, me and my Eragon loving friends had a conversation on how stupid and idiotic the movie was. After seeing how crappy Eragon was, we are scared to see Eldest.<br /><br />~Kristina (A VERY angry fan)
