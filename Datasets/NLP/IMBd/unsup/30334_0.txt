Christian Slater was absolutely amazing in his role. An office drone that is ready to administer his "justice" to all those who refuse to accept him, when an unexpected twist occurs that leads him down a different path. <br /><br />He's a deeply disturbed man, who can only live with himself by either becoming a hero or a tragic sacrifice. The dramatic finish to the self-obsessed paranoia of a man who dropped his sixth bullet. <br /><br />"Sometimes the only dignity left, is death. Who wants some ice cream?!" Some of the surreal effects were a bit over-the-top and unnecessary, bit this flick is all that and a bag of chips. If you like dark movies with excellent storytelling, this is for you. You'll be hooked after the first 15 minutes.
