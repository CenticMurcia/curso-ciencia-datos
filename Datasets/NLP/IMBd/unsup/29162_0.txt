I loved this show from the very first episode. Darkwing Duck makes an excellent and very realistic hero, one that makes blunders and mistakes, but always does his best to overcome them. He's devoted to his chosen position as St.Canard's protector, and he has a very normal weakness: his ego. His adopted daughter Gosalyn is spunky, but sweet. She's always adding spice, humor, and unique twists to the show. I can't forget Launchpad, DW's ignorant, but devoted sidekick. Without him, Darkwing might not have been so lucky in his cases. Or maybe not... Anyway, if any of these characters were missing, the show would have been can-celled long before.
