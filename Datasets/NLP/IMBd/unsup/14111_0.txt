Typical "Americans in a foreign country" storyline, made BETTER by the talents of the lead actors. It would be impossible to resist this movie if you were a fan of any of these wonderful actors! James Garner is always a treat in any role, be it comedy or drama, and Debbie Reynolds is typically wonderful in her role as the neglected wife. Add the phenomenal talent of supporting actors such as Terry-Thomas and Paul Lynde and you have instant comedic magic. I would love to find this movie available on DVD to add to my collection. There are no movies being made today that are any funnier than this, and it's a shame so many of these old comedies are so difficult to find on DVD.
