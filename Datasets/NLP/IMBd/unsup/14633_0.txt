The movie 'Fanaa' has some of the very good actors of Hindi cinema in it's casting. It has one of the best producers and distributors backing it (Yash Raj Films). Therefore there has been no paucity in presentation and the screen fills up like a colour palette. Add the good music(it grows on you slowly) and you come up with a good treat. Well that's why it was a disappointment!! At one point the storyline (not much of a story) went haywire and the ending leaves you with a feeling of being discontented. You feel as if the movie is moving in breaks and there is no continuity. I believe the director's previous movie 'Hum Tum' was better and sorry but I have to say 'Fanaa' was tad little better than his first film. Maybe he should stick to romantic movies and steer clear of saddling serious issues with romance.
