One truly exceptional movie that colorfully depicts situation in Soviet Russia in 1950's. Not only this movie shows all the stupidity of communist ideology (and any ideology in particular), it also in vivid manner shows how far would mother do to protect its child. Numerous personal dramas, love affairs of the two main characters and general tension that could be felt in the air, make this movie so exciting. Remarkable acting skills of the main characters made this film one of the most impressive I've ever seen. For Catherine Deneuve, Oleg Menshikov and Sandrine Bonnaire this were probably one of the best roles of their lives. Try to get this movie and don't make pop-corns - you'll need handkerchiefs instead!
