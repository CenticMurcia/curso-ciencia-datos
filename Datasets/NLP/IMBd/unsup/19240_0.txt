Maybe it is because my expectations were too high that I'm a tad disappointed now I've finally seen it.<br /><br />Of course I understand the tongue-in-cheek mood set for this movie. Indeed this is a funny movie, with some very interesting visual effects during gun fights these visual gags resemble similar ones from Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead. But by no means this is an archetype western like I read in one review (someone wrote that this movie was some kind of lesson on how to do westerns)<br /><br />In a ranking of westerns in which John Ford's The Man who Shot Liberty Valance is 10/10, Sergio Leone's Once upon a Time in the West 9/10 Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch 8/10 Tears of the Black Tiger is 5/10 or at the very most maybe 6/10. On the other hand if you don't compare it to those summits, Tears of the Black Tiger deserves 7/10. Of course we don't need to compare this movie to those masterpieces mentioned above; I've only established the unjust comparison as a guide intended to help western-buffs to have a quick and overall idea of this movie) <br /><br />Regarding the actors, the over-acting, operatic style chosen it doesn't seem to work always with all the actors. Regarding the saturated colors it is nothing more than that, they're not a feat of cinematography or post-production; those colors can be achieved very easily during color timing. <br /><br />The songs are quite cool and the main actress is a not only beautiful but also she can act, the same can be said of the actor who plays the main male character, he's handsome and a good actor as well.<br /><br />To conclude, this is a movie I recommend to see, not only because otherwise you'll never be able to boast you have seen a Thai western which is always a strange thing to see but also because is an entertaining movie with a couple of fine touches of comedy .
