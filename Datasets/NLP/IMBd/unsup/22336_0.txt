This was the first time I saw that movie, but I'll comment while the good impression still there. I didn't understand why I'd never notice when movies like this are release in Mexico till I saw movies like Minotaur, Anaconda 2, Snakes on the plane/train, etc. <br /><br />I like when I'm not expecting anything pleasurable or funny in a movie and then they come with this. This is a very well done movie, action-packed, nice drama and the best part: Its not senseless.<br /><br />Simple like this: Kainan is a traveler from another world/galaxy/universe, who used to be a member of a greedy and conqueror kind (very similar to the humans), whose starship crash into our world, in the Vikings Age, bringing with him a violent and uncontrollable creature (a "Godzilla" looked Dragon) named Moorwen, thats searching revenge against the exterminator of his breed. Afther Kainan is accepted by a Viking community that is being attacked by the Moorwen, he decide to help them kill that beast by the old way (no guns).<br /><br />Probably the special effects seems to be very old, like ten years ago, but the action is not affected for it. I'd like the way the Moorwen was made, in some cases it almost look cleaver. Its not the typical killer creature and if its not a completely serious matter in the movie... well, I guess the name of the movie is Outlander, not Outlander and the Moorwen. <br /><br />And about the outlander, I think that Jim Caviezel is to much for the role. He did a good job and he brings some prestige to the film (not enough, thought). He plays Kainan, the alien guy who become prisoner of the Viking who hate him and reject him. At the beginning he's just trying to warn the beautiful King's daughter (Sohpia Myles) from the trouble they're facing with. Time after, he falls in love with her, he becomes part of the village and earn the King's trust, and thats why he fight for their protection. Thats all the drama I need, not the perfect drama of course, but this is not a perfect film, just way to good. The action is the best reason to watch this film... and maybe the best is see it thinking it will sucks, it work for me. <br /><br />Again, this s just the first impression but like I said, I was not expecting the best picture, just a few action, a few drama and how to spend my time. Ya, I like it.
