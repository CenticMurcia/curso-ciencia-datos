i am really interested if the screenwriter of this film got paid. Cos this film is a copy of a good french film directed by Luc besson. and i mean copy, well there were some differences like the gender of good/bad guys or the city but everything was the same, only there was more shooting and sex. ending scene? total copy of the ending of Taxi by Luc Besson. i and gonna write everything down here , just watch this film: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0152930/ PS: The RIAA tries to teach us about copyright? man then what about film, a copy! Dam, i don't wanna get vulgar so i gonna end this. Thah film would be good if it would come 7 years early, now its not good nor original.
