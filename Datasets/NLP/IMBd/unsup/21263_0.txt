Young innocent from Chicago travels down South to stay with her wealthy cousin, a society shark with an alcoholic husband who is planning on busting up the engagement between her former lover and a terrified girl who also lives in the mansion. Though based on a novel, "Queen Bee" looks and sounds like a stage play (sub-Tennessee Williams), with arch overacting by everyone and only a smidgen of really memorable lines. Joan Crawford wear some fancy gowns, but this isn't an attractive role for her. The character interaction is drowsy and sluggish, and the plot-turns are occasionally confounding, outdated or hoary. There's an interesting plot-thread involving a cruel nanny who gives Crawford's Queen a run for her money, but she inexplicably vanishes. The film is drawing-room bitchery, yet with only minimal camp appeal; still, it's hardly enjoyable even on that level since nobody here appears to be having any fun. ** from ****
