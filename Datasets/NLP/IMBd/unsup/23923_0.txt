One of my all-time favorite movies and, I believe, Woody Allen's best film.<br /><br />What sets this film apart for Allen is the special warmth he has for the era and the characters that populate it. Recently reliving the experience on DVD, I was amazed at how every scene seems to hit a bullseye...both as individual vignettes and ultimately weaving together to make the overall quilt. <br /><br />It is a film that celebrates the glorious quirkiness of our own families and the wonderful stories that individual lives can tell. <br /><br />It is also a loving tribute to the medium of radio, which has ultimately been destroyed by FCC deregulation. It's nice to think of it in the days when it enriched the imagination of everyone listening.<br /><br />Guy LeBow's bit with the increasingly handicapped pitcher and Mia Farrow's brush with the mob over an italian dinner are priceless. But this is a film laden with jewels. <br /><br />
