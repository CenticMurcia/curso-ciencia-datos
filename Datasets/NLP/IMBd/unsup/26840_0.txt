Who was behind the murder of progressive Swedish leader Olof Palme in 1986? More than twenty years after the deed, the crime remains unsolved. This movie avoids naming real names behind the murder, but it suggests an international right wing conspiracy. The movie is shot as a thriller and the main characters are a Swedish police officer who suspects something big and ominous is going to happen in his country and tries unsuccessfully to prevent it, a mysterious but strangely charming British contract killer ready to pull the trigger, and a beautiful Swedish journalist whose choice of lover ends quite badly for her. I found this movie quite interesting, even though I'm not Swedish and I don't know a lot about Swedish politics.
