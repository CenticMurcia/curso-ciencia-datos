I saw this movie at a film festival before it was released to the general public and poor Nicole Kidman got boo-ed by a lot of the people who had come to see the movie.<br /><br />I eventually went to see it again when it was finally released to the general public.<br /><br />I can't believe how uptight Americans can be about anything and everything involving sex and sexual situations. What are their hang-ups about such things ?<br /><br />People were too worried about the movie appearing to condone child pornography instead of watching the movie for what it was actually about: a movie about death, mourning, and re-incarnation.<br /><br />Since I practice Budism, I was glad to see the issue of re-incarnation brought up in such a mainstream movie. The story is very gripping and holds you to the edge of the seat the entire time.<br /><br />I also liked the fact that there is very little dialogue in the movie. Sometimes, too many words and unnecessary conversations can get in the way of a great story.
