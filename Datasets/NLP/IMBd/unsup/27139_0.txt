Unfortunately the title of this movie isn't an invitation but a reference to the plot, in which the ever-annoying Ernest P. Worrell (Jim Varney) is given a pair of magical trainers and helps his city league basketball team win a tournament. Once again Jim Varney is so unfunny that my TV switched itself off in protest, and the brain dead script isn't any better, spouting half-baked 'be yourself' homilies and boring us with a clumsy sub-plot involving a scheming promoter. The already misconceived sequences in which Ernest uses his magic shoes are worsened by cack-handed direction that shows us shots of an amazed crowd to cover up the lack of ingenuity in the visual effects department but fumbles what little action we do see. Unbelievable that there's an audience for these films.
