Disguised as cops, three black crooks steal a big amount of cash after killing five syndicate runners and two policemen The New York police and the Mafia react with immediate concern <br /><br />Tough police veteran Captain Frank Mattelli (Quinn) resents the intrusion of Lieutenant Pope (Kotto), a black detective, in the case, while Mafia boss Don Gennaro (Frank Mascetta) sends his paranoid son-in-law, Nick D'Salvio (Anthony Franciosa), to reassert control over the Harlem branch and see that the money is recovered <br /><br />The black syndicate, headed by Doc Johnson (Richard Ward) and his assistant Shevvy (Gilbert Lewis), rejects D'Salvio, while promising only token help, and accuses Mattelli, who has been on the take from Johnson for years <br /><br />Anthony Quinn plays well the ageing detective who has long ago perceived that all his efforts are not going to do more than raise the very small part of the cover of crime, but he is not above taking a bribe from a racketeer His method of dealing with a reluctant witness is to hit hard first and ask questions laterThe rigorously legal approach to police work, as exemplified by Yaphet Kotto, is not for Quinn This is his territory, his little kingdom, and he keeps the peace as best he knows
