I like the action-flick from No Limit "Hot Boyz" with Silk The Shocker but this is almost pure garbage.<br /><br />I love hoodcomedies like FRIDAY & DON'T BE A MENACE TO SOUTH CENTRAL but this is not very funny. AJ JOHNSON is a annoying Chris Tucker-wannabe but unlike Chris Tucker AJ is NOT funny. Master P is the worst rapper ever to be in a movie, he couldn't act even if his life depended on it.<br /><br />I rate it 3/10 it has some fun moments but for the most parts it don't
