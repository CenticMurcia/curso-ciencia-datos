ATTACK the GAS STATION is a very enjoyable movie from the koreans. The movie has a very different feel to it from most comedy i seen. The koreans has a very different aproach to comedy. When you see the title name it might sound retarded or something. What funny about robbing a gas station................Well when you watch the movie your going to fall in love with charaters i mean these Guy dont care about nothing. IT show us the past of each character on how they deal with society which is the paint guy, BULLdozer my favorite, the head leader and a guy with long hair.<br /><br />These four misfits are just bored and they decided to rob the gas station for fun and they get into alout of trouble with gang members, with the police and you would be like man i wish i was there . This movie is just amazing. I really enjoyed when the hostages has to fight each other when bulldozer is feeling bored. JUst watch this movie if you want to have a good time.
