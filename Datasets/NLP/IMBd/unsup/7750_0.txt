I watched this on BBC 2 a short while ago and thought it was brilliant. The 80's look in the movie looked dead corny but that was the time. I was surprised when I looked at the TV Mag and they gave it 1 star. I was shocked.Anyway The movie is about a young guy Jake Kesey (Played By The then unknown Charlie Sheen) who has been killed by a gang of street racers lead by Packard Walsh (Played by Nik Cassavetes). But Know he has risen from the dead with a new face and to seek revenge bringing with him this high powered car called "The Turbo Interceptor" and one by one he gets them all. He also has a love interest Keri (Played by Sherilyn Fenn) who was once his girlfriend when he had a different face.On to more things the soundtrack is Fantastic. The Main Song "Where's the Fire" by Tim Feehan is great 10/10. My other favourite songs are "Secret Loser" by Ozzy Osbourne , "Hold On Blue Eyes" by LaMarca , "Never Surrender" by Lion and the score itself. The stunt driving was very very good especially the interceptor and Packards Chevy Corvette going Head to Head. I also liked the old SFX. To finish off This is a great Friday night movie watch out for Clint Howard (Rughead , Who played the guy Johnstone in The Austin Powers movies. and did the Voice for The little Elephant in Disneys "The Jungle Book.). Great slice of 80's cheese.
