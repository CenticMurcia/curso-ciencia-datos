Saw this movie screened at the Garden State Film Festival in Asbury Park, NJ on 3/4/08. The release title is "The Flyboys". This film was the premiere showing at the event.<br /><br />I loved it. Great storyline and acting, excellent blend of emotion and action. The entire audience was fully engaged from start to finish.<br /><br />Producer/Director Rocco DeVilliers answered questions from the audience after the screening... two details remained with me... the film was done with a $2M budget, and it has been shopped to the majors with all taking a pass. Big thumbs UP to the first detail, and a big thumbs DOWN to the second. As someone said earlier, somebody should lose their gig for not picking up on this gem!<br /><br />This is a movie I will buy on DVD for repeated viewing, though I will DEFINITELY have to see it again on the large screen.
