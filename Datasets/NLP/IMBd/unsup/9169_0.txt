This movie is one of the few, if not the only Colombian production that I can feel proud of, it tells a story close to our culture and our collective personality in a psychedelic and frenetic tone that reminds us of Fernando Meirelles's "Cidade De Deus".The movie is filled with creative film-making and literary reflections, and the various outcomes are usually pumped with an irony that makes it amazingly realistic, and often put that slightly sadistic smile on your face. the wit and crudity of Aljure in representing the particular things that makes us Colombians is overwhelming,and is truly revealing at some times.Don't let other comments bump you out, this really is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen.
