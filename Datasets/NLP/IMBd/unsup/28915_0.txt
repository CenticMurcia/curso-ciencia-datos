The movie was good in the material it was trying to get across. I agree with the first reviewer for the most part. I don't understand why no one was charged and convicted of a hate crime. My eight year old son was watching it with me and at the end of the movie he said, but they did hate her Mommy. As for her family, I find that many people do not realize how much being raised in a different culture plays a role in our life. Gwen's grandmother was not only Latina but a religious Latina. We would hope that religion would bring us tolerance but most wars begin because of religion and who believes they are more right. But I stray. Yes she was ashamed and intolerant but she loved her grandson. She believed he was born a boy and that he could be "fixed." But I don't believe she would meant to hurt him. It was just a lack of understanding on her part. My parents and grandparents are the same. They will stop talking to you over less, take pregnancy.
