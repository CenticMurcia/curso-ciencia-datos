Yes, it's true. This movie was awful and if I could get my money back I would. It was the kind of film that if you could go back in time to help out the screenwriter's, producers and the director and even Bruce and mos def you would. The pacing was wrong, the structure and plot lines were so lame and predictable.....Its like they took a bunch of different cop movies;copland, Narc, die-hard and yes even speed, and put them into one. Quite poorly I might add. And as annoying and pathetic of an actor mos def was, he was the best part about the film.<br /><br />The people in charge; the director, producer, writer(s) should be ashamed for recognizing what kind of crap they were creating. Hope the paycheck was worth it.<br /><br />Let me revert. AWFUL!!!!!
