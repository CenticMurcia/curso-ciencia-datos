Reading some of the reviews here reminds of some critic reviews of various children's movies, wherein they complain about childish plots, low humor or movies that didn't hold their attention, forgetting that they are, in fact, reviewing a children's movie.<br /><br />This movie falls into similar areas, although it's clearly not a children's movie. It is meant to be a spoof, a parody, and it pokes fun at all kinds of people, be they Asian, Caucasian, African-American, Italian, or what have you. It's not meant to be an Oscar candidate. It's meant to be plain silly, slapstick fun. And in that regard, it's perfect.<br /><br />No, Yune looks nothing like Bruce Lee. No, he's not even Chinese. But therein lies the humor. It's as much a send-up of Western stereotypes of Asians as anything (ever watch the "Average Asian" skits on MadTV with another Korean, Bobby Lee?).<br /><br />Overall, I have loved this movie every time I've seen it (although the sequel isn't quite the classic), and I would rate it as a fall - out - of - my - seat - and - wet - myself type of comedy. You just have to let your mind go and enjoy it for what it is. Pure, silly, goofball slapstick... :)
