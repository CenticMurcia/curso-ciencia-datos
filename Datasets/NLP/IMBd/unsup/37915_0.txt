This is the single worst film ever made. Please do not see it.<br /><br />The problems with this film are principally with the writing, directing, acting and editing.<br /><br />Of these problems, though, the writing and directing are the most serious. This movie is narrated and even with this hackneyed device it makes almost no sense at all. The plot is paper-thin and there is no character development at all. The dialogue sounds as if it had been written by someone who'd once been told about human interaction but hadn't ever experienced it.<br /><br />The direction is sloppy and underscores the fundamental lack of identity this film suffers from. It's neither comedy, nor drama. The "jokes" (THAT teeth gag) are old and flimsy and the drama (really ugly violence) is completely out of character and largely non-sensical.<br /><br />I can't go on as it's making me angry, again. I want my time back. This movie is an insult to the medium.
