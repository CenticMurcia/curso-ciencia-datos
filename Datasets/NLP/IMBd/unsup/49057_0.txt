No question that this movie is made very well. Good acting by everyone, good environments, much realism (no surprise !), a little fun and craziness, a little romance and marriage, a little of this and that.<br /><br />And the movie tries its best to be entertaining. The romance of the marriage couple is portrayed in a very, very realistic way, for example, I think that was the best part of the movie. And if you know more about money than I, maybe you will understand what really happened there at the stock market - the movie tried to explain that, but it was too fast for me.<br /><br />But it's most of the time really boring as hell because you know what will be the end after five minutes of the movie. And it's sometimes even more boring because its made that perfect. And for people which know about the Neeson case, it will be even more boring, for they know the end before the movie even starts.<br /><br />In the sum, I don't think I can recommend this movie, sorry.
