I really don't see why people like this program if it makes absolutely no sense and absolutely everything about it is dark and foreboding. This show is humorous only to those who enjoy the dark comedies and evil feelings that Zim projects. Absolutely nothing about this is interesting to those with more...refined taste. I watched this program and felt that Zim's character has no niceties about his character, and everything about him and the rest of the cast is evil and foreboding. It appears that everything on this show is evil and there are never any blue skies or any feelings of positive emotion that is not stemmed to some evil victory for the villain or the so called "hero", Dib.<br /><br />Simply put, this show is a waste because apart from there being no good within any of the characters in the show, it seems to bring absolutely nothing to the table. It seems that this show consists of an alien from the "Irken" race of aliens sent out to conquer a planet and make the inhabitants of said planet slaves to the Irken race. Zim only got where he is in the story lines because he was a pest to the race's leaders.<br /><br />This show has no appeal to those of us with a refined sense of humor and I thus spit on it and all who enjoy it, for the simple reason that it only conveys dark humor and insanity of the most vulgar variety. <br /><br />My personal critique: Invader Zim is the show which the forsaken dark humored fellows have eked out.
