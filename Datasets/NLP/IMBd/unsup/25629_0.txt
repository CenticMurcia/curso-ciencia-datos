It's no Casablanca, or a Godfather 2 for that matter, but it's not that bad either. In that mockumentary taste that has been made popular by movies such as "Waiting for Guffman" and "A Mighty Wind", "A Day Without a Mexican" chronicles the state of California through a short period of time in which all Mexicans (Mexican Americans, Illegal Mexican Immigrants, etc) disappear. Actually, they're gone for more than one day, but hey who's picky about the name when the idea itself is pretty strange.<br /><br />California comes to the realization that Mexicans are here to stay and that they are needed just as much as anyone else. The movie itself provides some interesting informational tidbits throughout, and plenty of lighthearted laughs, such as a scene where the Los Angeles Dodgers will be handicapped because of the number of Latino players they have missing, but the NBA says the Lakers will be fine. Lots of one-liners in this movie, and you don't have to be Hispanic or speak Spanish to laugh or appreciate this film.<br /><br />This also marks the last project of the late Mexican Telenovela actor Eduardo Palomo, whom most recently was seen by an American audience played the role of Cpt. Lazareno in the television series "Kingpin".<br /><br />Not an Oscar winner, but worth taking a look. Especially if you're in California and you want to see many different parts of our cities on the big screen.
