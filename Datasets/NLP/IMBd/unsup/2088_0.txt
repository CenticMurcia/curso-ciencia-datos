Knowing that Lon Chaney Jr. played the Wolf Man and that Burgess Meredith played Penguin on the old "Batman" TV series (plus Rocky's trainer), it might seem hard to imagine them co-starring in a serious movie. But "Of Mice and Men" comes out very well done. In this adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel, the two actors bring to life the retarded Lennie Small and the self-standing George Milton, respectively. On the farm where they get hired, one can easily see the hierarchy inherent in society: the workers forced to do the most degrading labor; the African-American ostracized from everyone else; the Chinese servant; and the woman (Betty Field) forbidden from having her own life. In the midst of everything, George has to look after Lennie, who proves very dangerous to himself and others.<br /><br />So, this is definitely a movie that I recommend. Even if Betty Field's performance comes across as mildly silly, that doesn't dampen the movie. Very well done.
