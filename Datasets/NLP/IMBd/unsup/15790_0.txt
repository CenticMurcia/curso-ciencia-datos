For the Bible Tells me So by Daniel Karslake is a very powerful documentary about five very different, though highly religious families each raised in different denominations of the Christian Church, and how these families deal with the knowledge that one of their children is a homosexual. Reactions from the parents range from accepting and loving in the case of Chrissy and her family, to utter rejection in the case of Anna and her mother. Overwhelmingly the initial reaction of the families was shock; however, in most of the cases parents were able to educate themselves about what it means to be gay or lesbian, and they became accepting of their children. The point that this film is trying to make is that many people, Christians in particular, are ignorant about the facts of homosexuality and hide behind a few, outdated lines of the Bible and declare it an "abomination." For the Bible Tells Me So strongly emphasizes the need to be accepting of gays and lesbians, and educate oneself about homosexuality. Daniel Karslake is in fact a gay man so he relates to a lot of the issues that his subjects had to deal with. Karslake says that when he first came out to his parents he said that his dad used to call his answering machine and leave Bible verses on the machine. He finally had to confront his dad and say "this is between you and me, not us and God." The music is a combination between religious songs and songs of acceptance. A lot of the time the images were not literal depictions of what was being said, but images of related things or things that could be metaphorical. Photographs were also used to depict the children and their families in the past. It is definitely a very powerful, and eye-opening movie, and I feel that everyone should see this film, no matter what what their stance on homosexuality is.
