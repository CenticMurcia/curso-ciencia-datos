The documentary style understatement used in this picture makes a welcome change from the usual encountered in other films of this type. There is some fabulous photography and very lightly and subtly sketched character portrayals. Altogether fascinating and unconventional I should think it would repay many repeated viewings. The emotion controlled as it is comes through all the more effectively.The Christmas scenes amongst the prisoners were very effective and the battle scenes conveyed confusion and small acts of heroism shining through. Who cares if they used an American ship for Graf Spee - some people are so pompous - its a superb picture.
