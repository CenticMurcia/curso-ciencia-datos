There can be a deal of ambivalence in the relationship between cop and prostitute.Being a prostitute is not in itself an offence.Soliciting for the purpose of prostitution is an offence,running a brothel is an offence,living off immoral earnings is an offence.Nonetheless a cop can have a lot of power over a streetwalker.He can arrest her,hassle her,keep her moving on,blackmail her for freebies,even take money from her.And she has little recourse.Most cops chose to turn a blind eye to all but the most blatant soliciting unless under pressure from above or from concerned citizens.The same goes for sex shows and massage parlours.A few,like Detective Wes Block,are attracted by their defiant sexuality and availability and the freedom they represent to have random uncomplicated sexual relief on tap.Like Block these men are usually separated or divorced,middle - aged and wary of intimacy and commitment. Mr Clint Eastwood gives a first - rate performance as Block,father of two daughters,ashamed of his needs,sometimes loathing what they have turned him into.Only with his kids or his dogs - all capable of unconditional love - does he appear even remotely human. As a serial killer begins to mirror his movements,Block is forced to recognise what he has become. The movie is set in New Orleans which gives Mr Eastwood a chance to commission Mr Lennie Niehaus - former Stan Kenton alumnus - to compose a jazz - heavy score. It is not a movie full of snappy one - liners,dialogue is sparse and significant.Miss Genevieve Bujold is also excellent as the Rape Crisis Centre boss,outwardly a ball - breaker,but wanting to trust this odd cop who offers so many contradictions. Arguably the best performance comes from Alison Eastwood as Block's cusp - of - adolescence daughter. "Tightrope"is a strange rather disturbing movie,but,if you can take it, a rewarding one.
