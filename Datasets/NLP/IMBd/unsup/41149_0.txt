Once in a while I manage to stumble across certain movies that, despite the cool box art, seem to go out of their way to appear unoriginal. Not only did "The Butcher" turn out to be another tired "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" ripoff, it was also as dull as dirt. A group of college friends on their way to Vegas to party, are in a car accident, resulting in the ridiculous evisceration of their fellow lesbian sun-roof flasher (the high point of the movie, might I add). They, of course, set out in search of help and come across a secluded, as well as boarded up farmhouse (closely resembling the Devil's Rejects house, I noticed). From, there they are killed off one by one by a deformed, psychotic madman and his wife while wandering through the house. "The Butcher" contains a handful of the usual, no-talent actors, no gore effects, no surprises or suspense, and enough clich√© moments to fill TWO movies. If you still decide to rent - or God forbid - buy this movie just make sure your fast forward button is working.
