Given the people involved and the unusual, creepy Angus Oblong source material, this show had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it became just another watered-down, bland sit-com full of the same tired sitcom plots and devices we've seen since the 1950s. Uninspired and neutered, the show rapidly became boring. <br /><br />Such a shame, and an almost total waste of Ferrell, Smart, and Adlon.<br /><br />For some reason, the show's producers almost entirely abandoned the macabre theme of the source and turned it into a "wacky, lovable oddballs make their way in an unfair world" clich√© party.<br /><br />Angus Oblong's work is worth a look, but not in this show. Angus Oblong only has one producer credit and only has writing credits for one episode (the first one, probably) so all indications are that he sold out creative control. <br /><br />It shows. This program was nothing special, which is why it's gone.
