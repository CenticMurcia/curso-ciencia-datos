The idea was interesting and the movie was OK at the beginning, then it goes downhill. I mean, it turns boring because it is the same we have seen a million times: A group of people where an unknown entity kills the others one by one.<br /><br />Also the characters are not particularly likable so you don't care if they are killed or not. Characters development is very important but the writer did not pay too much attention to this so each person means the same to you.<br /><br />The movie has some good chilling moments, but it is that kind of flick only enjoyable by teenagers. By the way, there are some cheap SFX at the end that makes you laugh.
