The movie came out in 1947 and my girl friend Virginia Rose and I went to see it together. (Small town girls, we practically lived at the movies). I was eight years old and totally entranced by the title song. I can sing it to this day, but no one seems to want to listen. :) I was beginning to think I was the only person who remembered this movie and am pleased to know I am not alone. I have not seen the movie since, but do wish it would be re-issued so that we old fans could enjoy the music and characters again. June Haver was beautiful and was one of my favorite actresses. I remember being happy when she married Fred MacMurray who was another favorite of mine.
