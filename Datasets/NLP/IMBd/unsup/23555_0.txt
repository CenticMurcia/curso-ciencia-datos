A film both truly innovative and highly engaging....Its one of the greatest films of the era and earned its ranking in the annals of film history. Amazingly good acting by Bassie Love and Hughes....A great example of cinematography from the "Roaring Twenties." The most dramatic and artistic and best era of Hollywood.
