OK people, I'm not clueless. I love good movies and most of my top ten match the top ten of the majority of "professional" (i.e. they don't pay for their tickets OR their popcorn) critics but we part company in a major way when it comes to this movie.<br /><br />I can't think of one positive thing to say about this mess of a movie...strike that, Ed Harris is excellent as always and provides the only thrills in this flaccid thriller!<br /><br />Everything about this movie is extraordinary, and when I say that I am breaking that word into two parts as in EXTRA ORDINARY. The camera-work is pedestrian, the dialog is stilted and unconvincing and the acting, wooden at every turn.<br /><br />If there was ever a sterling example of gratuitous sex and violence this is it. As I said in the beginning, I am not clueless. I realize the film is called "A History of VIOLENCE" so I'm not surprised that there is violence to be had...what surprises me is that even the violence is pulled off without imagination. <br /><br />By now every six year old knows about exploding squibs and fake spraying blood and brain matter. So just being gross isn't good enough anymore, you have to be gross with flair. Obviously David Cronenberg isn't comfortable with his flair either because he exhibits none of it in this cinematic train wreck.<br /><br />And far as the sex scenes go, they could have been left with the dust bunnies on the editing room floor and the film would have been none the worse for it...and that<br /><br />gra·tu·i·tous - adj. Unnecessary or unwarranted; unjustified. is the dictionary definition of those scenes<br /><br />Wait 'til this comes out on DVD and then DON'T RENT IT!
