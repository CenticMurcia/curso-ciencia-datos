We've all seen this type of movie a million times and yet we keep paying to see it again and again. Guy gets his heart broken at a young age, becomes a player, has one night stands until one day he somehow manages to woo the 'one that got away' and they live happily ever after. If I have to sit through one more of these terrible uninspired chick flicks, I just might throw my TV out the window. <br /><br />Matthew McConaughey was his usual laid back, douche bag self and Jennifer Garner could have been played by any number of horse-faced actresses just as well (Sarah Jessica Parker, perhaps?). The only one worth mentioning was Michael Douglas as the sleaze-bag uncle. He brought the only two laughs that I emitted during the whole film. If it weren't for his character, I would have given the movie 0/10 instead of 2/10. <br /><br />I would only recommend this movie to females that are afraid to think for the duration of 90 minutes at a time.
