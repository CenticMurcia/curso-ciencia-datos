If you approach this as what it is, unashamed feelgood family fare then you'll probably enjoy it without necessarily wanting to see it again for a few years. It's basically a morality tale in which good defeats bad and everyone lives happily ever after. In a nutshell - sorry about that - Jimmy Durante with wife and daughter, who haven't got change of a match between them, move into an apartment owned by miser Frank Orth, who deposits $1,500 behind the baseboard each week. The last resident was Jimmy Conklin and his vaudeville act The Great Rupert, a gifted squirrel who returns to the apartment when Conklin releases him, takes up a position behind the baseboard and drops the money into Durante's apartment as fast as Orth deposits it. The twist is that Durante uses it to do good and help those less fortunate. Love interest is provided by Durante's daughter, Terri Moore and Orth's son, Tom Drake and the only jarring note is Moore's unexplained volte-face when she ditches the sugar-daddy she's been dating in favor of Drake's penniless songwriter. This cavil to one side this is a seriously pleasant movie and if families still exist this is the sort of stuff they should be watching en masse.
