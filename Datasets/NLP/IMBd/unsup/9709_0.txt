Bonnie Raitt is one of the finest musicians from the USA. With this concert-registration "Road Tested" she proofs her qualities beyond any doubt. It's an evening full of great songs and beautiful duets with Bruce Hornsby and Jackson Browne. The performances of "come to me" and "feeling of falling" are just fantastic ! It's like she proudly says herself : "That's the band I like" !!
