Although fairly unknown, this is a classic film - period. I watched it for the first time the other night and it has jumped right to my "Top 10" movies of all time. That in itself is saying something.<br /><br />The plot of the film involves a sports salesman named Lenny (played by Charles Grodin, in arguably his finest performance) who rushes into marriage to the first girl he meets in a singles bar. From there, the pair whisk off to Miami Beach for their honeymoon. During the long trip from their native New York, it becomes apparent to Lenny that he has made a monumental mistake.<br /><br />On the newlyweds first day in Miami, Lenny's wife, Lila, ignores his plights for her to put on some sunscreen. In turn, she develops a severe cash of sunburn which forces her to stay inside the hotel room, while a joyous Lenny is free to pursue other things - like courting the beautiful and seductive Kelly (played by Cybill Shepard).<br /><br />This is a poignant, bittersweet film that will have you laughing, crying, and even squirming.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a plus, too.
