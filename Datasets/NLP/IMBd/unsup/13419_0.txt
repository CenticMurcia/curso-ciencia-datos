An atrociously made, acted and dubbed cannibal movie that is also very tame in terms of violence (except for a scene where a crocodile is skinned alive) and nudity (it must have been on the female lead's contract not to have a single nude scene). The "highlights" of the film's stupidity include:<br /><br />A: The poorly integrated stock footage of animals killing each other.<br /><br />B: The lamest attempted-rape sequence you'll ever see.<br /><br />C: A scene of the cannibals having circled around the hero and then attacking him one-at-a-time, and him defending himself with karate moves!<br /><br />D: A silly conversation about whether the cannibals have any chances of "adapting to our civilization" ("Well, it's gonna take quite some time"!).<br /><br />E: The already-mentioned axe-boomerang scene, and a terribly edited spear-throwing scene a few seconds earlier.<br /><br />The on-location filming is the only thing that forces me to give this film one star, instead of none. Only for the desperately curious.
