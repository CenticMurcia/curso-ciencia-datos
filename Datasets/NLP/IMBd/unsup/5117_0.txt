An excellent segment to this trilogy involves Roddy McDowall as Jeremy, a never-do-well nephew waiting for his wealthy uncle to die, and leave him his estate.<br /><br />Portifoy, well portrayed by Ossie Davis, is the uncle's faithful butler, who had served him most of his life. When the uncle finally dies, he has bequeathed his estate to Jeremy, but only under duress. Jeremy laughs as he tells Portifoy he will keep him on for $200.00 per month.<br /><br />Portifoy is not happy with the arrangement and decides to stay on just for a short time.There is a painting of the estate and the cemetery is in the back yard. The picture becomes distorted, and Jeremy, each day, becomes more and more terrified, thinking he sees his uncle's corpse rising from the cemetery and coming toward the house.<br /><br />There is a twist at the conclusion, and you will enjoy this episode. 10/10.
