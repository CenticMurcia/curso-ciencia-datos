Sohpie's Choice has got to be the most heartbreaking movie I have seen in a long time. It is a tragic love story between Sophie (Meryl Streep) and Nathan (Kevin Klein) who meet an unsuccessful writer named Stingo. They become great friends and Stingo soon discovers the darkness of Nathan, and Sophie's most heart-wrenching secrets. <br /><br />I'm quite surprised this movie hasn't made it to IMDb's top 250 list, because this should be a movie that is recognized as the best performance from Meryl Streep in film history. Fantastic movie, truly heartbreaking, but very well made.<br /><br />10/10
