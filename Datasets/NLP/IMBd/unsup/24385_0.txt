Colbert is well out of her element here, and cannot carry this tribute to WW II fighting nurses. The sentiment is commendable. The film is disappointing. It goes on and on, practically forever. It pulls no punches about the toughness of the action, which is laudable. But, it also gives us nothing to hold on to.<br /><br />George Reeves and Sonny Tufts are unbearably stiff and feckless in the two leading male roles. Walter Abel is good as the tough commander.<br /><br />I was disappointed when I first saw this, and recently wanted to see if it had improved with time. It hasn't.
