Extremely unpleasant slasher film seems like a relic of another era - of the early 80's, to be exact, when all the "Friday The 13th" ripoffs were made. The only difference is that most of the characters here are normal, not stupid kids, which makes their graphic murders MUCH more repulsive. The director builds some good suspense towards the end, but the film is almost destroyed by the killer's utterly LAME puns ("I'd get a second opinion if I were you") that make you wonder if the screenwriter was a seven-year-old.
