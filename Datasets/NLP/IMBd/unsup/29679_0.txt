The script could have been written by an average Argentinian on a piece of paper, nothing original. Perhaps it causes a certain effect on people outside Argentina, but I can compare it with below-mediocre locally oriented films such as "The Firm" or "Meantime" from the UK. Sorry, this film does not do for me, there is no art behind this socially motivated short story. In the same line of socially motivated films you'll find finer examples on Argentine cinema: "Buenos Aires, Viceversa" or "El Polaquito". I have to believe this film was more an experiment than a full scale movie.
