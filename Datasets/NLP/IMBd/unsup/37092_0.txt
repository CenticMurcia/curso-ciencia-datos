"Amateur" -- Beautiful titles, title music, actors, actresses, sets and locations. But that's all, folks. If only this were a simple noir film! When movie dialog is so flat, so much less than ordinary speech, and so affectedly slow that the viewer hears each line 3 times mentally before it's actually spoken, something is wrong. I kept thinking, "Art, Art, Art, and plenty of it!" When the Avenging Angel fires his gun into a demon's body over and over, it's a perfect example of more is less.
