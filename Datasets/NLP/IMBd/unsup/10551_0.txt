The Life and Times of Tim features just that; the day-to-day life of an ordinary 25 year old New Yorker, trying to talk his way out of horribly embarrassing situations. Tim really has the worst luck, and his dry, dead-pan excuses are the centre piece of this show.<br /><br />I urge you to watch just one story (there are two per episode) as you'll be hooked. The writing is very good. It's a little surreal how things could go so badly but it lends to hilarious situations and dialogue.<br /><br />Give it a chance, like Arrested Development, it won't be appreciated en masse during it's run.<br /><br />With so many animations that are faltering in great humour (I rarely laugh out loud the Simpsons, Family Guy or American Dad any more - South Park still does the business from time to time) This show had me laughing really hard a few times per episode.<br /><br />I've gotten everyone I've shown "Tim" to into the show, which is actually saying a lot. I really hope it gets a second season at least.<br /><br />Enjoy watching!
