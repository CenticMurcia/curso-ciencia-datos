I had read two bad reviews prior to viewing, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I think it easily matches up to the first Eating Out, though they are very different films. Each character held there own, though there are a few standouts, including the reprehensible luminary Mink Stole. Marco Dapper as Troy proved he is not just a pretty face. Was that his over-sized appendage in the modeling scene, seemed like some airbrushing? The trio: Jim Verraros (Kyle), Emily Brooke Hands (Gwen)Rebekah Kochan (Tiffani) stole the show with candid and off the hook deliveries. The notion that the characters in this film were traditionally rooted in stereotypes of the W.& G. variety is wrong. This film turns stereotypes on their heads.<br /><br />Laughed really hard at this movie! <br /><br />Take your friends!!
