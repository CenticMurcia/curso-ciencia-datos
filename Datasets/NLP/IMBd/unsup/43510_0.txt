I was very excited to see this film after all the hype, i was also looking forward to a funny, insightful portrait of 'SUBURBAN MAYHEM' especially having grown up in a place like the one depicted in the film.<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed. I actually found myself bored for the entire length of the film and it only runs for 90mins. I really can't understand how people are saying this is thrilling or a fantastic Austalian film. It is actually very weak, boring with not much mayhem.<br /><br />I thought Barclay was outstanding but the script and direction was sloppy, the 'documentary' format annoyed me, totally unnecessary.<br /><br />I can see what was trying to be achieved but the script lacked a real depth and direction and i found the characters to be two dimensional.<br /><br />I don't know who is at fault here, the direction or the writing, maybe it was both - but somebody missed the mark completely.
