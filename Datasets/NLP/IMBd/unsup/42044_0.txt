There's a great story there somewhere, unfortunately, this wasn't it. Very poorly acted, it reminded me of one of those Christian films where the underlying theme is "Trust in God, He's great." I'd love to see a real director and screen writer tackle this story because it's a great one (read "Pistol: The life of Pete Marovich"). This one I couldn't finish. The basketball scenes were real slow so the kid could make the under the leg passes and trick shots. I'm sure they spent a lot of time on them and they looked totally rehearsed. At no point do you actually believe a real basketball game is going on.<br /><br />It's was a total fluff piece but the worst thing of all was the narration. The guy who was supposed to be Pete as an adult who was narrating the film was WHISPERING THE ENTIRE TIME. I had to stop and rewind a couple times because I couldn't hear what he was saying. Was he recording his voice over on a golf course? Why did he speak so low? Tell me that wasn't the best they could do for someone who is simply NARRATING the film???? I hated this movie.
