I definitely think this kind of projects are the best ways for an aspiring filmmaker to learn the trick...actually I would like to see this type of films made in my own country. I'm also a fan of B-horror like Braindead or Killer Klowns from Outer Space. I rented Swamp Zombies!!! with the intend to just have a fun time and not expecting a masterpiece.<br /><br />But even those expectations were too high. I don't say I could do this better, but this was one of the most boring films I've seen in quite a while. I really can appreciate the idea of a zombieflick with lots of gore, kung-fu and nudity in it. But except for the fun the director took on the nudity, 'Swamp Zombies!!!' just didn't work.<br /><br />Let's be honest: two hours is just too long for a zombiemovie. Kungfu-scenes were overlong, lack of continuity and terrible acting made this film quite a boring ride, instead of the fun roller-coaster-ride I had hoped to see.
