Oh dear. ADS is just not that funny. And it could easily be... and I shudder to know what the budget was given the CGI content vs the $130,000 cinema gross (which may have come from only being screened in Baltimore)...... As with CECIL BE DEMENTED here is a hilarious idea that just becomes ragged and frantic in order to justify the production..... I am sure any of the leading cast earned more than the entire cinema gross in just one pay packet. This might have been funny in 1979 but in the era of JACKASS and American PIE #5 or mainstream porncomedies in cinemas ADS needs to be actually funny instead of well known stars being rude. I love CRYBABY and HAIRSPRAY because they are kind in their exposure of the unloved winning, whereas ADS is just a waste of stars saying "vagina". What a ghastly silly waste of your time. If John Waters wants to still be subversive in 2007 why not make an ironic Gen X comedy film called 'A CLOCKWORK CHUCKY"... or FERRIS BUELLER'S UNEMPLOYED ......think about it.... hmmmmm?
