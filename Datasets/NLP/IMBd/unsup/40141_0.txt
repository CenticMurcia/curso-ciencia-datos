I think this movie must be part of a series; having seen the 'part IV' in the title here at IMDb makes some of the movie make more sense (i.e., the baby-killing reference mentioned in another post). It's fitting that Corben Bernsen portrays a lawyer in this movie, since that's what I knew him best as (from L.A. Law), but I think he does a fine job in this movie. His presence was the best part of this movie and Mr. T did indeed provide some comic relief. Other than that, the production apparently had a low budget based on the props; the courtroom looked like something out of Star Trek; the defendant's hair was alternatively blonde or high-lighter yellow, depending on the lighting. I could go on but I agree with the previous poster, please make GOOD Christian movies.
