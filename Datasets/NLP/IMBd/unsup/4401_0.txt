Total garbage. I've lived in Pittsburgh for 3 years now and was excited to see this movie based on the positive feedback I had read. The night before renting "bitch" I had a lively discussion with friends and colleagues about the number of fun and interesting movies that have come out of this great city, including "Night of the Living Dead (1968)" "Robocop (1987)", "Gung Ho (1986)" and of course "Striking Distance (1993)". Maybe considering an indie alongside these movies was my first mistake.<br /><br />The dialogue is painfully incoherent and boring. The acting is pathetic. The camera angles and overall cinematography were horrible. The whole concept of the guy behind the camera interacting with the main characters does not work at all. I could not get through this movie and recommend that you do not bother with this hack.
