This is my first time posting. I just watched Bride Wars on HBO. I loved it. Sometimes people take movies too seriously. It was not meant to be a Oscar worthy movie. It was just supposed to entertain you for 90 minutes.<br /><br />Yes, females can be catty. But the movie showed how two best friends can work out their differences. Every little girl dreams that her wedding day is going to be perfect. Some women do go a little crazy when it comes to their wedding day. Anne and Kate played their roles to the hilt.<br /><br />The dresses were beautiful. It was great to see Candice Bergmon in a movie again.
