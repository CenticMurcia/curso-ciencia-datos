Well well well Satish Kaushik is one of the funniest actors on Hindi screen at least in some films he was damn hilarious though he got annoying later-on<br /><br />As a director he made social dramas like HUM AAPKE DIL MEIN REHTE HAI The recent hit TERE NAAM and some good films Comedy is considered one of his liabilities in his directed films be it HUM AAPKE DIL MEIN REHTE HAI and HAMARA DIL AAPKE PAAS HAI In TERE NAAM it was good but in this film he tries to make a complete comedy and ends up making a poor cousin of David DHAWAN films<br /><br />The film starts quite well but suddenly becomes a sad caricatured over the top bullshit comedy<br /><br />In short, Imagine a plot less film with comedy so forced and childish that it makes Govinda films classics?<br /><br />Imagine a film where Akshaye Khanna is hamming like a clown??????? Imagine a film where he wears the worst co loured clothes which make Govinda's clothes a style statement? Imagine a film where Aftab just comes and goes and you forget him? Imagine a film where Malika and Ayesha get to your nerves with their too bold and fake attitude and simple roles and fake acting respectively?<br /><br />Imagine a film where actors think making funny faces is being funny?<br /><br />Some funny one- liners can make a good comedy?????<br /><br />Overall a disaster barring some Suneil Shetty portions and his few lines the film is unbearable Suneil does manage to make you laugh with his Bhaigiri but that isn't much
