The director's debut, "Pusher", was an excellent tribute to American Cinema (Abel Ferrara, Scorsese) and a portrait of the drugworld of Copenhagen but "Bleeder" is much more personal, mature and grim film. The story deals with the relationship of four friends (& B-filmfanatics); a videostoreowner, his helper, a soon-be-a-dad and his girl's violent brother. Things gets complicated between the last two when the guy starts beatin' his pregnant girl and the brother's threatin' to retaliate. When the girl loses her unborn baby after a beatin' things get VERY ugly! There's no real reason for the violence which makes the mood of the movie extremely creepy. The characters and dialogue are very believable and impossible to forget. The few (very) violent scenes are so unexpected that you'll jump in seat. The film are also filled with nods to exploitation cinema (clip from Lustig's "Maniac" & "Vigilante", "Andy Warhol's Frankenstein" etc.). It's made on a low budget but is beautifully filmed (and acted) with a great glampunk soundtrack. "Bleeder" is a movie that gets under your skin for days so check out this masterpiece.
