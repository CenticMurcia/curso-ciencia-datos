this would have to be the worst movie ever by far!! the movie is plagued with bad acting, terrible editing and shocking direction, oh! and not to mention the storyline!!! yuk!! this film is an insult to the film it ripped off, children of the corn was a great horror flick but this was just another writer who did'nt want to think of a story all by himself so he decided to rip up a cult classic. this film was actually bought out on DVD in Australia and stupid me wanting to buy, which i did!, thinking that it might be a good horror film but noooooooooo!!! i was left bemused and annoyed that i wasted my time and money into this terrible piece of d grade garbage!!!
