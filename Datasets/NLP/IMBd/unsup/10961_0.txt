It was a snowy Sunday and I went to see this film because I am missing New York so much out here in Reno, Nevada. The dialogue is smart and witty. The acting is real, the directing first rate. Ed Burns reminds me of a young Woodie Allen without the neurosis (which I am glad to be rid of). I really didnt want the film to end. On that note I would have made a few editorial choices a bit differently but otherwise, Dennis Farina,Ed Burns, Turturro, and the fabulous women (*especially that beautiful actress whose name escapes me who played Maria). I found myself laughing way too loudly and then the rest of the audience seemed to realize this was funny. It is I suspect a very New York movie with a unique New York humor but it was a little gem. I think it rates an Academy Award Nomination.
