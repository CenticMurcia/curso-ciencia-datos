I gave this movie a 1 out of 10, only because 0 is not an option. First up, it's an attempt to cash in on the popularity of reality television. Just like Series 7: The Contenders - which is brilliant, or House of Nine - which was still pretty good, you get a reality TV show based on people having to kill each other to win. Except this movie is crap. It relies too heavily on flashes of gore - which, to be honest, are not much - especially to justify the claims of sadistic gore - and little on any actual thought process. I'm not gonna go into details and post any spoilers - watching the movie itself will spoil any self respect you might have. All I will say is that Ed Furlong was ridiculous in Terminator 2; he was a complete douche bag in American History X - which means that he can only really go up. Except, he filmed this movie and established a new low for himself.
