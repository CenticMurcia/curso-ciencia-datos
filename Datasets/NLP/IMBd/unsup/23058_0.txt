Think Dangerous Minds and Any Given Sunday mixed with gags and humour and you've got Wildcats: an 80s comedy starring Mrs Kurt Russell herself, Goldie Hawn who plays a high school sports teacher turned American Football coach. At first, the guys take a disliking to her, but soon afterwards, her efforts pay off as they win match after match.<br /><br />The film also launched the movie careers of ex-Cheers actor, Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes and rapper, LL Cool J. Okay, it may not win brownie points on originality alone, but Wildcats is an entertaining and amusing effort, with a somewhat impressive performance by Hawn herself. There are some silly moments, but hey this was the 80s after all! The hair, the fashion, the music, the movies ah the memories! In all, a feel good movie and for a sports flick, not that bad at all. And the rap is somewhat amusing and a tad cheesy too. Worth purchasing on DVD
