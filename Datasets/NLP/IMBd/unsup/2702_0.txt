This is one of the most unusual coming-of-age dramas I've seen; a fascinating exploration of a teenager on the brink of discovering her own sexuality. Laura Dern is fantastic as a 15-year-old Californian girl who is becoming aware that she is no longer a kid. She starts experiencing all kinds of emotions, when a mysterious stranger, who goes by the name of "Arnold Friend" (Treat Williams), decides to take advantage of the situation. At this point, the movie takes a deliciously bizarre turn. If we are to take the last third of the story in a literal manner, the conclusion is both creepy and confusing. But I chose to see Williams' character as a symbol, not as a real person, so the ending struck me as being reflective and very, very interesting. Figuratively speaking, "Friend" seems to be a representation of Dern's transition from childhood to womanhood, not a real person. Anyhow, it is a well-crafted movie, and an excellent showcase for Dern's skills as an actress. Beautifully realized by director Chopra, and highly recommended.
