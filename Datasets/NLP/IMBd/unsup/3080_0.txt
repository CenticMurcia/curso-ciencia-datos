My review gonna be long . [ spoiler] Nick Cherenko is an ancient spetnatz . He lives in a small village with his wife and his son . But one day , a local "godfather" come in the town . A massarce begin . His wife and his son are killed . Nick want a vengeance . He (thinks ) he has killed the godfather . [] 7 years later , Nick lives illegally in Los Angeles , as a Mechanik . A woman want him to come back in Russia to bring her daughter back . Nick refuse first , but change his mind when he discover that the girl has been kidnapped by the "godather". Second film as director , first masterpiece , after a very good first movie .<br /><br />Even if "The Mechanik" is an action movie, it has its drama side . This movie mixes different genre . Drama , action , thriller ....<br /><br />As in "the defender " , violent scenes are really violent . People bleeds violently , and action scenes are really strong . Actors give a real great interpretation . Ben Cross is absolutely incredible . When his favorite hooker is killed , he give us a great drama scene . Dolph is a great director . The photography is really great , the direction is as good . This movie is very good . Very 70's style . One hour and a half of pure entertaining dramatic action .<br /><br />Some directors should learn from him . I hope ( and I'm sure) he will give us other masterpieces like this one .
