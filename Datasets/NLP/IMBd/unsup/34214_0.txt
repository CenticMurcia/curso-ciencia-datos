This is a low budget, indie horror film that takes a downward spiral from the start. This is a haunting tale, but the scares are pretty weak. A writer(Don Wood)and his girlfriend(Christina Campenella)leave the dog-eat-dog days of New York City for a quieter location...Maine. The couple check into a dingy motel and settle down in Room #13. Strange things begin to happen in the one-room apartment and there is no place to run. Having writer's block is nothing compared to unwelcome spirits of former murdered guests of Room #13. Warning...the cover art of the DVD is very misleading and the movie inside is less interesting. Others in the cast: Larry Fessenden, Jamie Sneider and Angus Scrimm.
