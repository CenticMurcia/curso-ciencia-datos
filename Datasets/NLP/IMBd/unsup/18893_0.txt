A heart wrenching movie. Though none of us are free from grief and quilt, some may find this movie too emotional. But for all who venture here, you may find your mind pondering your own lives and loved ones and those closest to you. You may start to think just how fragile we all are. You may consider calling someone, writing someone or praying for someone. Some of you may take a closer look at world events, read a newspaper or for that matter avoid one. But if you watch this movie you will feel the need to preform some action of good faith, if not just looking at your own. I found the shocking scenes in this movie did not shock me and the sad thing is they should have. Tomorrow when I look out the window, walk down the street, have a cup of coffee. I will savor the moment with more awareness and thankfulness. As Leonard Cohen said "It's through the cracks that the light gets in"
