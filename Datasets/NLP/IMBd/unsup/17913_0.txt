Brat 2 (Brother 2) is a sequel to the 1997 film Brat (Brother). I am a fan of Bodrov and enjoyed all the movies he made and has acted in during his unfortunately short career. Without a doubt he was a revolutionary director and actor for Russia's film-making and this film presents him in one of his best roles. To me, this movie is special because I very much love its genre and the way it was presented. It is less realistic than Brat, but contains more action and more memorable moments. Anyone who is willing to look at a life of a simple guy who thinks his life is less important than that of his friends and loved ones will not be disappointed by the presentation of the film. Danila's character is very different and memorable; for me, he is truly an idol and every time I watch the movie I can only wish I had his big heart and bravery. Because I love this film so much I am giving it a perfect score, but disregarding my connection to former USSR I still recommend it highly. Brat 2 10/10.
