SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT, in my opinion, is one of the best comedy/drama/romances I have ever seen. One thing about this movie that made me feel good was when Grace (Julia Roberts) confronted Eddie (Dennis Quaid) for being unfaithful to her. There was only one person I couldn't stand at times, and that was Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick). This was because she kicked Eddie in the groin. Plus, she said some things about him that were not very nice. If I caught my husband red-handed with another woman the way Grace did, I would probably get a divorce, especially if my daughter had seen what was going on. I thought the scenery was beautiful, taking place on a farm with horses and whatnot. In conclusion, I highly recommend this film to all you Julia Roberts or Dennis Quaid fans who have not seen it.
