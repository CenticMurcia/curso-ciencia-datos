This is about the funniest movie I've ever seen. Billy Crystal is perfect as the psychiatrist and DeNiro does wonderful comedy. I don't often laugh out loud in movies--I laughed heartily all through this one. DeNiro's parodies of his own previous movies is wonderful. It's wonderful fluff and I highly recommend it.
