This is almost grade B category in film making - the story is a simple one of an orphan who is attracted to the sea, surrounded by adults who try to keep him from it- no wonder he runs away and steals to get money to hop busses. Dean Stockwell is the boy, Jean Peters (Miss Bland) and Dana Andrews (Mr. Bland) are the on again-off again lovers who may decide his fate. Black and white camera work of Maine harbors is attractive. One 6 minute sequence of a totally implausible rescue during a storm at sea earned an Oscar nom for Special Effects - must have been a very sparse year in this category. An okay film for kids, but nothing special for adults.
