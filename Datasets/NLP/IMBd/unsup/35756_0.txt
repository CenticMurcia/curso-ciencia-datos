Ever wonder why some films have faded from view and are little spoken of? RAWHIDE is a great example and contains many reasons for its general obscurity.<br /><br />Things go wrong the moment Susan Hayward arrives on the scene. This woman cannot act and her character is completely overbearing and obnoxious.<br /><br />This is simply a badly written story made worse by bizarre performances by Hugh Marlowe, Dean Jagger, George Tobias and the thoroughly freakish Jack Elam who is either the highlight or the low-light of the film.<br /><br />Jack Elam gives all to his role with his eyes bugging out, licking his lips and his teeth, sticking out his tongue and his jaw and positioning his head in every freakish position that he can. And he gets close-ups! All he needed was to have his head spin around a la Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST.<br /><br />Hugh Marlowe is awful and doesn't seem to realize he is in a movie.<br /><br />Dean Jagger mutters much of the time as the semi-simpleton of Marlowe's band of gold robbers.<br /><br />George Tobias plays an ethnic in the manner of El Brendel, yet looking like Alfonso Bedoya in THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.<br /><br />Tyrone Power does the best of all with a cookie-cutter character.<br /><br />On the other hand, the location shooting in Lone Pine is very attractive and the digital restoration made the image quality look near to real life, but in black and white.<br /><br />I can't envision myself ever watching this grueling film again.
