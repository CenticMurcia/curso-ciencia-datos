OK I'm going to give you the entire review of how this show has been from start to finish.<br /><br />In the beginning this show was brilliant, witty, dark, and mesmerizing, but as of late its gotten terrible. I'm not exactly sure if they changed writers or what's happened but basically for the first four seasons it was going in a nice escalating pace and then somewhere in the beginning of the fifth it just became dark and stayed that way. I've been watching the last 2 seasons wondering when the're going to do something unpredictable or at least something noteworthy of how the show used to be, and yet nothing's happened. So here's the take on these last few episodes, they are boring, lifeless, plot less, and pointless. It almost feels like the writer just went through a divorce and wants everyone to feel as empty as he does because there's nothing amusing or appealing about these last two seasons. Please for the love of god write something worth watching because this garbage is not even drama.
