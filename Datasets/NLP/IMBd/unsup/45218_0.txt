I was able to only stomach about half an hour of this film before common sense got the best of me and made me press the "Stop" button.<br /><br />It seems the producers had plenty of money to throw at this project, just look at the girls they cast in the various lead roles, but all this ends up being is like a sex-charged female-focused adult version of Spy Kids! The gadgets are pitiful, the script is shocking and the overall production makes even the regular sci-fi series look like they spent a mint on them in comparison.<br /><br />Even the attempts of the writers to take the focus off the storyline and replace it with vacuous sexual tension and, as I mentioned, lesbianism is terrible. Not credible in any way shape or form and does nothing for the storyline.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you to save your money and spend it elsewhere - money can be replaced. Instead I will appeal to you to save yourself wasting the time to even give this film a viewing - you can never get that 30 minutes back!
