I have expected more suspense but what I saw here was boring. Only the first 10 minutes and the last twenty minutes were interesting. The remaining two third played on a real comedy level and has nothing to do with a thriller. Okay I have to admit that the FBI cop was very funny until the end but the story itself was very poor. I am sure that they could have done more about but as I mentioned you have to wait till the last twenty minutes that something happens. Only Lola was very hot in this movie and the nice setting place. Sometimes I had the impression that AFTER THE SUNSET should be a wannabe James Bond movie but it failed completely. Therefore the picture was very fine and clear but all that is not enough to get an average rating. The votes on IMDb are too high with actually 6.0. My wife didn't like it at all and so our vote is 3/10.
