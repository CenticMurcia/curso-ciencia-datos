I was excited for this when it came out. Directed by the person who brought us the underrated House On Haunted Hill, many horror movie veterans (Dorff, Combs, and Kier), and at the time a fresh concept (released just before the Ring and all the other "ghost uses everyday thing to kill you" movies), and a dark atmosphere. So movie starts to begin, things are mixed. Cool death scenes, but scares are nonexistent (and believe me, I'm a wuss at horror movies in the theater and jump at even the fake scares). Use of Rammstein song, major check! But then after the first major death scenes and Dorff decides to check out the website himself, the movie starts to go downhill. Maybe it was because of how confusing the movie got afterwards or my mind just doesn't choose to remember it at all, or maybe even both but I can't remember too much of what happens in the second half right until the predictable climax. The characters are just too uninteresting too, no matter who is playing them. It just ticked me off how Combs was given a crap role, and a small one too. OK, maybe he didn't have a big one in HOHH, but he still owned a lot more than what he does here.<br /><br />So in summary, I guess everyone has a few speed bumps in their career of movies. This is one for Malone, and I hope his next movie will make me bow at his feet and forgive him for the 5 bucks I wasted on this movie
