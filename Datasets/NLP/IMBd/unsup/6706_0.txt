By any hack American filmmaker, the opening narration where it goes into a repeating echo to lead us into a flashback, would be considered fine art, and legitimately treated "ala Harrison Ford's The Fugitive" and thousands of other films. By film historian Truffaut, you know you're in for a wacky, silly comedy, which is unlike any other film he directed. It's a crime this has never been released in the USA, as it's far better than many of his films which are. Also it again pairs Truffaut with actress Lafont, the two hadn't worked together since his and her first film 13 years before.<br /><br />I can't recommend this film enough, it's so much fun, and highly offensive as well.
