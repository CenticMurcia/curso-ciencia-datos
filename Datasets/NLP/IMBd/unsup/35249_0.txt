What were they thinking?! Is this movie a comedy or is it a drama? It looks like it's a comedy--especially in regard to how they marketed the film. The only problem is, it just isn't funny. If it's a drama, there was no tension and the underlying message appears muddled. So, regardless of the intent, it fails on both levels. As a result, it is uninteresting and dull beyond belief. No, now that I think about it, it's VERY easy to believe that this movie is unappealing. So many ex-SNL people (especially the original cast) did MANY totally unfunny movies. Neighbors, Nothing But Trouble, 1941, Dr. Detroit and Funny Farm stand out as prime examples of this curse.<br /><br />Part of my disliking this movie so much may be because I just haven't enjoyed any of the Chevy Chase movies I've seen, whereas many of my extended family members think he is brilliant. However, even they hated this movie and found it annoying, so that says something.
