This was an edge of the chair movie all the way. I started not to watch it because I only liked one of Berringers movies, and that was the one where he made a comedy spoof out "movie cowboys"; forgot the name, but it was all those colored shirts, always clean shaved, and shot the gun out of the outlaws hands with a sixgun from a mile away. This movie showed a different side of the man. Of course,it is always interesting to see Kurtwood Smith but I must say he will always be Norm Stoney to me. That movie made me feel like I wanted to be a part of that hidden Cheyenne camp, away from the traffic, the war, high school shootings, and senseless killings every day all over America. So, for a little over an hour, I was "there". I just didn't get Barbara Hershey!!! Thanks.
