Time to realize movie makers, you can't film books satisfactorily! (Lord Of The Rings is the exception that confirms the law) <br /><br />There is just too much depth, too much! But no... you need to squeeze out a movie of minimal standards with ten(or less) dialog lines per character mixed in with a ludicrous pretty-boy model that makes sad faces that'll is ensured to make all the teenage girls faint. Meanwhile, as I saw these meaningless scenes unfold, I tried not to fall asleep from movies love story.(I don't need to spoil it, you already know how it goes...What did you expect? Originality? Please...)<br /><br />It is just a movie without ideas, which is fine if you want First Blood or Transformers, but this is Jan Guillou work of art for Christ's sakes! The novels were all about religion! About the conflict between different religion, views of life and most importantly: When does religion lose its wisdom and becomes fanaticism and why do men use religion as a cover for their own goals? <br /><br />None of those facts are brought up in the movie, so this review is technically no spoiler. That is the level of lousiness in this movie.<br /><br />The only thing they pulled off was the friendship between the two Cecilias, and that's just a side-story in the book. That's it!<br /><br />Well, its only excuse is that it's a Swedsih movie, which is a terrible excuse. <br /><br />Bad acting, bad directing, bad writing and idiotic battle sequences. Avoid this thing (I refuse to call it a movie any longer) like the characters in it would have avoided the Black Plague. I recommend Kingdom Of Heaven if you need a good Crusade Movie. Action AND ideas! What about that. <br /><br />To finish now, this is THE most pointless feature in the history of historical, epic(not!), adventure cinema, and I've seen Alexander.
