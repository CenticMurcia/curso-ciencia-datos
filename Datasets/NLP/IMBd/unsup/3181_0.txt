Yes, this film has been put together really badly It also has some terrible editing (1967...(moore mouths eight! Look closely, you will see!) Make-up is bad Directing is amateurish However, the film did entertain me. Caine and Moore must cringe when they ever stumble on this! But the tackiness was what made it great. The film tries so hard to be American in parts and it does fall flat on its face, but if someone like Quentin Tarantino had done it, it would have tied your brain in knots...In summary, this is a film for simpletons everywhere. Give it a try, yes It will probably make you cringe, but in one way or another, it will make you smile...Rather like Portugal getting knocked out of world cup. This film is Marmite...You either love it or hate it
