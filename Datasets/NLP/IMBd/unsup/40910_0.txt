Based on previous comments and critical reviews, I went to see this movie. I expected to see a well made documentary about Mozart's life, a composer I love to listen to and whose home I have visited. I was very disappointed. There was nothing new in this movie that made me sit up and take notice. You might learn a little about Mozart's life if you knew nothing, but taken as a whole, I was unimpressed with the details that were presented. You could not get emotionally involved with this genius by watching this movie. The presentation in many respects is unfortunate. Interviewees spoke in their native tongue, no translations were given. Now I know a little German, so I could understand those speakers, but the Italian, French and whatever other languages were spoken were beyond me and I'm sure to most other viewers. There was also no identification of who the interviewees were, so you could not relate to them in any way.
