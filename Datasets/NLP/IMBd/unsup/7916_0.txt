The only reason it didn't get a 1 out of 10 is because you get to see Randy Travis do about a minute's worth of trick gun handling. <br /><br />The plot was completely expected, you can see every dumb move that someone's going to make at least a minute or two before they make it, and you're left with this horrible feeling that you've wasted time that could have been spent...well, sleeping, if nothing else.<br /><br />Who do I see about getting the 90 minutes or so of my life back? I watched it for "free" on a cable movie channel. I would have been very unhappy if I had paid money for it.<br /><br />If you haven't started watching it yet, don't. If you already did, yes, I know. You feel used and stupid. You're not alone, if that's any comfort to you.
