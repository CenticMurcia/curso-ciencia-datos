Send 4 smart ass babes who interact all lesbian with each other for no real reason to a cabin in the middle of no where. Send 4 creepy Texas Chainsaw Massacre type guys to the cabin so they can torture them! Gross shock and blood peppered with attempts at humor. BUT WAIT! The lezbos are vampire witches!?!? YAY! LET THE REVENGE BEGIN!! Throw in a couple of Hillbillies and 2 Keystone cops, dicks getting bitten and shot off an you have the perfect blood and babe gore fest! I feel sorry for all the actresses (and some actors) involved. I now know people will agree to ANYTHING to get a credit on IMDb. Marc Senter as Caleb was very good. (wished his character was in it longer) and kudos getting Al Jourgensens music and some of the special effects (head in microwave for example)...but other than that.......Unless you are a crew or cast member STAY AWAY!
