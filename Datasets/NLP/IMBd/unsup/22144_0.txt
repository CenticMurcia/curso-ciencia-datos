It's wonderful to see family movies coming into the light recently. Jerry Jenkins has done an amazing job of producing a film that has all the elements that a big Hollywood film has. Hometown Legend will make you laugh, it will bring tears to your eyes, and you'll find yourself cheering! The actors were superb, especially the very talented Terry O'Quinn. Even though the storyline is not unique, Mr. Anderson has brought a fresh approach to the film. Hollywood has been forced to change their idea of entertainment recently, hopefully they will learn from Mr. Jenkins and produce more family oriented films.
