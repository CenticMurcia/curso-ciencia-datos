A horribly dated movie. Made in 1992, the clothes, hair and music all cry early 1990s. Contains a very simplistic plot about a murder during a robbery, this is no classic. The only stand out scene is the school locker confrontation between Omar Epps and Tupac Shakur (Shakur showed he could act). Overall, rather bafflingly over-rated by IMDB reviewers and for die hard Tupac Shakur fans only.
