Now I'm not generally a LOVER of 30's film. The monologues are frankly quite too much for me. I am a lover of GOOD film. And while Meet Joe Black isn't the finest caliber of film out there, it kicks this one's butt!<br /><br />I was accepting of it until Death walks out of the room laughing evilly?because he is going to be human. How ridiculous. It's all so overly dramatic that it's a comedy more than a love story.<br /><br />I recommend it for a good laugh :)
