Poor Jean Reno. Stuck in cinematic farce like this. That bored, suffering look upon his face throughout the film can only be his French impatience waiting for this stinking film to end! Technical inaccuracies, historical inaccuracies, inept special effects -- there are so many things here to compete with the film's sophomoric script in motivating the viewer to hit the "eject" button long before the actual end. The wonder of the thing is that you do occasionally find yourself caught up in some subplot that seems to have generated itself amidst the bounteous tripe. If you want to see a well-made movie in this genre, better to rent "The Blue Max" (1960s) and enjoy an hour and a half of real cinema.
