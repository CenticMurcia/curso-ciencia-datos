Ignorance. Did you get it? Ignorance. We have four little bitches (sorry for the profanity but that's the word) screaming "OMG! YOU ARE MY BFF!". Their dream is to become superstars, be famous and be on magazines. What do they teach to little girls? Make-up, cosmetics, hairdresser, fame, fashion! These are the words who best describe this picture. What an awful, messy and bloody script, the story lines are the most horrible thing ever. It's so cliché! This movie is the cheesiest thing ever! Based on those dolls with lip injections and millions plastic surgeries, this thing has no story. Listen to a cast saying clichés, cast that can't show any talent skills because of the lines and because of the awful characters that are dreadful.<br /><br />The reason I watched this is because my younger sister wanted to watch it. Neither I neither my sister liked it. We couldn't finish the movie because we were so annoyed with the corny plot, awful skinny role models and the dull argument that doesn't teach you anything about adolescence because this movie is too happy, sunny and colorful! No pressure, no stress, no drugs... no whatever! Just girlie, cheesy, corny, clichéd movie. <br /><br />What is there to say? This is the poorest thing I've ever seen. It lacks everything! Dirty movie. Dirty movie.
