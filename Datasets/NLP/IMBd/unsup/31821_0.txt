It's really no wonder because the portrayal of America and its culture is so one-sided in this movie. NRIs (Non-Resident Indians) who emigrated to the US many years ago are seen as being shallow and lacking morals, but their behavior is so exagerrated that it makes them hard to believe.<br /><br />America is portayed as a drug-infested (only true if you live in the ghetto) land where strange men constantly approach women on the streets and try to get them to have sex with them, and which permits men to rape their fiancees before they marry. And of course the old movie cliche rears its ugly head here: if you are successful and ambitious you cannot be a moral person.<br /><br />This would all be innocent enough as entertainment were it not for the fact that most people living in India get their information about America through movies such as these, and condemn the US as being immoral without ever having visited there or even met an American. These movies give the appearance of fact, when all they are is a thinly-disguised judgement.<br /><br />To be fair, most Indians don't understand American culture, and fear it even while it is embraced in cities like Bombay. To them, I'm sure it does appear to be a strange world indeed.<br /><br />Oh, and the movie itself? Anything with Shahrukh Khan in it sucks, in my opinion. Amrish Puri is the only one who comes across as having any depth here.
