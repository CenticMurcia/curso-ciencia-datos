Sylvester Stallone stars as Ray Quick, an assassin who is hired by a mysterious woman (Sharon Stone) who hires out his services to get vengeance on the mobsters who killed her family, along the way they fall for each other and the audience is bored by it all. James Woods pops up and provides the only real moments of interest but even he is wasted on garbage such as this. The problem with the movie is its awful script;The dialog is so stilted and artificial were shocked that doesn't involve androids. Stallone and Stone have no chemistry so basically we watch them discuss cat and mouse games that is hideously boring to watch. Also for some reason Stallone seems to think that saying nothing is akin to acting. Sorry, Sly but that isn't acting. Talented actors such as Eric Roberts and Rod Steiger look hopelessly lost with the lousy script as both of their characters (Despite being the main villains of the peace) are desperately underwritten. The Specialist is one of the worst movies of the 90's and even Sharon Stone's sex scene isn't that erotic, mainly because she is sharing it with Stallone. If you want to see these actors nude (And seek help if you want to see Sly in the buff) then watch Basic Instinct or one of his pornos, chances are you'll find better stories there.<br /><br />1/2* Out Of 4-(Awful)
