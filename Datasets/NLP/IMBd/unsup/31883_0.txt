For all you old timers, remember Jack Benny? He did make a few good movies, and made us laugh, too! This movie comes at a good time in our lives now to revive our sense of patriotism. The story is about The Fuller Family, Connie played by Ann Sheridan and Bill by Jack Benny, who purchase an old dilapidated farmhouse in Pennsylvania where George Washington, himself, supposedly had slept there during the American Revolution. So much of the humor comes about by the many problems they have while trying to upgrade the property. I found it more amusing this time than when I originally had seen it. Great comedy stars like Hattie McDaniel, Percy Kilbride and Charles Coburn. Don't miss it!
