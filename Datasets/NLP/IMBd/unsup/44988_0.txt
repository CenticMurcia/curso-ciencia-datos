As far as skiing movies go Aspen Extreme is one of the worst I've seen. It's dull, disjointed and focuses on snow too much. The symbolism is outdated and the drug references are vulgar. However Monica Olivares is fantastic. Whenever she is on screen it lights up, her dialogue is delivered to perfection and her comic timing is immaculate. I have never been so moved by an actress so young (9). When she delivers THOSE lines i can't hold back the tears. It's a shame this is her only movie, i heard she gave up her career because she found Hollywood corrupt and moved to Bristol, England to be a lawyer(!!!). The film industry is all the poorer for it.
