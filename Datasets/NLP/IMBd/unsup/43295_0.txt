This has to be one of the worst adaptations of any program I have ever seen. The acting is wooden, there's no spark between the characters, and the jokes are purely recycled.<br /><br />The pilot episode takes jokes from across the range of the BBC series, and tries to compress them into one episode, failing miserably.<br /><br />The actors who play Lister, Rimmer and the Cat try hard, but they just cannot achieve the same level that the original actors had. Kryten looks purely uncomfortable acting with them, and the whole cast lack the camaraderie that the original crew have.<br /><br />If you're new to Red Dwarf, watch the original. If you're a die-hard fan, don't even bother with this version.
