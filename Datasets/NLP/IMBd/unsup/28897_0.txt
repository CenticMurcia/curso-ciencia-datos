This DVD version of the classic tear-jerker "Penny Serenade" may only be a standard production (considering recent technological advances in digital entertainment), but all of the delightfully sappy "soap" effect of the 1941 original remains 100% in tact. A few little gimmicks include a cute interactive trivia game that doesn't show you the answer until you guessed correctly.<br /><br />Irene Dunne and Cary Grant are perfectly matched as the young couple whose years together are chronicled through the countless special songs they shared in a massive record collection. The tragedies and joys are all mirrored in the songs. When the couple's happiness seems doomed after losing their unborn child, adopting a little girl brings an abundance of sparks back. When this child dies at a young age, Grant's despare seems to be too much to weather, and Dunne sees no alternative but to leave.<br /><br />The miracle (even if somewhat predictable) at the end is nothing short of Hollywood Magic. Though a relatively lackluster production (certainly with Hollywood Golden Era's glamorous image), "Penny Serenade" easily makes most "top 10" tear jerker lists. A rare gem
