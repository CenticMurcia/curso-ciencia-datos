For those of you who have not seen this film, do not waste your time. Especially if you have seen Rambo II, as Bronson seems to visit the same POW camps in Vietnam that Stallone/Rambo did in his film. They both have the same plot line: Revisit Vietnam and this time we will actually win it.<br /><br />Very unrealistic and very idealistic. the Hero Vietnam vet is tortured by memories of his days of captivity in Vietnam. He must go back and rescue the other POW's. he does this with the help of one friend (who he looses along the way, just like Rambo) and therefore wins the war for America.<br /><br />For those of you who would like to fool yourself into believing that the United States actually won the Vietnam War, this would be a great film for you to see!
