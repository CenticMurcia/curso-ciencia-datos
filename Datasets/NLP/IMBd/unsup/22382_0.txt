The first Zenon was novel and cute, and had meaningful plot line with quirky characters and a happy, Disney ending. The second wasn't nearly as good, with a less original plot and more attention spent on special effects (the aliens) than plot details. After the second Zenon, I never planned on having to sit through another disappointing remake on an originally perky and fun theme.<br /><br />Sequels CAN be good, as Toy Story 2 showed us. However, each movie in the Zenon series has gotten progressively worse. Z3 has yet another unimaginative plot, with insignificant details and more flashy outfits and scenes than characters. There are only seven characters of even remote significance, and the plot would have been no different if it were compressed to three. The only reason Aunt Judy, Commander Plank, or Proto Zoa, three crucial characters in Z1, were inserted was for the "remembrance factor." Zenon's parents, who were also critical to the plot of Z1, are not even mentioned. Even Nebula, Zenon's best friend, appears less times than can be counted on one hand. The changing of actors for the same character which was sad and very noticeable in Z2 has happened in Z3, with a new Proto Zoa.<br /><br />The storyline of Z3 leaves much to be desired as well. The plot of Z3 is frighteningly similar to Z2, with some kind of weird force trying to contact Zenon. This time, though, there is no explanation as to why the force is calling her in particular, or even what the force really is and how it has the power to do what it does. In addition, the villain of this movie is not nearly as sinister as Wyndom, having no clear motive or even an immediate effect on Zenon herself-- yet Zenon willingly takes on trying to foil his scheme.<br /><br />The issue of the character Bronley also completely defeats me. It's obvious from the beginning he's going to end up as someone's love interest. However, his real role in the movie is nonexistent. When we first really get a glimpse of the character, he turns out to be an enemy of Zenon, and you begin to think that maybe there's some kind of hidden alliance between him and the real villain. But don't get your hopes up.<br /><br />I could continue, but it isn't even worth it for such a disappointment of a movie. Watch the original Zenon, but don't even bother with either of the sequels.
