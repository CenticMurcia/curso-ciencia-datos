Maybe Spoilers<br /><br />"The Rock-a-who"? As said by the incredibly hot, Jennifer Connelly, the hottest woman in the movies.<br /><br />That is pretty much the extent of what I remember about this movie. Well I also do recall the mobsters and the chewing gum. Outside of the fantasies that Jennifer can produce in a guy, I really can not recommend this one. But she is definitely worth a view for you guys.<br /><br />What else can I say, Jenny's character battles with her hero boyfriend and goes after the wrong guy, who well winds up being the villain. <br /><br />After you see this, you'll probably recall Jennifer saying "The Rockawho" also.
