i picked up a copy of this movie at an old Italian owned video store, completely unaware of what i was about to witness for the next 90 minutes or so. what originally sparked my interest in this 70's obscurity was the box cover artwork, which was basically a black cover with a large keyhole in the center - a single eye looking through it. simple, but effective enough to get my $2 for a weekly rental.<br /><br />i'll never quite be able to fathom what the state of mind was like in the 70's, particularly in Italy (the origin of this film). i'm simply left speechless when i see a film like this. not that it was good. it was downright sleazy, and altogether badly done. but what concerns me here is the film's content.<br /><br />in brief, a escaped killer (supposedly child killer) befriends a young girl of roughly 12 years of age. she takes him to her house in a beautiful remote part of the countryside, and hides him in the basement. her mother (a widow, or divorced?) soon learns of his presence in the house, and they eventually become lovers. but it is only to be short lived as this killer will soon meet his fate.<br /><br />what strikes me about this film is not only the explicit content, but a brief sex scene between the killer and the young girl, which she (the character) willingly participates in (its obviously a body double, but still!?) ... i was truly shocked. and its no wonder this film faded quickly into obscurity.<br /><br />my question is: how did a film like this ever get made? who were the people who financed this film, and others like it? it seems that for a brief while (in that decade where anything went) if you could conceive a story so depraved, and so totally wrong, there was a good chance of getting it made.<br /><br />i don't recommend this film to anyone. it would only hold interest to those who have a Lolita-fetish, or collectors of hard-to-find movies. in any case, just remember: I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FILM!
