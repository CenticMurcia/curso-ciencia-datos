It's a fact that Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy did their best works for the MGM studios. Their later works for the Twentieth Century-Fox studios aren't exactly the most classic ones around. This is one of those typical Twentieth Century-Fox Laurel & Hardy pictures, that in style and humor quite differs from their early work but still has its certain charm and entertainment value, although the movie is far from an hilarious or great one.<br /><br />Once again Laurel & Hardy are in the army. This time the movie focuses on their mishaps in boot-camp. Laurel & Hardy don't really get to show the best of their qualities in this movie but the provide the movie with a couple of entertaining moments nevertheless. There are a couple of sequences that are still are of comical greatness, such as the scene in which the boys ride in a jeep during a combat exercise but like often was the case in their later movies, there are more misses than hits with its humor. The movie isn't consistently funny but yet it always remains perfectly entertaining to watch, although I would definitely had prefer some more slapstick from the two boys.<br /><br />Reason why this movie still works out quite well, is due to its well written story. It makes the movie flow well and also is the reason why this movie is such a perfectly entertaining one. It makes the movie consistent and provides it with some good comical moments and dialog.<br /><br />The love-story of the movie, between the Sheila Ryan and Dick Nelson characters, is quite enjoyable and not as distracting as often had been the case in other Laurel & Hardy pictures<br /><br />The movie is a great looking one with good costumes and sets. It's obvious that they spend quite some money on this movie. The movie ends with quite a big battle sequences that is well fitted into the movie and makes sure that the movie ends with a blast.<br /><br />Might not be so hilarious be very entertaining nevertheless.<br /><br />7/10
