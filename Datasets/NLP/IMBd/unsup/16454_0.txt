Usually when I hear the term "indie film", I roll my eyes and think, "Oh great. I'm going to be subjected to absurdly quirky characters engaged in improbable activities in jumpy black and white", and if I even watch at all, I find myself watching my watch more than the screen. So I was very pleasantly surprised to find that "Body/Antibody" was NOTHING like that, and, in fact was so engaging and well-done that the only time I consulted my watch, I was actually disappointed because I realized that the movie was almost over.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most engaging and unconventional aspects of this film is its characters. Kip, portrayed to marvelously comical effect by handsome Robert Gomes, could have easily sunk into "stock" characterization of a man afflicted with OCD, but instead is infused with a touching combination of ridiculousness and pathos. The struggle to accept another body into his sheltered life plays across his face beautifully.<br /><br />That other body, Celine, played by deceptively delicate Leslie Kendall, is a wonderful breath of fresh air (excuse the clich√©) -- not just in Kip's stale life but in the movie theater as well. She hearkens back to a certain sort of "old time" elegance and glamour that is so lacking in movies these days. Her performance is nuanced and layered, and I found myself constantly wondering, "What ELSE is there about Celine? There MUST be more." And oh, there was!<br /><br />This is typical of the movie as a whole as well. Just when you think, "Oh, I know what's going to happen next!", you find you really don't. The direction manages to not reveal anything that shouldn't be revealed, but teases us juuust enough that we can't help but think, "Did he do that for a certain reason? Is that going to be important later on?" The direction is intelligent and cautious, never giving anything away and barely hinting at what's to happen next.<br /><br />When the movie was over, I turned to my boyfriend and said, "You know what? I would have actually PAID to see this." If you know me at all, you know that's sayin' something. ;-)
