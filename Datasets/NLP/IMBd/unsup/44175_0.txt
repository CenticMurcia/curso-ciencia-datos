I gather from some of the other comments I've read that the copy I have (on one of those Mill Creek 50 Movie Packs) is missing the first several minutes of the movie. And while it is still easy enough to get the gist of the plot, the background in those minutes would have been nice. That said, I doubt that those extra minutes would have saved this movie. A prominent but discredited doctor tricks a group of criminals onto a ship to continue his experiments on healing the criminal mind, but the criminals have other ideas when they decide to take over the ship. But the doctor also chooses to experiment on the normal person and a lady he presumes is guilty but is actually quite innocent. Things get out of control and go in various directions from here.<br /><br />There isn't much going for this movie. It's not the worst I've seen, but relatively little happens and there is much more talk than seems fitting for the kind of action/horror movie this seems to want to be. An attempt at comic relief fails, also.<br /><br />I don't consider the time I spent watching this a total waste of time, but it is the best use of an hour I've spent either.
