On an idyllic setting, we watch as Joe and Claire are getting ready in a lush green field for their picnic. Joe prepares to open a bottle of champagne, indicating, perhaps, some sort of celebration was to follow. Out of nowhere, a red balloon appears as it is trying to lift up again. The man pulling the rope to halt its ascent, is helped by Joe, and other three men that appear on the scene almost simultaneously, without we having seen anyone around. There is a young boy inside, who is asked to jump out, but instead, he pushes the device for lifting and it flies away. The four men that were trying to hold it, fall to the ground, but the father keeps holding on until we watch in horror as he falls to the ground.<br /><br />Joe and one of the strangers, Jed, a mysterious man, run to where the man has fallen. When they arrive, it is obvious he is dead; the men feel helpless. Jed, who has tried to have Joe look at the dead man, is a man who, at first, seems harmless, but he will reappear again in the story.<br /><br />Jed, who lives with Claire, a sculptor, is a university professor. He can't forget the scene he witnessed. What appears to be an easy going relationship gets complicated because, suddenly, Jed begins to obsess with the accident. Even their good friends, Robin and Rachel, begin to get concerned about Joe's mental state.<br /><br />Jed, the man in the field, reappears innocently enough, one day. He becomes a nuisance that Joe can't shake. It becomes obvious that Jed has fallen in love with Joe, something totally unexpectedly. Joe can't shake this man out of his life until he shows up at Claire's studio where he and Joe have a final confrontation.<br /><br />Roger Michell seems to be the right man for bringing this strange story to the screen. Ian McEwan's novel of the same title serves as the model for a film that has nothing to do with traditional love. The title itself is deceiving, one wonders who really is the who endures the love in the story. Is it Jed whose love for Joe is unrequited, or is it perhaps Claire, who sees her life shattered after an innocent day when her life with Joe was at one of its best moments? Joe Penhall's adaptation of the novel works well in the film.<br /><br />Daniel Craig gives a good performance as Joe, the man who awakens a love on another man and can't cope with what is doing to his life. Rhys Ifan's Jed is the more interesting part because one has no clue if he is serious enough, or whether he is mentally insane because of the way he pursues Joe. Samantha Morton does a fine job as Claire, something that is always the case. The supporting players are good as well. Bill Nighy, Susan Lynch, and Corin Redgrave, especially, enhance the picture.<br /><br />It must be noted that Jeremy Sams' music score works brilliantly in the film. The cinematography of Haris Zambarloukos and Nicolas Gaster's editing make the film much better. Finally, it is Roger Michell who pulled it all together to bring all the characters of Mr. McEwan alive for us in the film.
