Google for Jack and Jennifer clips (and Steve and Kayla) and you will come across a goldmine of clips that will tell you the entire story of the Johnson family - from Steve's arrival onto the show to Jack and Jennifer's first wedding.<br /><br />And, oh my, if there isn't a boatload of pain, heartache... from Joy garrett's achingly wonderful portrayal of Jo Johnson, to Steve Nichols and Matt Ashford playing long-lost-brothers with so much history of pain between them.<br /><br />Matt Ashford is one of the best actors out there, and Steve Nichols is incredible too. Watching the two interact has always been a treat.<br /><br />Ken Corday let go of an incredible amount of potential for amazing storytelling when he decided that "Jack" had to leave with "Jennifer".<br /><br />Days today is all about the couples. The only time people interact with others is to whine about their significant other, or plot to steal someone elses significant other.<br /><br />There is no more warm and loving family or friend interaction for the sake of it, and that is the glue that holds the show together.<br /><br />I'm saddened to see that a show that I watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when Steve and Matt and Mary Beth returned is still going to be so terrible.<br /><br />It's not too late for NBC to fix this, but I'm guessing these pleas will fall on deaf ears.
