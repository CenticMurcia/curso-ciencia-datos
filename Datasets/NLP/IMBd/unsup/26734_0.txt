Considering that there's a fair number of reviews already, I doubt anyone will read this. I wanted to write a short one for popular anyway and I seriously encourage everyone to watch this show. It somehow managed to combine humor and drama perfectly into one episode. Some of the episodes were honestly laugh out loud, but could also make me cry at the same time. Mary Cherry was hysterical! Popular seems like its filled with stereotypes with the typical cheerleader but really the characters are really well developed that it becomes a lot deeper than that. I loved all the characters and believed in all of them. The only negative thing I have to say is that the last few episodes got a little weird in terms of character motivations but other than that it is a fantastic show.
