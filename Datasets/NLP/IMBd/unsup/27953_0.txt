If you have not guessed it yet the film producers have a religious type cult following. Their marketing was to push their followers to churches and other small venues to see the film for its ONE weekend showing. The film was so bad that it was not shown again publicly and did not make the leap to movie theaters. They have posted Hyper glowing reviews on various net venues in order to dupe more people into renting or buying the DVD. I wish they were honest about the film's shortcomings rather than promoting it with reviews from raving cult members.<br /><br />Is this movie worth seeing? NO........it was HUGE disappointment. A lot of the acting was bad, the tech. quality was bad, and the story was insignificant! It had no real point, no real focus! We paid $20 to see it, and we felt duped! A bunch of Unity people got together after the movie to have pot luck and talk about the movie, and no one would say anything.....just two people brought up a couple of "lines" that they thought were good and then silence! We moved on to another topic! Everyone I talked to personally, felt the same way!<br /><br />They are going to have a very hard time getting people to buy into another movie, I feel bad for Tywman, but he should have done a better job, it was a "B" movie at best and not a very good B movie at that! Sorry to disappoint you, I didn't want to say anything, but I did not want you to waste money on it. :(
