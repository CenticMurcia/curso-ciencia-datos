Miel para Oshún is wrongly called a movie. It's format is based on a documentary style, and very badly done I dare to say; also, it´s premise is so predictable that it almost becomes painful to watch. It´s about some cuban guy that was forceably taken by his father to Miami on his childhood who comes back to the island to encounter his mother (to find out why she didn't leave with them). Once there, he discovers by a cousin that everybody lied about the reasons why his mother stayed and to make things worse, his father, dead by now, made him promise that he'd never go back to Cuba (so he wouldn't find out, my guess). But, as the defiance to a deathbed oath becomes stronger because of his resentful feelings, he flies to Cuba to discover what really happened as well and getting to know his roots. He's helped on the task by his cousin and a taxi driver.<br /><br />The flat screenplay has nothing to do with the bad results in the film; narrated in some sort of a road movie as well as a travelogue of those little, picture like towns in Cuba, Miel para Oshún is a terrible experience mainly because of it's visual aesthetics, soap-opera like, a very bad acting by everybody that transmits nothing to the viewer, and a long story that usually gives the feeling of going nowhere. Thank God we already knew the plot, otherwise, we wouldn't be able to get a clue. There's not much to do with this crap and I think Miel... tries to show the cuban culture but even in this matter fails. It is corny and amateur like, manipulative and dumb in it's dialogue, and generally speaking is boring like hell. By way before the half of the movie we stopped caring enough to not give a damn whether he finds his mother or not.<br /><br />I rate it 1 star out of 10, and suggest to keep away from it.<br /><br />
