Welcome to Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium, the strangest, most fantastic, most wonderful toy store in the world. It's a tantalizing toy haven in which everything inside literally comes to life ? including the store itself ? and where marvels of every imaginable, possible kind, and beyond, never cease... that is, until now.<br /><br />When Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), the store's extraordinary 243 year-old proprietor, announces that he will at long last hand over the reigns of his wonder-expanding store to his unconfident young manager, Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), the store decides to throw an unusual tantrum. As a skeptical accountant named Henry (Jason Bateman) comes in to audit the Legos® and Lincoln Logs®, not to mention the Whodathoughts and Whatchamacallits, the once sparkling, color-saturated Emporium is suddenly embattled by mysterious changes. The playful toys are all still there, but they've turned gray and quiet ? and only Mahoney and Henry can revive them if, with the help of a superdexterous 9 year-old (Zach Mills), they can find the source of magic inside themselves.
