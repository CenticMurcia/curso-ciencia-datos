"Frankenstein Reborn" is another of those direct to rental flicks that usually makes you hesitate before you rent. Just the fact that viewers are ready to shell out a few bucks in the hope that "this time" they'll be pleasantly surprised says quite a lot. Unfortunately, there are not many emerging Roger Cormans out there, and movies like "Frankenstein Reborn" proves that fact. Another poster on this title claims some connection to this dreary movie, defending it because the cast and crewed "cared" about what they were doing. I'm sure Kevin Costner "cared" about "Waterworld", but it was still a terrible movie. All the audience has to go on is the finished product, and to be blunt, most don't give a damn about how much work or money went into the effort. "Frankenstein Reborn" is a bad movie. Bad acting, bad script, bad effects, and obviously too bad to be released into legitimate theaters. The quickie shooting schedule shows, everything looks threadbare (especially the "nightclub" location which looks like someone's basement with a cardboard bar and some flashing colored lights bouncing on the walls. Check out the "nurses/lab assistants" with their meticulously polished inch-and-a-half long nails and nary a rubber glove in sight. See the monster with half a pound of Silly Putty on his face and yarn for hair! Ninety percent of this tripe is shot in close-ups, evidently because you'd be able to see the edges of the sets or the kitchen sink. Perhaps it's time to leave the poor old Frankenstein monster alone, this version brings nothing really new to the genre even though I'm sure the director thought he was being revisionist. While I do commend those who attempt making a movie, I cannot say something is good when it's plainly not. This movie isn't good...and when I shelled out the rental fee, I paid for the right to say so.
