On behalf of all people in Manitoba, I would like to apologize for this film! Maybe it was a tax right off for someone.....someone forgot to tell the director/actors that it was not supposed to be a comedy..... somehow someway some film student (who obviously failed horribly) got his "final exam" on the TV by accident...I don't know.<br /><br />Manitoba has a thriving movie industry - though you would never know it from watching this 90 minute waste of time. Please excuse us for putting out this trash (Kate Todd is pretty cute though!).<br /><br />I started watching this horrible movie because it was so bad it made me laugh. Then I looked at the license plate and said "hey, the movie was made in Manitoba". According to the credits the movie was made is a local park 5 minutes outside the city. One person said it looked like it was all filmed within a 50ft radius.....close - probably more like 2KM.<br /><br />There is not enough space here to write everything that is wrong with this film. I'll instead close by writing everything that is good about this film........<br /><br />Thankfully it didn't waste any more of our lives then 90 minutes.
