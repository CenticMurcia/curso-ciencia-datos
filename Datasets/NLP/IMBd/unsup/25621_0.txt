I am a California native and Mexican-American. I lived in California for most of my life and I know how dependent we are on ALL Hispanics. Some people seem to misunderstand that this movie was only about Mexican's disappearing and what the result of that would be. If you watch closely, you will see it was about ALL Hispanic's in California (both central and south America, Puerto Rican's and whoever else). Initially it zero's in on a phenomena that occurred as a fog envelops the borders of CA and Mexican's initially disappear but as time goes by you realize all Hispanics from the well educated to the poor disappear. Most people don't want to realize that much of what is portrayed (Latino's in 'worker bee' jobs from nannies to field workers to grocery workers) is TRUE and don't want to be reminded that if something like that should happen, California and many other areas would be affected. I now live in Maine for the last two years and was shocked to realize that illegal Latino's are shipped up here from the border to do the field work for the blueberry and cranberry fields (the largest producer of wild blueberries in the world is here in Maine) and of course they are 'invisible' in every way possible in a 99% white community (look it up). This movie is a satire...a dark comedy that initially looks silly and superficial but that's the POINT...to exaggerate in order to get a message across. Fabulous movie!
