Still working for French Intelligence, Indiana Jones (Sean Patrick Flannery) is dispatched to Austria where he must help it's beleaguered Emperor (Patrick Ryecart) make a deal with the Allies that could end the war. Later on in Russia, Indy is caught between his bosses at the Intelligence Service and a group of friends of his in the Bolshevik revolution...<br /><br />The first story is a brilliant mix of both intrigue and action. Indy can only watch helplessly as the Austrian Emperor is pressured by a crafty diplomat (Christopher Lee) into lessening his demands on the German Kaiser, blunting the deal for peace. Trying to escape the country, Indy must outrun the Austrian secret police, led by the sinister Prussian (Joss Ackland in a wordless but still effective role). The last sequence on-board a train is especially thrilling and suspenseful.<br /><br />In Russia, the script offers some solid insights into the workings of communism and revolutionaries, and Roger Sloman in a one-scene appearance gives an excellent reading of Lenin. The inevitable tragic finale is also very well-done.<br /><br />More great stuff from Indiana Jones.
