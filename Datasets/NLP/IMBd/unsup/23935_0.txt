I've been a Woody Allen fan since the 1970s, when I was about 20, and this gem is one of his absolute best. Sweet, nostalgic, fall-down funny, wistful, at times remarkably poignant and sad...this Allen film has it all and shows the director at the top of his form. I have a soft spot for Dianne Wiest and she's fabulous here as the marriage-hungry Aunt Bea, whose terrible luck at chasing matrimony makes you wish you could push your favorite unmarried cousin her way. Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker also shine as the main set of parents in the piece, Mom & Dad to Allen's childhood alter ego. I never had a family and relatives as neurotic and wild as this bunch in Brooklyn--but Allen almost makes me wish I had! Possibly his best work, and accessible to a wider audience than his usual showcases to angst.<br /><br />
