has anyone noticed that this "movie" is made up of about 6 scenes in total? Each scene if you look closely (which really, you don't want to) is played at least 3 times over. and who noticed the massive case of 'cameltoe-itis' that the teacher lady had when asking for the gun? man, she's the style master. the CGI for blowing up the dam is cutting edge, not to mention when the helicopter goes kaboom while traveling at granny walking pace.<br /><br />overall, this "HORROR" movie which would have trouble scaring a two year old is not worth paying the five dollars to rent it out. this pathetic excuse for a film was probably put together in 3 days (or less) for fifty bucks (or less).<br /><br />if you have just watched this movie, you just wasted an hour and a half of your life which you will never get back.
