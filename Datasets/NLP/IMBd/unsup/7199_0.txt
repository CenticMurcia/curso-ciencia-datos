I saw this movie when I was about 10 and it had a profound effect on me. Growing up in a white, middle class neighborhood, I had very little exposure to people of different races and cultures. Seeing how a boy about the same age as I lived so differently prepared me in a small way in dealing with people from different backgrounds later in life. When I saw how JT got so much happiness from a simple thing like adopting a kitten and caring for it really made me appreciate what I had and put things into perspective for me. I think this movie made in 1969 would still hold its own today. If anyone from PBS or Nickelodeon reads this, there are a lot of 30- and 40-somethings out there who would love to see this re-released and watch it with their children. If this ever happens to come on in your area, DON'T MISS IT and make copies of it.
