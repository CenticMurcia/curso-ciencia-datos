I have no idea why people think they can make a good anthology film on a 10 dollar budget. This was awful. It had three stories. The first was perhaps the most pointless and is about a man escaping from the insane asylum. Later he works as a janitor at a school, kids make fun of him so he kills them. The second story is about some mean teens killing an Indian for no reason at all and stealing his peace pipe and getting high off of it. They have hallucinations, one of which is a REEEAALLLYY poorly computer animated snake. The third is just about some girls messing with these guys trying to scare them. It's all surrounded by this random guy named Rick, played by "Tales from the Darkside: The Movie's" James Remar. The opening to the film is a poorly animated skull that looks pathetic. The end is absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 92 mins. Rated R for sex and violence and language
