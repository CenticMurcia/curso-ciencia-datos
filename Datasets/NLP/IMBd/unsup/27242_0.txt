Overlooked yet highly entertaining drama from director Francis Ford Coppola and producer George Lucas, an amusing and nostalgic look at real-life idea man Preston Tucker who, in 1945, developed the Car of Tomorrow and hoped to put Detroit's auto business out of commission. A smart, knowing take on the past, a nice comeback from Coppola but one that did little business. The film has gleaming photography, a jaunty pace and a great cast. Jeff Bridges, not the most subtle actor, gives one of his finest performances in the lead. Supporting cast is made up of pros (Martin Landau, Frederic Forrest, Dean Stockwell) and fresh new talent (circa 1988) such as Joan Allen and the incredible Elias Koteas. *** from ****
