The very opening shots of They, aka Invasion from Inner Earth, aka The Selected, aka Hell Fire, aka your mama (well, not the last one), has lots of people running around, apocalypse raging. This is obviously from another movie, as the producers of the film rarely have enough of a budget for Wonder bread inbetween the takes for the actors much less staging a big epic cluster-f***. Right after these shots, which look made for a promising movie it cuts to the Wisconsin (or Canadadian?) wilderness, where some guys are flying in a plane. But there's also a crazy guy flying a plane who crashes in the woods. The four guys see this and investigate. But there's more than they bargained for: all communication with the outside world is cut-off, except to a pretty girl with a radio in her cabin one of the guy's knows. Then a red light coming out of a flashlight is buzzing around the room- the alien, of course- and now there are ominous callings on the radio.<br /><br />Spooky? Moreover inept, really, though it's not without a certain allotment of watchability (unless it's late at night, which might make it a good movie to fall asleep to, or to fool around with the significant other). But it's also so cheaply shot that anything that could possibly be in the script is obfuscated by the meandering take of the material. 'We need aliens' should've been as a protest on t-shirts during the making of the film! Instead it's done in a style that elimintates the middle-man, or middle-martian, so that Ito (yes, a director called Ito, who in reality directed one of the worst films ever Monster-a-go-go) can get many shots of outside in the wilderness and so-so scripted fighting in the cabin. I don't even remember if I made it all the way through to the end. Looks like They don't get very far with this stuff- the filmmakers, I mean. At least the stock music is cool.
