I think the coolest scenes was when Mario Lopez, then that 2nd guy (baby daddy) discovered the girl lying beautifully in the woods and realizing that her head was on backwards. The reaction from both was top rate. I found ALL of the actors quite engaging, it was a B movie but they did not phone it in. I was rooting for them to survive, especially that nice Sheriff. But the couple that was having the baby annoyed me at the end, because they had a 2nd chance to get away and they're doing the "Run! But no I can't leave you!" argument yet again, until the slow walking psycho catches up to them.<br /><br />So the cars have been located, and tied to all missing people in the area, but no one knows the whereabouts of this cabin in the woods, everyone who did is dead. So does the guy get away with it or do they call in CSI Boondocks? <br /><br />Things that made me go hmmm?: Cops investigating without back-up. Why did the psycho killer kidnap the pregnant gal, suddenly breaking away from his M.O., and give her the chance to get free and run? Was the deputy's reaction to Mario Lopez based on the fact that he was Latino? Or was it standard police procedure in that town to club and arrest someone who waves them down screaming for help? The scene with Gary Busey was ridiculous and unnecessary. Bummer we never see "Jeremiah's" face. Yet another, wound the bad guy but don't make certain he's dead scene. Can't they at least tie him up? All in all it was fun. It's one of those see with a group, laugh, cringe and thrown popcorn at the screen movies.
