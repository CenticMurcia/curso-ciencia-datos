Finally saw this last night on TCM, and I really can't believe the raves by the other posters! First, if Andy and Linda had actually hooked up, their kid would have looked like a gargoyle! Second, I didn't understand why Andy got Dink. Linda was probably a gold-digger who bailed the second Andy lost the belt, but fathers were very rarely awarded custody back then unless the mother was as an unfit a parent as Andy is!<br /><br />Which leads me to the fight. Beery flayed around like a crazed fish in search of water! Why no one told him that you punch straight ahead is beyond me! When Cooper started bawling for this loser, I wanted to deck him! He was so damn annoying throughout, but never more so than then!<br /><br />And what happened to Jonah? Didn't anyone care because, as Dink puts it, he's "colored"? That must be it.
