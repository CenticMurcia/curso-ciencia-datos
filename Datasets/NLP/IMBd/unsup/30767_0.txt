Not a particularly good WWII yarn, but worthwhile for Anthony Quinn's commanding performance as a bitter sheepherder who is asked by the French Resistance to smuggle scientist James Mason and family across the Pyrenees. Nazi Maclolm McDowell is on their trail. It's violent but hardly exciting with one scene of brutality after another (Mason's daughter is raped by McDowell, an uncooperative Gypsy is set afire). As good as Quinn is, Mason is given little to do. Patricia Neal has almost no dialog as his infirm wife and Kay Lenz is oddly cast as his resourceful daughter. McDowell is outrageous, acting as if he just stepped out of CABARET's Kit Kat club (as one of the dancers!) He's perks up the film, but only to propel it to campy heights. Michael Lonsdale and Christopher Lee appear in small roles. Directed, very blandly, by J. Lee Thompson, who seems to have lost any ability to mount suspense. This from the director of THE GUNS OF NAVARONE and the original CAPE FEAR?
