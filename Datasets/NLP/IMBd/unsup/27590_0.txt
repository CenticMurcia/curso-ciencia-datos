I have watched all the three Crocodile Dundee movies in the theatre as well as their re-runs on cable TV at home: <br /><br />- Crocodile Dundee I; - Crocodile Dundee II; - Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles: <br /><br />I am very impressed by the hilarious antics of Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan). I also like his charming, down-to-earth character. <br /><br />What I have enjoyed most in watching the three movies is that, I have learned that one can use sheer human ingenuity & creativity to overcome obstacles, no matter how intimidating they are...some life-threatening ones, too! <br /><br />Just watch how Mick Dundee (sometimes with his side-kick) out-thinking all the predators &/or bad guys in all three movies...in the treacherous hot outbacks of Australia & the mean streets of New York (When a mugger poked a small knife in front of his face, Mick took out his jungle knife & said: "That's not a knife. This is a knife!)...& mercilessly cold concrete jungle of Los Angeles. <br /><br />On the whole, I have enjoyed watching again all the three movies, each with its own engaging story & romantic notion of adventure. <br /><br />As a strategy consultant/success coach on life (survival) skills, I have added these three movies to my resource repertoire.
