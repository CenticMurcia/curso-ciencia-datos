Tiger Blade is one of the worst action movies I ever saw... The plot is non existent, it's so full of holes that I lost interest about 10 minutes into the film. So, at least there are good fight scenes ? No. Special effects are cheap. It's all a rehash of previous films, notably Matrix, but with inferior quality.<br /><br />Everything sucks in this movie ! Lousy acting, totally boring, this flick is an insult to the viewer. Avoid !<br /><br />Sometimes the absence of a plot is preferable to a really crappy one. Take the Doom video games, for instance. Who cares why you're there as long as there are aliens to shoot ?
