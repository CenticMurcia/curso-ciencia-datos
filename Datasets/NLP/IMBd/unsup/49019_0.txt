I really can't understand those who like this movie, and I really can't understand this movie!The first two episodes are totally nonsense, and I think the first is the worst of the movie. The only part I liked is the Rodriguez one because Banderas is really funny and the plot and the circumstances are fine. The fourth part of the movie, or the fourth room is not totally bad but I think it's boring. Tarantino speaks, speaks and speaks again, but the action of the finger-cutting is too short. Really bad in this movie is also the Tim Roth's Character, with that strange way to walk, to run , to talk or to make lots of thing! My conclusion is that this movie is not funny in a good way, but in a really stupid way!
