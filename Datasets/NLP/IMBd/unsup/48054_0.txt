I was at my local blockbuster and was turned on to this movie. Also I heard that it was Tarantinoesque. Me being a big Tarantino fan, was excited to see it. Let's put it this way, I put it in and wasted two hours of my life. The writing in this film is for lack of a better word, appalling. I wrote better stuff when I was a freshman in high school. The script was full of cliché and all around bad dialog. Another beef I had with it was the action. It was like they watched an 8 year old play with action figures and based the action in the movie on this. The plot is stupid as well, there is a twist at the end (which I will not disclose) that made me feel embarrassed for the writer. I also couldn't get a feel for what time they were in, it seemed simi future based on the police garb, but then the cars and everything else seemed modern...Weird. In retrospect, had they thought everything out a little more and took the thousands of clichés out of the script, this movie has potential for good, but just turned out a stinky crap fest. See it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.
