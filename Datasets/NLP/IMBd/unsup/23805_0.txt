The more I view this film - the more I chuckle. It is well written, clever, delightful and downright fun. Strangely enough, it wasn't until a 5th or 6th viewing that it finally dawned on me. I had seen this story before - Jane Austen's Emma. Only this time Flora(Kate Beckinsale seems made for these Emma roles) gets it right with her meddling and matchmaking. 20th Century Austen. And the entire cast is stellar!! Need some cheering up. Then visit Cold Comfort Farm. There is nothing chilling about this rural route.
