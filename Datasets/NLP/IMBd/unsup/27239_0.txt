A beautiful film which captures the spirit of a man's struggle to make his dream come true. Jeff Bridges is invincible in the role of Preston Tucker and effortlessly pulls the viewer inside the mind and spirit of this maverick entrepreneur who brought to the automotive industry seat belts, fuel injection, pop-out windows and most of all a legend called the Tucker Torpedo.<br /><br />Acting just oozes out of this fine actor and id consider it as his best performance ever. Excellent direction,screenplay and soundtrack. great duologue's too. especially "can any one in this room look me in the eye and say we cant do it" and on hearings a non-affirmative he replies "except you".<br /><br />The courtroom speech is something which recharges your spirit and fills your body with passion. Very true as he puts it " fifty or fifty million...thats only machinery..its the idea that counts..the dream.."
