michele placido, who has always been a very very mediocre actor himself, not to mention director, made this movie out of a book which is out of a very true story... The book was quite good, the movie is NOT. The real Banda della Magliana mixed up with mafia, camorra, secret services, terrorism, and whatsmore. They were quite coldblooded people who acted only for their interests. These guys are part of many of the most infamous chapters of the Italian history. What do we see about that in the movie? nothing. We see some very insipid love story, some more insipid gangster story, we are even supposed to feel sorry for some of these guys... because they were supposedly men of honour... and not one word about why this bunch of people was so notorious, feared, and protected by the powerfuls. Shame to the horrible placido. He didn't even gather the courage to portarait half of the real story... I can't understand why he was given the money to make this piece of garbage... or maybe andreotti paid? LOL that would be the cherry on this tasteless pie.
