A reasonably good start that obscures a really stupid and lame plot, as soon as it starts explaining it you think "can't be serious, can't be SOOOOO absurd!" The story does not stand up a child's mind, the acting is horrendous, the dialog almost non existent, the localization really cheap... the only achievement is to show Prague as a really ugly city, something not so easy.<br /><br />Really, paying to see this crap seems to be a really nasty way to lose money.<br /><br />For me, the only possible explanation for all that positive comments is that the people involved in the making of the movie are trying to improve its ratings. Incredible.
