Wonderfuly done, and at that point in time when animation was REALLY animation and not just the same art shown over and over or computerized "stuff". The music is very well done, with great voices and good score. Given that it was made in '39 this film has held up beautifully. It still conveys a good antiwar message which, in this day of Home Land Security and international political blundering, we all might do well to remember. All in all, for its sweetness and wholesomely entertaining story line, this thing is STILL a treat for young and old alike. You want a nice story with a good message, well done animation with pretty music? Something to just relax with and enjoy? Travel with Gulliver.
