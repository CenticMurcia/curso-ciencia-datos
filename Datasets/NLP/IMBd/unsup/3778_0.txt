If you look up this movie here, it's considered a very good thriller. If you look up it's remake (w/ Kiefer Sutherland), they say watch the original. And the verdict is that they're right, for the most part. The character development in this French/Dutch film is fantastic in that this is the first time I've ever been drawn to the evil character, but the lag time in the movie slows it down immensely, which is it's only problem. While trying to get you to know the man behind the mysterious disappearance of a Dutchman's girlfriend, some parts of the film drag on to no end, and then pick up finally after one specific scene, being a car-ride where it picks up and doesn't fail. When the Dutchman finally meets the evil man, the dialog and scenes are impeccable, leading up to an astonishing ending that made me feel very empty. A great thriller, even after the long, drawn out parts.
