Well what can you say... just witnessed this spectacle ... completely crazy...yet still manages to have depth. Not everything works , its a little too long but hey !! who cares when you have plot lines which includes a dysfunctional couple (played to the extreme), repressed homosexuality which blossoms at the end, amazing soundtrack (even the cake song was relevant), a man who is mentally a bird due to hypnotism gone wrong, later taught by his his son to fly due to the son's admiration of his father, Vinnie Jones !? who constantly is interpreted by a Japanese sidekick who never once utters a word of English, the worlds greatest actor (T.Asano), set designs that will blow your mind, spoofs of J-horror/game shows/anything really !! ... i could go on and on... not for everyone but why is this not released in the UK. There is so much more than Ghost stories and Miike takashi (he is still amazing mind)... invest in Survival Style 5+... it makes Tarantino look like Renny Harlin
