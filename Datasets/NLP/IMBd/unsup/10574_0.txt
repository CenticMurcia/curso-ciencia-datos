I'm sorry for the people who liked it, but there's is absolutely nothing good about this movie. Actors are really playing bad, quotes are stupid (even when they try to have some scientific background), often in the movie we have these vomiting camera shot making circles around the characters (the bank scene is the worst scene I have ever seen in a movie, I laughed all along). So if this unreal scene was not enough, we have that strange bus driver who runs when the FBI agent tries to cut off the bomb.<br /><br />As I know we can find a lot of funny bad movies in the 80's, it's the first time I see a recent movie being so ridiculous.<br /><br />Everyone should see this movie at least one time in his life, really. All young directors should see it, and learn how not to do.
