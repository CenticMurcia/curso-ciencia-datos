this film is like no other. Yes, at times it can be predictable but your afraid for it to happen. I do think this movie matches up to Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm st. because its different. A mad man throwing blood-sucking spheres! He was also really creepy. He wasn't dead, and he didn't wear a mask he was a simple character. I also found the special affects really good for this movie since it was made so long ago. If you like the horror movies of the 70's and 80's you have to check this flick out. The acting was above average, there are many fright scenes, the music was frightening, and it is definitely worth buying and also a movie you can watch over and over again.<br /><br />10/10*
