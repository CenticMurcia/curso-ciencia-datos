watched this on Lifetime Movie Network the other day , and i was thoroughly impressed with it. It showed what can happen to a family when an addiction occurs, whether it be alcohol drugs , or in this case sex. yes i said sex. there's actually an addiction for that, Harry Hamlin plays the cheating husband absorbed with sex, Lisa Rinna from Days of Our Lives plays the drama teacher wife. they have 2 boys who are seemingly caught in the middle of their parents situation. The wife finds evidence of him cheating,, confronts him,, and well the sparks do fly in this one, it's hard to say more without giving away what happens later, so i won't do that, but this is a very intriguing movie that delves deep into what can tear families apart, definitely worth a watch if you ask me.
