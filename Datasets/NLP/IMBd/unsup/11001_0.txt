What a surprise! I just turned 43 although it doesn't seem like it. I watched the movie and it transported me back to when I was 17.<br /><br />The feelings that the young men felt were so real. I was really impressed with the accuracy in the way they portrayed those experiences.<br /><br />I almost never watch a movie more than once. I watched this movie 4 times in the last 2 weeks.<br /><br />The ending really sucked though. True, it was realistic I suppose in some ways, but it hurt. Thats why I watched it so many times. I can't understand why I have such a strong feeling of hurt in the ending. It was, after all, just a movie and I don't ever have a lingering reaction such as this.<br /><br />It really touched me on some deep levels that frankly kind of confuse me. It would be nice to see a sequel. Even if they don't get back together as i am sure in real life the wouldn't. It would still be nice to see some closure to their sweet dating experience and a positive outlook on their individual futures. <br /><br />Wow, I can't believe I am actually writing this as it is so out of character for me to do. This movie just really touched me in a way that truly surprised me and is now one of my favorites. I would highly recommend seeing "Get Real".
