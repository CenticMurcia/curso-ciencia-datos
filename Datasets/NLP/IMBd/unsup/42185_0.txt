Being that I am a big fan of La Marche de l'empereur, I gave this a shot. I expected juvenile sex jokes, but was really surprised by the scatological humor.<br /><br />I like Lewis Black and enjoyed his penguin, but that was about it. It just seemed like the same jokes over and over - eating, farting and sex. It really got a little tiresome.<br /><br />The music for the movie was a little schmaltzy, like a Celine Dion concert, and was more of a distraction. But, I guess that was the whole point: to create a farce about a work of art.<br /><br />Why can't they just try to create a work of art themselves, rather than make a joke about something beautiful?
