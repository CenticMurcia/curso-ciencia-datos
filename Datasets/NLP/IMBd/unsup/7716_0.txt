I Like ManiRtanams movies<br /><br />But Geetanjali is something different and its a class of its own in the sense even if you see after 15-20 yrs its still looks fresh story. all the characters Justified it. They are lively and well suited.<br /><br />Ilayaraja supplimented this with excellent music.<br /><br />Girija acting in her first movie was the center of attraction as she suited for the role and acted very professionally.<br /><br />I wonder not to see her again in films. Nagarjuna did his job perfectly but the credit goes to the director who portrayed these roles and refined them.<br /><br />Hats Off Mani Sir. Expecting more from you like these classics.
