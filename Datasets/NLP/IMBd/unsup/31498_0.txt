I must say this is one of the best movies to have come out in 2008. I wouldn't want to compare it with Tare Zameen Par because it deserves to be a unique film in its own aspect."Jodhaa Akbar" was truly beyond my expectations !!!!. I saw the 3hrs 40mins film on Saturday but still its lovely characters and the setting has left me amazed !!!!. <br /><br />The film began on a very slow and rather boring note though Amitabh Bachchan's powerful role as the narrator was worth appreciating. The first half-an-hour had some war sequences which were shot wonderfully but got kind of stretching-too-long after a while. After the entry of Hrithik as Emperor Akbar, the true story was beginning to form. With his muscled look and the mustache, Hrithik looked every bit like a true hero. I was completely awestruck by his power-packed performance as the stern yet kind-hearted Akbar. An alliance between the Rajput King and Akbar took place, which said that Akbar would protect the Rajput kingdom and the King in return would give his daughter Jodhaa's hand in marriage to Akbar. <br /><br />This was the turning point in the film, after which it took off beautifully. Aishwarya was the best choice for the film and no one could have done as much justice to the role as much as her. She looked amazing and I was completely mesmerized by her beauty. She looked like a true defiant Rajput princess with the heavy jewellery laden look complete with long hair and lovely dialogues. <br /><br />The setting of the film was something-to-watch out for. The Agra Palace and the setting for the war sequences were shot at the Nitin Desay Studios At Karjat apart from some other fabulous locations. The setting is something that one HAS to go to a cinema hall and watch.....it is something you just can't capture or experience on your normal TV at home. <br /><br />Apart from the lead actors, Punam Sinha , Sonu Sood , Ila Arun and the child actor (Parth Dave) have delivered superb performances. <br /><br />I don't want to spoil your mood by telling you the whole story but I must say this movie deserves to be seen and appreciated. I don't know whether the movie might be a hit or a flop but one thing's for sure.....it will definitely be remembered as one of the finest films ever made in Bollywood. <br /><br />Like "Mumbai Mirror" (a newspaper) said...."this film is worth every rupee of your multiplex ticket".....LOVELY !!!!!! :) :) 3 cheers for the cast and crew of the film !!!!!!!!!
