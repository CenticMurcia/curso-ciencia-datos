I watched this movie not so much for Rosalind Russel, but for Regis Toomey ("The Big Sleep" and "Guys and Dolls"). I barely made my way through this film. It was painful to watch. And like a train wreck, I could not stop watching, hoping it would get better.<br /><br />Jo McBain is an incredibly stuck-up blue-blood aristocratic ..um.. twit. She spends most of the movie with her nose high in the air, all but sh*tting on her black servants. I so wanted to smack her hard several times in the film.<br /><br />I would think that if a recruit showed that much insolence and insubordination that she showed the WAC NCOs and officers, she'd be thrown in the brig until her attitude got adjusted.<br /><br />And don't get me started on Clara Schneiderman and Sgt. Norbert Jackson! She was insufferable, and he desperately needed a knee in the groin every time he said or did something patently offensive.<br /><br />Yes, I know the movie is a product of its time and reflects the then-mainstream sensibilities. I've seen other old (read: black and white) films that were not nearly as offensive and painful to watch. This film needs to be watched with more than just a grain of salt, you need an entire container of Morton's.
