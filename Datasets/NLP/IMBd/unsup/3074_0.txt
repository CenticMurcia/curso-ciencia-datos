I was an exchange student in London a year ago and had the great opportunity of meeting Dolph in person, and he gave me an autograph. He was very gracious and kind. I don't watch a lot of his movie usually but I decided to watch this one earlier today (my boyfriend works in a video store and got me it a day early!).<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie it was very good. Dolph looks good too (I didn't say this to my boyfriend, I'm so bad!) and of course there is lots of fights and things too so he was happy. I liked the scenes with Dolph and Ben Cross, they were engaging and Ben is a really top actor (not that Dolph isn't a good one).<br /><br />Anyways this was a good film and although it was a bit overly violent at times, a little sadistic it was well made.
