This documentary is so nasty and gross that I almost threw up. It's about this woman named Grace but she calls herself Annabel and she makes dirty movies. So she decides to be a record setter in a different way and has sex for ten hours with 251 men. Then when someone breaks her record, she gets all depressed and I think she had a lot more problems than the viewer really saw. The movie was awful and Grace says that she is going to quit making these movies but she just keeps making them. Grace wanted her mom to be proud of her but then went back to making dirty movies. If I were her mother,I would disown her because it's sick and wrong to just lie to her mother's face. Then Grace says that she is doing it for some woman's movement or to make women stronger but that is all just BS. It's a bad movie and if you want to watch a movie on strong women just find something about Eleanor Roosevelt. She was a really strong woman. Annabel Chong or Grace is a very poor example.
