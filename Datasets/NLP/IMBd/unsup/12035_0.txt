I agree in most part with the first review especially when comparing it to other movies from the RGV production house. Unless watched as a prequel to 'Company', it stands a little feebly with a mixture of actors, script, storyline and direction borrowed from it's fantastic predecessors. Otherwise it's an interesting prologue to a more complete and fulfilling story. I think the movie improves in the last third with excellent plot development and gritty twists, and the finale is well-worth waiting for.<br /><br />Having loved 'Satya', 'Company' and 'Ab Tak Chappan', maybe I was expecting too much from the same genre and was a little disappointed. Try again some other time methinks, rather differently perhaps for a fresher approach.
