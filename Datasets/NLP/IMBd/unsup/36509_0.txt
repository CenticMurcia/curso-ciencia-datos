Sat through this film, just, but only to keep watching the strange man/boy actor Peter Bark. Apparently he's supposed to be about 17 or so, but he looks and moves around like a 50 yr old. Also bizarrely, Bark never speaks on-screen, IE you never see his lips move, and his voice is always heard from the reverse angle. The scene where Bark tries to seduce his mother is also a classic of sorts. Three cheers for Freak Man-Boy BARK! Apart from this, Zombie Dead has little plot and atmosphere, though there are some relatively Gory scenes to make up for this. The pace is also very slow, with Zombies moving really slowly towards there victims.
