Well, this movie is obviously not a 10! But it's very funny to watch. It's true, that Yor, the barbarian, in the beginning fights some clay&paper-dinosaurs and than decides that fighting some Sci-Fi-Robots would be more interesting. But that's the fun of it! The Story is so unbelievable stupid, that it gets normal people to laugh. What would you do, when suddenly Darth-Vader comes around the corner in an "Cavemen-Movie" ? Even more funny is the fact, that the Actor of Yor must have been very happy to be in this movie ... because he smiles like an idiot directly into the camera in nearly every stupid scene. Not to mention the awful music in this movie which sounds like an very bad Amiga-shooter... or like the music of Doom 2.<br /><br />If you don't want to watch this movie, maybe it's enough to watch just the trailer... because everything mentioned is shown in it. As if it want's to say: "Hey... look how shitty I am!"
