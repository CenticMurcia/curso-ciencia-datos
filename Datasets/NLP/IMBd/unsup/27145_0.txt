This was one of the biggest wastes of time I have ever witnessed. VERY bad acting, monotonous action sequences (hey 10 ninja's, hey another 10 ninja's) and the 'martial arts' looked like they came straight out of a power rangers episode. Several inconsistencies. Where did cameron come from after the master demon was defeated? Bad acting. People look like they are reading boards while speaking their lines. The weapons looked like cardboard with some paint. Who choreographed the fights? The worst fights I have ever seen in any movie EVER (even jeff trent's suckerpunch in plan 9 looked more believable) Worst lighting I have ever seen (every shot featured 10-meter shadows even while people were talking ?) The story was ok, but overall this was a pretty bad movie which I was hoping to END, END, END as long as it lasted.
