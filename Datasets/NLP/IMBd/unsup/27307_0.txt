This movie stinks. It is difficult to convey just how bad it is. A good place to start is the idiotic dialogue. The guy asks his 12-year old son, "Did you get laid last night?". Then, as he watches the painful transformation of his son into a vampire, the father calmly asks, "Would you like an aspirin?". Then there is the fact that it has nothing to do with the first movie, or the book. Then there is the fact that it is so damn boring. How many times do we have to see the guy try to escape from the vampires? Of course, the plot really makes no sense either. One has to wonder what the editors actually took OUT of the movie. If they edited all the bad parts out, the movie would only be about 45 seconds long. I was unable to even laugh at it, it was just too stupid. Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.
