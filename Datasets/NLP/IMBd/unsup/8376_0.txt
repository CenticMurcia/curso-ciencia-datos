No, it's not a gay coming of age film! Just a bog-standard horror B-movie that would have worked quite well as a 30 minute episode of a series like "Tales of the Darkside," or a similar type programme. But as a full length film, it soon outstays it's welcome.<br /><br />The child actor is quite reasonable and not as 'cute' as they tend to be in these roles. It's the adults who are poor, their acting never rises above adequate. Not helped by the dialogue or the clich√©d plot of 'the monster that lurks in the cupboard.'<br /><br />All eminently predictable and forgettable, better to go watch numerous old episodes of 'Tales from the Crypt,' to get exactly the same plot done a bit better.
