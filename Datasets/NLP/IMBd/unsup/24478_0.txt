I did not know what to expect when I picked up this DVD. <br /><br />But, I have to admit it held my attention from beginning to end...and boy was the ending a shocker! <br /><br />I don't know if the ending will work for most, but for me it did. <br /><br />The music was very intense and scary as well (I had to buy the soundtrack, it's great for Halloween) Any way, I really liked it and the special features are cool too. <br /><br />For me however, besides the surprise ending and the shocking murder mystery plot twists, what I love the most about this movie is the title...BLEEDING ROSE, ooh nice:)
