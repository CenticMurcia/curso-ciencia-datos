Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour star in this tired comedy. Hope is a photographer who specializes in baby pictures but really wants to be a private detective like his hero down the hall, Sam McCloud (a cameo by Alan Ladd). One day when McCloud is out of the office, Hope happens to be there when Dorothy Lamour slips in and, mistaking him for McCloud, hires him to unravel a mystery. This is just one more of Hope's mistaken identity comedies, and not a particularly good one. The writing is weak, Elliott Nugent's direction is flat, the supporting cast--other than Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr.--isn't really up to par, and for some reason Hope and Lamour don't seem to have any chemistry at all. On top of that, the picture just looks cheap, like a later Bowery Boys movie from Monogram. Hope and Lamour made much better pictures than this. It's not really worth your time.
