I was blown away by the reviews. I liked the sound of the concept. I bought the DVD. I turned it off half way through and binned it. This is awful.....Oooh so it's got a big name cast....So what! The 3 marks I have given are solely for the concept. It's new and original, and that deserves credit. But for me it was so painful to watch. To keep viewers to speed of what is happening in other parts of the story, Jack Bauer is constantly on his mobile phone. This started to annoy me. Then the storyline started to become unbelievable, re the lady contract killer who parachutes to her rendezvous for just one example. Then the incredibly bad acting/direction from the guy who appears to be a normal American business man, who when put under the slightest interrogation suddenly starts speaking in an eastern European accent....What happened to his perfect American accent.....Sorry, I'm not overly keen on Keither Sutherland anyway, maybe that didn't help... but I cannot for the life of me see how anybody thought this was good!
