I had a chance to see this film while attending the Sundance film festival last year. I was attracted by the great cast put together by the films director Eric Weber. Joey "Pants" Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly, Bronson Pinchot and others. I was also surprised to see "The Patty Hearst". While the acting was terrific it was really the content and the characters that made my time viewing enjoyable. In addition I also liked the way it was shot it felt very homey and was not overwhelming which allowed the flavor of the story to shine through. We can all relate to the main character with his current life(never quite getting to the top) and seeing the success of his long time friend, it will hit close to home for many. Go enjoy this film and bring a friend.
