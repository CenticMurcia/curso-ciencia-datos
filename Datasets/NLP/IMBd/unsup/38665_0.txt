Ethan Wiley, the script writer of both House 1 and 2, almost had something good going. He took the same basic plot of House and added strange, supposedly humorous things. The result is an annoyingly odd movie where events simply take place. Not only do these events not make sense, but they are not fun like the first movie. The cast is interesting, as it usually is with this type of movie. Johnathon Stark is a little amusing, Arye Gross(The Experts, Minority Report) is no cowboy, and Royal Dano(Killer Klowns From Outer Space, The Outlaw Josey Wales, The Trouble with Harry) adds nostalgia. Amy Yasbeck(Casey from "Wings"), Bill Maher(loud mouth), and John Ratzenberger("Cheers" with George Wendt) all play forgetable roles in this mostly forgetable sequel. I had to laugh when this movie got name checked in Scream 2.
