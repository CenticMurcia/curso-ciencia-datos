i love how this movie shows what can happen if you are a teen mother, and if people find out. i think it was heartwarming and some points honestly brought tears to my eyes. Danielle Panabaker gives a great performance in this movie. this movie, to me, is an excellent thing for teens and their parents to watch. even people who aren't teenagers yet may like this movie. this can really show you that having sex as a teen, or even preteen, has it's consequences. all in all, i really like this movie a lot.lifetime is doing a great job by using such hot, young actors/actresses in their movies. i most definitely give this movie two thumbs up and five gold stars.
