A few days ago we got a coupon in the mail that said we can rent up to 3 movies for $0.99 each.So we went to the video store and I found this movie called The Shunned House.It looked like a pretty good movie from what the box said but i was sooo wrong.The movie was sooo boring that I fell asleep within minutes.The movie tries to scare you but it fails to.So if u see this movie at ur video store do NOT get it.I cant believe I wasted $0.99 on this piece of junk.
