This is just the kind of story a girl like me would like to be able to tell. No wonder us twentysomething women gave it a 9/10 on the general.<br /><br />It's not hyperfast paced and not boring. It's not singleminded and not disperse. It's not totally plot driven nor does it dwell on deep psychological insights about the characters. It's better than a typical American romantic comedy. You know, it's not Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks again. It's more real life-ish, more emotional, less superficial and yet just as fun. It's the kind of movie where you want to make sure you have your bucket of popcorn, your soda and a comfortable place to sit. And yeah, it's the kind of movie that makes you leave the theatre feeling just a bit happier on the whole. :)
