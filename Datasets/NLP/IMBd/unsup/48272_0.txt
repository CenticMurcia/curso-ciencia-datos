How the hell does this kind of movie end up getting distribution? The script is terrible, the story makes no sense - (rumour has it that Darren Day disappeared two-thirds of the way through realising what a stinker he'd involved himself with). This at least explains his character vanishing without any plot resolution whatsoever. The music is a sort of irritating Michael Nymanesque minimalism seemingly written by a man with no ears. If this was made by a first year student filmmaker it would still be a result of the grossest incompetence.<br /><br />There is no other way of describing this other than an absolute steaming pile of festering dog turd, resting on a catastrophic car pile-up. Avoid.
