Nostalgics should enjoy this mid-80s cheese fest, as far as spying familiar faces of the decade: Jason Gedrick (who routinely played the troubled, but well-meaning defender teen), Bobby Jacoby, Marc Price, and Jackie Earle Haley.<br /><br />But as a movie geared for older kids (given that the young characters have no problem letting the expletives fly and hence the PG-13 rating), it is indeed, as another viewer wrote, predictable. A bunch of trouble teens invest themselves in putting together a rock club they once thought was owned by the bum (because of squatter's rights) who granted them permission to use the club. So when the feud with their rivals get out of hand, they rivals take advantage of the lack of property claims and so the Zoo Gang (named for their rock club) as the underdogs, have to do what they can to save the club.<br /><br />It's terribly dated. With its predictability, there is plenty of 80s corniness: the work-out montage, the bad haircuts (get a load of Jackie Earle Haley's mullet-tude), and dialog. Granted, the filmmakers could only be sophisticated to a certain point in a movie that primarily stars and is primarily geared towards teens and pre-teens.
