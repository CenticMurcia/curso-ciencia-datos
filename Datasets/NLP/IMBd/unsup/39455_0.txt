My friend and i went to see "Angel Eyes" last night, at my insistence - we were the only people in the theater!! The film didn't hold my attention at all but i couldn't stop counting the amount of times the microphones came into shot!!! I cant believe the director let this happen - in nearly every indoor shot a green and red mike popped into scene and on the outdoor ones it was the big fuzzy one!! I have read the other reviews of this movie and can't believe no one else found this unbearably distracting! I wish i had gone to see the other film playing at my cinema and i certainly don't recommend "Angel Eyes". Weak characters, weak story and unsuitable music.
