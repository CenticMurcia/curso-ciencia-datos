This is one of the movies I'd recommend to anyone in want of a good movie. It was very enjoyable and although there weren't unpredictable twists, it didn't fail to keep me attentive.<br /><br />Story-line: Lon (Daniel Wu) was born with an injured face. Him an his brother are hired killers until something happened, which prompts a turn in the story.<br /><br />Stephen Fung and Daniel Wu both gave awesome performances. Although, I haven't seen many HK films, it seems that they are taking a turn and for the better. Very enjoyable.
