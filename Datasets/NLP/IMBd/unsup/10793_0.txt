A horror film that you need a psychology degree to appreciate??? Sure, it wouldn't hurt, if you're looking to gain a deeper understanding of the subtle nuances of this almost half hour assault on the brain, but it's not necessary. Many of the themes expressed are basic human emotions and fears, but when forced to confront these demons of human experience is where the real horror lies. It may take a few viewings to really grasp just what Matthew Saliba has to say, but the knowledge he imparts is well worth your time, if you can make sense of it.<br /><br />When a woman gives birth to a giant severed thumb/toe creature in a room full of bloody weapons, you know you've really stepped into something bizarre. And when the father of the thumb-kin accidentally hatches it by pouring milk over its cuticle, you truly know that there is no turning back. The child, now seemingly fully grown into a teenager, brings his mom the thumb cocoon, which she lovingly turns into soup, before helping the boy's father to perform some kind of Frankensteinesque experiment. The doctor makes an appearance next, feeble assistants who aren't quite human in tow, all leading up to some strange ass visuals including a meatloaf mask, a pick axe wig splitting, and a return to the womb.<br /><br />As I said above, a fluent knowledge of Freud and Jung isn't compulsory to enjoy the imagery, but it really does help when trying to ascertain the underlying story that makes up the crux of Pandora's Paradox. We are handed everything from Oedipal complex to matricide, and more psychoanalysis than an FBI profile of a serial killer. If these kinds of things excite you, then by all means, dive in and enjoy, but if you're looking for a more straightforward horror flick, this might be a little too cerebral for you. If you happen to fall into the latter category, I'd suggest dusting off your David Cronenberg DVDs and watching those for the umpteenth time.
