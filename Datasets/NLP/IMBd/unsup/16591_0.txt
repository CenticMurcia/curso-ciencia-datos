This is the story about a young child who was separate by his mother. The reason behind this is because the mother was trying to get papers for her son to come to America. So the mother goes to America, while the kid is in Mexico with his grandmother. After having his grandmother die, the child finds out that he is going to be given away to some annoying couple across the street that would care less about the kid. So this kid makes the daring journey across the Mexican border... in a week.<br /><br />Yeah, if I recall correctly, there have been Mexicans who have taken months, even years to get across the border and you are telling me that this nine-year old kid is able to get across the border, maintaining that adorable look that all young girls will just gaze at? I know that this is based on a work of fiction, but the keyword is "fiction" not "fantasy." The whole purpose for the kid to get across the border in a week was because every Sunday, he would call his mother on a pay phone, tell her how much she loved her, miss her, and cry over her. The kid had to get to where his mother was in a week so that way the mother will not start freaking out.<br /><br />None the less, this movie is still well-done. I mean, for an indie movie, it is pretty much solid in terms of the acting, direction, and the way things were filmed. There are no big names in this film, (except for a total of three minutes with America Ferrera) so you are more focused on the story line and the motifs/themes of this film. And there are some heart-touching plots in this film that I thought would be overrated, but ended up pretty good and higher than what I expected. And the movie moved not too quickly, but at a good pace to where you did not get bored all the time and you were thrilled to know if the kid will find his mother or not.<br /><br />Sometimes the movie does go off in that path as if this movie was made by amateurs that written a film for a textbook. Most of the characters speak Spanish, but not all. Do not watch this film if you want to learn about Spanish culture. Because it the background of the film was just, enough, to supply it. They showed a Mexican or two getting treated unfair, and the police attacking some Mexicans. The whole purpose of the film is just to show this boy's adventure.<br /><br />This is a low seven for me.
