I viewed this movie this evening and was amazed at the writing, plot and cinematography of this no-budget film that was made for $50,000 that could rival the most of the big budget movies that have been made.<br /><br />If you are a Star Wars fan, it is a plus, but it is not necessary to get a feel for the story and its well-developed characters.<br /><br />Even more impressive is the producer/director, Gary Wood & his wife, had not even studied in the film industry...he only had a desire to make a film and put $50M on the line to fulfill his dream. He did not limit himself to the "box" when writing the film and had the attitude from "Field of Dreams"..."If you build it, they will come".<br /><br />The no-pay actors were great, as was the directing and script. Kudos the all involved in this effort and highly recommend this movie! Star Wars Veteran, David Prouse, is a plus in this wonderful film!
