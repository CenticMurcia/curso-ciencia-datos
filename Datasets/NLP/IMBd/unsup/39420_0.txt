Something new isn't new at all - it is a limp attempt - and despite the best intentions leaves the viewer unconvinced that love is in the air.<br /><br />Compared this to the kind of dialog and natural rapport that creates chemistry and is sparky and fun, and flirtatious - and you will begin to see why I wasn't thrilled. The conversations are very flat and prosaic and simply don't fire the heart or brain.<br /><br />Something New is not a bad movie - but jumps from awkward situation to making out, to breaking up, to get back together without any brain food<br /><br />- it just lacks the conversation to back up the script and the premise and the good directorship. More spark please!
