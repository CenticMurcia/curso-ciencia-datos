If you are looking for a movie that is excruciatingly stupid, pick this one up.<br /><br />The story is, a group of teenagers are heading to a concert. They realize that their truck is low on gas before they leave and they don't even bother fill it up. So, they head to the concert and the truck runs out of gas. They are stranded out in the middle of nowhere and for some ridiculous reason, all 5 of their cell phones won't work. Don't ask me why because it isn't explained.<br /><br />When one of them goes for gas, he is killed and never seen again. So, the remaining teens decide to go look for him and get killed off one by one. The men get killed off but you never see their bodies again! The problem is the women. The killer killed the men but he won't kill the women. Why? There were 4 scenes that I have seen where the killer had the PERFECT opportunity to kill them.<br /><br />Here they are: <br /><br />Opportunity 1: Both women are stuck in a meat packing plant in a room and the killer is in there. When they open the door, one of the women just slowly backs away and screams continuously. Oh, did I mention that she is armed with a meat hook that she could have used to kill him? Instead, she doesn't do anything! The killer doesn't do anything to her either. The other girl hits him and he falls to the floor unconscious. They both walk out of the room. Literally! They walk! They don't run! <br /><br />That's one opportunity wasted! <br /><br />Opportunity 2: The girls stop a man who just happens to be driving his truck. They stop him and ask for a ride. After a few minutes of driving, they demand he stops the truck after seeing blood on his boots. He calms them down and explains the situation. They believe him 100% and just as he is about to continue driving, the killer comes out of nowhere and attacks the man and kills him except the women. When the women get out of the truck to look for the guy's body, the killer is nowhere to be found! <br /><br />There goes his second opportunity! <br /><br />Opportunity 3: The two girls stop in a glass office. There are two doors into this place. One in front and to the left, another door. One of the girls sees the killer standing in the doorway to the left and screams for the other girl to look at the killer. She doesn't look. The camera pans away for a few seconds then goes back and the killer is gone. There are no camera angles. The camera literally pans away for about 2 seconds and then goes back! <br /><br />There goes his third opportunity! <br /><br />Opportunity 4: The girls are finally at another meat plant and the killer is there. He knocks out the girls and walks away. When one of them gains consciousness, she runs over to him and shoves him on a sharp object which pins him to it. After he gets free, he knocks one of the girls down to the ground AGAIN! <br /><br />His fourth opportunity is gone too! <br /><br />Here is the worst death I have ever seen for a villain. You ready for it? When the girl is on the ground, she manages to grab a nail gun or something and hides it behind her back. As the killer slowly leans forward, she slowly aims the nail gun at his face. I'm not even kidding! It's like he all of a sudden went blind and can't see her aiming this thing at him. He also has his forehead pressed up against it. I'm not even kidding when I tell you that. Finally, she shoots him a few times with it. He doesn't scream or groan or anything! He just slowly sits back and dies.<br /><br />What is the point of making a film about a psychotic killer if he's not going to do anything? The majority of the movie is just two teenage girls running away from this killer. There were so many opportunities that the killer had to kill these women and they were wasted.<br /><br />I even had to pop two pills of Ibuprofen because of the massive headache I had obtained from listening to these two girls screaming nonstop.<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the WORST horror films I have ever seen! <br /><br />I give this movie 1 star out of 10. How stupid can a movie get?
