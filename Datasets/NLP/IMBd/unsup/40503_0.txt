Okay, some get John Waters and some don't. The same is true of Divine, I think. I fall into the second category. With the exception of "Hairspray" which was tolerable only because of Ricki Lake, John Waters's movies go straight over my head.<br /><br />This movie was my first introduction to Waters and Divine and what a wake up call. It's rare that I don't finish a movie, but this is one of the few exceptions. It is incredibly UN-funny. It features "nude" scenes with Divine who is the ugliest, least talented female impersonator I have ever encountered. Admittedly I haven't encountered many, but the ones I've seen were way better and they didn't get to star in even a lame piece of junk like this one. At no time did I accept Divine as a woman, and yet this movie insisted that I do so even to the point of enduring scenes where he/she attempted to seduce various male characters, and even attempted to provoke (if memory serves) a rape scene. Perhaps the ridiculousness, the sheer lack of any believability is the whole point. Usually I like that kind of thing, as when Elmer Fudd defies gravity. But this was pushing it, even for me.<br /><br />Maybe John Waters and Divine are your taste; maybe you'll get it and be entertained. Me: I rented this stink bomb and really wanted my money back.
