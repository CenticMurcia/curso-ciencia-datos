this movie sucked in every way, thin plot, no character development, flimsy acting, pretentious themes, clumsy production, super-low budget.<br /><br />nothing at all redemptive except maybe the hot girl and a decent beginning. Its like a watching a mediocre student film that got way too much attention.<br /><br />This movie is generally so bad one does not know where to begin...<br /><br />If you watch the director/actor/producer interviews on the DVD you will find out that they shot it over 8 days on break while the director was making ju-on, this makes sense as they spent no time developing this movie and one has to wonder why they bothered at all. It also becomes apparent through the lead actor's (Shinya Tsukamoto) interview that director Shimizu gave his actors little to no direction which he politely (and somewhat embarrassedly) tries to spin as as a good thing but reveals that he (as a director himself) wonders why there was so little thought and effort behind this project. This would explain his totally flat performance (just because the protagonist is alienated doesn't mean you don't have to act)! Producer Takahashi answers this mystery in his interview by revealing that this project was an "experiment"... read low budget throw-away to make a quick buck on his indie brand label. This is all pretense and no follow-through. I am selling my copy on ebay so look for it if you like j-trash.<br /><br />What a bunch of rubbish... Don't bother wasting any time on this one.
