Painful to watch such great acting talented wasted. Who comes up with such plots? There are so many good sources... While I understand the commercialism involved in making such a TV series, I never understand why producers and directors believe that audiences will tolerate such poor quality as fare... Those interested in Merlin would be advised to read Mary Stewart's trilogy.
