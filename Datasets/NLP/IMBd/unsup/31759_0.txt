Lindsey Lohan was miscast and the conclusion to this was more than just absurd, unbelievable, etc... Lohan plays Aubrey, a high school teen who gets kidnapped by a serial killer. We see her tortured in very grotesque ways. A woman finds a mutilated young girl by the road who is still alive. The girl is identified as Aubrey; however, she insists her name is Dakota and does not know her parents or friends. Dakota's personality is not like Aubrey's. She says she is a stripper and her mother died from drugs. The Flemming's take Dakota home with them; hoping to get their daughter back. Dakota insists her limbs just started falling off. The twist at the end is more than far fetched. The explanation for how fingers and legs could just fall off was more than silly.<br /><br />As many have said, Lohon is pretty bad in this. And her stripper scenes make her look used and cheap. This in not the script to pick for someone trying to move their movie career along.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: This movie is so bad that it might actually be one of those films people watch to get a chuckle and play a drinking game. But if you are a Lohan fan, I say don't watch this because it does not make her look good.
