It is a future time and prisons are now run by private companies for profit because the economy went to hell. Hmmmmm. --And this future time is not far from now either.<br /><br />This is a better than average action-entertainment or "popcorn movie". The concept is one we've seen a couple times of late about the ruthless greedy villain who manipulates a bunch of people into participating in some dangerous game or sport for internet viewing and profit. In this instance, a man is framed for the murder of his wife so that he will go to prison and participate in a "death race".<br /><br />This movie is one of the best of it's kind: action-entertainment. And to be fair folks, should be judged by that standard. The acting and the action is very good. It seems more like a guy-flick to me, maybe not. There is a good looking latina in it who plays our hero's driving partner. Her acting abilities surprised me because at first glance she seemed like she was just going to be "eye candy". She also got behind the wheel and was impressive. I'm thinking that all she needs is a little martial arts training and for someone in Hollywood to give her a chance and she could be a really good kick-ass heroine. (Who doesn't like women in snug outfits beating people up?) <br /><br />The ending also surprised me because it was--shall we say, "impersonal". I don't want to go into what that means and spoil it for you. Suffice to say that movies usually don't end that way. At first I was a bit disappointed, but then I said "why not?" --Do things a little different for a change. Anyway, put this one at the top of your "to see" and DVD list. No one is pretending and intending that it's art (in the "snooty" sense), it's just pure entertainment. Love, Boloxxxi.
