Warning, slight spoilers within To me, this was a fascinating Movie, about two Germans, leaving their (more or less)slowly eroding lives in Germany, and managing to live in Japan, a country they no pretty much nothing about (which surprised me concerning Gustav, a Zen Buddhist - I think it to be pretty much impossible to understand a religion without any knowledge about its cultural background). In Japan itself, they find two different worlds, the fast-paced metropolis of Tokyo, and the buddhist Temple, where time seems to stand still. All this leads to a huge amount of cultural "clashes", but of course, this is a comedy, so it doesn't end in prison. I really enjoyed these last two hours- but I was the perfect audience, so to say: As a German with huge interest in Japanese culture, a basic knowledge both of Japanese language and traditions(though in both I still have lots to learn) - I can understand many jokes which are often unnoticed. It was really entertaining to see how I myself would have reacted to being in Japan only two years ago. Therefore, much of the joy I had watching this movie may very well be coming from being proud of my own progress - which of course will not happen to most other viewers. Therefore I recommend this one to those who know a bit about Japan, knowledge about Germany might increase the fun, but isn't really necessary. Without knowing either country, this one is just a German comedy with fascinating pictures of a Japanese temple and an "artsy" touch - which isn't a bad thing, but not more than 7/10. For me though, i give 9/10.
