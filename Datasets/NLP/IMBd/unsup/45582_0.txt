Kids at the age there after (1-3) are constantly learning, and a brainless TV show like this, ware the characters constantly talk rubbish and the narrator keeps naming nonexistent things and creatures. Cannot be any good for the poor kids (even if them may like it). <br /><br />This show is absolutely terrible!
