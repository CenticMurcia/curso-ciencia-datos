The subject matter of this film is hilariously familiar, the story is bizarre and the relationships between the characters are believable, complex and well-written. On one level it's a superb comedy, but it also works as a drama. It was a pleasant surprise as I had no idea what to expect when I went to see it. I will be recommending 'GamerZ' to people for a long time to come.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoyed 'Napoleon Dynamite'. It's got a similar geeky charm, great dialogue and the pace never lags. It's a funny, bittersweet film about the small things in life, things which seem like a big deal when they happen.
