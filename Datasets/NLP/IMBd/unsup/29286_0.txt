I enjoyed this movie, it has an up to date urban twist on an old story...but I would wait for the tv version before I let MY mother or mother-in-love see it. It was funny and the acting was mostly above average. My favorites were Monique(the preachers wife) and Mama Africa and Sommore was great. It is absolutely worth the price of rental.
