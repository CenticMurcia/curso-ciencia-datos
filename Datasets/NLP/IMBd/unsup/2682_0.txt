Buñuel's fascinating masterpiece is a landmark of the erotic genre. A subtle drama with hints of burlesque comedy, it plays with an upper-class middle-aged man with too much money and time in his hands, and his sexual obsession for the elusive Conchita. She decides to remain virgin throughout the whole movie, however she uses her sex to manipulate Mathieu who's too blind to understand she'll never be his to possess.<br /><br />This is a frustrating movie to watch too - many times it seems Mathieu will be able to get Conchita to bet, only for her to change ideas in the last minute, however whetting Mathieu's attention through some glimpses of her naked body. I dare say she actually enjoys torturing poor Mathieu and his expectations. And I'm not sure we're meant to identify with his hang-ups, after all he seems just a bit too innocent to be tricked by Conchita so many times, however he's lust-driven.<br /><br />It's not Buñuel's best movie, but the dialogue is outstanding - which European movies usually lack - and I really felt something for these characters, especially Mathieu, brilliantly played by Fernando Rey. This is a great place for Buñuel newbies, it's got his personal touch of the surreal, but it's still linear and coherent enough like a normal Hollywood movie to be enjoyed by the average movie-goer.<br /><br />10 out of 10.
