So ban me from IMDb for spoiling about the true star. In the long run,this film will make it's way to the Top Comedy list, believe me. Well written, well acted, a bit slow in the editing. And the direction should have paced the scenes with more tempo. But generally one can say it's a true comedy film, not a movie. Either it was the recording or the mixing and maybe it's only the mastering - the ONLY negative is that it sounds lousy. Maybe it's just my DVD copy. The sound will never win an Oscar. But please ignore the comments and votes from the anally sensitive. This is a wonderful story and deserves to be seen and talked about.
