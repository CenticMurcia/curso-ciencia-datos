Dead Poets Society is an extraordinary movie that has a lot of meaning. When i watched this film, i found it unlike anything i had ever seen before, it shows you how one teacher can inspire and the change the life for A student, giving the confidence to find their path. I can say that when it comes to a great drama movie, Dead Poets Society should be on your 10 choices list. It may not have won the best picture Oscar, but most importantly, won the people's hearts.<br /><br />Robin Williams plays an English teacher called John Keating, working in a very prestigious and strict school. He is new to the academy, and has different teaching methods that acquire the students fascination to the subject. No longer are they bored of English, but are dedicated to it, thanks to the teaching methods pf Williams. He teaches his students to stick with their individual beliefs and follow their individual passion. Seize the day.<br /><br />I wish, i really wish that i had a teacher like John Keating!!
