After university professor Richard Todd "drops out" in protest of the expulsion of two clean-cut students who print an underground newspaper (The Tomorrow's Times!), he takes a jaunt to San Francisco to check out the action and finds nothing but bubble-blowing, hip-shaking, body-groping kids frolicking in the park (nothing too outrageous: the dancing blonde has flesh-colored undies beneath her dress, and all the couples are boy-girl). Quickie product filmed on the Columbia lot has nothing to say about religious cults (the theme is brought up, but only to be exploited). It is so poorly-made and na√Øve (and, ultimately, conservative) that it runs the risk of being endearing. Too bad nobody came up with a competent script to help the picture over that 30-minute hurdle. How much LSD does one have to take to get through relics like this? * from ****
