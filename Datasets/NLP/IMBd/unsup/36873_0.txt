If you like modern-day soap operas, you should like this critics' favorite. It's simply an ensemble of 20-ish young people who hang out at the diner and give us - or so the critics think - witty and profound statements. To me, most of them just sounded obnoxious, profane (blasphemous (especially in Steve Guttenberg's character) and unappealing. It didn't do much for me: kind of like another "Big Chill" but with a different cast.<br /><br />That was the only interesting aspect for me, seeing a young Kevin Bacon, Daniel Stern, Ellen Barkin, among others. I saw this on tape in the '90s instead of when it came out in the early '80s.<br /><br />This is probably too talky for many people today, and they aren't missing much. It's overrated.
