Escape From Hell??? Prison Of Sex??? Which is it??? <br /><br />This movie su-u-u-u-u-u-u-cked! <br /><br />Take Linda Blair, put her in furs, have her cap a security guy, (A slumming Penn Jillete.) then put her face to face with a sleazy diamond merchant/slave farm owner. It must have sounded cool at one point.<br /><br />Both of the early films that were ripped off, and had the Blair footage wrapped around, seemed like passable entertainment. But this horrid mess must have been made as a joke.<br /><br />No coherence. Characters switching on and off at will. Seemingly endless shots of chicks in jungle gear sweating and running before dying. That does get boring when done wrong. And this was WRONG.<br /><br />And who/where was that sneering voice coming from? (" Come on! You gotta WOOORRRKKK!!!!") <br /><br />The late Leon Askin (Gen. Burkhalter in "Hogan's Heroes.") was the lone watchable one. His brief scenes seemed like the only serious ones.<br /><br />Crap!
