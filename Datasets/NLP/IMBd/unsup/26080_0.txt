One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time!!!! Low budget b flick that was better that most million dollar films. These three actors were dead on most of the time forgot I was watching three men.Evie...funniest drunk I have ever seen very Debbie Renyolds like Great one liners!!!!!! Miss Coco who I had fallen in love with since her small part in "TRICK" her blood curdling scream make me pee every time!! And then there is Varla,aspiring actress who moves in with the two "has beens" Varla has come to the other girls looking for acting tips and revenge! The one liners hysterical,politically incorrect..the best part!! And I agree the opening features on the DVD are as funny as the movie!!!
