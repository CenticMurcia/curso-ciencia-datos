This is a mildly enjoyable flick which attempts to be a serious political thriller but in my opinion falls very short of the mark. This is mainly due to the exceedingly annoying Hollywood need to always create some romantic chemistry between the lead male and female characters. OK in this case it is not taken too far but it still feels false and as though it has been added in just to keep the lady's in the audience happy (or rather the Hollywood executive's idea of what will make lady's in the audience happy).<br /><br />In trying to be serious and political the film comes off at times as just being confusing. And the there's the plot holes, oh my god, there are just too many to mention. Some of the action and suspense sequences are great like the magnificent bit with the bus. Kidman is as usual very good but Penn at times feels very one dimensional, too much cowling at the camera.
