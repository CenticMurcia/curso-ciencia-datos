(sigh) Another bad film from Albert Pyun... I've seen "Blast" , "Mean Guns" , "Nemesis 3" , "Crazy Six" and "Post Mortem" before "Ticker" and I have to say that all of them are bad. It's shame to see Tom Sizemore and Dennis Hopper in this junk... <br /><br />The plot is awful and the budget must have been small, because the police station looks incredibly small. Well... this movie is bad and I hope that it doesn't ruin Sizemore's and Hopper's career. Steven Seagal is lame as always, but I can't decide which is worser "The Patriot" or "Ticker". I'm glad that I didn't rent this...I watched it from Satellite channel.<br /><br />* star out of *****
