not as intricately paced as May but still a good film....i do have to correct IMDb on their error comment dealing with the lesley gore song mention....in the film, the dj clearly says, 'you first heard her at the ripe old age of 17 with the #1 hit, It's My party, Heres lesley gore' and then it goes into "you don't own me'. making it clear that they were just introducing the song as a new song.<br /><br />i have to admit, these posts in the messageboard about the film not being scary or horrific are pretty sad. the film is creepy as can be and if that doesn't scare you then maybe you really aren't into scary movies. I don't want to sound like i am trash talking but a film like this, to me, is far scarier than a movie like Saw, Hostel or any of the new crop of pseudo horror/gore films out there.<br /><br />Sure, i am a big fan of films with gore, Cannibal Holocaust is a fave of mine but i actually think this movie is scarier....sure CH is disturbing due to its content and such but this movie is full of old fashioned scares that hold up. The sounds in the surround sound are enough to drive me and my cat crazy. and the movie is done well, the acting is top notch, the story is cool, the period nature of the film works and the direction is great.
