I thought this movie was fantastic. Edgy and full of young fun I was really drawn in a recommend it for a laugh,a touch of drama and sexy Alessandro Nivola! For those wondering what happened in the clock scene watch till the very end credits-there's a sneaky ending to it all! Although the movie title is a little bland, there are some truly awesome actors in it that create a movie with attitude. I find the plot really hard to forget now as often I found myself amazed at how thought out this movie was. I watched in on TV and I'm glad I did, its the sort of movie you can snuggle up with your boyfriend/girlfriends or your best girl mates who don't mind a bit of Alessandro showing of those toned arms... Loved it, and it appeals to all.
