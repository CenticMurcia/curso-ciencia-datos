I never get bored of this film. I think the actors are all wonderful and i only wish it could have been longer!!! Both Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth portrayed their characters really well and as corny as it sounds I think that if Jane Austen was alive today she would be very pleased with the film(as well as being a living miracle as the worlds oldest lady!). I also think that all the actors did very good performances, especially the Bennet family. For once the film is very very true to the book- of course the lake scene was added but that was not at all damaging to the film in my opinion and i think is one of the most famous moments in the film.Very good!
