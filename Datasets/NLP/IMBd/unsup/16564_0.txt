Boy, is this movie lame or what?<br /><br />Any interest in the movies' characters is SOLELY provided by Krya Sedgwick as the wise-cracking, potty-mouthed sister of the lead actress..can't place her name right now. <br /><br />Anyway, the lead finds out her husband (Dennis Quaid) is cheating, and this comes as a surprise to her even after it was pointed out that his nickname in college was 'Hound Dog'.<br /><br />Possibly she thought it was her duty to not see his indiscretions. She was raised in a town very concerned with two things - doing the right thing, and talking about it when someone else is caught doing the wrong thing. Her parents (Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands, who make any movie they are in better than it normally would have been) are in denial as well, about life in general but mostly about their own relationship. <br /><br />Nothing much really happens. In that way it reminded me a little of 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', but that was never boring for a minute. <br /><br />Soundtrack is distracting - each new scene begins with a swell of music, so if you're falling asleep, just listen for the music..that's the start of the next, and hopefully better, scene. <br /><br />But take my advice - it doesn't get any better. My heart goes out to Kyra, whose work is wasted in this boring vehicle.
