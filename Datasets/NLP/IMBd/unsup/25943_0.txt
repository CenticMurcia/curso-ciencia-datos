I am absolutely amazed to read reviews praising this program! Are they for real, or is it some kind of cruel joke? Yes, I'll admit that I love this show, but only because it's so terrible that it's hilarious. The acting is embarrassing, the lighting is poor, and the lines in the script are beyond cheesy. It's ridiculous. I feel like I'm watching a really bad student film. I'm aware that the program is made for those who are learning to speak English, but I'm surprised to see so many great reviews about it. Come on, people. Genius? I hardly think anything about this show could be described as 'genius...'<br /><br />Having said all that, I have still been sucked into this show! And so I have given it four stars - not because it's good though, because it's entertaining.
