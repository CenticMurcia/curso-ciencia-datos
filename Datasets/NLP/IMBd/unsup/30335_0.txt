And that alone should make you not want to take into consideration my review. However, it doesn't help having my own expectations before watching it. Some guy said that is a combination of Falling Down, Office Space and some other film. Yeah, it has cubicles!<br /><br />The movie is more reminiscent of Julian Po (mixed with quite a bit of Boxing Helena) and Christian Slater was clearly chosen for the part because of that particular movie. This is no way a comedy and, if you feel "cubicled", I don't know if it is a good idea to watch it. I mean, yeah, it does suggest one look into their own heart and act, rather than hate others and always fantasize (or even act) on that hate. However, it doesn't say what to do if what you find in your own heart is not that pretty.<br /><br />Bottom line: a pretty sad and dark film. It is also a good film and one might appreciate not only the script, but also Slater's wonderful performance. However, I personally wasn't in the mood for it.
