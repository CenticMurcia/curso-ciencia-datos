I have seen 1000's of films from bad to great, and this one barely ranks as watchable.<br /><br />The story has already been given by a poster, so no need for that. The wife and I sat down to watch this one with hopes. After 15 minutes we knew it was bad. We would have turned it off then, but we had hopes it would get better.<br /><br />After 40 minutes into I was wanting to pull my hair out. We knew at this time we just had to get through it. After this awful thing finally played out, I actually took the DVD out and smashed it with a hammer. The only movie I have ever done that to.<br /><br />I feel for anyone who sits through this entire thing!
