This movie was made for a very small budget ($100,000 at a time when the average movie cost $15 million). It was meant to appear to be a psychological thriller, yet, ultimately, it's something else; the kind of "now you see it -- now you don't" that normally doesn't happen in inexpensive, quickly made movies. The film suffered from distribution problems, eventually being bought by TROMA, which purposely made it look, as in all previous TROMA films, like a trashy horror film, which it is NOT, renaming it from IN DEADLY HEAT to STUFF STEPHANIE IN THE INCINERATOR. The potential viewer then expects to see a campy grossout, but that is not what happens at all. So,if you run into this film, give it a chance. It's not great, but it does have a clever spark that is unusual for a supercheap indy.
