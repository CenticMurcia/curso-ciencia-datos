I was astonished at what an awful production this was, considering Stewart's sterling reputation. Perhaps producing and acting is a bad combination for him? We watched it through the end only for the amusement of seeing how bad it could get. When the Stewart character begins to laugh at the end, so did I, as he sounded like nothing so much as a cat with a hairball. Those who are searching for a meaningful, three-dimensional performance are well-advised to search out the 1984 version starring George C. Scott.<br /><br />Stick to Star Trek and you won't be disappointed.
