I have to say to everyone here that if you are out to find a terrifying movie, this is not for you at all. This movie, i would have thought, would come under the genre of Comedy. Everything and i mean absolutely everything in this movie was very very bad quality. But all this added to the comedy side of the film. I could not help but laugh during the shark attack scenes, all they had done was take cuttings of sharks obviously attacking seals, or sharks moving through the water. The MEGALODON shark was obviously footage of a Great White, just zoomed in on. The FX were so bad they were laughable throughout the film. The acting, so atrocious that it is funny and embarrassing for you at the same time. And for some reason the voices of the characters were not always in sync with the film and most of the actors had slight Mexican accents even when they were not Mexican. The continuity of this film is atrocious.<br /><br />So when i say that this film is horrible, i mean it. By no means should you not view this movie, just do not watch it under the pretense that it will be scary. In fact go buy some popcorn, hire the movie out, get some friends around and get ready for non stop laughs. I honestly found this movie to be one of the funniest i have watched this year.
