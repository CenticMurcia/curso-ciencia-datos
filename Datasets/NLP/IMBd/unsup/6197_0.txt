I absolutely love this movie, but am unable to find it anywhere on VHS or DVD. I watched this movie years ago. It had two endings. The first ending has the people at the end being attacked by the Aunt's cats. They knew the bad intentions of the evil nephew. I love cats, horror, and this movie. It is suspenseful all the way through it.<br /><br />Great movie for us oldies who love suspense and horror. Today's scary movies are all blood and guts, and repetitive. In the old days, one movie stood out from others-like this one. My hope is that I can find a station that is willing to show this movie again.<br /><br />Great, great, great.
