...after some very difficult (nude!) roles in FEELING SEXY and (in particular) THE MONKEY'S MASK. Wenham is also good - after appearing in various bit-parts, his major break came in THE BOYS, closely followed by A LITTLE BIT OF SOUL and MOLOKAI: now, of course, he's a household name.<br /><br />This is by no means a brilliant film: it lulls occasionally, and there's something annoyingly trivial about watching a couple of young people talk about their new relationship - universal, but still trivial. However, first-time director Teplitzky manages to create a very open feeling, and drag us into the story with the use of obvious, but (again) universal, angsts. Yes, you can spot the "ending" from a mile away - though of course half the fun in these realist films is predicting what might come next - but if there's one reason to see it, it's Kris McQuade (you might know her from the FIELDS OF FIRE trilogy) as the taxi driver: unmissable.
