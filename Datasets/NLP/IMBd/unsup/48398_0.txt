Unlike Tom from Santa Monica (the other reviewer), I didn't read any newspaper reviews - I just sat through the first 45 minutes and couldn't take any more.<br /><br />The actor Ray Romano was irritating in the extreme and the storyline totally unbelievable and unfunny. For example, a girl puts on a video which is of her mother in a sex movie, the doorbell rings and she doesn't want to answer it because the visitor is an old boyfriend, so she hides without turning off the video. Guess what happens. Ridiculous.<br /><br />Example no. 2: a father is smoking a joint in his locked bedroom. His daughter knocks on the door and he tries to get rid of the smoke and upsets a flower pot on a bed. He then answers the door with the joint still in his mouth. So funny. Not. Truly an awful film.
