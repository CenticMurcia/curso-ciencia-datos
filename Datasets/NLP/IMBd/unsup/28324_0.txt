We watch a new horror movie every week so we have a VERY open mind when it comes to low-budget films. Let us tell you that this one was one of the worst we've ever seen! The acting was simply horrific, the ending was completely uneventful, and it was just not scary at all. We love watching "B horror movies," they are usually very entertaining but this was just boring, and an embarrassment to all involved. You sit there and wait for something to happen but nothing really does. The makeup was horrible (big surprise), the "ghosts" or "zombie- things" looked like they came straight from a grammar school haunted house-yeah, real frightening-we were waiting for the zombies to scream, "BOO!" Besides that, the filming was close to the worst we've ever seen, if not the worst. We usually let that go if the acting and the rest of the movie is decent since we know they can only do what their budget allows but this just compounded the horror of the movie. Ghost Watcher 2 is now out, we'll rent it since we want to see if the 2nd part to this "film" could possibly get any worse!
