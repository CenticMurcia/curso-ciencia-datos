This is solid 7 out of 10. I felt as tho we weren't given enough details of the "story", before joining in on the movie. I think if there was flashback or two, or if the movie began about a year or two before the actions took place, the current situation would have meant more. I didn't feel I knew any of the characters, so I was not able to really care all that much to what happened to them. Acting was suburb, and the premise was right on. No sugar coating in the ending, and the costumes and "feel" of the scenery brought me to the 1800s. Overall, it was good, not great.
