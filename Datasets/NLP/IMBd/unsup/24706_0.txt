Inuyasha is the best anime series I have seen and the one that Iam obsessed with right now. I love it! It has everything a series should have: well defined characters that make you fall in love with them, humor, suspense, the ability to grab your attention and hold it, excitement, great lines and dialog, characters that have a personality that no doubt everyone can find one to relate themselves and become a fan of, an engaging storyline that doesn't slow down, malicious villains and lovable heroes, great animation and voice actors that have voices that match there characters perfectly. When I was small mostly all my favorite shows were anime and when I grew up and my anime shows all came to an end I started watching shows with people and forgot about anime until Inuyahsa that is. I remember being on the computer and on yahoo's box of entertainment of what the world is searching for I saw that people were looking up anime and a list of the most popular and searched for anime of all time and Inuyahsa was number one. I read a summary for it and become interested so I asked my friend who loves anime about it and he told me it was his favorite anime series right now. I started watching it and immediately I got hooked. Now I watch it all the time. I got caught up on the first 50 or so episodes by the season box sets which are great. I bought them during my march break and watched all 54 episodes in a week, it was awesome. And now I never miss the new ones. I'm always there on Fridays at 9:00 watching it with my eyes glued on the screen and by behind glued on the couch. I recommend it to all anime lovers and to everyone who loves a great adventure with action, romance, lots of humor and unforgettable characters. But a warning it will make you fall in love with demons!
