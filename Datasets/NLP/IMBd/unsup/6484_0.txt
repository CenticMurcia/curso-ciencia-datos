And Mary Tyler Moore as the sociopath Sante Kimes. Her history is very interesting, and frightening at the same time. Moore gives an excellent performance here, she is not over the top and quite believable as Sante.<br /><br />Robert Foster delivers a good performance as Ken 'Pappa' Kimes- Sante married this man for his money, enjoyed the high life in Los Angeles, Nevada, the Bahamas and Hawaii. Apparently Sante was capable of anything. She got her husband into a political affair for Jimmy Carter's election (similar in personality to John Wayne Gacy, who worked volunteered for Rosalynn Carter, and Ted Bundy, who volunteered for the Republican Governor in the state of Washington).<br /><br />Basically Sante flips when her husband does not leave her any money in his will- he leaves it to his children. This kicks in her major criminal behavior, which leads her and her son (who is her devoted slave) to New York City. She manages to get her attractive son to rent an upscale apartment owned by wealthy NYC socialite Irene Silverman, (well- portrayed by Jean Stapleton). The scenes with Stapleton and her boxer, Sophie, are truly upsetting. Silverman was murdered on 4th of July weekend, when her house-man and maid were off for vacation. I believe there was also a scene where they drove from NYC to Manalapan, Florida (The wealthiest city, near Palm Beach ).<br /><br />In court, Sante stands up and screams to the judge ..."there is no body...so there is no case...I am innocent".... A truly frightening movie, as it is all true. Sante and Kenny were sentenced to 220 years in prison, and presently the state of California is attempting to extradite them for their crimes in California. Highly recommended.9/10
