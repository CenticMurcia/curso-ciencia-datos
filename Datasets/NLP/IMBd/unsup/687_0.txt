Set during the Spanish Inquisition, this take on the Poe story features Grand Inquisitor Torquemada (Lance Henriksen in a marvelously intense performance) engaging in various acts of torture to get citizens to confess to witchcraft. He targets young baker Antonio (Jonathan Fuller) and his wife Maria (the amazingly alluring Rona De Ricci, who looks great in and out of clothes), only to find himself lusting after her. He then proceeds to torture her, concluding that his lust can only be the result of her "bewitching" him.<br /><br />Putting aside anachronisms such as the lack of accents and the rather modern way much of the dialog is delivered, this is a solid effort from veteran genre director Gordon. It looks fantastic, with impressive sets and costumes. In his ever enjoyable fashion, Gordon spices it up with plenty of violence and his great touch for black humor. Granted, the broader comedy relief (courtesy of Torquemadas' clownish associates played amusingly by Jeffrey Combs, Stephen Lee, and William J. Norris) I could have done without, but overall the film is commendably as intense as Henriksens' central performance. It's very striking, involving (De Ricci not only is very attractive, she really gets to the heart of her impassioned character), and lavish, with a typically fine music score by Richard Band.<br /><br />The strong supporting cast contributes equally vivid turns; Frances Bay, Tom Towles, Mark Margolis are all excellent as well. Gordons' actress wife Carolyn turns up, and as usual, there's a graphic demise in store for her. Oliver Reed pops up about halfway through the movie in a nice cameo as a Cardinal.<br /><br />It's a great Full Moon production and a film that any fan of Gordons' "Re-Animator" or "From Beyond" ought to see.<br /><br />8/10
