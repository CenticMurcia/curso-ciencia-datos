What can i say. This was a Great film that i really enjoyed. Very funny.<br /><br />When i first watched this film they said its a WELSH TRAINSPOTTING A Welsh Trainspotting - No. Its completely different from Trainspotting and in my opinion, better and funnier. Don't get me wrong though, Trainspotting is still a great film but i prefer this. I don't know why really, i guess its because i'm Welsh (and proud of it). And i'm happy to see they made a decent WELSH film. Trust me, if your into foreign films that speak English or if you like British comedy films, then watch this. 10/10. <br /><br />Best line ever was:<br /><br />'And this glue is for my submarines and not for sticking up your f****** noses. And don't think i don't notice because i do. Buy your own f****** glue!'
