this is an awful film. Very low budget, wooden acting, and a story that is as incomprehensible,as it is dull. Avoid at all costs. I have seen student films that are better than this, after just a couple of minutes the complete amateurish production is obvious. My first hint was that the DVD said in was 1hour and 15 min. what an odd length for a feature film, well that one hour lasted what seemed like forever. Oh and don't believe the what you might read on the DVD as far as the story is concerned. Vegas, and the casino they are supposed to blow up, never happens. In fact it looks to me like they never left the back woods of Oregon where i wish they had left the DVD.<br /><br />I would give it a zero if I could.
