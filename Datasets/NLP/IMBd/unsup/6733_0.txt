I really enjoyed Bee Movie. The role of Barry Benson was just made for Seinfeld, can't think of anyone better to be cast as the voice.<br /><br />Plenty of humor for the kids and adults alike. I thought the plot was going to be a bit thin in the middle, but the ending ties it up just nicely. Would have liked to hear more from Chris Rock though!<br /><br />Anyway, a very entertaining, light hearted film (even with a hint of a message about Ecosystem preservation for the kiddies). <br /><br />One of the better animated films after a long run of disappointments(except for Ratatouille). I'll be getting this one on DVD without a doubt. 8/10
