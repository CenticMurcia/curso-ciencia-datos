While I can't add anything to my summary, it requires 10 lines to submit a rating so I have to add more comment.<br /><br />This movie is a major distortion of the Iraq war.<br /><br />It is depressing, bringing out the worst part of any war, and is not representative of what our brave troops do, or what the vast majority of them live with when they return to our country.<br /><br />It is a clich√©.<br /><br />It offers the worst of what the Vietnam War offered viewed through the Communist propaganda of that time, pretending to be about a war against the Iraqi people.<br /><br />It is a battle against anti-freedom Sadam supporters and the terrorists that attacked our country. Regardless of our feelings toward Bush, we need to fight Al-Queda there, because that is where they chose, or else we will be fighting them here, in LA, NYC, Atlanta, and Omaha.<br /><br />It is a FAR left vision of reality- distorted to show the minimum as if it were the maximum.<br /><br />It ignores the social benefits our troops have supplied to the Iraqi people, and ignored the awful life the Iraqi's had under that awful dictator and his rapist, sadist, boys.<br /><br />It doesn't represent the accomplishments of the troops at that time and certainly not the major accomplishments reported over the last couple years in the Associated Press or Reuters.<br /><br />It is, simply, an awful movie that is anti-American, and against our courageous volunteer army.<br /><br />When will Hollywood learn that insulting the American people will not generate either a great movie, or a popular movie???
