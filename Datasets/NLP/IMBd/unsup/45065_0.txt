Albert Brooks still knows how to spin off a great one-liner but something has happened to this man since the great "Defending Your Life". He seems angry at everyone and everything with only a handful of compassionate moments reserved for those who can't do him any harm (in this case, his children). Andie MacDowell's sinusoidal career moves on, this performance being on the good side of average (her next will invariably be on the bad). The greatest pleasure this movie has to offer is Sharon Stone. She perfectly portrays the flighty, carefree lifestyle of a daughter of Zeus. It is for her luminescence and the two or three funny jokes (plus great cameos by James Cameron and Martin Scorsese) that I give The Muse 3/10.
