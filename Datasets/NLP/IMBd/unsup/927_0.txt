What a loser this 1998 film is.<br /><br />It's a shame that Signe Hasso, a great actress so many years ago, allowed herself to get into this productive mess. I want to remember Signe Hasso for "The House on 92nd Street," not this mess of a film.<br /><br />For Rob Lowe, the film is perfect. He lacks talent and this picture allows him to display it.<br /><br />One of the previous comments says that Michael York is similar to the late James Mason. Is that true and I congratulate the writer for stating this.<br /><br />Cassie was just too sweet of a girl to be left alone here. Go know that she led a previous life which is true of the Lowe and Hasso characters.<br /><br />Ms. La Rue is no Lola. That's what was needed for her part as well as far better writing. The film appears amateurish at times.
