Fine bravura tour de force from Mr Hasebe. A young nerdy cake decorator and a waitress misfit work in the same tea-shop. She makes a play for him and they end up on the road, in the rain picking up a near naked hitch-hiker who gleefully rips off her wet clothes and more. This delirious movie begins almost as a comedy, although there is always an edge. The scenes preceding the hitch-hiker's demise are almost dreamlike and it is unclear quite what the tone is to be. But gradually the waitress, desperate to get her pal to get hot enough in bed to get her hot, hits on the connection between the blood and violence and his erection/performance. Once the direct correlation between killing and f***ing is established there is no holding this kid back. Inevitably, in the end he seems content just to kill and the film builds to the most amazing and bloody climaxes. Very well made with loads of s & v.
