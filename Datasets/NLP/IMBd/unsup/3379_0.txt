I love science-fiction, and will watch almost anything in the genre (although so far have resisted seeing Battlefield Earth). I watched Attack of the Killer Tomatoes with enjoyment. Last Mimzy was supposed to be another E.T. However, although E.T. was not Shakespeare (remember "penis-breath"?), at least it had Spielberg. Mimzy's director made William Shatner the director look like Alfred Hitchcock. <br /><br />Mimzy was humorless. E.T. had product-placement with Reese's pieces. Mimzy bludgeons with ersatz Tibetan Buddhism, crystal worship, palmistry, animal rights, and Silent Spring anti-pollution preaching. Alice didn't really go through the looking-glass, she had an abortive encounter with a vortex time-cloud hatched above some crystals from the future, presided over by a robot stuffed rabbit who is trying to get back to the future. Emma, the 21-st century Alice, is a "pure soul" who can help the future, perhaps because she recoils after learning the hamburger she eats was once a cow. At the end, the Gestapo FBI/Homeland Security forces, who track down Emma and her brother because they caused a multi-state power failure, instantly break off their pursuit and suddenly leave, immediately after witnessing Mimzy the robot rabbit disappear into the sky (a la E.T.?). I've never seen such a wooden scene in a movie. (Even Killer Tomatoes had a better ending!) <br /><br />Speaking of ending, the dad in the movie gets to moon the audience while walking around the house wearing only his pajama top (Mom stays fully clothed) and trying to get Mom to break her diet. Kid's movie??
