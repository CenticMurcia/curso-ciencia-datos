"Campfire Stories" was pretty lame,in my opinion.the opening sequence,with the so called flaming skull,looked like it was made on the cheap,to be polite.normally,i try to be diplomatic about bad acting in movies,but that would be hard in this case,so i won't say any more about that.aside from that,i didn't find it scary.i guess it's supposed to be something like "Tales From the Crypt" or "Creepshow",but it certainly doesn't measure up to either of those anthology series.i don't know what else to say.i guess i could talk about the lack of suspense,or even tension in the movie.or the fact that is not much gore for you gore hounds.to be fair, i didn't watch the whole thing.i didn't even watch all of the first episode.i fell asleep,but I'm fairly certain the rest of the anthology is no better.most people would likely be bored by this one.my advice is to avoid "Campfire Stories" and look elsewhere to satisfy your entertainment needs.I'll give this movie 3/10,at most.
