Vince Rocca did a great job on this one. I've seen a lot of comparisons here to Kevin Smith's 'Clerks' but I enjoyed this indie a whole lot more. This is definitely a flick to chill out with on a Saturday night. I thought it was very funny and Vince did a great job with the sound & cinematography IMO. I knew from watching the trailer that I would enjoy this film and I surely did! The women are especially hot too. <br /><br />This film is a fine example of what can be accomplished by the independent filmmaker. And it should surely serve as inspiration/example to those of us who aspire to make indies. If you get a chance to see the screener for this you should--you won't be disappointed. Great job on this everyone!
