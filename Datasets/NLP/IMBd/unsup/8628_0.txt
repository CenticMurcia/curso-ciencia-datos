I have to admit that before watching this one with my 2 year old daughter, it seemed virtually certain that I'd be doing a great deal of groaning and yawning for the next hour and fifteen minutes. After all, a movie made for young girls, released straight to video, and branded with a 3 at the end of the title, doesn't really sound all that thrilling.<br /><br />Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised! The artwork, score, and voice acting were all up to Disney's usual high standards. But I was most impressed with the writing / screenplay. Where the original Cinderella was and always will be a classic, I felt it lacked character depth. It was a wonderful movieÂ… in its day.<br /><br />C3's characters had real world problems and values. The plot was a great twist on the original. This one's a great little flick for any child or child at heart. I was surprised to see even my little 2 year old got emotionally involved in the story and stayed with it almost all the way through! At the end, I felt slightly disappointed that it wasn't released in theaters.
