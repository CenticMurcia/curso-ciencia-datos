This is a terrible, terrible movie. I like bad movies, but I couldn't even sit through this piece of trash. All of the actors (or should I say 'over-actors'?) were terrible caricatures of characters in Twelve Angry Men, the plot is trite (they probably stole a good part of it from CSI or something), and the flashbacks of the murders are terribly shot and filtered with something yellow so they are also physically hard to watch. Unless you have watched every other movie ever made, for Pete's sake don't get this one. If you're looking for jury drama, go with the original version of Twelve Angry Men instead. And if you're looking for an actual psychological thriller, there are hundreds better than this one.
