Call me hopelessly sentimental but I actually find this film very touching! Once you totally suspend your disbelief (this is a film, it's kind of expected...) Jez and Dylan really sell the orphans concept. Here you have two lonely, needy, love-starved guys who through hard work, self-denial and sheer determination win themselves a family and a home. How can your heart not melt? The acting by the male leads is strong enough (mostly - the 'why do I have to get so technical?' scene falters a bit) to make you invest emotionally in Dylan and Jez' quest despite the fact that - all soft-heartedness aside - they are two lying, selfish, close to morally bankrupt con-merchants. By the end of the film you'll be cheering them on.<br /><br />What am I saying? By five minutes in you'll be cheering them on! Yes, it's full of clich√©s. Yes, it's pretty predictable. Yes, it's soppy. But this film proves that you can get away with anything if you have lovable characters and a fantastic soundtrack (see also Ocean's 11). Never fails to cheer me up - I'd recommend it to anyone not entirely hard-boiled.
