A TV cowboy star is in actuality a wussy egomaniac who doesn't know the first thing about the Old West. Miraculously, he is transported from the set to the REAL Old West where he meets all the outlaws who his character has killed and bested in his series. Not only do they prove to him that they are MUCH more manly but they threaten him until he promises to return to the present day and correct this silly stereotyped cowboy hero image--allowing the bad guys to win and revealing to America that cowboys like Roy Rogers and Gene Autry were just pretty boys who NEVER would have survived the rigors of Western life! <br /><br />I have noticed something in reading through the Twilight Zone episodes on IMDb. In general, the serious episodes of the show are rated much higher than the comedic episodes--even though I think that the occasionally funny episodes are a great relief from a constant barrage of overly serious themes. This episode, like so many others, is great fun to watch because it didn't take itself very seriously! Do yourself a favor and give this one a watch.
