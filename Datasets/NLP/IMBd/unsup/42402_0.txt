While watching this, you may find yourself waiting for the horror, so the sudden credits may be the only shock you experience in this movie.<br /><br />Another "I swear it - the corpse was here two minutes before!"-movie, this reminds me of some X-Files parts - Mulder and Scully would have far improved this movie.<br /><br />All in all, this tells us that the Stephen King-movies may have a good script (his books!), but are poorly converted, and even nice cover pictures can't make me watch one more.
