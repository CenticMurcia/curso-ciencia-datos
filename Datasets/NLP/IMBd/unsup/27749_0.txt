If the Title "The Butchers Wife" puts you off watching this film count yourself lucky, take the hint and dont bother with this rubbish. The film is about a simple clairvoiant who marries a butcher after she dreams that her future husband will walk out of the sea.When she moves to New York she meets a group of people who she gives spiritual and relationship advice that turns all their lives around including her and her new husband's. If that description sounds dull you would be right to think so. This film is like an overlong , dull sit com that has no humour or pattern to it whatsoever. Is there anything good i can say about this film?.......no not really. 4 out of 10.
