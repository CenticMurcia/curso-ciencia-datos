I can't believe there are people who like this movie. Of course, their opinion is as valid as mine, but it's hard for me to understand that. What's in this movie? A few pseudo-comic scenes, several references to old spanish TV programs and music hits (if you want to feel nostalgic with all that stuff you can watch a spanish TV documentary instead and that'll be surely better), and a surreal plot only understood by the people who made the film. I must confess I didn't laugh a single time, perhaps I smiled twice or three times during the whole movie. Sorry, Santiago, I don't like it !<br /><br />My rating is 4 out of 10 (and I'm being generous because I'm spanish).
