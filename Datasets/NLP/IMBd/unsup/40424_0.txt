This show seemed to be about a rather large, plain woman who was regarded highly for her singing but spent a lot of time trying to keep men out of her pants. Trouble is, the script calls for someone who is truly attractive. The casting of Lisa is unforgivable as Ms Tarbuck is not "sexy" and the plot therefore lacks all credibility. Did I say plot? The show meandered, talking scenes linking pointless nightclub singing spots that are designed to show off "Lisa's" talent. I am astonished that the show has received so many high votes on this site. Dare I suggest that Ms Tarbuck's famous daddy is the main reason that she got the part? No, there is no nepotism in showbiz. I expect that Ms Tarbuck does have acting talent and her character roles, such as Mrs Jellyby in Bleak House, are more suited to her persona.
