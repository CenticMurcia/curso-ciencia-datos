OK, maybe I'm giving in to nostalgia here but I rented "Footloose" recently and thought it was great. Yes, it's definitely a teen flick, similar to "Dirty Dancing", and aging a little now.<br /><br />But the music is great and the plot and themes do as much for me as "Grease" ever did. As teen movies go, it is somewhat original and interesting.<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- Teens with nothing better to do on a rainy day<br /><br />-- People reliving the 1980s, you won't be disappointed to<br /><br />see this one again<br /><br />I'll give Footloose a 9 out of 10 because it cheered me up on a day I needed it.
