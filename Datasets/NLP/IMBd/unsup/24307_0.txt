Time after time, I wonder how Robot Chicken will top itself and always it does. Its cast sometimes beggars believe with familiar Voice Actors returning to there classic roles such as Danny Goldman returning to the role of Brainy Smurf for a parody of the movie Se7en.<br /><br />The show's humour while not topical does not try to be, sure there are a few bush are idiot jokes but it's not preachy nor does it expect you to laugh at its hidden meaning. The humour is over the top and not for everyone, put if you liked the scene in family guy where Peter, Brian, Chris and Stewie vomit over each other you will feel right at home with Robot Chicken.<br /><br />Where else can you see Palpatine answer his phone with the phrase "Go For Papa Palpatine" then lay into Darth Vadar when he finds out the Death Star has been destroyed. Want to see what "The Office" look like if it was set in COBRA's HQ The Terrordome? What about Bevis and Butthead joining the animated Teen Titans? Then watch robot chicken it is out on DVD so no excuse!
