The concept behind this show is good, but the crappy writing, actors and sorry excuses for jokes threw it all away.<br /><br />I just don't understand how things like this even make it on the air. Why are wonderful shows like "Freaks and Geeks" and "Arrested Development" even considered for cancellation? The acting is bad. Just plain bad. The "jokes" are a slap on the face for its viewers. The only reason I tuned in was for Liam Sullivan, whom I assumed would have more common sense than signing up for this. I hope he finds better work, because this show can not go pass its fourth episode.<br /><br />And our protagonist, is just HORRIBLE.
