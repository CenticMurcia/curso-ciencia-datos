I want to clear something up right away before all the fans start clicking "no."<br /><br />I am a Waters fan. "Pink Flamingos", "Female Trouble" great B movie cult classics, even Water's himself making cameos here and there ("Seed of Chucky" etc.) So I don't want to be misunderstood as one of those people who just doesn't like anything he does. <br /><br />Blair, Knoxville and Ullman's families should all be instructed to love them less after starring in this dreck.<br /><br />Not only is the movie not on par with the usual atmosphere of Water's past classics, it's just downright stupid, and not even in a turn-your-brain off amusing sort of way. People get knocked in the head and are all of a sudden sex fiends....and not only that, soon the whole town is walking around with head injuries and trying to hump anyone that moves.....(sigh). <br /><br />Blair sleep walks campily through this film as a stripper with nightmarishly huge boobs and little else. Why she, after proving that she had obvious talent in other roles, ever agreed to this is beyond me. I can appreciate well known actresses wanting to do a "cult" or "B" movie because of love for a character or franchise (ie: Bridget Fonda's cameo in "Army of Darkness.") But not after reading this script and saying "Let me get this straight, I talk about how good promiscuity is and having huge knockers, and pole dance through the entire thing?" "Where do I sign?!" <br /><br />Ullman was a shocker. Was she hard up for cash? She should stick with the skit shows. Knoxville, well, i'm not real surprised at, it seems to fall into the category of everything else he'd been in up to the time this came out. (He's probably suffered enough head injuries from his "Jackass" days to explain his participation.) Although he's subsequently had some significant and decent roles, go figure. <br /><br />I wish there was more I could tell you about the plot, but there's not. Some group tries to redeem the sexually deviant, only to in the end become them themselves. Great. I was actually angry for wasting my time and rental fee on this trash. <br /><br />I know Waters is known for controversial, trashy movies, but the difference between this and his others is that they're fun. My advice, skip this and dig into your collection for the "Divine" era.
