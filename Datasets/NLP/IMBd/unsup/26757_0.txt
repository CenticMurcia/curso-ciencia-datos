- Campbell Scott and Stanley Tucci do it here, and in the very highest style. This is the film where Tucci, previously stuck playing sleazyball creeps, reinvented his career. Primo and his brother Secundo (Tucci) own a gourmet restaurant. The conflict - Primo the purist won't sell out to commercialism, while Secundo is seriously considering it, in the interest of staying in business. A simple plot, but perfectly written and magnificently realized.
