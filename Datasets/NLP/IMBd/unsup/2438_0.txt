In ending this movie, they used the exact ending of Long Kiss Goodnight! It's not even a copy--it's just an edited version of the same thing!! How cheap. What's up with that? If you watch closely you can actually see a truck disappear that they used in Long Kiss Goodnight that wasn't supposed to be there in Extreme Limits or Crash Point Zero whatever you want to call it. Not worth the $1.99 to rent, unless you want a good laugh at the copy cat ending! YUCK
