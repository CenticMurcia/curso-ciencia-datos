Telefilm Canada is government agency that helps fund movies and TV shows. It has been criticized for mostly funding obscure films with little appeal to the general public. It has been trying to fund more mainstream movies but it's too bad they didn't pass on this one. It was on a movie channel and I began watching I immediately assumed it would be a bad movie and it surpassed my expectations. But I was stuck on the couch and wanted to see how bad it would get. After watching the movie I assumed it was a first time director who somehow got the financing together. In Canada productions are often made by people who know how to write the proper grant applications not the people who can produce something of quality. But I found out the director has been around for many years making bad movies and I guess he knows the ins and outs of financing but never learned how to write or direct a movie. I thought at first it might be an over the top movie that was meant to be humorous but that was not the case it was a clich√©d slasher film without any redeeming features except the bodies of some of the women in it. But if I want to see attractive woman I can watch an adult movie and they take their clothes off. This movie has no nudity but a fair amount of cleavage. It makes no sense and one doesn't care about any of the characters. Avoid this film. Don't let it make any money and perhaps the Canadian Government will be more careful about financing films. Movies can be mainstream and good at the same time. I hope Telefilm Canada learns that lesson one day.
