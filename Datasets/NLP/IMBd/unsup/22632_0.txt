I am another one who remembers this wonderful production when I was a child. I also had the cast album. I think my favorite song was "My Mother's Wedding Day" sung by "Meg Brockie" - Marlyn Mason. What a hoot! Notice that was the one song that was left out of the Gene Kelly/Cyd Charisse version! I guess it was just a touch racy. Its funny, but for years I couldn't get anyone to believe that there had ever been another version of Brigadoon besides the Kelly/Charisse version. I almost thought that I had dreamed it, but then I would look at the album cover and KNOW i was right! Even my mom didn't believe me - and she had watched it with me!<br /><br />And yes, I dearly wish this was available on VHS or DVD!<br /><br />YIPPEE!!! There are 9 pieces of it on YOUTUBE - including Charlie singing Come To Me Bend To Me to Jeannie!!
