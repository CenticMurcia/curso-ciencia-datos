Proves that making a visual-effects maker a director of a movie is a mistake.<br /><br />Not one single scene contained any of the components the book actually used to make a good story. The story-line suffered immensely from it.<br /><br />If you take the book, and flip thru it, take a sentence on each 3rd or 4th page, and visualize that. Then you take each of the parallel stories, the hidden hints and associations, and you boil it down to one sentence and reveal them in each scene, and then you have this movie.<br /><br />Not one of the stories have survived, not one of the twists is revealed in a proper manner in the movie.<br /><br />It's OK to cut parts of a story out to make a visual presentation, but this movie cuts out the plot it self.<br /><br />How they can make a followup of this piece of *beep* (something than usually smell really really bad) is beyond me, they removed all the plot-twists that allowed Eragon to make room for the "Eldest".<br /><br />I will NOT ruin the "Eldest" by seeing the movie (if ever one is made), unless off-course, they manage to get some promising director to direct it... And then, I doubt I will pay money to see it in the theaters.<br /><br />Shame on the script-writers! I have NEVER seen a book be so awfully ruined in a movie.
