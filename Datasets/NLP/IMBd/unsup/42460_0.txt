We decided against everyone's advice here and went and saw the movie. It restored our faith in society to find the theatre was absolutely empty. The funniest part of this movie was reading what everyone else on here had to say about it. Which is even funnier now that we have seen (half of) it. We too had to leave mid movie, maybe even twenty-five minutes in such was the breathtakingly bad production - one of us falling asleep and the other getting fidgety. Except for the cinematography and special effects not withstanding how poorly they were used this was about as bad as it gets. Anyway we wandered into the theatre next door and picked up Star Trek. At least there was some good eye candy in that movie. The really sad part of it is that this movie actually makes it to the box office.
