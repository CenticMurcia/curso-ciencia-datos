Oh, I hate this type of movies. The European (Italian) background was just a fake. It had nothing to do with the story. Gilda Mattei thought she was smart and sensitive and blah blah but she was actually a low IQ self-centered kid. The film is terrible because it shares no feeling about the real world that is much deeper and wider that can be beyond the imagination of the poor director.<br /><br />2 out of 10 for some of the camera works.
