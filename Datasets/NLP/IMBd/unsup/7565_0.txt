(some plot content included, although there is no way to spoil this crap) Ok, here's the scene: Me and my friends are renting movies one night and we decide to rent this (thinking it would be funny, not a porn because of it's R rating). My, my, my, how we were wrong. There were probably 11 people total working on this movie. There are like 5 orcs in the whole movie, and they get killed and yet come back for the next scene. But the thing that had me tearing my hair out was the "comedy." Good lord! The jokes, if you can call them that, were so bad, oh so BAD. Seriously, it made me want to cry thinking that someone thought that some of these jokes would be funny. There was one part in the movie I thought was funny (I think at this point I would have found anything funny) was a scene where the bad wizard was killing Smirnoff the wizard by putting him under a blanket and then farting under the blanket. I believe he called it the "killer dutch oven." Another part an "orc" (which was a guy with blue make-up on) started p**sing on the "throbbits" that he was trying to catch. It was obvious that he would have seen them, but like the rest of this movie, it didn't make any sense at all. And despite what you may have read in other reviews, the girls in this movie are especially skankarific, and if you have any standards whatsoever with women, you would find MAYBE one remotely attractive. The dialogue is diabolical and the CG! I've never seen such crap. There were cut scenes to show where the throbbits were on their trek. The only thing was the AWFUL cg looked NOTHING like where they were. This movie is worth the rent to see just how bad this is! Another thing that absolutely baffles me is why this movie was made. It's not quite porn and it's the farthest thing from being a funny movie. Who provides funding for this crap? Only see this movie if you're looking for another reason not to live.
