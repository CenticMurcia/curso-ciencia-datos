When are movie studios going to learn that Will Farrel is a bufoon, not an actor who can be the center of a movie. His smug, stupid facial expressions made me sick. The story was so silly it also made me sick. The only good thing was the special effects. But you can't hold a whole movie together on special effects. You have to have a good story, good acting, doesn't have to be brilliant acting, but at least some sort of effort has to be made by the actors to entertain. I wasted my money on this film and I am not happy. I even asked the theater for my money back and they gave me a free pass for another movie. And I wasn't the only one suckered into this. Others were asking for their money back too and I saw at least six people walk out of the theater during the show. Shame on you for making this movie when you could have spent all that money on charities or on making several, cheaper, but much better movies.
