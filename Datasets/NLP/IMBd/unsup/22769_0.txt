Rarely do i watch a foreign action movie that has the quality of this one. I have never actually posted to this sight before but I found this movie to be so excellent that I thought I would. Some might liken this to other assassin vs assassin movies but i disagree. This movie is so much more in depth in the story line you forget that it has subtitles. Others have commented on how well it flows from one language to another. I didn't notice since I was so involved. Great action - not a Michael Bay action fest but enough to keep you interested and then some. Great plot, nothing unique yet was done with such style and pizazz that you thought you were getting something original. Great ending, not going to give any spoilers but I was very pleased.
