The movie is OK up until the last third which is just a redundant and long-winded exposition of the first 2/3 of the movie. Granted, the movie can be hard to follow because of the vast amounts of symbolism and somewhat confusing story line, but it becomes very clear by the half-way point. The ending is boring and frustrating. It was a kinda cool idea for a film, but it was so poorly executed that I can't recommend that anyone go see it.
