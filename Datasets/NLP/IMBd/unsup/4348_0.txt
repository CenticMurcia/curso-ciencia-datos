A pretty decent film, an amusing look at small-town Americans taking on the big city...and losing. This is vintage Jack Lemmon. A must-see for any fan of his. For anyone else, it's still a pretty good dark comedy of its time. Sandy Dennis is also quite good in her role. (I haven't seen the remake w/ Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and so cannot comment on the relative virtues of the two films) Grade: B-
