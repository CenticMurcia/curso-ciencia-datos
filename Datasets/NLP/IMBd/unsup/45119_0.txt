This film is among the worst crap you can see on TV. Yes, I enjoy laughable b-action movies sometime but this is just torture. How in the world can you make up such a story and then collect North-Americas worst actors and make a film out of it???? I rather enjoy watching Dolph Lundgren making an ass of himself instead watch this movie again. DON'T SEE IT, and you will save some money. /NL
