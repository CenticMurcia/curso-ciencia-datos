I used to like Jet Li movies purely for the fighting, depicting a rare style and grace; not unlike the master, himself. Li's characters often portray the martial arts code of honor very well. Of course, his evil doppleganger in The One does not apply here. I'm finding that I'm drawn more to his sense of honor that are the cornerstone of his characters; more than the fighting. The action and fighting scenes haven't lost anything, but I think I'm seeing more of his honor code than I used to. He has true style that reminds me of Bruce Lee. His modest demeanor and silence until it's time to use lethal force... it's very refreshing. You can tell he's in control from the second he walks on to the scene without any lame phrases or quirky little acts that are fine for other actors, but not a master.<br /><br />What worked: It was really cool and mesmerizing to see Brigette Fonda in this film. She does messed up and screwed over really well; and one can actually feel her frustration and hopelessness. A natural prelude to her trust and confidence in Li's character. Of course Li's performance was a picture of style and prowess.<br /><br />SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER What didn't work: Unlike my usual inclinations, I actually wanted the cheesy to happen in this film. I don't want to ruin any ending elements, but for once I wanted the two characters to find love... it definitely leaves that option out in the open. Other than that I liked the film just fine. There were some elements that were a little predictable, but it helped make me feel like I'm smart.<br /><br />8/10 - Overall, very good... not excellent.<br /><br />thank you
