Before I watched this movie, I must say I wasn't really expecting much, regarding all of the negative reviews I had read on IMDb about Contagion. And, unfortunately, I was correct in my presumptions. There is no word that can better describe this movie than RIDICULOUS. This movie is not considered a comedy; however, I don't think I stopped snickering the entire length of it. The majority of the plot was just absurdthough the theme would have made a good movie perhaps under better direction and with better actors, this creation of Contagion was not only disappointing but silly as well. The acting was horrible on behalf of every main character. None of the roles were portrayed in a believable fashion, and the dialogue was rather amusing in its unoriginality. Everything that happened in this movie was just ludicrously predictable. As a last thought, I was really disappointed that the director did not include any more blood and gore than he did; the effects of Ebola on the human body are horrifying  but all I got to see were some red warts and a nosebleed.
