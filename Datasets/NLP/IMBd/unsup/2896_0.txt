The Garage is the only title that describes the film. I watched it like I was watching my son's in there early adult life. Wondering which path to take. Making their life decisions. To go or to stay. Young people have to make their own friends and life. This film told that story of family,friends, and life decisions (without any profanity), really refreshing. Carl Thibault hit the jackpot with this film and I congratulate him. I understand that Carl is planning another film in the near future. I hope he keeps to the standards that he used in making The Garage. I will look forward to seeing this feature film in more festivals, or perhaps on TV and DVD , so that more people will get to enjoy a time to be remembered. Congratulations to Carl Thibault, the new writer to watch for.
