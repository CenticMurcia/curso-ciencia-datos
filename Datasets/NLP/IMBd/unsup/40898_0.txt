If you like your movies sappy, then this one's for you. I can't help but think how much tragedy would have been prevented in this movie via the use of a concept I like to call "scouts". I'm all for the suspension of disbelief (especially when watching a movie on the hallmark channel) but the idea that a guy could be riding his horse around in a war and *not* know it was pregnant strains incredulity to it's limits. I'm not the target audience and I admit that I was forced to watch this but I really didn't like this movie. I found it pretty amazing how much outright death this had for a family movie. The ending especially could be pretty traumatic for little kids.
