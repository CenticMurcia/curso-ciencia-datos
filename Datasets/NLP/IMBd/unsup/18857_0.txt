I love Rob Zombie's music and was looking forward to this movie when I first heard about it. From the recurring themes in his music, I thought it would be a bit like Evil Dead II: surreal, funny, supernatural, and purposefully cheesy. Instead, I got 90 minutes of torture porn. Zombie makes no attempt to build any kind of suspense or generate any kind of terror. Rather, he focuses in excruciating detail on the process of abducting, torturing, and killing four unlucky teenagers. Watching what could be Charlie Manson's home videos is an unnerving, disturbing, disgusting experience; the teens are trapped in a house of killers, hopeless, beaten, despairing, with only the knowledge of their imminent torture and death for company. It's an excruciating experience that left me feeling dirty and thinking about all the people who really have died at the sadistic hands of very real serial killers. All in all it's an example of what not to do in a horror movie.
