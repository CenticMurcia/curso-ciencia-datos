This movie is a touching human interest story and gives the average viewer a better appreciation of the overwhelming challenges faced by those who must deal daily with disabilities, particularly adjustment to quadriplegia. It also brings sharply to mind that this young girl, Jill Kinmont's fate could so easily in a split second be our own, resulting from a sports injury, car accident, or whatever. Jill's story reminds me of another lovely & famous quadriplegic, Joni Eareckson Tada, who suffered a diving accident as a teenager but went on to become an accomplished artist, and has a remarkable faith which is an inspiration to many.<br /><br />This film is based on the real life story of Jill Kinmont, an eighteen year old skiing champion & Olympic hopeful, who suffered a severe fall down a mountain, which not only ended her skiing career but paralyzed her from the shoulders down. Jill's struggles are poignantly chronicled as she learns to cope with life as a quadriplegic and regain a hopeful spirit, assisted by her devoted family. Eventually she even finds a love interest in the form of Dick (called 'Mad Dog') Buek.<br /><br />Marilyn Hassett is convincing and very sympathetic in her portrayal of the vibrant & determined young Jill, and Beau Bridges wonderful as the warm & adventuresome Dick.<br /><br />A strong recommendation for this film. It paints a vivid portrait of the realities faced by those who must depend on others for personal care and simply daily tasks, also their struggle for some measure of independence and the same respect granted able bodied individuals. Hopefully, this movie might tend to impart to those of us not disabled a little more gratitude for abilities we take for granted every day. Also, this story has a very appealing heroine and a touching romance.
