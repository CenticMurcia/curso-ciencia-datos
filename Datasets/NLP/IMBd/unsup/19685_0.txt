I love older movies and especially try to watch the ones I have heard of but never seen. For the most part when I do this I am somewhat disappointed in the movie. This is the exception. This movie was well worth watching. I thought the casting was excellent, the characters developed well and scenery was great. It was like a walk back in time. I especially liked the way that many different characters were developed, and you want to know more about each of them. You wonder how they lived the rest of their lives. This is to me a true test of how good a movie is. Did the boys make it home from the war alive? Did Allison become a famous writer? Did Connie and the principal get married? I wish there was a part two to this movie. I would stand in line to watch it.
