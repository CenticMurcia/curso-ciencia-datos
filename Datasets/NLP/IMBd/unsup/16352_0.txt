This is without question one of the worst films I have ever seen. It fails in so many ways that I feel it is a perfect example of a what a film should be to rate a "1" on the IMDb Vote.<br /><br />1. It fails as an adaptaion of a comic. Captain America is not a great hero who is frozen and thawed in this film. He is a ill prepared looser who gets his butt kicked in his first ever fight. Then we don't even see the red white and blue and shield again until the final fight. Captian America was an "action" comic folks. A film about Captain America should have lots of action! <br /><br />2. This is somewhat related but even if you decide to give the film maker a break on the lack of action the rubbish in the middle is so boring that you will wear out the head on your VCR as you fast forward looking for something that looks promising.<br /><br />3. I don't care what the apologists for this film say the acting is not good in this film. <br /><br />4. The plot is terrible. Come on. Even if Cap could have diverted the rocket launched at the White House by kicking the fin, and even if he could have survived the impact I really have trouble figuring out why a rocket that is supposed to only have to travel to Washington DC has enough fuel to get to Alaska. <br /><br />Over while the beginning and ending of the film show flashes of what this film should have been like the incredibly boring middle of the film and the lame plot make this one of the few films I feel really deserve a "1". For other "1's" see "Superman 4" and "Hudson Hawk"
