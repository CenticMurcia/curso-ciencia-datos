A poor farmer struggles to keep his family fed after leaving the security of working as a farmhand to develop his own farm. Renoir tells his tale in a simple, realistic style that is very effective; it is impressive that despite being a Frenchman he is able to capture the spirit of the American South. As the farmer, Scott gives a very natural and nuanced performance; it is unfortunate that he was not able to parlay this role into a better career. Field is terrific as the devoted wife who tirelessly works the field alongside her husband, while Bondi is amusing as the eccentric granny. Other notables in the cast are Naish as a grumpy neighbor and Kemper as Scott's city buddy.
