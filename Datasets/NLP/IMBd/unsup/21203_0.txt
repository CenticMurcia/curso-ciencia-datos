I saw this online a couple years ago and still can't forget it. If you ever get a chance to see this film, please give it a try. If you forget about the recording quality, you will be blown away. To think that this movie was made when the Linn's were in high school blows me away. It is paced well, and there is actually some decent acting. My only beefs about the movie is that it could have been changed from an Indiana Jones fan film. Maybe 'Tennessee Jed' or something.<br /><br />But like I said before, I recommend this to any aspiring filmmaker. It really is a showcase of what you can do with a little planning and instead of watching TV, going out and shooting a movie with your friends.<br /><br />8/10
