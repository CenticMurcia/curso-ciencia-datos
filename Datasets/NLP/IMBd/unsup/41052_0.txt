Oh well. I had it in a collection and watched. It has that narration that makes it sound so National Geographic. Meanwhile, the subjects of this "film" run around and act out their impulses. It makes you wonder how they ever evolved as far as they did with so little knowledge. There is one scene that reminded me of a PBS thing about cave people. The tribe keeps pushing the women to keep up with them, to where they pretty much end their civilization. Apparently the Neanderthals were so hard on the fairer sex, they became extinct. Let's see. No women. No _______. No civilization. Hmmm. Let me think. In this movie, the women take matters into their own hands and with the help of a big rock, move on, leaving their hairy counterparts to fend for themselves. There is one really great character, a nine foot giant, who likes to pick up women (literally). The men, who sort of like these ladies (thought they themselves are going to become extinct if they don't figure out a couple things), get embroiled in the capture or destruction of this big guy. There are lots of other scenes that are pretty ridiculous. I love those stupid dances that they do. Then there's that sling shot fight. Unlike the Wonga movie, this has a little personality, and though it's ultimately stupid in every way, it has some charm.
