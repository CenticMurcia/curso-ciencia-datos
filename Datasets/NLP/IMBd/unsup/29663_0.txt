The twin billing of the late Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher is rather appealing and the two comic-gifted actors do fairly well. I always think its the mark of a good actor to pull off the consistent lurching that is the hallmark of sentimental romcom. The two of them negotiate the script well.<br /><br />The problem is that, like so many other examples of the genre, the film demands a statutory smattering of extra set pieces: a dreadful go-kart race and a ridiculous men-share-the-bed running gag let this one down. There's also an unsavoury 'black jokes' sequence which I simply didn't need.<br /><br />When I wasn't cowering/out making the tea in embarrassment I enjoyed it as it was intended. 4/10
