This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Basically it's a Children Of The Damned wannabee. The acting is very bad, especially the children. The script is boring and relentlessly dull, punctuated by such zingers as, "you moronic Bible thumper" and "show me a warrant otherwise I'm calling the police" (said to a sheriff). One of the children in the movie could have written better lines. The gore is laughable in here. It's obviously so fake. One victim can be seen breathing after being killed. Another is stabbed, obviously, way to his left, like underneath his arm pit. The well hyped ending is ridiculous; it resembles getting together with neighbors and making a home movie and throwing in a bottle of ketchup. The background music is extremely annoying and one of those all-in-one keyboard machines was obviously used, the kind that make drum sounds, synthesizer effects, etc. The music is very typical over-synthesized 80's trash. The producers should have saved their money and bought a can of ravioli for the kids, instead of making this movie. 0 of 4 stars.
