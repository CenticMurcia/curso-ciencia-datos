A typical German movie with a bunch of untalented actors that sure never studied how to play in a movie, but learned everything on theatre stages. But there is a difference between movie and theatre. I wished German actors finally learned about that. I can hardly believe this is based on a true story, but if they say so it must be true.<br /><br />Rating: 2 / 10
