A very stylish movie that takes a lot of themes and meshes them with some success. First time director Kasten shows that he is someone to watch in the future. The performances are generally good especially Jeffrey Combs & Seth Green.<br /><br />I would like to see this movie again, just for the fact that I saw it as part of an all night film fest, and my brain wasn't functioning properly. I have the feeling that I might have missed some of the subtle points in the movie. But however, it kept my attention for the whole running time.<br /><br />8/10
