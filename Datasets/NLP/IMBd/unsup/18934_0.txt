This is an "extra" of sorts on the DVD for Alla Nazimova's production of Salome. Although this was made in 1933 (or at least released then) it totally made me think of the German Expressionist movement of the 1920s. (The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari sprang to mind) You definitely need to already know the story of Sodom & Gomorrah, but as another reviewer stated, the audience back then would have been well-versed in biblical text. As for bible-thumpers who object to sex and violence, they should start with banning the bible since, as this story shows, it is chock full of both. I was curious to know about any censor issues with this film because their is a lot of eroticism with the young male dancers and some bare buttocks, as well as an extremely voluptuous statue of a female torso(at least I think it was a statue). The most surprising image is when the men approach Lot's door and one man has his arm bent upwards and his hand cupped. When he moves out of frame and stops, the shadow of his arm is just to the right of the door-frame and is very clearly in the shape of an erect penis. I wondered if such a graphic image passed the censors because the story was biblical? Either way it was interesting and got the point across very clearly. This is worth watching a few times. It's a bizarre, but interesting piece of film history.
