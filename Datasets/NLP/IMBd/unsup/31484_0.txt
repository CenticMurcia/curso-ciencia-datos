The movie is based on the time during the mughal dynasty. Jallaludin Mohammed Akbar is one of the most powerful rulers. He was crowned at a very young age. Years later he married a Rajput princess Jodhaa (Aiswarya Rai) who happens to be in a different religion. They try to be good and comfortable with each other that's when more problems arise from the enemies.<br /><br />Jodhaa Akbar has a good storyline but has unnecessary dragging. The movie lasts for about three and half hours in that manner. And it was completely unnecessary. Like Hrithik Roshan takes about five minutes to go from one room to another. And during the wedding scene Aiswarya Rai is sitting there and the camera pans in taking about five minutes. Only in the second half the film becomes more lively.<br /><br />Songs are excellent like jashn e bahara, khwaja mere khwaja.They had that touch of the old days including the lyrics. A.R Rahman did well in both song's music direction as well as the background score. The performance were very good from all the actors. Overall Jodhaa Akbar is a good movie. It is not an entertainer. Fans of Hrithik Roshan and Aiswarya Rai will like this film. 8/10
