The Director is taking through us a 80 minutes journey through the eyes of a 13 year old girl in Afghanistan under the taliban...<br /><br />The landscape full of limestone .....and the people unfortunate enough to have born into the wrong time....<br /><br />barren land and lives.....<br /><br />where every other woman is a widow and every other mother is a living tomb.......<br /><br />Please listen to the soundtrack carefully.... especially the background score.... its really important..... it starts off with an iron swing..... ends with the sound of skipping rope hitting the ground.... Masterful.<br /><br />I bet that after the movie, you will go and kiss your young daughter. You sure will.<br /><br />My salute to the director who mesmerised me the whole 80 minutes....<br /><br />saw this movie in 8th international film festival of kerala in 2003 where It got a grand applause.<br /><br />This was the first movie made in post taliban regime in afghanistan. Truly commendable.<br /><br />My 9 out of 10.
