This is the only movie that I have literally walked out of for sheer boredom. Needless to say, I won't be revealing the end of the story here.<br /><br />Robert Duvall puts in a stunning performance. However, the storyline has none of the Duvall's depth and simply unfolds, or perhaps unravels, in a meandering and uninteresting sequence. <br /><br />
