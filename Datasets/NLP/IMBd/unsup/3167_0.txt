I saw this movie a couple of months ago on SBS on Erotic Tales and fortunately saw all of it. I had been searching for this movie and luckily saw it advertised on the day. When I watched it I realized I had seen part of it before but that was before I was a Vincent D'Onofrio fan. I read what the movie was about and was intrigued as he was playing the naked stranger. This movie was made in 1995 and he looked a lot different then. A must for fanatical female Vincent / Criminal Intent fans. Theresa Russell plays the bride to be - a real pain. D'Onofrio makes the most of this short movie; only 28 minutes. He is very expressive and a touch overacting but the movie is full of dialog.
