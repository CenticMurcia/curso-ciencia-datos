I'm a fan of the first Epoch. But like most sequels, they wind up being bad. Mainly because they don't have enough ideas for a sequel. That's why I get nervous when I rent a sequel, because I don't know if it's going to be as good as Spider Man 2. Or dumb, Spy Kids fluff. The movie was kind of rushed. Unlike the first Epoch, everything inside the Torus was different. Unlike the Torus in Epoch 1, There weren't any huge rooms with those tanks in it, and no really good CGI effects. And My favorite Character from the first installment died. And oddly, this movie is rated R. Epoch 1 is rated PG-13. I'm gonna have to say this movie is a flop.
