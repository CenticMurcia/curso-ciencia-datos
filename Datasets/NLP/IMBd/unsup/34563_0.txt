First off, I'll start out by saying that I am not a Mormon, nor do I believe in the Mormon religion, which is what this film was meant to bash and redicule. I started watching this movie already knowing it was going to be dirty, raunchy, and a bit on the wild side. With that in mind, I was ready to laugh. However, about every 10 - 20 minutes, Joe Young (a play on Joseph Smith and Bringam Young, two guys who started Mormonism) throws out some comment about how all of this is wrong. "How would Jesus benefit from me doing this?" And so on and so forth. It kept making me think, "umm...he has a point." For anyone with or without a sense of religion, the amount of comments made in this regard would start to effect anyone with a sense of morals into having second thoughts about finishing watching the movie. This is why I say it is a self defeating film. In what began as a kick back movie to have some laughs ended up in feeling uncomfortable with the whole movie because of the constant reminders. However, all in all, with that aside, the movie really wasn't all that funny. Maxxx Orbison was too outright profane and mean to be funny and made us wonder if this might be getting too serious. There were some good parts though, such as when they zap people with Orgazmo's working gun, (especially the dog, I got a kick out of that), and a few other scenes. They were just too far between. In conclusion, the constant moral reminders of the film killed many of the laughs because we are reminded that we really shouldn't be laughing at that. The laughs were few and far between and the film was much to profane to be all that funny.
