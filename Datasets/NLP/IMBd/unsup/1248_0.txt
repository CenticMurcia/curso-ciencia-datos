This movie does just the opposite of what it means to do (affect a change in the audience like the one in Hannah), partly because the audience (I, anyway) don't need to learn Hannah's lesson. What it does, instead, is to create a Holocaust in which you don't care much about the victims because you don't get to know them. The only person we really know is Hannah, and from the beginning, she is a brat. She supposedly changes over the course of the movie, but somehow I can't believe it. And the commandant reminds me of Dr. Evil. It's hard to take seriously. What happens is predictable; I just wish it could've happened faster. And the lack of graphic violence is an insult to the victims. Despite its intent, it doesn't begin to convey the horrors of the Holocaust, even compared to other movies.<br /><br />Also, if camp survivors are supposed to remember who they are (they say this over and over in the movie), why does Rivkeh change her name? Isn't this a victory for the Nazis?
