With fear and apprehension of losing 98 minutes of my life, I was somewhat surprised by this film. Yes, I will admit this was a fairly bad film, but that was only in the fact it was NOT FUNNY! Technically, comedies have a certain degree of humor, yet this one seemed to lack in that department. Eddie Murphy was at his worst, and his lack of passion for the film seemed to spread to everyone else. While the CGI and set design was excellent, that seemed to be the only saving grace. I admit, it was not a total waste of time, but if it had been funnier and released last year, it might have made some money. At least it wasn't as bad as films like Cutthroat Island and The Postman in regards to box office intake.
