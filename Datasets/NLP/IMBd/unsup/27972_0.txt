I was disappointed in this film as the film did not live up to its intro. A great premise was marred by bad acting and uneven production values. Make no mistake, the premise for this film is compelling. While the film makes a fairly good case, the idea and need to further study and discuss the subject matter of indigo children (thanks to the intro) the film just doesn't deliver! It certainly seems that the producers are trying to feed off of their first born in this genre, "What the Bleep Do We Know..., Like Bleep it promises existentialist views of rather unexplained events and experiences in our life with a spin that was thought provoking and entertaining. A better film could have done that. Come on guys - don't kill a great start!
