Two teens wake up ready to go on a class field trip. Along the way one of them drinks contaminated water and they both become zit-zombies. They can only eat chocolate and the disease only affects teenagers. The infected teens gather together and hatch the devious plan to travel to Hershey, Pennsylvania to contaminate the country's chocolate supply and dawn the remaining populace a zit-juice dripping existence.<br /><br />This screwball punk rock black and white comedy is some kind of bad. To be blunt I think I'd need to be on dope or something to get a kick out of this one. You got to give the actors credit for walking around the entire production (and I use that term loosely) with burst zit appliances on their heads. The music ain't half bad though.
