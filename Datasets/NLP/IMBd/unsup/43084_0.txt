Hi.. I just finished watching invasion a few days back, i saw the show on DVD, and to tell the truth i was expecting an excellent series after reading all those positive reviews, but i was quit disappointed with it, it wasn't good at all, in fact most episodes were boring. No wonder it has been canceled, because it had no potential of getting any better soon and was really really boring and unoriginal. <br /><br />* some spoilers* First of all, i thought the whole idea of the show was unoriginal and we've seen this idea in many many movies and TV shows ( examples include invasion of the body snatchers and the faculty ) actually it was very very similar to the movie the faculty, same idea with the whole aliens and their preference to water ! The episodes were very slowly progressing, at many times boring, nothing really happens ! one episode, someone falls into the water, he comes back changed, people are uncomfortable with that change. THEN, next episode another person falls in the water, comes back and the cycle continues, nothing new really happens in the first few episodes. The final episodes weren't that good either and very predictable, actually the whole show was predictable, i mean i knew where it was going from the start, ( people changing and being taken over by aliens, more and more join in and eventually aliens want to take over the world,hmmmmm, i didn't see that coming ?! ) <br /><br />I'm not sure why fans like this show and keep asking for it to come back, if it were for me i wouldn't watch a second season of this show, and I'm glad there isn't another season, because it really sucked ! There are several other shows that are far more superior to this boring show, ( examples include : x-files, millennium, miracles, 24, lost and battle star galactic )
