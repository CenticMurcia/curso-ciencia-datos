I'm watching this movie for the first time on Sky One, and am trying really hard to feel surprised at the twist and turns of the (yawn) action!I read all of uncle Jules' books as a boy, and saw all the action movies of the 50s and 60s. I'm sure it's a childhood thing and these stories don't appeal much to me now. One of the previous comments mentions there are women in this movie, and there was none in the original book. This is mainly because our author lived in the days when men wrote about other men as adventurers, and left all the romantic stuff to women authors!So there is room for a little poetic license, or the film would be made exactly like the original! My thoughts drift back to "Of Mice And Men'when George told Lennie his story about the farm they were going to live on and Lennie knew exactly how the story went, but insisted on hearing it anyway! This movie is the kind that attracts the fantasy fan, but I'm watching it all the way through, despite the urge to fall asleep and dream it better for myself! So far I give it 2 out of 10, but this could all change in an hour or so! <br /><br />0 for 4, better than 2001! Keep 'em coming!
