This was a fun horror film. It didn't try to be more than it was supposed to be, but did enjoy itself being all it could be.<br /><br />The werewolf could have done with looking a little more wolf-like in both it's costume and it's mannerisms, and it reminded me of the old wolfman style pre-howling/AWIL.<br /><br />The werewolf had some good lines and worked well with it's attitude overall.<br /><br />The main characters were well acted I thought, and the plot was a nice horror plot that flowed well.<br /><br />Gore, nudity, and naughtiness was all in good supply and didn't feel forced into the story.<br /><br />Don't expect a scary film, or a psychological horror. It is what it is, a fun entertaining film with a few nice ideas and scenes that you don't normally see in films these days.<br /><br />Good potential for a series of films, as the villain and content of the films could work well as such, as long as the production values are maintained.
