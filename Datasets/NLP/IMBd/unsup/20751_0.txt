I've always been a fan of these low-budget, direct-to-video, B-movies. Independent films, such as this one, are usually a nice break from the shallow crap Hollywood churns out each year. However, the production quality is usually on par with a sleazy porno flick. But I was none-the-less shocked when I caught 2001's "Jacked" on Black Starz last night. Watching it, I knew not to take it seriously. <br /><br />A gang-banger kills a policeman by accident. He returns to make nice with the family of the cop, and eventually falls for the daughter. All while being pursued by his murderous, Coke-addicted friends.<br /><br />The truth is that they have a really interesting plot, which unfortunately isn't as polished as the characters. From the on-set, you get the immediate vibe that the entire film was rushed, and this shows in some of the editing and in the Broadway-like camera style -- that takes place mostly in a suburban house of the Barnes' family. But this is excused because it gives a truly realistic mood to an insane story. And, as I chuckled after viewing it, some of the gunshots by Zach(Bizzy Bone) are unintentionally hilarious. To be honest, his character as the villain is by far the one thing which brings parts of the story downhill, yet gives some humor for B-movie appeal. Watching him on camera (where he is high 90% of the time, and then pointlessly shooting thugs for the rest) gives you the distinctive image of Drexl Spivey from True Romance. And the end fate for his character seems choppy at best; could have been way more climactic, or at least had made more sense.<br /><br />Now, for the good points, I was honestly surprised by Alexis Fields in this movie. Coming fresh from her years as a child-actor, she truly has great acting range, and holds the crazy gangster storyline in touch with the tragic love story, which is the focal-point. And her portrayal is the single memorable thing left in my mind the next day. Not many actors can both make a viewer feel sympathy and want for her to never find out the truth of her father's murder. Needless to say, I knew there would be extreme tearing from her in the ending. The mother offers a solid supporting role from "Friday" actress Anna Maria Horsfield, as the hooker/mom. While the brother is just dead weight in what is a neglected role. Also, I liked RonReaco Lee as the lead character, Dre. While you can see he is intimidated with some of the dramatics, he still gives a delicate character moral's, which make you feel emotion for his conflict in the sad ending.<br /><br />But the best element here is third-time director Timothy Wayne Folsome -- who takes a Film Noir film, and weaves in some inventive camera shots and semi-predictable, but effective plot twists. He is someone that could very well create a future masterpiece if given proper filming time, and a reasonable budget. <br /><br />Overall, good movie. But just doesn't live up to what it could have with some plot changes, and a more polished script. Still, worth watching on a bored afternoon.<br /><br />***/*****
