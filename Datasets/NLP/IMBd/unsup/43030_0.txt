I only have a few things to say about the film itself and then a personal conviction about Park as a director. The art direction of the film was absolutely horrible. The staging, color coordination and whatever else went into making this movie was alienating at best. The dialogue was very weak despite everyone's love of quoting Park's previous works. Finally, I feel that there was an unusual amount of campy scene work for this film, even for Park's standards(in particular the angelic halo scene in the prison). Park Chanwook has proved time and time again that he lacks any sense of social responsibility as a director. His only tricks seem to be the incorporation of eery or alienating imagery...If you think very carefully about his work you will realize that it is shallow at best...it plays only on reactions to the reprehensible. His non-revenge films are even weaker in content and style and have received an undue amount of praise and accolade.
