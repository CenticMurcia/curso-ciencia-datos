Plainly pathetic. The backdrop in some of the action scenes are so visibly unreal that it made watching this painful. At one point near the beginning a photo of a test lab Dr and a terrorist is so badly edited it looks like one of the Internet pictures with superimposed faces planted on someone else's body. I also enjoyed watching the taking of the bomb up an unknown number of floors to a roof, starting a helicopter and then flying an estimated 25 miles off shore and all in 4 minutes and 30 seconds. I hope the director had fun making this. I also have to agree with some previous writers that seeing a very over weight Seagal is sad. You never really notice his weight until the very end when he is walking away. Also the champagne lunch with the CIA agent at the end is terribly phony and acted at an uncomfortable feeling. What a terrible waste of time.
