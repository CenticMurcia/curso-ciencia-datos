Let's face it, no one will rent '100 Women' with the high hope that it's going to be an unforgettable and revolutionary look at love and comedy. If you want that- go out and rent something like Love, Actually or Intolerable Cruelty.<br /><br />I saw '100 Women' before I saw its predecessor '100 Girls'. I seem to be in the minority when I say that I preferred this version. Whilst the storylines are similar, we're not forced to tolerate the smarmy overacting of of Jonathon Tucker. Whilst '100 Girls' does have a far better know cast, I find that it was more enjoyable to see a movie where you didn't associate the female cast with movies they'd previously done. Erin Bartlett is a relative unknown, and incredibly beautiful. Some of her scenes with Chad Donella are just plain sweet.<br /><br />The real highlights of the movie are the philosophical discussions on women and masculinity held by Sam (Donella) and his disgusting cousin Holden (Steve Monroe). Viewers of the first movie will have heard it all before, but I found Monroe's grossness far more amusing and far less disturbing than James DeBello's.<br /><br />That, and some of the downright sweet and romantic stuff that goes on, makes 100 Women a different, more intellectual look at an often overdone genre. Jennifer Morrison is wonderfully sweet, Donella delightfully screwed up, and every female characterisation provides a different view on the fairer sex. Maybe not a flattering one, but a view all the same.<br /><br />Worth a look if you feel like being cheered up about love and life- but don't rent or buy it expecting to be forever changed. It's just a fun movie.<br /><br />My Rank: 7 out of 10 stars
