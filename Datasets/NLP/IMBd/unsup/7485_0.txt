I suppose that the IDEA of the film Henry & June is alright; you know, find yourself, discover who you are, etc., etc. ... but does it really have to involve so much prolonged sex scenes? And really, what WAS the point?<br /><br />I kept on waiting for this film to actually, I don't know... begin, I suppose. It just seemed to go in circles. And just when you think that you can't take it anymore, they throw in another half an hour. I kept on thinking to myself, For God's sake, this is almost bordering on porn. All sex, and minimal pointless plot (and what good plot there was, they sure didn't focus on it as much as trying to create arousing scenes) Why don't I just leave? --- I didn't leave, although now I wish I had. I just kept on hoping that it was going to get better. But it didn't. I stayed in the end because I figured that I might as well if I had made it through the rest of it.<br /><br />I thought that the actors were ok though, considering what they had to work with. But in the end presentation will never add up to substance, and substance there was not. Again, I beg of the director, What the hay was the actual point? I give Henry & June a 3 out of 10. See it if you so desire, but I REALLY don't recommend it.
