If you need an example of the evils of corporate and media convergence, this uninspiring film is it. Old Walt Disney had fun making his movies and one suspects he actually wanted to entertain kids. Here we see flinty eyed accountants and oh-so-serious market researchers uncontaminated by artistry using film as a corporate tool,in the process producing a movie that while technically excellent has neither soul nor spirit. It had a balance sheet, not a shooting script; a corporate goal, not a plot. A)Let's use black actors as a cynical device to attract new black markets for the same old stuff whites have bought for years B)Let's create an effective cross promotion for the Haunted House attraction at Disneyworld. The result is a movie that is both sterile and stupid. Walt would not have smiled.
