I have recently been seeking a video or DVD as i still clearly remember seeing this film in 1972 in Sydney Australia. A superb movie provided by a genius of composing each frame. The series of strange characters that weaved in and out of the film. It is shortly being released on DVD in Australia and is a must see provided you are open to strange proceedings
