Strangely enough I don't feel it's a great stretch to call this movie not worth the film it was put on. This film could have been used for an Oscar winner, a thoughtfully done picture, or even a Bruce Willis action movie. But instead it was used to record Master P's desire to employ all the awful rappers of New Orleans while keeping his unexplainable popularity as the poor man's Puff Daddy through the roof. I can't even begin to tell you the problems I had with I Got The Hook Up other than to say I don't count it as an actual movie. Movies have actors, plots, scripts. This awful production had none of these. I've seen some bad movies in my time, but by and large many of them were at least fun to laugh at. This wasn't; in fact this made me genuinely angry. I wasted an hour and a half of my life on this monstrosity that I will never get back. If I ever meet Master P, he'd better watch out.
