This film is so so addictive. It draws you in from the first 5 mins and then keeps you going and yet it is such a simple storyline. A must for all film lovers and a great watch. I recommend it watched at least twice :). Make sure you are sat back and ready for a laid back film as it is slow paced and just a generally nice film to watch. Something to chill with, with the missus or even on your own. A good end to a hectic day or even used as a pick me up film. The film is not complex to watch so is ideal for a bottle of wine (or two ;)) to watch with. However it is not one that I would recommend to own or watch again and again. Just a once in a blue moon film but still when watch a great watch :P.
