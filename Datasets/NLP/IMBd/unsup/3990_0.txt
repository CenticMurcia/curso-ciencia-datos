I just saw this film at the Starz Denver Film Festival. It was an amazing film. Anyone who knows anything about independent films knows that this film is an amazing achievement. Even someone who has never even seen an independent film can appreciate the great story line and the beautiful locations. Besides the four different locations and the great cinematography for a completely unknown cast the acting was great. The lead Kristine Blackport was great. Her first major role, doing all of her own stunts and overall just doing a phenomenal job. I definitely recommend checking this one out! Also if you stick around you can see in the credits that she was responsible for the music which was really great. I think we will probably be seeing her sometime in the future.
