There should be more British horror's like this. Before I continue, anybody who wants to watch this Movie, has not yet seen it, DO NOT pay attention to the bad comments.<br /><br />This film is a low budget horror and once again Britain manages to create something amazing. From the start the best actors are Alec Newman and Joe Absolom, this is what British films are about, good actors, low money made into something decent. This film is entertaining with slight comedy at times with dark scenes. 100% British in this film, there need to be more<br /><br />Anyone who has not seen it and wants to, DO!!!
