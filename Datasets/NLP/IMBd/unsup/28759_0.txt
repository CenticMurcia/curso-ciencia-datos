Whatever happened to Heather Thomas, anyway? She provides almost the sole reason to watch this lunk-headed teen comedy. Well, I take that back. There's also character actresses Sue Ane Langdon and Marya Small (both familiar to '70s tv viewers) and the young Felice Schachter seems very sweet as Scott Baio's soon-to-be girlfriend. But what happened to Heather? She dominates this lame movie even when she's not on screen. You would think producers would have been lining up to sign her. Was she dismissed as a beautiful bimbo? Unfair if she was. Thomas is a much better than that other more famous Heather, Locklear. Check out her performance if you don't believe me. Frankly, I think the wrong Heather from '80s tv became famous. "Zapped!" star Heather Thomas demonstrates a charisma and sexual allure the other Heather can only guess at. Not to mention acting ability. Damn that Aaron Spelling!
