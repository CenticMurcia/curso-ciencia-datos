This move is simply rubbish, I myself have seen the entire anime and at points during the movie I found myself lost as to what was going on. The plot is also jumpy and I think it would take someone about 10 goes at watching it just to get the idea of what was going on.<br /><br />It also cuts HUGE chunks of the plot out, including several key characters and then adds ones that don't even exist to begin with! I mean.. where were Near and Mello? And what about when the business men were Kira? Oh and Light being chained to L for a substantial part of the anime? These are just a few examples I can think of.<br /><br />I loved the anime, I hoped that this film would be as good, however I just found it a huge disappointment and nearly turned it off half the way through. If you want my summary... don't bother wasting 2 hours of your life on this film, go do the dishes.. hoover the floor or even watch paint dry. All of these will be more exciting than this film.
