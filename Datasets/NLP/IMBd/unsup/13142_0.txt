Reminiscent of the film "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World", this feature takes aspects of several of the earlier Sharpe novels and combines them to create a new plot/storyline. Fine acting by both the main and supporting casts (Toby Stephens is perfect as Dodd), with sets and effects that show a more lavish budget than previously-issued Sharpe installments, this movie may puzzle and maybe irritate devoted readers of the Sharpe novels. At the same time, it addresses the earlier (chronologically in the series, if not in order of publishing) exploits of Private/Sergeant/Lieutenant Sharpe during the Indian campaigns.
