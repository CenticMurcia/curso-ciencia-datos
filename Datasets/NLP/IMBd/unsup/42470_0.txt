I did not watch any trailer before going to watch this movie I just decided to watch it when I saw some posters of it in Manila and I did not even read any review or comment about this movie before going to watch it. with the name of Will Ferell I thought this movie is going to be hilarious but I was totally wrong. from the start it was a total disaster to me and not just that it could not make me laugh but rather I felt like being insulted by it. in 90 minutes maybe I smiled couple of times but of course you expect more than a movie made at the highest level of cinema and being shown all over the world.<br /><br />Mr.Ferell should stop wasting money and start considering a new way of making people laugh and not insulting their intelligence. this movie could not even make a 3 year old laugh though with the big monster dolls in it seemed like a kindergarten movie which of course even children of under 3 would be bored with after no time !
