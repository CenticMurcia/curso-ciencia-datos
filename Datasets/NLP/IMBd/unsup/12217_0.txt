Michelle Pfeiffer wasn't nominated for this movie, and that's a crying shame, because this is easily the best work she's done since "Baker Boys". Like Tom Cruise in "Rain Man", she goes through all the changes while the main character (Sean Penn here in another awesome display) has to remain relatively static throughout the proceedings. And like Tom Cruise, the Oscar voters, in their wisdom, decided to overlook an outstanding performance. Which. if history is any lesson, they will make up for in the future by handing her the award for an inferior movie. (see Paul Newman-"The Color Of Money", Al Pacino-"Scent of A Woman", et al.) Anyway..bottom line is they OWE her one now. <br /><br />Sean Penn nails it, as does the rest of the supporting cast in "I Am Sam", particularly Dakota Fanning as Penn's precocious daughter in a performance that's sure to put her on the Jodie Foster track in a big hurry. "Sam" is a 5-hankie tear-jerker, but for all the right reasons. And the use of the Beatles' music as a sound track is on target. A compelling film with a clear message about love and family and a happy ending to boot. What more can you ask for?
