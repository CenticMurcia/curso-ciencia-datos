This confused attempt to replicate the success of Turkish Delight does have some oddball moments that make it slightly entertaining and of mild interest to Rutger Hauer fans. Mainly I'm referring to the bizarro band scene where Rutger hops on stage to fake-play a guitar. Crazy dancing ensues. The whole thing is reminiscent of some of those wild partying moments in Reefer Madness.<br /><br />The ending comes about in a perfunctory manner and leaves you giggling rather than feeling introspective. "Yeah, right," was the first thought that came to mind. I wouldn't put this on a must-watch list for anybody, even big Rutger fans. Instead, pick up the Verhoeven box set which contains Turkish Delight, Katie Tippel and Soldier of Orange. You'll feel much better about yourself in the morning.
