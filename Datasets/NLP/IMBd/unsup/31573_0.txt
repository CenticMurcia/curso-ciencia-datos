Dakota Fanning's performance was super, but DeNiro slept-walked through it. He's on my list of favorite actors, but I have no idea why he took this role. <br /><br />The direction and editing were sloppy, and the writing even worse. I watched it because I like the people in it, and kept hoping it would improve. Sadly, it didn't, despite decent performances by Elizabeth Shue and Famke Janssen (sorry if her name is misspelled.)<br /><br />The surprise ending was just plain lame. I think the idea had some merit, but it just wasn't well written or otherwise believable.<br /><br />I recommend watching just about anything else.
