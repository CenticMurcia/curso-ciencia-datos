Tucker: The Man and His Dream is an expose on this idea of the 'American dream'. To be honest, I'd never even heard of Tucker before seeing this, but it turns out that he's a man that decided to build a new type of car that would revolutionise the car industry. Naturally, he faced much opposition from the bad guys along the way, but in the end good won out and Tucker got his cars made and revolutionised the auto industry forever. Oh say, does that star spangled banner yet wave...sing it with me now! <br /><br />Jeff Bridges is apple pie personified as the title character; a patriotic American that wants to live the American dream. Francis Ford Coppola creates a lovely 40's style that is pleasing to the eye and gives the film a very upbeat attitude. The stylishness of the picture comes at the expense of substance, however, and that makes the film hard to like because there isn't a lot of character for the audience to connect with. The American dream's hold over Tucker and the way that he continually gets pulled down lend it a sort of substance, as it's a comment on how adversity always exists, but it's not very personal and doesn't make the film easy to like. The film is also rather poorly plotted, with it all going well until we get to about the hour mark and then it takes a horrible downturn, almost into the realms of boring; this is a far cry from The Godfather films for Coppola. The film gets a little too chirpy at times as well, which will annoy and not intrigue, especially for the non-patriotic Americans in the audience.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this film isn't terrible by a long way but it isn't particularly good either and despite a lovely style, Coppola can't take the ball and deliver on the substance front as well. A shame, but there you go.
