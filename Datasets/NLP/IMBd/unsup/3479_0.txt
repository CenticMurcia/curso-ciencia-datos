Mad Max meets the Dragons.<br /><br />What a silly waste of film. A decent idea with a horrid film attached. And they could have saved a lot of money using B&W film; the rare color of note is only the flames. Grey, blue and black are poor tools. Maybe it's supposed to remind us of old WWII films?<br /><br />The Disney version will probably be better.<br /><br />A study in why simply adding fire and big booms to a movie is not enough.<br /><br />And why, when in species danger, do humans have to dress up as medieval persons?<br /><br />Christian Bale should have quit at 15 and become a tax collector, duller than the sharp end of an egg.<br /><br />Don't pay for it, wait for it on Mystery Theater 3000.
