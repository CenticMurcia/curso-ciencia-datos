Action, Adventure, Romance, Humor all rolled into one!<br /><br />I think not. Who in the right mind would watch something like this? It is one thing to go into a bad movie knowing you are going to expect one. I would rate this movie worse than Mortal Kombat II.<br /><br />The action moves overdone... this is just not the Matrix nor the Crouching Tiger.<br /><br />Adventure is mediocre at best because it does not make any sense.<br /><br />Whoever wrote this script needs to get their brains rewired because anyone will puke at the sight of any of the romantic interactions.<br /><br />Humor? Yeah leave this one for the last because they are all dry. At least Jackie Chan has a funny personality which make his attempt honorable. Michelle on the other hand is like Jean Claude Vandamme making his jokes. And the entire cast is just a joke.<br /><br />The funniest part is when it premiered in Malaysia, Michelle Yeoh was so adamant about destroying every pirated copy of this movie. I can see why.... This production should pass GO and head to the dumpster.
