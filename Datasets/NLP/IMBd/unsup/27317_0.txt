This watered down version of Jerusalem's Lot is a far cry from the tense atmospheric town we grew to hate in Salem's Lot.<br /><br />They made the mistake of bringing in a non-Salem's Lot child, to endear this attempt to the younger audiences. Larry Cohen, who also wrote It's Alive, It Lives Again, and Maniac Cop 1 & 2, penned this screen play. Cohen's style of writing is mediocre at best, frankly. He's had a couple of surprise hits, but they were surprises because the directors and actors involved made the necessary changes and added a quality to the work which lacked in Cohen's writing. Phone Booth is one such surprise. Unfortunately, he was also the director on this project, which explains the inability of the director to add a different perspective on the written work, and a 3.8/10 rating here at IMDb would seem to support the fact that something did, indeed, go wrong.<br /><br />I has heart, but lacks substance and therefore rates a 3.8/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
