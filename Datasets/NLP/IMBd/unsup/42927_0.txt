The pace was excruciatingly slow. Acting was amateurish. The plot was disjointed and there were feeble attempts to make it feel like an old fashioned western film. My wife and I watched it to conclusion only because we thought there would be a punch line that rewarded us for enduring the film. It's no wonder we have not heard any more of these actors. Kennedy should be embarrassed to be associated with it. Obviously he took part in it as a favor for a friend or because he desperately needs the money. He was given top billing in the credits and appeared on screen for only two scenes. He was at a low point in his acting as well.
