Angela is a young woman who has just been killed by her angry ex,but Angela isn't dead,she's one of the undead.You see,the recently deceased have come back to life and these are not your typical zombies either. They are organized,intelligent and crave the flesh of the living.A crazed cult of undead terrorists and a militia of brutal zombie-hunting humans fight for dominance.I'm a fan of old-school zombie flicks,where walking dead devours the living and that's why I highly disliked "Last Rites of the Dead".Undead can talk,shoot,search for a job or drive a car.Zombies roam the street,hold jobs-even have their own dating services online.Is this a joke?Admittedly the script has some originality and fresh ideas,but I prefer zombie flicks with an constant aura of apocalypse and tons of gory mayhem.The concept of intelligent zombie is beyond retarded.Still the acting is pretty good,some of the gore is excellent,unfortunately "Last Rites of the Dead" plays more like an unfunny joke.4 out of 10.
