Saw Nanny McPhee this evening. Loved it! Emma Thompson did a great job on the screenplay and is great as the nanny. The scenes were colorful and it is refreshing to see a movie that actually teaches children good values! Thumbs up to this movie and I love Colin Firth and bravo to him for being in this. The children are endearing and the oldest boy was wonderful. It was great to see Angela Lansbury also - she was so good years ago in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. This is a great family movie and I hope this is the start of a series. I recommend this movie to young and old! We need more movies with values. In summary, I give this movie a 10 rating.
