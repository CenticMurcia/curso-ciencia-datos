This movie was generally watchable as long as you kept in mind that it was a CHILDREN'S movie. Even so, I found some problems with it, and it certainly did not stack up to the original. First, the special effects were not quite as good as in the original. Second, the majority of the main characters were young, inexperienced, and naive. Only Goeff seemed to have some sort of interesting background, but he never elaborated on it. Lastly, the ending left much to be desired. At the last moment, the bad guy reveals a secret that was never even hinted at during the rest of the movie. The king is never shown to come out of his stupor. It's no surprise that the dragon saves the hero's life (that was telegraphed from the beginning). Nobody gets the girl (in fact, they never show her saying goodbye to the hero). All in all, the movie was a disappointment.
