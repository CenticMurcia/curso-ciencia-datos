Just finished watching this and its a pretty bad film. A poor storyline, a rubbish script, and another low budget film where everything goes well for the good, and the bad get punished or learn a "valuable" lesson (even though really it was the leading female characters fault for closing down the research in the first place). The leading female character is always right and seems to be an expert in every field telling people what do (another low budget trait). This film just regurgitates all the bad things about low budget disaster movies. Its a shame because if this had been directed and scripted in more of a unique way, it could have brought back feelings of the old B movies about bugs etc.
