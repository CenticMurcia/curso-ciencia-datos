Hurray for Hollywood. The same (or at least same type) anti-war, pseudo intellectual morons who attempted to BRAND Vietnam veterans with the Hollywood lies. The same smears, from those who have never served their country, in an attempt to discredit the only heroes we have left, the American Serviceman.<br /><br />Facts exist, studies have been made, papers have been written, and the facts are in re those who served in Vietnam compared to study groups comprised of those who served in the military, but not in Vietnam and groups of "civilians" that found ways to avoid military service. The Vietnam vet is better adjusted, less mental illness, healthier, wealthier, more productive, and less likely to act like a total butt wipe than the latter groups. The information is available to those that care to know the facts rather than to follow the California nutcases. When studies are made re the veterans of the Middle East and/or Afghanistan, the result will probably be the same.<br /><br />The American fighting men and women are not dopers, drunks, sadistic baby killing, dog drowning, prisoner torturing retards. No doubt some few go over the line. However if anyone has a question about that, who has never served anything but their own self-interest. they have not earned the right to either ask the question and do not deserve an answer.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones as the grieving father (not an retired officer by the way.. he played a retired sergeant)is as always EXCELLENT... Susan Sarandon as always is not believable... and Charlize Theron is Terrific, as always.. Those playing the friends of Jones's deceased son are typical smarmy Hollywood types, trying to look like soldiers but would probably be better cast in movies like Broke Back Mountain.. I was impressed with Francis Fisher's parts.. no silicon there.<br /><br />Anyway the movies overall is pretty good, but then some halfwit has to come up with idea of the flying the US flag upside down to show what they think of this country...That ticked me off..<br /><br />You know these are the same people that live in 30,000 square foot houses with a garage full of gas guzzling cars, a few airplanes, and helicopters, tour buses, Olympic size pools, who think nothing of spending $1000 bucks for a meal they do not eat... and then campaign to get the poor smucks who make %50,000 or less a year to conserve, etc.<br /><br />The Hollywood morons... they are so out of touch with reality that it is disgusting.... Maybe McCarthy was right and they are all Un-American, communist illegitimate sons of......... well, you know.
