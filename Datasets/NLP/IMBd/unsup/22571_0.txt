It is a really good film to watch alone, when you are in a sensitive mood, ready to accept and understand the emotions and feelings of the characters. Even those who don't actually like films related to wars, might like this one,robin Williams has done a good job, but others in the cast are at times even better. Half true, comment from Williams,heard on the radio with the Nazis starts giving hope to the distressed common people , caught in a small town held by the Nazis. Jakob, then carries on the lie,and later is forced to carry on the lie, that he has a radio, to keep the hope alive, in the end dies , but doesn;t let go , just so that people already close to death under the Nazis, don't lose whatever hope that is left.<br /><br />You keep getting the feeling , that it could have been better made, with more focus on the emotional drama happening due to the situation. Good cinematography, If you are making a film portraying the emotion of hope , always there will be a difference in the way different people look at it, since things are relative to different people depending on their thought process. It could have been better, thats all can be said. But whatever there is , is a definite thing that all people who like good, sensitive cinema should watch.
