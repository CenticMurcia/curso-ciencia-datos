"Southern trees bear a strange fruit/Blood on the leaves and blood at the root."Strange Fruit.A poem written by a Jewish high school teacher Abel Meeropol.A song made famous by Billie Holiday.Abel wrote it after he saw a photo depicting the lynching of a black man in the south.Something so beautiful came out of such a tragic event.Shivers go down your spine when you hear Billie Holiday perform it.Your eyes get wet.You ask yourself why and yet you get no answer.How could something like that happen such a short time ago? And just because you're black.Joel Katz' documentary from 2002 is very touching, very moving movie about one stain in American history.There are Abel's sons, Michael and Robby, talking about the song, about their father.Pete Seeger sings a piece of the song and plays with his guitar.Again your eyes get wet.Amiri Baraka, Don Byron, Abbey Wilson and Cassandra Wilson are also talking there.This movie makes you mad, it makes you sad.There is a stain you can't clean. "Here is a strange and bitter crop."
