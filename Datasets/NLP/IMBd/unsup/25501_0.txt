NOTE: This version IS now available on DVD. <br /><br />Some Eyre enthusiasts say that this is their favorite version. Sorcha Cusak plays a Jane heavy on the "elfin" aspects of the character, and Michael Jayston gives a really strong portrayal of Rochester. Sorcha Cusak is a fine actress, but is not at all plain, she has an unusual striking beauty, and is nearly as tall as Rochester, which makes her a bad fit for Eyre purists. I suspect it is her personal lightness and charm which make people like this version, but this is precisely what makes her an incorrect Jane. We find that she looks very much like a blonde version of the dark haired beauty Blanche, so much so that they could be sisters, which is, of course, a miscast Jane, no matter how fine her performance. <br /><br />This TV miniseries version looks much more like film than the 1983 version (which has the best Jane ever, Zelah Clarke), and this is a visual plus. Here, Michael Jayston is a much more believable Rochester than the gorgeous James Bond Rochester, Timothy Dalton. This version was very true to the dialogue of the book, but the endless over-narrations by Jane (telling us her motives and thoughts) are extremely unfaithful to the book, and are another thing that make this version very dissonant. <br /><br />These 70s miniseries are very slow, but this one is exceptionally well done, and stands up much better over time than others of the same period. Conversely, we have the awful 70s hair, very fluffy and with the big bump in the back that was so much in Vogue, and even the mysterious woman in the attic has on heavy eye makeup when we see her. <br /><br />So many little things are so right (the best Grace Poole is in this version) , but then disappointing in so many little ways, too. This version is several parts shorter than the 80s version, and it suffers from it. <br /><br />Overall, this IS a very well done version, but if you have the patience for older TV miniseries, treat yourself to the 80s version, which is the most faithful to the book, especially by giving proper weight to the second half, which is where Bronte gets to sink her teeth into ethical and spiritual issues.
