I've seen this piece several times and I can assure you that Ray Tintori is nothing short of a genius. Clearly he's an amazing story teller and an inspiration to amateur and low-budget filmmakers everywhere. This remarkably simple yet masterful piece and his previous short "Jettison Your Loved Ones" are reminiscent of Wes Anderson films but sport a style of their own. In addition to seeing his recently made music videos, I would love to see a Tintori directed feature film.<br /><br />If you haven't seen them yet, I'd recommend Googling for both of these shorts. I think you'll find them well worth your time. I don't have enough blah, blah to say to keep IMDb's word quota happy so this is some sad filler text. Just watch the short.. dammit.
