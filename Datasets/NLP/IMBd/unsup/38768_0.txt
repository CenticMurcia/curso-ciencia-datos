Babylon AD is a mess of a film. I liked other Vin Diesel films like Chronicles of Riddick (silly but fun). Unfortunately this film just doesn't work with the story just all over the place. The film starts off pretty normally but as it goes on the plot begins to crack and by the end is falls apart. What makes this worse is that nothing is explained and I just wonder why half the stuff that happened did happen.<br /><br />The acting is OK but no-one stands out, Vin Diesel just sounds bored throughout the film. The action scenes are run of the mill, nothing stands out and a lot are just silly and boring.<br /><br />I think somewhere in the film there might have been an interesting story, unfortunately somewhere along the way the makers of the film have forgotten that. Overall a woeful effort.
