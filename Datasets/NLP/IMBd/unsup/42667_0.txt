I have been watching Jackie chan's film since I was small. Well I must admit that his shows are rather interesting, coupled with great and well choreographed fighting scenes. But this latest offering from Jackie is rather dull, with little action scene and hardly any humour in it. The only part which is interesting and funny is the part when he's naked and running around, fighting the bad guys. This film is way below the average Jackie Chan's film and being the most expensive film made in Hong Kong, it certainly fails to live up to its expectation.<br /><br />Not recommended by me but I'm sure there are diehard fans out there who will still watch this show.<br /><br />4 out of 10.
