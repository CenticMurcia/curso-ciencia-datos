I have had this film on tape for many years, but had never got around to watching it until last week. I am very interested in horror films, and in particular some of the fairly obscure 70's productions. After having watched this film, i can't understand where the 'horror' part of the title actually occurred in the movie - maybe some other imdb users can enlighten me. Why wasn't it simply called 'Dunwich'?. This was an incredible waste of what was actually a good cast - i mean a film based on an H.P.Lovecraft work must surely have maybe a little tension, suspense, or terror?. To make matters worse, the story was not even presented in a very coherent manner - maybe that's a bit harsh as i did fall asleep once or twice - ok maybe that's when the 'horror bit' happened before anyone tells me!!.
