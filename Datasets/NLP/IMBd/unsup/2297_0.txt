This classic X-movie purports to recount the escape of three convicts from the NW territorial prision in 1891. The film starts off Nate (Richard O'Neal) and Sarah (Barbara Bourbon) discussing their 18-year old daughters upcoming marriage and the rancher's need to ride off on errant for a number of days. With 30 minutes before he has to leave, he and Sarah tumble back into bed for a lovely lovemaking scene. Barbara Bourbon is breathtaking in this rare X appearance.<br /><br />Soon after Nate rides off, the 3 convicts crest the hill to find Sarah's three daughters bathing nude in the creek. These lovely girls are reason enough for them to stop their flight from the pursuing posse long enough to scout the ranch.<br /><br />The meanest of the three hombres is sacking the ranchhouse when Sarah enters and is immediately taken. Finding out that the 'menfolk' are gone, Ned the convict rips off Sarah's clothes and rapes her on kitchen table. Seven years without sex makes this a rough scene.<br /><br />When they are done, Ned drags Sarah to the barn, collecting the three still naked girls and the two other convicts on the way. Giving herself to the second and third convicts to protect her girls, Sarah is raped and sodomized in the barn.<br /><br />However, her noble act goes unrecognized. After they are done with her, she is taken outside and hung (by her arms) from the barn's lifting beam for our visual pleasure and some more abuse.<br /><br />The convicts ride off with the three daughters, just ahead of the posse who save the strung-up Sarah. She insists on riding out with them in pursuit.<br /><br />The film winds down with naked bathing scene with the convicts and girls, and a vicious rape of the Maria, the youngest daughter by Ned. As the thugs sleep in a cave hideaway, the girls plan in whispers to save themselves by wearing them out, and you might they employ their newly taught sex skills to this means. When the time is ripe they club and shoot the bad guys just as the posse arrives, and Sarah gets to dispatch Ned. These convicts wouldn't be returning to the territorial prison.
