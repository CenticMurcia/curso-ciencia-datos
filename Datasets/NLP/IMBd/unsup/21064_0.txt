I just finished watching The Visual Bible's "Matthew", and it will be a while until I feel "normal" again. For almost 4 hours I was back in time, among his followers, totally transported by this movie, as close to the real thing as I could never imagine was possible. I can't describe properly how very real it felt. <br /><br />This movie, although very rich and lush visually, contains none of the marks of a Hollywood "production". For the first time, we get to hear all of Jesus' words and parables in everyday English, as Matthew wrote them in detail, which are delivered by Bruce Marchiano in the most lively, realistic way imaginable. His "Jesus" is as close to the real one as we can get-full of life, loving, affectionate, smiling, dynamic, persuasive, so human and so full of love, so approachable and realistic. His skin and that of the disciples is tanned from their days of walking and teaching in the sun, and if there is any make up, I can't even tell.<br /><br />I have collected all the movies made about Jesus, including Pasolini's-none vibrates throughout as strongly with Jesus's realistic presence and words as this movie. I have really no words to describe it adequately. <br /><br />I just feel like I'd like to thank all the people involved in this work, for they have created something wonderful for the world. Matthew's portrayal in his old age is absolutely masterful and enchanting. In a hugely artistic, entertaining way, Bruce Marchiano's unbelievable performance as Jesus makes every thought and word of Jesus in that Gospel readily understood-thank you for this incredible work! I saw at Marchiano's website that he is making "The Gospel According to John" -again word for word-entirely by his own ministry when they manage to get 250000 people to donate $100 each-how I wait for it!
