There was very little in this film that interested me. "Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance," by the same director in the first of the vengeance trilogy, contained meaningful violence with character and story development. "Oldboy" was even better, creating a world of vengeance where the viewer was constantly in doubt of everyone's motives. This film was unsatisfying. Anyone can tell that the movies by Chan Wook-Park have progressively gotten less and less violent. It seems that this same director tries to shock the audience in other ways, and his new formulas produce badly put-together scenes with unmotivated characters.<br /><br />Both "Oldboy" and "Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance" were journeys. They gave you an unlikely scenario and the extreme reactions that people were forced into. "Sympathy For Lady Vengeance" is an annoying, poorly edited film. Some directors like to edit films so as to switch between difference scenes in a meaningful and relevant tone. That is completely absent in this. Instead of being a journey, "Sympathy For Lady Vengeance" carries more of a documentary tone: nobody is changing or evolving. The viewer is just hearing more and different details about the same thing in a randomized, irrelevant order. It's boring. Scenes lead up to what would be presumed a possible conclusion, and instead of revisiting what happened, we just get barraged with fifteen minutes of someone walking through the forest or watching a snowflake. Would you call that good-film writing or a movie that disarms its audiences, lacks true inspiration, and fails to make the story real?<br /><br />Two out of ten. I'm disappointed in you, Chan-wook park.
