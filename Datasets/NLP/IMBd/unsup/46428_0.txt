The Flintstones cartoon series is in essence a dumbing-down of the Honeymooners TV series of the 1950s. Change suburbia to caves, add dinosaurs and sabertooth cats, and cut the IQs of every character from the 90's to the 80's and you have the Flintstones. Fred and Barney can dream big, but they are too dumb to realize the folly of their dreams.<br /><br />So here's the big story -- Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble compete to become executives. They are the only ones to not know that they are being set up. Duh-uh!<br /><br />Costumes and scenery are tacky. The plot is weak (white-collar crime isn't good for a plot). Characters are stereotypes. Technically this live-action film qualifies as science fiction due to anachronisms, but it's the fiction of pseudo-science.<br /><br />The dinosaurs-and-humans stuff is utter nonsense. Large mammals (anything larger than Yorkshire Terriers) could never have survived around T. Rex. If your children like dinosaurs, then stick to Barney (the dinosaur, not Barney Rubble) or the animated Land Before Time series. When they get older, then introduce them to the documentary (animated, but as realistic as it can be) Walking With Dinosaurs. Don't let your children get any idea that Man and dinosaurs ever coexisted!
