Well, as promised in first part, Russian folk hero Danila goes to USA to revenge a friend and give "kirdyk"(apocalypse) to America. Everyone who stands in his way is done for. He meets and gets to know Russian Pamela Anderson look-alike and foxy black girl. In the firefight, no cops, neither negro gun-runners and pimps, not even Russian, Ukrainian and Italian mafia can stop him. He get to the BIG BOSS and demands his million dollars, and then goes home victorious. As we can see from the plot, it is kind of a fairy-tale that is transformed into the RP(Russian-Power) action flick. Although the plot is unrealistic at best, everything else is top-notch - the movie has best Russian actors (Sergej Bodrov Jr. R.I.P.,Sergej Makovetsky, Viktor Sukhorukov), director (Alexej Balabanov), and excellent soundtrack. And of course lots Russian humor. Also some episodes are just unforgettable - like "weapon-bying" or "child poem". And of course an epic showdown in Mtro club. 10/10.
