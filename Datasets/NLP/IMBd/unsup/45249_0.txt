Pretty average show really. Just a whole lot of dropkicks and 1 chick who is more likely than not a bimbo. As a dating show its crap, but as a comedy it's not too bad. But yea its just another average American show. it's got nothing on British shows I'm afraid. It shows up that a lot of American chicks are shallow, as they still go for the dropkicks, even though most of them have slept with heaps of women. I've been told that some of the stuff is made up. The one where the guy did a road trip through states and had sex under each welcome sign, surely cant be true. The army episode was definitely the best, it was very good acting even if the dad wasn't really been himself. Overall 1 episode of this is enough for most people I think.
