"Whilst searching for ancient treasure on a lighthouse-island off the British coastline, an archaeological expedition becomes isolated from the mainland and is stalked by a monstrous assassin." Most people blow up or fall over out-of-sync with the gunshots/knife-wielding.<br /><br />This works as a comedy, but only if you're drunk enough. Otherwise it's one to avoid. <br /><br />The highlights are a Kevin Keegan lookalike, some attractive women for the gratuitous sex scenes, and a couple of deformed retards who are presented in the way all good film retards should be - as comic relief.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is in no way a film to spend money on, except perhaps via your electricity bill when it's shown, inevitably late at night as filler in between phone-in quiz shows and news programs.
