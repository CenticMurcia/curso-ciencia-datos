When evaluating a show like this, you really have to put things into perspective.<br /><br />Robocop: The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is one of the best shows to come out of this country and into network sindication. (Other great shows include: Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, T and T, starring Mr. T, and My Secret Identiy, with a 13 year old Jerry O'Connel)<br /><br />All the actors in the show are local Toronto/Canadian actors, (now they do national tv shows and national lottery/car dealership commericals) so this was probably the only chance they got to be seen on television sets around the world. No, the show didn't live up to the standards set forth by the movies: lots of gore, the ED209 Combat Unit, sarcastic remarks (BANG!!..."Thank you for your cooperation...!") and a corrupt multi-million dollar corporation (OCP in this series is actually made to look a little more "friendly")<br /><br />But it really did try to stick close to the storyline, using scenes and references from the movies (ie all Robocop's functions and directives, the COBRA assault rifle) as well as keeping the wardrobe clsoe to that of the films. It had its own touch of originality (bringing in new ideas in terms of Alex Murphy's past...ie elaborating on the life of Nancy Murphy, his wife, Jimmy Murphy, his son, as well as Robocop's Parents). It contained "Mediabreak" featurettes, as well as the satirical humour of the commercials you would see in the movies (funny futuristic-product commercials, talk shows, etc). Yes some episodes were goofy, but most provided 52 minutes of great entertainment.<br /><br />Out of all the other Robocop TV duplicates that appeared over the years, this is by far the greater of them all. Definately a show not to miss.
