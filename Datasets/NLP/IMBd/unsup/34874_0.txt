A movie with excellent animation about a robot who doesn't have modern parts and must use hand-me-downs. He makes friends, gets his love interest, and defeats the villain. Sounds like it might be fun, right? WRONG The script feels like it was written by four year olds. Every single clich√© is here, and some parts of the script just seem lazy. For example, the major city in the movie where our hero wants to go is called Robot City. Robot City. Why couldn't the writers have thought of something a little bit less dumb? All of the jokes are lame, especially the robot that begins dancing to a Britney Spears song.<br /><br />The story is not at all compelling, and you will probably find yourself bored and/or furious. I was both when I actually paid money to see this trash. The characters are complete idiots, and do not have any depth whatsoever. Do not see this movie. It is a waste of good animation on a 15 cent script. The producers knew it would make money because they had good voices, like Halle Berry and Ewan McGregor. <br /><br />Please save yourselves. Avoid this movie. Go stare at a wall or hit yourself in the face. Both will be more productive then watching this.
