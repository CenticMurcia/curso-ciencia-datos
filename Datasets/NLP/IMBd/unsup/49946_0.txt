This is one of the most vapid, poorly acted movies I have seen in years. I had to force myself to sit through the entire thing, and was quite proud when I made it to the end. . . though saddened by the fact that I had lost that chunk of my life to this travesty. My daughter who is 6 (and God knows the movie tastes of 6 year old girls runs pretty parallel to this dribble)could not even stay awake through it, and it is probably the first movie ever she had no desire to watch again. Yes, that's right, a 6 year old girl refused to sit through this movie a second time. In her words "it was stupid". I think that pretty much sums up this colossal waste of time, and film. It was stupid.
