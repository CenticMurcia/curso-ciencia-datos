Wesley Snipes stars as Dean Gage, an ex soldier who has emotional baggage, however when he is injected with a truth serum, Gage finds himself vulnerable and the bad guys on his trail, but who can he trust? I caught Unstoppable on USA a couple of months ago and it is easily one of the worst movies i've seen from Wesley Snipes. I know this don't go to theaters but the quality and the overall final result is substandard even for a straight to video action flick. The action sequences are filmed with little interest and the movie just lacks an originality or life to make this for anyone but Wesley Snipes enthusiasts.<br /><br />1/2* out of 4-(Awful)
