DreamKeeper is one of the movies that will accompany you forever. It contains today and yesterday and helps the understanding of the true history of the American Indian. The situation of many Indians today living in reservations and being in a cycle of vandalism, alcohol and drug problems does not go unmentioned. But there is hope for many because the roots of them and the old stories are still there. So you melt into wonderful pictures and stories given from the grandfather to his grandson being on their way to a meeting of all nations. The intertwining of the genres(road movie, drama, tales) is very well made and John Fusco did another great job with the creation of the script. The actors have been well chosen and you feel that they are not just acting in a movie they are truly concerned and giving you their story. Behind all is a message not only for the Indians to again respect more their ancestry and live it but to the 'white people' as well. The commitment of all the people who made this movie possible is very much appreciated.
