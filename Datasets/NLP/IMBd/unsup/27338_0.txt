Essentially an episode of 'The Fugitive' with cobwebs on, 'Nowhere to Run' sees escaped con Jean-Claude Van Damme getting comfy with widowed Rosanna Arquette's family and defending them from ruthless property developer Joss Ackland, who wants to tear down their farm and put up a huge development. While it's a competent movie, and doesn't suffer as much as you might think from Van Damme's complete lack of acting ability, it's weighed down by its hopelessly threadbare plot and a split personality screenplay that can't decide if it's a drama or a beat-em-up. The longer it goes on, the worse it gets, and Arquette's role is amazingly thankless.
