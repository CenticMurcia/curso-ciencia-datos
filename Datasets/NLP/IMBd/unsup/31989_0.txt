This movie has some depth so if your just into blood,guts, and mindless action and gore(which I love too) it may not be for you. This is a drama/Horror with a little more depth then your average horror..I have seen this movie a few times on cable and saw the screener before it came out. It took me 3 times to fully grasp everything that was going on with Danika. For those who think its only people involved in the production making good reviews, I feel sorry that you couldn't grasp this film. I have absolutely nothing to do with this film and I give it 8 stars.<br /><br />Marissa Tomei is still very Hot and a great actress who gave a stellar performance. Watching her come unglued emotionally on screen is very believable. She carries most of the film, but the rest of the performances are excellent too. An all around great film, good acting, cast, plot, etc for those who don't like spoon fed plots.
