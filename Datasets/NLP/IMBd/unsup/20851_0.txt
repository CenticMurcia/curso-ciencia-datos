Little Britain is a badly made cheap sketch show which includes jokes that contain cheap fake British accents. The characters Lou & Andy are just a stupid idea, oh ha ha ha look there's Andy walking out of his wheel chair(the same jokes all the time). The Gay Welshman David, what's so funny about him? A person who is the only Gay in his village? People who live in bad area's of the UK will just keep watching this piece of crap. Just stick to your classic comedy like Hancock's Half Hour, Blackadder, Spitting Image, Mr Bean... Look ahead to 10 years from now, this will just be forgotten comedy!<br /><br />I Give "Little Britain" A Mark Of 1 Out Of 5!
