So Close opened yesterday, 5 September and I was lucky enough to get a ticket. However, the long queue at the ticket counter was worth it. This is one of the best action movies I've seen in recent years. I was dissapointed with Corey Yuen past few movies but he is in his element here. The fight scene was brilliantly staged and despite the fact that this was the first full scale action movie for the 3 lead actress, the girls were impressive. Jet Li got nothing on them.<br /><br />The 3 actress has a good chemistry and it good to see the tables turn on men with the Korean actor playing the obligatory love interest. He pretty much have nothing to do except look good and be a source of conflict among the sisters. There was another hinted at romance played out between Karen and Zhao, it's too bad they didn't have much chance to develop this unconventional relationship.<br /><br />Watch out for the handcuffed fight scene between Shu and Karen and final confrontation between the Japanese guy, Karen and Zhao with samurai swords and bamboo poles. The time the girls spend training martial arts for this movie has made for a furious and beautifuly executed scene that just takes your breath away.<br /><br />
