This movie is a waste of material and precious time... avoid it if possible. All parts are trivial, no real horrors... The plot is plain as it can get, you know how it will end before it begins. The beginning is the opening to your trials: guts cut out, woman pinned to the wall with a knife. Donr by who? A guy in a hoodie. Dear mother of God you could score with it in 1984 but not in 2007!! Then all psycho wrecks are killed by facing their own fears... Again, who's the psychiatrist? The Saw guy... Who's the second doctor? Gabrielle from Xena... like what?! The almost-closing scene with those gardening tools is really gross and loosy.
