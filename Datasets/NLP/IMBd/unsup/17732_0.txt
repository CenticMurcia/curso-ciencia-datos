I've always loved Farrah Fawcett, ever since I've seen "The Burning Bed", a couple of months ago I heard that she was going to do a movie for T.V., so I came on the internet and went here to IMDB, when the movie came on I thought it was not the best, but what commercial t.v. movie is?, the only thing I liked about it was Farrah Fawcett, she was really good in it, she looked different, but I still loved her in this movie, I gave it a 7 because I thought 8-10 was too much, if this was a motion picture it probably would be a 2 star movie, but anyway I liked it, I even taped the movie for myself.
