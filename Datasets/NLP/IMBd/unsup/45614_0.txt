This film is the first and the worst one of Kitano's films. The violence in the scenes are not justified, and the story is very poor. It is certainly because, Kitano did not write the scenario.<br /><br />According to me, seeing this film is total waste of time, but if you are a fan of Kitano, you should see this film because Kitano is a good actor.
