This movie is slow and dull. The fact that you know how it ends makes it even worse: it seems like they're trying to build up the tension and let you think that maybe Nick'll see the error of his ways. But then you remember what really happened. The soundtrack made the movie even worse, if that's possible. Nothing exciting ever happens. I can't see any reason why anyone would ever want to watch this movie.
