I remember seeing this episode as a child of maybe 3. It was one of the few episodes I remember seeing as a child in that series. All the other Hitchcock shows I've seen have been in re-runs as an adult. I never saw the "jar" episode again as an adult. I remember being a bit disturbed by this episode as a child but not bone-chillingly scared like some shows that were on during the 60's. As long as my Mom or Dad was in the room, I thought I had to see some of those programs. However, I sometimes wouldn't sleep too well after watching something creepy. I'd love to see this particular episode again as I'm sure it would be interesting at 46 to view what I thought was a strange & sort of scary episode at 3.
