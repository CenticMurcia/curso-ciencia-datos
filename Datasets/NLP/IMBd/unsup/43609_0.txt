Invasion from Inner Earth - I know it's slow moving but it does have a certain charm I attribute it to ITO's eerie synthesizer score. early seventies style, bad acting, desolate location make it worth checking out on a snowy winters night.College students on some sort of field trip are trapped in their guides cabin try and figure out why they can'receive any outside communication,after much speculation they figure it must be an alien invasion.after two attempts to get help (one gets blown up in a plane the other just disappears on his snowmobile ) the rest brave the elements and try and make it to safety.In a confusing ending the remaining two make it to a town see a flying saucer and turn back into children . Beware of the red light!
