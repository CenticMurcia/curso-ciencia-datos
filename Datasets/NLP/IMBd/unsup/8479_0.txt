Before Christopher Nolan came along and redefined Batman for a new generation, it was Batman: The Animated Series which was the definitive adaptation of the Batman mythos. With its timeless anachronistic 40's feel, its well-scripted plots (many of them inspired from the Batman comics of the 70's and 80's) and its well-maintained balance between the heroic optimism and darkness of this protagonist, Batman TAS was essentially a pioneer in the field of more mature action oriented cartoons. And Mask of the Phantasm captures the best of what made this series tick.<br /><br />The main storyline is pretty interesting, though nothing particularly remarkable. Batman is framed for the murders of a series of mob-bosses, which were actually carried out by the titular Phantasm (not named as such in the film itself). However, the real charm of this film is in the flashback scenes which delve into Bruce's past and how he eventually ended up donning the cape and cowl. This film was the only on-screen adaptation of the mythos (until Batman Begins) to depict Bruce's transformation into the Batman, which is one of the most powerful scenes in the TAS ever. His doomed relationship with Andrea Beaumont and the role it plays in his metamorphosis into the costumed vigilante further adds depth to the character, in ways we have never seen before, as we realise exactly what Bruce had to sacrifice to live the life he has chosen. And as the story moves forward, the past and present of the Dark Knight begin to merge... Watch out especially for the subtle hints towards the Joker's background and a nice brief flashback scene which foreshadows their legendary enmity!
