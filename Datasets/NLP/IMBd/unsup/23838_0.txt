This is a fascinating, extremely well done, documentary style Indie film about the life of a down and out guy who defies narrow definitions. <br /><br />The story description focuses on the most outr√© elements of this man's life: Brazillian pimp, street fighter, drag queen, thief, criminal. <br /><br />The outstanding achievement of this film, though, is to put his life into context, that he is also protector, father, dreamer, artist; and to neither airbrush, glamorize nor excuse his life. <br /><br />This film goes further to put his life into context in the racial mix of Brazil of the 1930s, when slaves were freed but not allowed to hold jobs, the Brazil of Carnival where even the most macho men appear in drag. Deftly touching on all, but not belaboring any one of these elements of bigotry and systemic injustices, we are given a real portrait of an unusual family who are revealed in their entirety, not entirely good, not entirely bad, really human. <br /><br />The performances of the main four characters are simply outstanding and raw, so much so that you begin to wonder if this really IS a documentary. The small supporting roles are all equally strong. A riveting film in all respects; here the art direction and filming styles really augment the gritty reality and emotional perspective of an edgy life in a difficult time and place.<br /><br />This is a morally complex film, not for children at all, not for those who do not like indie films. If you see it on DVD, DEFINITELY listen to the commentary, the Director DOES achieve what he hopes to convey. This is not a film you "love" - it is one that deserves deep respect.
