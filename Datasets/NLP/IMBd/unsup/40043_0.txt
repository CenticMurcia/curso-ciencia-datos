I've became addicted to Guy Maddin films lately. I'd heard many negative things about "Twilight of the Ice Nymphs", how it had nearly destroyed his career as a filmmaker, but I decided to give it a go anyways, if only because it was available on a DVD with both "The Heart of the World" and "Archangel". I'd love to say this film is underrated, but to be honest I can see why it attracted all the bad hype. Its uncompromising to be sure and often looks terrific, but is overall really boring. Mainly, Maddin's typically droll sense of humor seems to be present, but it doesn't work at all. Where the offbeat lines in "Careful" and "The Saddest Music in the World" were hilarious in how left-field they were, the dialog here is merely off putting. Also, the film's plot is completely impossible to keep track of. Maddin's other films, as bizarre as they are, usually have some kind of linear story. I had no idea what was going on in this one.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, the acting here is pretty dire. Nigel Whitmey (uncredited due to disputes with Maddin) is really wooden in the lead role and doesn't know how to approach the tongue-in-cheek material at all. R.H. Thomson is far too bombastic and over-the-top in his part as well, while Pascale Bussieres and Alice Krige are completely forgettable. The only saving spot of the film is the feud between Shelly Duvall and Frank Gorshin. Their sequences are generally really entertaining and prevented this film from being a complete loss. Even so, its easily the weakest Maddin film I've seen yet. (4/10)
