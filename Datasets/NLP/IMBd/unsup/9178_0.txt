I am giving this series a 10, not because of the plot(who's noticing?) but for the incredible allure and erotic presence of Krista Allen. The exquisite beauty possessed by this lady is so transcending it simply vanquishes anything else in a scene. Her sex scenes are so powerfully sensual they bring you right out of your chair. I know there has to be something, in any level of adult fare, for every sexual taste, but I would have preferred less lesbianism and more hetero-action. Among other things, I applaud Ms.Allen for the gutsy decision to accept this role, in view of the fact her acting talent and beauty should get her about anything she wants in film. This series was Cinemax's most commanding attraction, the adult quality of which can only be matched by a Krista sequel.
