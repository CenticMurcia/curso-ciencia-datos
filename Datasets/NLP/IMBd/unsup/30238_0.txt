Spoilers! Don't read unless you've played the game!<br /><br />This game is a bit old - it first appeared in 1990. But that doesn't stop it from being great! <br /><br />This game was made by LucasArts (at the time they were known as LucasFilm.) This company is well-known for making great adventure games that are funny and easy to play. The Secret of Monkey Island is definitely no exception. It's made in three or four different parts, something I wasn't accustomed to until I played this series. It's virtually impossible to die and the games give a fresh new look on the whole adventure platform. The game is packed with great jokes and challenging puzzles. It's not the type of adventure game where you have to swordfight monsters every 2 seconds (although you do go through "swordfighting training" to learn some really funny insults) or listen while someone blabs on about how they're avenging the death of their great-grandfather's second cousin's sister's nephew's half-uncle once-removed, wasting your time with stories that don't have anything to do with the game. <br /><br />In the Secret of Monkey Island, you are Guybrush Threepwood, an aspiring young man who wishes to become a pirate. You talk to some pirates in a bar and find out that there's three challenges you have to go through to actually become a pirate like them. Seems simple enough, but be warned...this isn't your average adventure game! You might find yourself with the strangest tools to do the job.<br /><br />One feature I really liked was the challenges the game presents. You really have to think outside the box to solve these puzzles, and it makes the game really funny. I mean, in what other adventure game can you actually utilize a rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle? The stuff you pick up is totally weird and generally isn't used for what you'd expect.<br /><br />The game was also full of great characters with all kinds of different personalities. These weren't over-stereotyped, blase cookie-cutter characters that all acted and looked alike. There's everyone from Carla, the island's cynical sword master, to Stan, the high-pressure ship salesman that will do anything for a sale. Even the Men of Low Moral Fiber (pirates) are unique. It makes for a great gaming experience.<br /><br />In short, this is a great classic that should be played by everyone - especially someone looking for a fresh new perspective into the world of adventure games. I wish there was more games like the Monkey Island series. Hopefully they'll come out with a fifth one sometime in the near future. As it is, I'll be enjoying these Monkey Island games for a long time to come!
