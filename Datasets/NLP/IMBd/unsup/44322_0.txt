I sometimes like to watch a "classic" that I have never seen before.<br /><br />I was fully expecting to see a great film, based on the Oscars and the actors. What I received was a reminder that Oscars are given primarily for bold moves in the film industry (now no longer bold) and acting has come a long way since the 50s.<br /><br />I don't normally "bash" on the classics, but I certainly did not get half of what I was expecting. Here are some painful points:<br /><br />- All of the actors and actresses seemed very rigid, like they were trying to hit some sort of queue mark -- save Sidney at moments and the gentleman that saved them from the mob. - Sidney's singing was very annoying (I knew that he was trying to show his defiance, but it was so annoying and without feeling it diminished the point).<br /><br />- Everyone was quick to light up a cancer-stick. We're drowned, beat up, dogs on our tail - but hey, lets act cool right now and make it a point to have a puff or two before we say some really deep lines to each other.<br /><br />- Guy with dogs seriously overacted - I've never seen anyone try to pet a dog so fast and hard. He was harder on the dogs than the hunt was.<br /><br />- Sheriff was totally unbelievable. Would pause at odd times and I had to wonder if I had ever met anyone so lethargic before.<br /><br />- Cara Wiliams had the best part of all - play a mother that throws her kid away while throwing herself at some con that walks into your house. - duh.<br /><br />Here are some good points:<br /><br />- Seeing a much younger Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier was kinda neat.<br /><br />- The racial animosity/tolerance thing. I can imagine that, for its time, this was a very bold move. While both overdone and underdone at times, it still serves us a reminder that people are people and we should try and forget the stereotypes we create. -- (it was this that got me to the end of the movie).<br /><br />- You will better appreciate films being created today even the two stars :)
