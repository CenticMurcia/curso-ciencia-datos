Cutting Class is a late eighties slasher flick that delivers on the most pathetic of levels. It actually has a good cast featuring Jill Schoelen, Brad Pitt, Roddy McDowell and Donovan Leitch. But even with these actors the movie is a complete failure, in my opinion.<br /><br />Leitch plays the part of Brian who has been released from a psychiatric ward for murdering his Father fives years ago. Upon return to School, his old friend Dwight (Pitt) decides he would rather humiliate him than to be his friend again. Jill Schoelen plays Paula who is Dwights girlfriend and is the love interest of Brian, also. Suddenly, teachers and students are turning up missing or dead and it comes down to whether Brian is the killer or Dwight is the killer.<br /><br />I saw this film many years ago and had trouble sitting through it then. I don't know why things would be different now. The script is laughable and the actors try to do their best but still turns out bad. What Roddy McDowell is doing in this movie playing a perverted principal is beyond me. Such a great actor and to end up in trash like this is just sad. The actor that does the best with his character is Brad Pitt. He does a surprisingly decent job. The murder scenes are extremely weak with a few off screen killings and one killing with a very fake ax to the head. Just disappointing... 3/10
