Well, in Finland this movie is oddly called Executor, though that isn't a Finnish word. So, this tv-movie is very bad. The scenes are made very poorly and some scenes are so funny, especially when one female robot takes her hand and starts to beat with it. The scene where David Bowie's "Ashes to ashes" plays, the angel wings come on the the lead character, that scene is so stupid! I would give this * star out of **** (1 out of 10).
