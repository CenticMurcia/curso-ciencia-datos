This came at the end of a long weekend spent watching really bad films. Don't think for a second that adds to its credit, though. I can't list everything I hated about this movie because a) it would take too long and b) I'm sure it killed a few of my brain cells, and my mind is blocking some of my memories out of self-defense. This movie contains: terrible acting, a horrible screenplay, lousy camera-work, way too much red lighting, occasionally no light at all, really bad makeup, plot hole upon plot hole upon plot hole, the least effective villain ever, a mind-numbingly bad soundtrack, and THE strangest sex scene I have ever encountered in my life. The director admitted in the commentary that he gets teased a lot for the "parking lot of death" scene, and I would say "teasing" is a generous word. I would like to throw feces at the man responsible for that scene. Also, when we got this movie it was listed as "Street Zombies", not "Ozone". It's a fair indicator of a bad film when there's more than one title involved-- alas, we had no warning. Here's what I can say to this film's credit: watch it with a bunch of friends and you just may get some good laughs out of the schlocky awfulness. In a scene in a bar involving zombified patrons, the director mentions that he'd been buying all the extras beer and they were all rip-roaringly drunk by the time filming was through. Watching this movie, I really, really, really wish I had been, too.
