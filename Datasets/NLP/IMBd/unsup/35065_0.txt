This is the story of two childhood friends, Chuck and Buck. Buck is a guy in his late 20s who lives with his mother. When she dies (and by this point, you can tell there is something "off" about him just by his reactions at the funeral), he invites an old childhood friend, Chuck, to the funeral. This opens Pandora's Box and sets off a series of events with Buck trying to somehow recapture some obscure childhood memories that he shared with Chuck.<br /><br />Buck is in perpetual pre-pubescence, and while Chuck had moved away when they were kids and developed into a normally functioning person, Buck stayed behind in the town and developed a psychotic, homo erotic fixation for his old friend Chuck. All Buck seems to want to do is to revert back to the times he remembers when they were kids. Chuck may be able to fend off the guy at first by simply going back home to L.A., but when Buck moves there and injects himself into Chuck's daily routine, he becomes harder to avoid. Worse, while Chuck tries to avoid his exceptionally creepy friend, it becomes exceedingly difficult when Buck fails to grasp any sort of reality that things are different and forever will be.<br /><br />Along with "A Thousand Acres" and "A Dangerous Woman," "Chuck & Buck" will remain, for me, one of those movies that was so creepy and disturbing that I never want to see it again.
