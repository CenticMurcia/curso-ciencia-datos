I picked up this movie in the hopes that it was a good suspenseful ghost story. That is not what I got.<br /><br />This movie must have been produced on a shoe string of a budget, from the odd camera angles to the meandering around the plot, this movie was a big disappointment.<br /><br />I do believe it had the right ingredients, but just needed more direction and some better actors. The only thing that kept me from turning it off is my curiosity of just how bad this movie could get.<br /><br />The ending was abrupt, leaving all sorts of questions in the viewers mind. Much like this review.<br /><br />I do not recommend this flick.
