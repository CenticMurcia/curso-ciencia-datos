And I've seen a lot of movies. The DVD cover said it was "Scariest Movie of the Year". I didn't know that scariest was a euphemism for crappiest. Total waste of time, left-wing propaganda, global warming film. The heroin isn't even hot. A bunch of gratuitous scenes that make no sense. The monster is a digitally created moose, how stupid is that? The antagonist wets his bed, and the protagonist is a tree hugging liberal weirdo. I wish that I had never watched this movie. If you want to see a cool movie like this that is set in the Alaskan theme, check out 30 Days of Night. I'm tired of these Hollywood elites lecturing us on the ills of industry and capitalism, while constantly reaping the benefits of it. Maybe once they put away their private jets and highly consumptive lifestyles, I might be inclined to listen.
