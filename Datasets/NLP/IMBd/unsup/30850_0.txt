Name everything that's bad about recent comedies: the pointless gross-out humour, the gratuitous celebrity cameos, the wafer-thin plot, the fat/ugly jokes, the punchline-less jokes that consist of nothing but a reference to ephemeral American popular culture. Pretty good, but there's something missing - that one missing ingredient in this boiling pot of cinematic calamity.<br /><br />And in Zohan, Adam Sandler appears to have found that one component required for this perfect storm of bad movie-making to occur - racist jokes. The vast majority of "jokes" in Zohan consist of little more than "Jews are penny-pinching cheats" or "Arabs are poor, stupid goat herders". What little characterisation anyone who is not Adam Sandler gets is either "hummus-eating weirdo" (Israeli) or "angry cab-driving terrorist" (Palestinian).<br /><br />The plot is abandoned relatively fast in favour of Zohan having sex with lots of old ladies, and a nonsensical climax involving Mariah Carey shamelessly plugging her album. Don't say you weren't warned.
