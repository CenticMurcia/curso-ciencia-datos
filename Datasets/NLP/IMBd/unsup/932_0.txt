I found videos of the six episode series for BBC 4 in 93 ' gathering dust on local library shelves. I watched them and then watched them again. I renewed them with the library. I've now done this three times and am trying to track down a copy for my own library.<br /><br />I don't understand how these could have been overlooked they are wonderfully brilliant. Truly well written with that quirky surreal twist that only Dennis Potter can create.<br /><br />I am now on a personal crusade to bring this marvelously entertaining work of art to the attention of anyone who will listen.<br /><br />How can this have been overlooked in the States? I think this may very well be Dennis Potters best for the small screen.<br /><br />The UK Cast and crew including Ewen McGregor are impeccable,,,, Do yourself a favour and find a copy to view and you two will be singing songs from the 50's again.
