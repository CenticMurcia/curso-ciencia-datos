Perhaps it's the film, or just my insanity, but either way "Get Real" gives me the strange urge and unattainable goal of being a gay school boy from Great Britain. This movie is wonderful. At first viewing it's excellent, then after I thought about the film some more I gained appreciation for it. Eventually I became sexually attracted to this film and wished to procreate with it. Melodramatic? Sure. Psychotic? Perhaps. But I know one thing for sure, if you are going to watch a movie about a gay British school boy, "Get Real" is the movie for you.
