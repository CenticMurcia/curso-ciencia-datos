A woeful script - if indeed there was one - combined with the worst comedy-special-effects known to mankind, make this film possibly the worst I've ever seen. And I've seen a few ...<br /><br />The long list of credits disproves my theory that it was in fact, concocted over a drunken weekend by a bunch of bored, penniless students. What exactly did all those people contribute to this 'movie'? I refuse to believe there was a script, a director, or a budget. I could find enough rubbish under my bed to accurately re-create the 'special effects'. The location appears to be a garbage tip in a wood, and the entire film was shot within a radius of about 50 feet.<br /><br />All this, and a plot based on the premise that the victims all choose to run around in the open to escape the wooden bear, rather than take refuge on the first floor of the empty house.<br /><br />Some of the camera shots are actually quite artistic - possibly evidence that they could only afford to hire a professional for one hour. I feel sorry for the young actors, who have probably had their careers set back 20 years. Some may say that's no bad thing, but I think there is a glimmer of talent there, particularly in Kate Todd. <br /><br />One only hopes they are able to look back and laugh at this in 20 years' time.
