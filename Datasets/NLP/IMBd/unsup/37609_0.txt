<br /><br />This movie it supposed to be very funny, why? Because it has a monkey, and they always do funny things, not only that Matt LeBlanc is a very funny actor (in "Friends" of course) because here it doesn't work as well as in the sitcom. I didn't laugh at all in the whole movie, and there's a moment you don't expect to laugh anymore.<br /><br />Ok, so it's a comedy, a stupid comedy to be true, and the worst of all you didn't laugh, so don't bother to see this one, and you better wait thursdays to see "Friends"
