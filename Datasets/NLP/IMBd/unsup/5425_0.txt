YO PUTA aka WHORE is fusion of fact and fiction in a semi-documentary style as a young woman(Daryl Hannah)schedules interviews in completing her book exploring the secrets of the oldest profession in the world...sex. European 'escorts', pimps and johns discuss the pros and cons of prostitution; some with pride and others with frank regret. The sex trade can stupefy and titillate with a thin line separating pleasure from pain. It is a means of gaining independence, but at the same time put a high price on the cost of human self worth. Denise Richards is cast as student working on an anthropology PH.D. and considering prostitution as a way to pay the bills; being a virgin proves to get in the way. Strong sexual content and some nudity equal an R rating; but a large percent of the film is subtitled and may sustain flaccidity.
