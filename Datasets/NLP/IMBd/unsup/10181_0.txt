It's always interesting to see a movie from a play. This one made me wonder how the intimate, brooding mood of extended silences reached across the stage into the audience, but it certainly works on film. The Netflix blurb prepared me for a depressing experience, but I came away with a sense that I had spent a few years in a world that is thousands of miles and hundreds of years from my own. The characters have a limited range of expression, but what they feel and say is consistent and almost meditative. Yes, there is tragedy, but the gift of a film that opens a window on deep experience is that you are uplifted rather than let down. A nice little movie that makes me so grateful for DVDs.
