I have watched this film and I thought it was a waste of time, I found it boring. But most other people I was with who watched it said they enjoyed. One reason why I know I hated it so much was because I hate comedy films, In the cinema if you watch a comedy film all you can her is the laughter around you and it really destroys the film. So basicaly I hate comedy films and this was a total waste of time!!!!!
