Shoot 'em up starts out insane, and never lets up. The movie is straight up action, much like the Transporter 2 was made, just EVEN MORE ridiculous. The stunts and guns were just awesome, as was the acting by Clive and Paul. They were both funny and intense at the same time. While at the times the stunts are too unbelievable, they still add to the fun and will keep you saying "No way!", "Wow", and "What the hell?!" throughout. <br /><br />Overall it is definitely worth a look if you are looking for something to do and love brainless action films. <br /><br />---6.5/10
