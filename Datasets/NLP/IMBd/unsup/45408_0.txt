I loved the previous reviews. Maybe reviews really shouldn't begin with "from what I remember"....... Hilarious that you don't actually have to remember the movie to review it. I saw it. It sucked. Guy knows a girl all his life, going to get married, so he goes off to buy a Lamborghini. OK. Meets scumbag dealer who screws him on the deal. Then, he decides to screw the sales girl........and misses his wedding rehearsal to do it. Then is late for the wedding. Both chicks are hot. So then he decides not to show for the wedding. But then he decides to show up. The whole family has predicted he won't show. He does, with his new girlfriend in tow after being MIA for days. And the first girl still wants to marry him. He even invites his slut girlfriend to the wedding and his bride appears to have no problem with that. OK. The dad of the bride should have beat the living crap out of him and taken his daughter home. Does he? Noooooooooo. He just decides to go along. Great movie. Maybe the girlfriend moved in with them next. That would have made a great movie.
