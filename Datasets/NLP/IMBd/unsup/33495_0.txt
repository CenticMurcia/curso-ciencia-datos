That's not to say there's not something of worth in it, but someone here<br /><br />claims that Mamet wrote this- the truth is, he SOLD it, and it became<br /><br />'Hollywoodized', sanitized and beaten down from it's pure and shocking<br /><br />form. On stage this was a howl, a rage against the inevitable- falling<br /><br />in love. On film, it's a little gooey and sweet, not much bite there,<br /><br />but a few interesting lines (usually all taken from Mamets play) that<br /><br />hit home about the difficulty of sacrificing 'self' to become a<br /><br />'couple'. Lowe and Moore are pretty, but it's the surrounding<br /><br />characters that actually act and are interesting, and if you look hard<br /><br />you can see some good actors in small roles, such as Megan Mullaly (Will<br /><br />and Grace) Catherine Keener (Walking and Talking) and Ray Wohl<br /><br />(Arli$$). This is definitely a film of and for it's time, although not<br /><br />quite as painfully dated as St. Elmos Fire, you'll still laugh at some<br /><br />of the hair styles and fashions and music. The director went on to<br /><br />create "thirtysomething", which tells you right there that he didn't<br /><br />have much in common with David Mamet. A curiosity, this film. .
