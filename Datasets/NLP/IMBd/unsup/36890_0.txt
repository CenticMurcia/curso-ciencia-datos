This is probably the second-worst TV reunion show ever. While the honor for the worst goes to the Beverly Hillbillies reunion, this one is only marginally better. First off, the show begins by explaining that Oliver and Lisa had moved back to New York and had been living there many years!! This NEVER could have happened in the TV series and in many ways makes the show irrelevant--after all, what's funny about moving to Hootersville and then leaving because it DID suck after all?! Secondly, like the Hillbilly TV movie, a lot of the cast was dead or near-dead. Fred Zipfel was dead and Mr. Haney just looked dead (he was very sickly and died soon afterward). And the rest of them just looked old and tired. It was pretty sad watching this mess, as it just wasn't the same. It's true you can never really go back.
