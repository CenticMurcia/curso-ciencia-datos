This is over an hour of stupidity, and colors. It's as if the writer just said: "We have a premise and a story, now lets put in some half written songs, a child, animation, fat people, animals, and pretty colors and we made a child's godfather worthy masterpiece. It's not like we need to put effort if anything. No one attempts to even be good in this film, it's as if they thought no person would notice! Even the so called jokes aren't even funny at all. I expect better from Disney, Selick, and Burton! NONE OF THIS FILM MAKES ANY SENSE! EX: The human talks and breaths underwater, a rhino killed a boys parents, and SPOILER: In the end they live in a giant peach! WTF!
