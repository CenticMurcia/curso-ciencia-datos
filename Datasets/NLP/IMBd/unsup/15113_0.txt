The Long Good Friday, with Bob Hoskins and Helen Mirren introduces us to <br /><br />characters I won't soon forget. Hoskins, as Harold Shand, a London crime boss, is a standout performer. Having never even heard of this movie until I ran across it on cable, I was truly impressed with Mr Hoskins' acting chops. The rest of the cast is truly excellent also from Helen Mirren's performance as Shand's<br /><br />business-like wife, to PH Moriarty's role as one hell of an enforcer aptly<br /><br />nicknamed "razors", this movie really does send a chill down your spine. The<br /><br />casual violence inflicted by the main characters is never gratuitous, as<br /><br />evidenced by the scene where Shand's competitors are hung like sides of beef<br /><br />for questioning. In this case, less is more. The ending is truly a classic. Im thinking about it now and I still feel my stomach drop when I imagine myself in Shand's shoes. An excellent addition to any DVD collection, I'm very happy to have stumbled across this gem. Highly Recommended.
