I rented this DVD for $1 as a weekly, and I still feel ripped off. I cannot imagine the production company made a profit from this film? I hope DEJ productions make a better film next time.<br /><br />Also, it looks bad when they use poor computer animation for some of their helicopter scenes.<br /><br />There seemed to be a lacking of logic in the way the soldiers and pilots carried out their missions. Poor editing too, probably just rushed. But what can I expect for $1.<br /><br />You may be able to get a refund on your money, but that is 95 minutes of your life you will never see again.
