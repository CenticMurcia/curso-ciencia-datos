is probably one of the best lines ever said by Joel of MST3K fame and it completely summarizes this movie. The plot has been explained many times in other reviews, so I'll focus on reviewing the main character, a good alien named Trumpy, who does resemble ALF, as stated by many other fellow reviewers on this film.<br /><br /> Trumpy, has magic powers that help him befriend a boy who lives in a cabin. These powers are nothing more that cheap special effects, that are less like "magic things" as said by the boy and more like "stupid things" as said by Joel. There's also another alien, an evil one, who looks just like Trumpy, whose reeking havoc around the forest, where the cabin is located. But both of these creatures are just downright creepy looking, which raises the question, how could this boy not be frightened by this scary looking alien.<br /><br /> Well anyway, this is a stupid movie, though the MST version is quite funny.
