In the slums of 16th century London, young Billy Mauch (as "Pauper" Tom Canty) makes the most of his life as a beggar; though, he is beaten by his father, and thrown in the mud. Meanwhile, royal Bobby Mauch (as "Prince" Edward VI) lives a life of luxury; soon, he will replace father King Henry VIII on the throne. One evening, Pauper Mauch takes refuge from a storm on Prince Mauch's palace grounds. The look-alike boys meet, and strike up a friendship. Prince Mauch invites Pauper Mauch over to the palace, where the two become intrigued by their different lifestyles, and identical appearance. After they exchange clothing, they become separated, by happenstance. When nobody believes their stories, the boys are forced to assume each other's identities.<br /><br />This is a well-produced version of the Mark Twain classic. Sadly, the unevenly paced scenario does not produce the film classic which was, evidently, possible (considering those involved). The "Mauch Twins" and Claude Rains (as the Earl of Hertford) are especially strong in their portrayals; and, Erich Wolfgang Korngold's soundtrack should be noted. Don't expect to see top-billed Errol Flynn (as Miles Hendon) until later in the film, as a supporting player. Alan Hale, Barton MacLane, Henry Stephenson, and Montagu Love are also worth noting; but, the film's main strengths are Mr. Rains, Mr. Korngold, and the "Mauch Twins". <br /><br />******* The Prince and the Pauper (5/5/37) William Keighley ~ Billy Mauch, Bobby Mauch, Errol Flynn, Claude Rains
