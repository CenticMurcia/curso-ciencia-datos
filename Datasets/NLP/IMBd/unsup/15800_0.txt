I also saw the film at Sundance and being a Christian, I can say that Karslake left out some of the stronger Biblical passages that were in the New Testament, but I don't believe he was shooting for a theological argument. I think he wanted to show that family is important and that gays/lesbians are people just like everyone else and deserve to be treated as human beings. To hear Karslake tell the stories that inspired this film deeply touched me and I think this film could stir a lot of good emotions in people, despite the fact that some areas of the film are a little weak. I think if Christians step away from what's right/wrong long enough to remember what love is all about and if non-Christians stop ridiculing the Christian community for the same reason, our world could be a better place.
