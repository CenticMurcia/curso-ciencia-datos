Among it's coverage of plot lines that die hard horror fans are sure to acknowledge from the genres glory days and just wholeheartedly enjoy, plain and simple, I couldn't help but feel it was about time for "Supernatural" to focus on some psychotic rednecks! It ain't supernaturally themed! Well done, I found it to be, non-the-less. Sam vanishes from a biker bar parking lot, to Dean's dismay and, with the help of a potentially friendly female police officer, he attempts to track down his brother. Turns out, a family of deranged in-breeders, residing in the deep backwoods of Minnesota, are kidnapping people and releasing them into the wild in order to hunt them for sport... With the use of some crafty lies, Dean manages to coax the cop into accompanying him to his brother's rescue, though not without difficulty... Like many horror fans, I have an appreciation for killer hill-billies and "The Benders" pulls off a pretty standard-style of the sub-genre, yet it is interesting to see these two dynamic characters involved in this particular setting. Actually, the evil family is menacing and extremely sinister - after Dean infiltrates their homestead, they beat him and burn him with a red-hot fire-poker. Sam is kept in an intricately locked cage along with another victim who isn't so lucky in the long run... So far, not the BEST episode in the series (my current favorites being "Asylum" and "Skin") though it is pretty much right up there with them. For the record, it doesn't rank as awesome as the controversial "X Files" episode about psycho in-breeders, but it comes close!
