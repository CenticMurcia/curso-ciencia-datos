Four gal pals living in the Big Apple with successful jobs, fabulous lives, and drama to boot. This show sounds utterly similar to that of another show by Darren Starr, Sex and the City. The hit TV show that has won the hearts of many cosmopolitan drinking fashionistas the world over. And who could replace those four girls and their interestingly hilarious escapades and taboo issues? No one could do Sex and the City better than Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda. <br /><br />Lucky for Mia, Zoe, Juliet, and Caitlin their show is called Cashmere Mafia. While the TV show hasn't covered issues as that of SATC, it does offer a new insight into the world of women. Not only can women just be portrayed as the sensual, sultry, sexual beings, but something more. In Cashmere Mafia, they show that women cannot only be sexy, but also deeply passionate about work, family, and relationships. <br /><br />In a constantly changing society, where once women were valued for just their pretty face and social lifestyle, women are reaching new heights. I hope that this show does become wildly successful, but even more, I hope this show empowers women everywhere to strive for more and to set their sights higher.<br /><br />I was and still am a fan of SATC and while I swear allegiance to it, I am open to something different, something new. While Cashmere Mafia covers similar topics that can be covered in most television shows today, they weave the stories to make them delightfully amusing. So for all the Sex and the City fans, the ones who own every season, who order cosmos when they're out with their girlfriends and wear high heels when they're going to a BBQ, it's time to try something new. Maybe it's time to trade in those cosmopolitans for wine and champagne.
