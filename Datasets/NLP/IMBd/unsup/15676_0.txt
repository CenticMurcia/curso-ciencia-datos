I don't know how many times I have seen this movie, and it's Still very entertaining for me! there is nothing like an actor growing and expanding their horizons, and showing you what they think is funny! not to mention that he brought a whole new light to things that most people don't even think about (even if it was for entertainments sake)<br /><br />Awesome movie when you just don't know what else to watch! its a funny feel good movie that actually makes you think and displays cheech's talent! he is no longer the burned out drug fiend with a fried brain! he is genuine and warm and does the right thing! (when it's important) I think the acting was actually pretty remarkable (even when it was meant to be goofy)
