One of the worst movies ever made...thus making it one of the best movies ever made. Everybody who loves awful movies, must go see this movie. I saw it at a midnight show, and got a free fortune cookie! This is basically an awfully funny version of "King Kong." They ripped off the plot, the ending, and anything that might be ripped off. I liked the gratuitous, no-nudity sex scene. Go see this movie for the music alone. It is total seventies crap. The dubbing sometimes comes after their mouths have stopped moving. Total ineptitude. Great movie. The special effects are not-so-special. There are animals galore that are mean one minute, tame the next, and can rip off a leg, and make it disappear in a millisecond. Also watch for the bad acting in the flashback scene (yes, they even used flashbacks, it ruins them all.) For the guys, there is a jungle babe that only has a small animal skin that sometimes is glued on (only one arm strap) and sometimes falls out of. I personally like her makeup...in the jungle at all times, it's perfect! I don't know whether to give this movie one star for not really trying too hard, or 9 stars for being so entertaining.
