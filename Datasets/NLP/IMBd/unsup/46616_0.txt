In order to protect a $100 million inheritance, commitment-shy bachelor Chris O'Donnell (as Jimmie Shannon) learns he must marry before he reaches his impending 30th birthday. Naturally, Mr. O'Donnell proposes to the woman he loves, beautiful blonde Ren√©e Zellweger (as Anne Arden). But, Ms. Zellweger senses O'Donnell's heart really isn't in his "(empty your intestine) or get off the pot!" proposal. Zellweger bails, with sister Marley Shelton (as Natalie). So, O'Donnell, with pal Artie Lange (as Marco) assisting, tries to locate a marriage-minded woman, who is willing to share $100 million, and produce a baby. Any takers? <br /><br />Ms. Shelton is a sweet sidekick, and Brooke Shields (as Buckley) stands out among the unfortunately wasted supporting cast. Gary Sinyor's "The Bachelor" is a lesser re-make of a well-remembered Buster Keaton comedy ("Seven Chances"). No cigar and not even close.<br /><br />**** The Bachelor (1999) Gary Sinyor ~ Chris O'Donnell, Renee Zellweger, Marley Shelton
