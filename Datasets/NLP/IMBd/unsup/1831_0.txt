Ballad of a Soldier is a fine, humanistic view of war as experienced by a young Russian soldier. The young soldier is everything a Boy Scout should be: trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverend. Well, maybe hold the reverend.<br /><br />Having managed to save a bunch of his comrades from certain death at the hands of the Nazis, the young soldier is called to the general's hq. There, the general tells him he's putting the lad's name in for a medal of valor. Fine, says the boy, but could I please go home to see my mother?<br /><br />The general hesitates, but encouraged by the soldiers surrounding him, he lets the boy go home, making him promise to get to see his mother and come back to the front within four days.<br /><br />So the lad goes home, and along the way he does favors for some of his comrades, he helps a lovely young maiden in distress, and he generally spreads good will. He gets home in time to give his mom a hug - there's an incredible scene with him and his dear old mom (wearing a babushka) running toward each other through a field of wheat. Then he wipes away her tears, and tells her he's got to go back. Immediately. A promise is a promise.<br /><br />What a film. If you can watch this one without crying over the human condition, you're just plain not human!
