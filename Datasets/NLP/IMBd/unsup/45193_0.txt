Do not, I repeat DO NOT watch this movie if you value your sanity. I sat through almost 3 hours of this movie and could not get a single clue about what the whole movie about. I spent a night analyzing the movie, racking my brain until I almost drove myself insane. The theater was almost empty on a Sunday night which was its third day of release. I think that more than accentuates the failure of the movie. The director did a very bad job of porting a Stephen King's novel for Bollywood. At the end of the movie I was checking to see If I was the only one disappointed. People shaking their heads and joking about how bad the movie was reassured me. No one got the movie. And for the record I live in one of the posh areas of the city. If people like these are so clueless what happens to the masses?
