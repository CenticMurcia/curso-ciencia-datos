Sociologists would have a field day with this film. Given the current state of things, it's amazing that African-Americans have not picketed this film due to its extremely negative stereotyping of black life in America.<br /><br />Black men are depicted as shiftless tramps, hustlers and just general low-lives. Ditto for women.<br /><br />The language here is absolutely disgusting to say the least. You can't get through a sentence without b and f bombs being hurled at each other.<br /><br />How old is Tyrese Gibson's mom in this film? She must have had him when she was 14 or so.<br /><br />How horrible that the killing is never solved by police officials.<br /><br />These negative things being said, our sociologists would view this film positively claiming that it gives an adequate description of black life.<br /><br />Where are our so called black activists in protesting this film? I thought I was back in the New York City classroom or other large urban school setting. What a disgusting film to show to all groups. Talk of reviving of racial prejudice, this was really off the wall.
