I know others liked this movie, but this was a depressing movie. I felt Peggy was so unstable and needed some mental health care help. This is truly a woman that has no life and then gets so obsessed she seems ready for a rubber room. I love animals, but this movie shows how some people can get so unhealthily obsessed with things that it controls their whole life. Molly did a good job of acting and playing this poor pathetic character. But, she is so unstable that not only does she become a danger to herself, but others, too. This just wasn't an enjoyable movie. This shouldn't be in the comedy category, it's mostly drama. This was our Saturday night date movie, so really put a damper on the whole night.
