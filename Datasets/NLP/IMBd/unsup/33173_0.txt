Perhaps the Wagner clan found making it cathartic, but for the viewer it is merely punishment.<br /><br />Not rising to the truly repulsive, the infantile self-absorption of the cast would drive most any non-Wagner to claw his or her way out of the speeding van even at the risk of life and limb.<br /><br />The quirky annoyance factor of the cast (particulary of the straw-chewing patriarch) is not matched by an emotional pay-off. The (spoiler alert! z-z-z-z-z...) reconciliation is utterly toothless. These people SHOULD be separated.<br /><br />This indie movie is scary in that it shows how little money and little talent are required to get drek produced nowadays.
