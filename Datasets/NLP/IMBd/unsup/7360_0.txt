A rather strange, slow-moving story about a writer (Hutton) working on a screenplay based on the exploits of a stripper (Burke) he has fallen for. There's more going on behind the scenes, involving his financially desperate buddy (Joe P.) who needs the screenplay written or his kneecaps may be forfeit. But in the end this plot goes nowhere in particular. I'm not at all sure why this was made. I certainly wouldn't have greenlighted it, except maybe as a Skinemax midnight movie with the addition of a lot more skin showing. Burke is reasonably sultry as the tell-all bad girl, who is perhaps a bit too attractive to be who she claims, and Hutton is his usual befuddled self. Not that there's anything wrong with that. He plays befuddled well. In fact, if you look up the word in the dictionary, you will see his face next to it. But the story here all goes for naught. The climax is -- shall we say -- anticlimactic. You may safely skip it.
