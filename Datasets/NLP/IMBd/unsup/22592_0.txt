Why is this movie ranked so poorly on IMDB? I just saw it at the Hawaii Film Festival, where it was sold out, and it is such a good film. If you're going to post a negative, please explain why. There has to be a reason this film has been not only invited to show at festivals across the country, but that it has also been winning awards at several of them.
