I always love it when a few angry wanna be filmmakers jump on IMDb and critique other people's work. Sure, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but when you COMPLETELY MISS THE JOKE, the joke is actually on YOU. What part of hot college chicks from another planet led you to believe this was going to be Schindler's List?! Obviously, the people who made this movie meant it to be goofy (DUH!). Too bad you can't lighten up and just enjoy the silly film that it was clearly made to be. It's entertainment. Mindless fun. Stop taking yourselves so seriously. And if you think you could do better-- move out to LA and make your movie instead of working at the Grab and Gulp.
