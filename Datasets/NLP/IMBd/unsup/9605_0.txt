"In 1857 a citizen of Great Britain (from the Channel Island of Jersey)" At least I do not think so.<br /><br />Jersey like the other Channel Islands is an Independent State otherwise, for example it would have the same income tax regime as applies elsewhere in the places Governed by the UK parliament which are currently England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, although in 1857 the whole of Ireland was under UK law.<br /><br />The film is nonetheless of interest apart from the error in the comment that I record.<br /><br />One wonders whether a better portrayal of a fascinating story would have been achieved with the lead played by a more natural actor, rather than the wife of the director. However, this rather stiff style is of it's age and so hardly surprising as it was not made in the times of Susan Sarandon or Meryl Streep.
