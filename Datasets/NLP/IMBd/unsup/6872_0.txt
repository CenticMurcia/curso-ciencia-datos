I saw Wordplay at the Philly Film Festival without knowing or expecting anything. I'm not a big crossword guy, but I do love a good documentary movie. Real stuff. Since seeing Wordplay about 2 months ago, I've raved about it to everyone I know who enjoys good, out-of-the-mainstream films. Probably the best thing I've seen all year.<br /><br />It's inevitable to compare this movie to the spelling bee "Spellbound" even as you watch it. I think it holds up. I found it informative, funny, touching, human, and most importantly, compelling. One slight worry: With the cameos by President Bill, John Stewart, the Indigo Girls, etc. I'm afraid the Limbaugh-minded folks will turn right off and start yelling "LIBERAL propaganda" or some such trash. Hopefully not.<br /><br />I Loved it.
