I know that viewers from the UK and USA have different opinions of this film. Most say that they do like this film or it was OK and then add things they didn't like about it.<br /><br />I personally loved it, and would not have made any changes to it, including subtitles, running time etc. One of my favourite scenes is the escape and chase back to the village. It is one of those films where you really feel involved. You want him to get revenge and you want him to get away, and those bad guys in the film really get to you. <br /><br />This is one of the few films I could watch more than once. I would describe it as a feel good film because it takes you through the motions and you want some sort of satisfaction at the end, which it delivers perfectly.
