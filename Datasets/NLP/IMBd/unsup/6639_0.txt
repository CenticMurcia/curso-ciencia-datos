I must concur with the previous reviewer the only saving grace in this movie is Luke Mably who once again does a fine job portraying Edvard of Denmark. Kam Heskin who plays Paige Morgan is just plain awful from the Shirley Temple hairstyle, the over the top facial expressions, and the hideous wardrobe. The original film while considered fluff by many at least had some wonderful chemistry between the leads whereas there is zilch between Luke and Kam. The only other character worth mentioning is Zoren and I thought Jonathan Firth did an admirable job. Maryam D'Abo's Queen Rosalind is flat and wooden and King Harald is now bald and sports a beard. Even worse is the couple who portray Paige's parents (look more like her grandparents). I cannot fathom why they chose to turn this sequel into such a screwball comedy.
