I was blown away by the beauty of the actress playing the Indian maiden in this film. From the first moment you see her on screen she looks like you could reach out and touch her, she is so realistic. The D.W. Griffith Years of Discovery liner notes say she was "unknown." Well, that is a crying shame! How could someone not document who she was? She was stunning, and completely believable. If anyone knows who she was, please post it here for posterity.<br /><br />This film was pretty sensitive to the Indians' cause, and also showed that the white man could also get along with the Indians when they showed true Christian character towards them. Owen Moore and James Kirkwood perform well. The father's death scene is moving and poignant. Was D.W. Griffith a racist? If he was you couldn't tell it from this film.<br /><br />
