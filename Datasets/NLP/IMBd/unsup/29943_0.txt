When this movie first came out, the reviews were generally favorable but the subject matter was utterly depressing. What could be sadder than the appalling mistreatment of Afghan women at the hands of the Taliban? I skipped the movie when it ran at the theaters.<br /><br />I recently viewed the movie and my earlier impressions were correct. It is very depressing. However, I would recommend it simply because it is as good a method as any to educate the world on Islam and its treatment of women. What happens in "Osama", the summary execution of women via stoning, the brutal beatings and imprisonments, the slavery trade, and all manner of beastly practices anyone in the West would consider beyond the pale, occurs in these countries all of the time.<br /><br />The question one asks, given the increasing percentage of Muslims in the E.U., the increasing practice of "honor killings", the frequent rioting by Asian "youths", the routine harassment of Jews and Gays by Muslims in the E.U. countries, and the increasing acceptance of Sharia law by the secular E.U. authorities to accommodate the growing Islamic population, how long will it be before the great democracies of Western Europe look like Afghanistan? Rudyard Kipling must be rolling in his grave.
