I saw Saawariya yesterday and I want to share my review about this movie. Saawariya is a short-story poetry based Bollywood movie. Of course it is very hard to translate a short story which is a poetry to the big screen. <br /><br />Fyodor Dostoevsky's 'White Nights' was written a century ago in Russian. The poem is beautiful and extremely touching and emotional. About the movie, I think both the new comers (Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor) have done a wonderful job in first film. And of course there is Rani and Salman in this film. Salman has a very short role but Rani takes your heart away. And Zohra Sehgal is always delightful.<br /><br />Film starts out with a prostitute, Gulab 'ji' (Rani Mukherjee) narrating his friend's story. Ranbir Raj, is a young man who comes to a beautiful 'town' to get a job. He gets job in a bar. Eventually he makes Gulab Ji his friend. One night he sees a mysterious girl, Sakina crying in the bridge. He asks her why she is crying, then she says that she is waiting for her lover, Imaan (Salman Khan), who has been gone to some 'country'. She asks him to help her in finding him. In the process they become very close. Raj falls in love with her but Sakina is very confused. She thinks that she likes Raj but the same time when she thinks of Imaan, she starts looking for him. In the end, Imaan comes and Sakina goes with her. Raj is alone, alone with memories of Sakina.<br /><br />The movie's sets are wonderful, cinematography is amazing, and music is awe-awesome. Only I have one problem with was screenplay, being very strict and sometimes lenient to the picturization. Story suffers sometimes, but in the end you will leave theater with wonderful memories, and of course you will be sad. The movie has fairytale touch, so you don't have to think about which city they are wandering in? What is background of Raj? Why Imaan leaves his town in a haste? What happens to Gulabji in the end? and so on... You will enjoy it if you stop looking for these answers, but you can create your own answers in your mind.<br /><br />On an ending note, I liked this movie and I hate those critics who are giving this movie a rating of 2 out of 5. This is a beautiful movie, and it will surely touch your heart (ofcourse if you have heart!).<br /><br />8 out of 10.
