At first glance, A*P*E* would appear to be the worst movie in history. Perhaps this is true. I mean, everything about this movie sucks. The ape looks fake, the acting is virtually non-existent, the music is something you would hear in a bad porn movie, and the special effects (if that's what you want to call them) look as if they were done by 6 year old kids. What could possibly save this movie?<br /><br />What saves this movie is the fact that it was SUPPOSED to be this way. Anybody could have made a realistic movie with great special effects and talented actors, but that would be boring. I'd much rather see a piece of crap film like this one and laugh my ass off at it. This movie reminds me of Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space. It is one of the cheesiest movies ever made, and yet it has a cult following. In other words, it made its mark by being terrible. Let's face it, some movies just shouldn't be good, and A*P*E* is one of those movies. It's a special talent to be able to make a bad movie that is fun to watch, and the makers of A*P*E* definitely have that talent. That is why I give this movie a 10, because it was made exactly how it was intended to be made. Sadly, this talent is not recognized in hollywood, and not many bad movies of this caliber are made anymore. Truly a tragedy. Check out A*P*E*, though, and you won't be disappointed. I mean, you will be, but it will be a good disappointment...nevermind, just watch it.
