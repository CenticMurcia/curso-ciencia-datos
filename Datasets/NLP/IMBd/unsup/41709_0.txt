To begin with I did not give this title a three because i don't like foreign films i love them. Especially Asian ones. This however is a sad excuse for a film. Do not be fooled by the cover art or summary which screams violence because there is none. Even if you do not enjoy violence there are still many problems with this title. The story well there isn't much of one. Juzo who was picked on in his child hood, well more than picked on.. tortured in a way, by a classmate named Akai is the main character. Juzo is now of course traumatized and has split personalities. Juzo gets a job and moves into a new apartment guess whos in the room right above him and his new boss, thats right Akai. I wont say much else concerning the plot. There were a few twists very few however which helped but not enough at all. There is no musical score what so ever to heighten suspense instead we have long drawn out scenes which do nothing but bore the viewer.. All in all this movie is a waste of your time. Do not waste any of your precious time on it as I did you will regret it. two out of ten
