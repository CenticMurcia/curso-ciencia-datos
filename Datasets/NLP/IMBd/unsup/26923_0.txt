I will be honest and say that I did enjoy Romeo Must Die. It was entertaining, with some decent action sequences. But none of them are nearly as intense, well choreographed or as fast as the ones in Kiss of the Dragon. This movie has absolutely excellent action sequences. I was hoping for that and it delivered. It isn't as good a Bruce Lee movie, but its as close as I've had the fortune to see. However, action aside, everything else was awful. The script was horrible. The characters were quite standard, for instance the bad guys were totally horrible without a redeeming quality, and the good guy is pure and honest, and gets into a lot of trouble. The acting is at times laugh aloud bad. I went to see it for the action, however, so I turned my brain off and enjoyed. If you can just watch this movie, not question anything and enjoy the absolutely stunning fighting of Jet Li, then give it a watch. 7 out of 10, purely for the action.
