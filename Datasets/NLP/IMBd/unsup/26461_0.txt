<br /><br />Another of those above average movies that Gere usually does.He carries the movie on his shoulders here as he gives us a peek into the "guilty untill proven innocent style" justice system of Communist China.The movie tries it's best to be fair but the screenplay and script are so below average,it comes off as forced.The Chinese actress who played Gere's lawyer was very good and if you are a fan of political court drama or a big fan of Gere,you will be satisfied with this movie.....
