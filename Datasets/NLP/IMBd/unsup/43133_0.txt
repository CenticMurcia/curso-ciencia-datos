Rude, crude, amateurish, self-indulgent and just plain unfunny. When I first heard what these people were trying to do with this movie, I was confused. After reading the script and seeing the movie's description in Ralph magazine, I am even more confused. The storyline seems to be a joke that someone made over the breakfast table, and didn't realise it should have stayed there. For the little bit of "story" that is there, it does nothing but to string together jokes which are either weak or stolen from other places, sitting in sequence in a disjointed, incoherent manner. Thank heavens that this will never be seen in cinemas (and in my opinion should not even be on this site), and please, let us be spared of any other nonsense that these hacks try to impose on audiences
