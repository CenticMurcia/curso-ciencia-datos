This movie was ridiculous.<br /><br />I found the story to be pretty weak to say the least. It's about an Islamic man, grouping with some terrorists in Jemen, to plot attacks throughout the western world.<br /><br />The movie was obviously created as a scare tactic for the viewing public.<br /><br />It should be noted that most acts of terrorism are done with ideological motivation, rather than religious ones, but still in this movie you see the 'terrorists' praying to the east every other ten minutes, and in almost every line they speak about Allah, and their devotion to Islam.<br /><br />Besides the blatant anti-Muslim propaganda, the movie even contains parts where flashy images show regular looking people traveling on public transportation, who according to the movie really are terrorists who could be carrying a bag, a notebook, or simply people with an Arab appearance.<br /><br />After the movie was over I couldn't believe the actors actually agreed to cooperate with this, but then I figured the Pentagon must be sending really big cheques to buy their souls.<br /><br />I do not advise anyone to view this movie, because the brainwashing techniques used, will probably scare the average viewer into submission.<br /><br />If you happen to be studying Propaganda Techniques used in Hollywood Movies, then this one is one to watch for you.
