FF8 is definitely one of the biggest classics in the series. The story starts off with a group of students in a military school: we have Squall, the main guy who is a loner and a bit moody; there's Zell who likes to use his fists for a lot of things & Selphie who is perky and always has a positiver attitude. We also meet Quistis (their smart and incredibly hot instructor), Rinoa (Squall's love interest) and Irvine (a ladies man) along the way. Good points: Story: The story is one of the best in the series and is mostly what i play the game for. there are a few clever plot twists that will make the story even more interesting.<br /><br />Characters: All the characters are likable enough (Except Irvine maybe) and they all have good interaction with each other.<br /><br />Setting: The places are very nice to visit, particularly the ones on the Esthar continent: Esthar City (a hi-tech metropolis), Tears Point (a place with statues and nice art) and Lunatic Pandora (find out for yourself) Summons: The summons (called Gfs) can be found in different circumstances: some have to be fought, some have to be drawn from enemies and some can only be obtained through special conditions and there are a number of secret ones as well.<br /><br />Bad points: Battles: the system on this is a little slow paced and the drawing system just isn't that great Development: the junction system on this is a good idea (junction GFs to use magic, etc) but it makes the characters too powerful and therefore makes most boss fights easy. However, you don't have to use the junction system as much so it doesn't really affect the game too much.
