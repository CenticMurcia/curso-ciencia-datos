I enjoyed this movie a lot. I think that people are right when they say that this movie isn't all that it could be. The acting is great, the plot is pretty good but this doesn't feel like a complete movie. Most of it comes from the fact that this movie first ran near 3 hours. Then they cut it down to a small hour and forty minutes. I think that a lot of substance was lost due to the fact that the audience would get bored. I'd rather sit through a slow movie that is good than a slow movie that is okay. They should have turned it into a mini-series on TV then release it on DVD to get the budget back. So in the end it's a good movie that I enjoy watching over and over again. 7/10
