Reading the postings here it does appear that one will either hate this offering as insulting and/or laughable or come to appreciate it as something quite unique.<br /><br />Admittedly the dialog and much of its delivery is B movie tedious, yet examining other scripts and performances of the time we find that this is rather standard fare. The acting could certainly have been much more refined (Billy Rhodes, the villain, looked uncomfortable through most of the film), but I have traveled all through the United States, seen plays and musicals put on by more trained actors that were so much worse than this. Some version of this script could have easily found its way into Roy Rogers weekly show.<br /><br />The worst part, for me, was the second musical number in the saloon; sung by Johnnie Fern as Diamond Dolly. I had seen it as a separate clip long before seeing the entire movie - feel free to fast forward here - it is truly embarrassing.<br /><br />Charles Becker as Otto the cook, is a joy to watch.<br /><br />Bill Platt as Jim 'Tex' Preston, was the senior of this group and had been performing for several decades before being well cast as the wealthy loving uncle.<br /><br />Billy Curtis as the hero Buck Lawson, cuts quite a dashing figure (all be it on a pony), especially during the stagecoach chase; which is dangerous for even a larger stunt man.<br /><br />Two things I found distasteful. First, Yvonne Moray as Nancy Preston running under the desk out of the jail. Second, the swinging doors at the saloon. The top of the doors were placed at the usual height for the period, but length had been reduced (obviously on purpose) to half. These are insults to both the viewer and the players.<br /><br />Not the most horrible thing on screen. I will watch "The Terror of Tiny Town" rather than that audio-visual vomit, "Moulin Rouge!" (2001), any time. What ever your personal opinion of this film please allow that everyone should see it at least once. The greatest question here may not be "who thought that this movie would be a good idea?", but, "why is there a penguin in a barber shop of the old west?"
