This movie is one of the cutest films i've ever seen. The actors are great and their characters absolutely loveable. Jez (Stuart Townsend - one can only feel sorry for his haircut in the movie) and Dylan (Dan Futterman) are two little crooks who try to make enough money to fulfill their dream and buy themselves a house. While doing one of their swindels they get to know Georgie (played by Kate Beckinsale) and happen to both fall in love with her. From that point on it's getting real chaotic, but you can bet on a happy ending. Maybe it's a little predictable, still absolutely worth watching it.
