As an American Indian in New York I could relate to the title character's confusion about his Indianness. At the same time I sympathised with him about the religious mumbo-jumbo thrust upon young Indians. A romantic story at heart, this movie skewers various stereotypes about the Indian community. A tremendously enjoyable film, specially if you understand the setting of an ABCD.
