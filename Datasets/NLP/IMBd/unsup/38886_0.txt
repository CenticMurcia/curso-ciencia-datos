*****Plot points that could spoil this movie****** When coming upon this movie written,directed and starring Bobcat Goldthwait in a the movie considered the Citizen Kane of Alcoholic Clown movies one word comes to mind: classy. However after viewing I promptly demanded the video clerk to return to me 74 minutes of my life. She upon viewing the synopsis of the movie said, "I think this is your fault." Anyways the movie it self drags on and is really not that funny. There is no real plot until the last 15 minutes of the movie (if you last that long) and even then is not worth it. Bobcat does not even use his trademark voice instead attempting to actually act it appears. Few highlights include Robin Williams in his mime school scene, and the scene where the clowns beat up the mimes (which is mostly funny since most people hate mimes). Overall this movie ranks near the bottom of all the movies I've seen.
