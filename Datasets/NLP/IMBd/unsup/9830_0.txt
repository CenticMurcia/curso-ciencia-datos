Many elements of this movie weren't bad in concept. I can hardly fault the acting, campy style, special effects, or even the plot. Unfortunately, the movie fails in directing and editing, which trumps all the others.<br /><br />For example, the plot is basically Species, but the writing was horrid, and the characters were not believable as a result. Are you going to believe that a college kid is still flirting with a space alien after he's seen tentacles? No.<br /><br />Same for the special effects, the tentacle effects could have been great if they slowed them down by a factor of 10 or so. Again, just bad directing on that.<br /><br />It all makes you wonder how the crew burned through $5 million; they certainly didn't pay the writing and editing crew anything.
