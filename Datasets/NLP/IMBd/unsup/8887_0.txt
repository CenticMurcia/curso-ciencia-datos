The Leopard Man is a master class in efficient scripting and filming on a budget. Despite being 70 minutes long, it has a large ensemble of characters from different areas of a small New Mexico town - English and Spanish, rich and poor, entertainers, police, scientists - all involved in some way in a story about an escaped leopard who may be hunting humans. A mood of fear and foreboding is economically created with plays of light, sudden noises, eerie music, and unseen objects moving in the shadows. The animal attacks occur in darkness and behind doors, but are filmed in such a way as to be suggestive of greater violence than if they had been shown explicitly, and this is very effectively scary. A remarkable film.
