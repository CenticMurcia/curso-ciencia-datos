After a few excellent movies in the eighties (such as An American Werewolf in London and The Howling), the werewolf genre seemed to take a fall in the nineties. Then, movies such as Dog Soldiers and Ginger Snaps came along, making me believe the genre was making a comeback. Then Cursed came along and ruined every hope.<br /><br />Big Bad Wolf has been depicted as a 'B-movie', people warning not to expect too much of it. It's scheduled to be released on DVD in the US in June. Abominable is another movie which was released on DVD and one I'd very much like to see. I'm still waiting for Abominable to come out here (the Netherlands) on DVD but I decided not to wait with Big Bad Wolf (don't worry, if it does come out, I'll buy it).<br /><br />To cut it short, I certainly wasn't disappointed. The movie has a good, gloomy atmosphere one looks for with movies such as this. Also, in my opinion, it takes a certain individual to portray the werewolf in human form, who  basically  can be put into two categories: the sad, cursed victim (like in An American Werewolf), or the sadistic, willing victim (like in The Howling). Richard Tyson plays one hell of a werewolf and his character can definitely be placed under the second category.<br /><br />Not only as a werewolf, but in human form as well, Mitchell Toblat is one nasty character. The werewolf too is somewhat different than we've seen before.<br /><br />Like with many, I had my doubts about a talking werewolf, but I believe it has worked out nicely. In this movie, the werewolf truly is a well sexual predator as well, representing the animal side of human nature, call it ID if you'd like, but it worked out well. Blood, gore and sadism all around nicely done, though, and not too much. The movie also had humour in places; as with An American Werewolf in London, not overly done and well-timed.<br /><br />None of the other cast members annoyed me (most were even likable), unlike several recent werewolf movies. The story has a few nice turns and most of them weren't overly predictable. The ending didn't hold too many surprises and is perhaps even a tad disappointing (sequel, perhaps?) but all in all, this is worth watching.<br /><br />Call it a 'B-movie', but in my opinion (being the werewolf freak that I am), it's a hell of a lot better than Cursed and, yes, I dare say, better than many mainstream horror movies of recent years.
