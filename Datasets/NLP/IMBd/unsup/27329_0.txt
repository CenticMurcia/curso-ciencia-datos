An escaped convict protects a widow from greedy land developers who want the property for something. Along the way the escaped convict falls for the widow and becomes a father figure for her two children. I want to make this clear, I quite enjoy Jean-Claude Van Damme and his movies, I recommended Bloodsport,Kickboxer and Universal Soldier. However Nowhere To Run is just an awful movie. When Jean-Claude Van Damme interacts with Kieren Culkin and the little girl, I just cringed. Even cringed more when Jean-Claude made passes towards Rosanna Arquette. Indeed there is a very awkward moment where Rosanna Arquette and the daughter in the movie discuss Van Damme's penis size at the dinner table, which then has Kieren Culkin all happy that his mom has seen Jean-Claude's penis. Yecch! It's all just cringe worthy material. With melodrama so leaden in sentiment that it made me want to throw up. Add on a sappy ending and you have what ranks as one of Jean-Claude's worst movies.<br /><br />* out of 4(Bad)
