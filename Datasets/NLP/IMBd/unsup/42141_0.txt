Living there in Morgan City when the movie was filmed in the summer of 1992, we members of the press, at the press conference for this movie, laughed when told what the movie was going to be about. Our local KQKI was quick to point out that if the crew just waited till August, they wouldn't have to make up some of the hurricane scenes. Though everyone laughed, the joke was on Ernest Polk when Andrew slammed into Morgan City after taking out south Florida. Ernest was right. The move was okay but when the real hurricane met some of the sets that were used in the movie, like the Berwick Civic Center, Andrew, quite impolitely, removed roofing off of the walkways and such. If you lived in a trailer before the hurricane, you lived in a shelter after it (residents from Patterson to Amelia, at least). It was the only time I evacuated, ever. I went to Mississippi and watched CNN. The Mayor at the time, Cedric LaFleur really did make Morgan City look like it was a haven for Cajuns with his thick accent. Anyway, I found this on another web site and it does sound like what the Mayor might have said.<br /><br />TWC Meteorologist: Mayor Lafleur, are you concerned that many citizens will stay for the storm or do you believe they will leave early enough to get to safety? Cedric: No, Sha. Iss all gone be okay. We done issued a mandatory evaporation for da hoal city.<br /><br />Public Works Director (off camera in a hushed voice): No. Cedric, that's the wrong word.<br /><br />Cedric: What? Oh..Oh..Yeah, I'm sorry bout dat. I meant ta say we done ejaculated da hoal city, Sha.
