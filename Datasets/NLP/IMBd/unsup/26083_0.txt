I purchased this DVD as it was a Merchant and Ivory Collection piece and hoping for a good Sunday evening bed time view. I wasn't disappointed and the movie generates some beautiful sceneries and life a far with strange paradoxes in a complex Bombay society. The story is quite similar in fashion and form to Red Heat (1988), and the Rush Hour series of movies. The plot is ridiculous and the screenplay rather dull and nothing ever fits together to solve the riddle as you would like to in this movie. But the laughs are a plenty akin to more to the bumbling Inspector Clouseau genre. Acting is better than the screenplay and the chemistry between the two detectives could be better. The DVD is very sparse and why Criterion ever got involved I am not sure. The transfer is disappointing and somewhat grainy.
