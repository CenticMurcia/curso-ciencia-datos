I really wonder why movies like this still come out. Global warming is a #1 issue for years now, at least at the citizens. I guess, if you believe in the danger of the warming, you don't need to watch this. Cause it basically says, what you already know. If you don't believe in gl. warming, you won't watch this movie anyway. The politicians and industry bosses should see this.<br /><br />DiCaprio isn't really doing anything, he just appears every 10-15 minutes to hold a small monologue, but it's clear enough, the movie just needed a famous face to sell it. The whole movie is just 10-15 people standing in front of a dark background and talking. While they are talking, documentary footage is shown. I have to say, after like 20 minutes it became really boring and uninteresting to follow.
