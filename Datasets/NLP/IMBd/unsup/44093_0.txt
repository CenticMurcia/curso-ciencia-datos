Yup! It was pretty bad, though I admit I watched it to the end. Sometimes what is more interesting about a remake is how it reflects current cultural thinking. Just as the 1971 movie added a woman who wasn't in the book (And author Michael Chricton has a real problem with women - you would see this if you read his books.) Now the cast is multi-ethnic and gender diverse. Frankly, I think this is good - by now it would be STRANGE to see a group of doctors be all white men.<br /><br />The conspiracies within conspiracies is more modern too -- all those years of X-files have made their mark.<br /><br />But this would have been a far better movie if it had been an hour shorter -- cut out the alcoholic wife & troubled son of the main character, the love interest, the government conspiracies, and less of the intrepid reporter trying to get the news and the movie could have been decent. <br /><br />In the original story, the focus was on the scientists in the lab trying to find a cure for a constantly mutating organism. The remake should have kept the focus there instead of wandering all over with side plots and much too many scenes of Andromeda in action. (I didn't see the "no animals were harmed in the making of this movie" disclaimer at the end, but I think with what CGI can do today, I'm hoping none were.)
