This film is special. It's everything you could expect from a film shown on the SciFi CHannel, and more. This includes: Bad plot, bad acting, bad writing, and tons of nonsense. I'm talking REALLY stupid stuff. The aspect of this film that appeals to me is this: Every single stupid thing characters have done in bad horror flicks for the past fifty years is compressed into this film in this film. I'm talking a butt-load of clich√©s. I however like the fact that they don't wait till the end of the movie to show you the monster. It was cool when Spielberg did it in Jaws, but now every talentless director thinks it'll give his film suspense, but it's just irritating. This is a great film to watch with your friends and heckle the $#!+ out of. Worse than anything Uwe Boll could have created. Enjoy!
