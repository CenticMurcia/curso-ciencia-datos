This Japanese adaptation of the classic 1970s "Tomb of Dracula" American comic book series is pretty much forgotten today, and it's easy to see why. At 89 minutes, this TV-movie (with the usual fade-ins and outs for commercials) seems made out of several different sagas cobbled together, as Dracula, essentially a good guy here, faces different enemies (from the usual vampire hunters to his own son turned God's agent, to Satanists, to Satan himself, to a new King of the Vampires...) without much character development whatsoever, and through plot holes so big they could contain a whole graveyard each. Plus, it has all the worst characteristics of late 70s films and cartoons, including the obligatory disco soundtrack. The animation is far from the greatest anime films, with fine backgrounds but terribly drawn characters that seem to come out of a Saturday morning cartoon of the era (despite the occasional brief nudity). Not that it has not its interesting points, like a vulnerable Dracula becoming human again and trying to recover his vampiric condition, but everything is so underdeveloped that it's ultimately worthless. Also, I could have done without those shiny fangs, and without that son of Drac right out of Thunderbirds. And, alas, despite it being based on "Tomb of Dracula", no Blade here, just the usual descendants of Van Helsing, Harker, and Dracula himself (and it's obvious from the beginning which one of the vampire hunters will eventually bite the dust). It could have been a good TV-series, but, in its absurd condensation, (sorry for this old awful pun) this Dracula sucks. 3/10.
