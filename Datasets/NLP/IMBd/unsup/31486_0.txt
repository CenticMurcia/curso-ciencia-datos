Lets see it starts out with this whole "Troy-ish" Battle directly lifted out n copied or even remade to an extent..<br /><br />then we go into the actual movie.. the essence of the movie was totally lost in my sense, The director lost me at least because of the length of the movie.. maybe he wanted to convey something great through his research but frankly what he did was nothing more than inflict pain... that was something i was hoping to forget by watching the movie...<br /><br />Hrithik Roshan continues to amaze me till date with his varied acting talents n Mrs Aishwarya Rai.. lets just say that i don't very much care for what she does... 99% of it is crap anyway ....<br /><br />But this is my opinion go watch the movie and make up your own
