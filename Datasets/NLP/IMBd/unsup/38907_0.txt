Now I would just like to comment on how the last person kinda missed the point of this movie. Firts off the main character , a 17 year old boy has come to live in CANADA not the U.S (one of the professors in the institute even say "If you can't find a coaching job here, how you going to find one in the states). He comes to live in Canada because his mother has died and is living with a supposed friend of his father who has a family on his own.The movie has a couple twists and turns that make it feel like a 2 hour soap opera instead of a movie.The movie starts off alright but at the end becomes quite ridiculous. Also many shots (no pun intended) were not taken well in this movie.For example the coach tells Tomasso to take a free quick, and he kicks the ball and you can tell it goes over the net,but the next shot makes it look like it went directly into the net in the most bizarre angle.
