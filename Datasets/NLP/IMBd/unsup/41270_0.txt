I really tried to like this film - an excellent ensemble cast and technically well-shot, however the addition of the US scenes (credited as being shot in Kentucky) appeared to be stuck on simply to provide US 'appeal'. There appeared to be no sophistication of the plot - and it simply boils down to; Jocket gets cancer, his horse tears a ligament and may be put down. Therapy for both before eventual recovery, and both win the Grand National at Aintree. Even Edward Woodward didn't appear to be overstretching himself, and whether you could believe John Hurt as a successful jockey with his size of frame requires a massive leap of faith. It just hasn't stood the test of time, and it's re-release on DVD may gain a few extra viewers, but if there's a car to wash or dog to walk, your time may be better spent doing these task instead.
