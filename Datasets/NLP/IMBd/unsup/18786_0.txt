I really felt Dirty last night, so I revisited this film along with The Gauntlet and Magnum Force. Sometimes, you just need to immerse yourself into the world of "Dirty" Harry to remember what life is all about.<br /><br />There are sheep and there are goats. Most of us are sheep, but we need goats like Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) to remind us that "...if you want to jerk all these people off, you can, but don't do it with me." Too often, we go along like sheep while the bureaucrats do their song and dance. Nothing gets accomplished, and people get hurt.<br /><br />I am not a big Tyne Daly fan, but she really did a good job as Harry's partner. Bradford Dillman, who will be back with a different name in Sudden Impact, was perfect as the toady who would kiss any butt to get promoted.<br /><br />Lots of action, and the heart of "Dirty" Harry shines through the rough exterior again.
