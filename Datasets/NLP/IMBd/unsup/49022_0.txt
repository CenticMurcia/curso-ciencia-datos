Bearing in mind the directors and cast involved, Four Rooms was a huge disappointment. Tim Roth gives a bizarre central performance which, rather than coming across as quirky, is simply irritating. Robert Rodriguez' slapstick section is best by a mile, followed by Tarantino's contribution, but the rest is extremely unfunny and rather tedious. One to avoid, unfortunately.
