The word is pervasive in our everyday life. Even so, there are times when I find it offensive. Scarface comes to mind.<br /><br />Where did the word come from? It certainly isn't Fornicate Under Consent of the King. No one really knows. It has been around for hundreds of years.<br /><br />How the word has evolved, especially after the World Wars and has interjected itself into every aspect of culture was fascinating.<br /><br />You can side with George Carlin or Pat Boone & Alan Keyes. The film is an interesting exploration of free speech and censorship. After all, when the "seven dirty words" were broadcast in New York, out of the millions of people that heard it, only one complained. Yet, the government sides with the one over the many. The statistics of pre-and post Bush ere will show how the religious Reich has taken over society. It should disgust you more than the word.<br /><br />If nothing else, you will get a lot of laughs from the many commentators, and a great website to visit.
