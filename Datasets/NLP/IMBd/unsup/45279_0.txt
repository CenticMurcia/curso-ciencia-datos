The reason why many people seem to adore this film alludes me. They claim that it is one of the best action films ever; it is not. They claim that it is original; it is not. They claim it is a masterpiece; it most definitely is not.<br /><br />This movie was not poorly made at all...it just is completely tasteless, lacking in originality, lacking in good action...basically it is lacking in everything that makes a movie good.<br /><br />First of all there is the plot. People leave woman for dead, and she comes back for revenge. That's about it.<br /><br />The action scenes are lame. When I go to see movies with sword fights, I expect good sword action. Kill Bill does not have good sword action. During the main fight scene, all that is shown is peoples' feet falling off. Now I don't know about most people, but I don't consider that good action. I expect clashing swords, skilled combatants, and cool fighting, not people who can't fight pretending that they can.<br /><br />There is nothing original about Kill Bill at all. Tarantino took old action movies from the seventies and copied everything about them. It isn't like he put a new spin on anything, basically he copied everything about those older movies, only he did so without the skill and experience required to pull it off well.<br /><br />If this movie had been made by anybody other than Quentin Tarantino, it would have been long forgotten...hell it wouldn't have even made it to theaters.<br /><br />Tarantino has done so much better in his earlier movies than he did with Kill Bill. What Tarantino was most praised for was the high-energy, witty dialogue that pervaded his earlier efforts, unfortunately in Kill Bill, the dialogue, when there is dialogue, downright sucks.<br /><br />Overall, I was completely disappointed in Kill Bill. More than that, I was offended that I was led to believe that I was going to see an actually good movie, which Kill Bill is not.
