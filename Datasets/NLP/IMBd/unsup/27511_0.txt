The word "menagerie" just happened to come up in a conversation(unrelated to show business) and reminded me of this story. So later,while casually browsing the web, it occurred to me that very title of Tennessee William's play probably had much to do with adding that item to our general vocabulary. Defined as an assortment of animals, the expression here takes on both literal and figurative meanings that sort of intertwine throughout the screenplay. I have yet to see the Glass Menagerie performed live, and really have nothing much more to say now about the motion picture versions, except that further commentary may very well be forthcoming since my mind has been activated on the subject more than ever before thanks to websites like this. Feel free to check the few other brief impromptu reviews I'vesubmitted to get some idea what to expect.
