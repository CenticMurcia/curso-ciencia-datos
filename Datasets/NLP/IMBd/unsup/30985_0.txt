I saw this film at the Atlanta Film Festival (June 12, 2005). When the final frame of this film went to black, my instant reaction was my lips mouthing the word "Wow" -- and I mean that in the absolute best of all possible connotations. I have never had a film reach me like this before -- in this way and so deeply. Some of the reviews have talked about how this film reaches viewers on a visceral level. Very, very true. It goes straight to the heart, straight to the soul, straight to the core of your being. It soars straight passed that part of us that analyzes and articulates. Some articles about the film have suggested that audiences might feel drained or exhausted from watching it. I didn't leave the film exhausted or drained. Mesmerized is probably a better description of how I felt. I was completely absorbed in the film from the first frame through the final one. Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly exceptional film, and Damian Lewis delivers a truly outstanding performance in the title role. If anyone ever seeks an example of an empirically perfect match of actor, role and story, this is it. Keane is an amazingly wonderful film experience that I will never, ever forget. I am immensely grateful to count myself among those who have had the fortune to see this film. If you have the chance to see Keane, see it.
