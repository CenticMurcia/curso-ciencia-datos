to whom this may concern ; i've seen the annihilator movie many time since it's release in 1986 . my favorite parts of this movie are when the lead android was first seen behind that log cabin home when she tried to attack the male actor's role managed to turn the tables on her and he terminated her by nearly running her over with the jeep that he drove. he also terminated the other android by shooting her in the face with a shotgun and knocking some 10 feet to the floor and in the process knocking one of her red eyes right out of her head. well that's all for now and later in the movie a female cyborg was crushed on a wall by another cyborg that malfunctioned .<br /><br />but can you answer this one question for me . i'd like to know what special visual and makeup effects were used in this made for t.v.movie that gave it the realism. i'd really like to know your insights on this.
