Be forewarned! This is a propaganda piece against abortion. My uncle sends me a link to this movie in every email he sends me. Now mind you, I'm not in the market to have an abortion but I'm not sure that a bunch of strangers should be regulating what I do with my body. The movie is well made; you can tell they've spent a lot of money on the aesthetic. And the actors all seem well-qualified and committed to what they are doing...as actors and not just as mouth pieces for a specific agenda. If you are intrigued about this movie...then you should see it. I just don't think people should get suckered into sitting through something so heavy-handed.
