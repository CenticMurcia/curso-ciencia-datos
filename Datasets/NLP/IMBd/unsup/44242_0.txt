Apart from the wooden acting, the heavy-handed direction, the vapid dialogue, farcical 'action' scenes and the incredulous plot, this movie was the worst film I've seen in a long, long time. Given a choice between stabbing myself repeatedly with a pen and watching this movie again, I'll take the pen.
