What can be said about this movie that has not already been said? I love this movie. In fact it is my favorite movie. Kevin Smith is a genius. He did this this perfectly the minute it hits the 37 scene it is complete gold. Randel is one of the funniest characters ever. And in this movie we are introduced to View Askews most memorable characters Jay and Silent Bob. This is a fantastic movie one of the greatest independent movies ever. And the premiere of a great comic mind writer/directer Kevin Smith. I have yet to find a person that disagrees with me. I highly recommend this movie. Everyone should see it. 9/10 amazing movie.
