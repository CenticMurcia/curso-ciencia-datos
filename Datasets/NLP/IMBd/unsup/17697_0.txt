Sadsentinelwings , I enjoyed your review. Anyone reading your review who are not consumers of metal, will learn that this topic could easily be discussed and debated on any of those Sunday morning political round-table television shows.<br /><br />That being said, I'm surprised you didn't identify prog metal as a non-metal sub genre. Personally, I love prog metal, especially many of the bands that have emerged from Europe. I hear metal fans (mostly American fans) all the time lament that prog metal isn't true metal. A dark metal fan or power metal fan would claim that prog metal really can't be considered as metal, due to each band member's perspective, motivation, fashion sense and musically elitist attitude; similar to the way that the 70's punks viewed Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Pink Floyd. Personally, I really don't care if its metal or not. Still an interesting discussion.<br /><br />I would have love to see the prog scene explored. Certainly Mike Portnoy or Daniel Gildenlow would have much more to contribute to the discussion than Rob Zombie or Dee Snyder ever could. Besides, all the footage of the concert audience got old. Some of it could have been trimmed and replaced with a discussion of prog metal and how it differs in both positive and negative ways.<br /><br />Though I do agree with you on every criticism, I agree that it is one of the best documentaries I've seen. Certainly far better than any of those metal documentaries on VH1, which are truly horrible.
