This is hilariously bad,which is some sort of reason to bother seeing it.The charisma free O'Keefe struggles to play an Arthurian knight, Sir Gawain, but no more so than the rest of a distinguished cast, including Sean Connery as the Green Knight.Connery looks embarrassed throughout, as well he might. It is a mishmash of Arthurian legend, medieval history and myth quite lavishly shot, but the giveaway is the producers - the Golem Brothers, makers of more cinematic rubbish than probably anybody else in the history of cinema, providers of homes for actors on the slide. Connery's career was in one of its troughs at the time. The miracle is he climbed out of it to become the sexiest man in the world. Not even Michael Caine could have made a worse career choice.
