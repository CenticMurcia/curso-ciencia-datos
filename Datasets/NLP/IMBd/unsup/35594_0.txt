I'm a big fan of Laura Linney and think she's one of the most interesting actresses around, but this film is a disaster and so is she. Very depressing. But the movie lost me with Linney's very first scene in which she introduces herself as "Mrs. X." Mrs. X? Why in heaven's name would any character in a film be called Mrs. X? I thought it was a joke and laughed. But then I realized that was her character's name and that would be her name throughout the film. I just couldn't believe it. I could not imagine why the producers would allow such a thing. It knocked the very bottom out of the film for me. But I kept watching so see if it had any saving grace and discovered it did not - at all. The script stunk - no two ways about it. It's too bad because the book was big and had lots of fans but this movie did not live up to the book and should have been made by someone else. The pair behind it simply did not know how to deal with the material they had.
