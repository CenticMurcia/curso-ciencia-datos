I had heard about this film and that it was supposed to be a comedy and an alternate history. I'm fairly open minded and don't like to judge a book by its cover...or by other people's review of the book...so I decided to get the movie from Netflix and check it out for myself.<br /><br />Now Mr. Willmott is a professor of film at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. With this knowledge I expected an interesting piece of work...well, I guess you could say interesting if you were really stretching for a definition in this case.<br /><br />If this is an example of what a film professor is teaching his students...I pity his pupils. Willmott can't make a good film to save his life. At this point, I'm not speaking of the content, I'm speaking of the directorial style...or lack there of. The movie was poorly made. I've seen better fan films made with VHS.<br /><br />Now, on to historical accuracy...or inaccuracy.<br /><br />Willmott is full of crap. I don't know where he gets off making a film like this. Comedy? I think not. It takes a lot to get me riled up but this film hit all the right buttons.<br /><br />I'm a Southerner first of all and I don't appreciate the gross inaccuracies that Willmott made in this film. Yeah, I know it is supposed to be fiction, but blatant lies and obvious racism on his part do nothing to make our country better. On the contrary, it makes the situation worse by filling peoples heads with blatant mis-reporting of history and human attitudes towards slavery.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on him attributing the slash and burn policy of Sherman to Genereal Lee...and also his gross misrepresentation of George Washington.<br /><br />His assertion in the film is that if the South would have won the War of Northern Aggression (AKA the American Civil War) that we (as a nation) would still be condoning slavery...not out of a need for inexpensive labor (which is a fallacy in its self), but out of a sentiment for the ways of the Old South. Slaves weren't cheap in the 1860's...hell, they never were...but if you take his perspective on slavery you'd be lead to believe that everyone below the Mason-Dixon line had 3 or 4 slaves to take care of a 3 bedroom ranch home.<br /><br />Additionally, his idea of a Slave Shopping Network on cable TV is not laughable, but is totally absurd. To make it even more atrocious, his speculation of a Confederate peace pact with Nazi Germany is even more nonsensical.<br /><br />This man may have studied film, but he is no student of history...and is obviously no scholar on human behavior, technology's influence on the American Industrial Revolution or other issues that would have caused the natural extinction of slavery in the US...even without the War of Northern Aggression. He also fails to note that the Confederate Constitution itself outlawed the slave trade in the confederacy.<br /><br />Willmott's overlapping of the institution of slavery and the ideas of racism just add to the confusion and lies propagated by this "work". This film does nothing to heal the wounds of racism...it merely rubs salt in them and undoes much good that has been done by much better men such as MLK Jr. and others who strived and died to help make our country a better place than it has been in the past.<br /><br />Please Mr. Willmott...step away from the camera. You are dangerous.
