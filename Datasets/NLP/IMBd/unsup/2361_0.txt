The only interesting thing about this movie is seeing the original cast members after all these years. There is also a neat flashback sequence, with footage shot for the first film, but not seen before. A bunch of seemingly unrelated would-be scary scenes plod along aimlessly towards a big explosion at the end. (Was that a spoiler?) The oblique origin of "The Tall Man" is just more meaningless stuff. The first movie was a unique experience, the sequels have been pretty bad. Give it up guys.
