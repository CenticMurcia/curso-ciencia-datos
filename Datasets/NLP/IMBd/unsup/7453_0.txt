Steven Seagal has come out with an array of DTV titles since 2003's The Foreigner and none since then have been very successful in winning over many action fans. As a hardcore fan, I personally have been mildly disappointed in Steve's stuff of late (mainly Out Of Reach, Submerged and Black Dawn) due to uses of voice dubbing, fight doubles and very flat plots, which is why Mercenary For Justice is an exception.<br /><br />The plot is very simple: group of mercenaries are betrayed on a mission by their boss, mercenaries are then blackmailed into taking another mission, mercenaries get mad, mercenaries get even.<br /><br />What separates MFJ from Seagal's last couple is the obviously improved production values, the opening battle sequence looks almost as good as your average war film (not forgetting the uncanny over the top ability of all protagonists to hit their targets with extreme precision). Seagal doesn't appear to be dubbed and performs 95% of his own stunts and fights, which is a breath of fresh air for this fan (and for most I would imagine). He looks like he's having fun with this movie and works well with his supporting actors. A very big mention must go to Roger Guenveur Smith who plays Chapel, his character is so ridiculously over the top that its almost impossible not to like him.<br /><br />All in all, MFJ is an great, fun action movie and Steven Seagal's best since Into The Sun.
