some good gory scenes, otherwise the continuity, and other factors concerning the production sux.<br /><br />the actors are kinda bad...<br /><br />the plot if there is one is not that great =D it reminded me of a porn flick =D if there were no gore, this movie would not be watchable.<br /><br />i little boring i guess...<br /><br />i was reading a book, while watching this one... and i watched just the parts with the gore.<br /><br />this movie is definitely not a winner, but i've seen worse, unless you have really nothing else to do, then you can watch.<br /><br />oh lord the radio part is real crappy =D
