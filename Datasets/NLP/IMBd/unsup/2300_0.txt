I was 10 when I fell in love with Errol Flynn watching this film on TV; more than 30 years later, he's still a hottie [grin]. Sorry, Kevin Costner & all the other pretenders--this is the only & only Robin Hood, & Olivia DeHavilland, the only & most ladylike Maid Marian. Flynn manages to look "all-man" in tights, & in every athletic move he makes. Basil Rathbone, later to play Sherlock Holmes in films of the 1940's, resplendent in a red and gold surcoat, plays Robin Hood's worthy adversary, & he was also adept at fencing in RL. Claude Rains as a subtle & conniving Prince John, a performance appreciated more & more on each viewing.
