"Toolbox Murders", while being interpreted as a "remake" of an earlier film with the same name, is given a powerful upgrade and the story shines thanks to the duties of fright master Tobe Hooper. There is something "wrong" with the overrated and creepy looking "Lusman Arms" apartment complex. For years, this old place has been catering to the best Hollywood has to offer, but now, it seems that the "Arms" has been caught up in controversy as well as strange hammering sounds heard in the night. For many who live here, it will not be a heavenly voyage to the stars and screens. The guests who live here are a beautiful struggling actress, an actor going into his most recent audition, a former overweight woman, a dysfunctional family and their brainy son, and a newly married young couple. Our married youngsters have had stormy money problems and have moved into the decrepit housing project. While the husband is out "on call" usually at his place of business, the hospital, his wife Nell(played well by Angela Bettis) is left at home, usually scared by the continuous "knocking" noises and drilling. As she is finding clues to find out what is going on, her neighbors are systematically slaughtered, drilled, and hammered by a masked man who somehow lives in the bowels of the building. Here is where we find Hooper at his best. We go through caverns and unknown tunnels, not knowing what we will reach. He has approached this "exploring the unknown" in several films including "The Funhouse", "Poltergeist", and of course, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Toolbox" really brings us back to the classic form of screen terror we have longed for since we traveled to "Salem's Lot", which was also masterfully done by Hooper. If you thought Tobe Hooper was done with you, think again and give this "power driller killer" a spin. There's always a vacancy at The Lusman.
