This movie was a major disappointment, but with a fantastic cast. I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie, but I wanted to throw it out the window when I came across the first scene of the dead animals. It was Unnecessary to see Bobby (Sean Penn) running over an animal. Was that needed? Grace (Jennifer Lopez) got on my nerves, didn't like her at all, the performance from Jennifer Lopez weren't all that great either. This movie all in all, was boring. What was good about it? Only one thing, Toby (Joaquin Phoenix) and Jenny (Claire Danes). The only form of entertainment of this Movie. Joaquin surprised me with his small, but outstanding performance. Joaquin and Claire - YOU MADE THE MOVIE! Only with 3 scenes Unfortunately. Otherwise this movie made me sick. It was degrading. I gave it a 3. That goes to Joaquin and Claire!
