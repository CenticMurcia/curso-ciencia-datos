Having learnt of the author, I started reading her blogs which was very interesting. It got me thinking about wanting to read her books. But, me being me!! LAZY... decided to watch the film instead. And was I disappointed? And how. Well, there is nothing more to this film than what the posters have to offer. Sheer EYE CANDY. That is it!! My regards to the ever so beautiful Lisa Ray and also Sheetal Seth. An issue of being gay in sensitive religious families, as the director felt it should be portrayed seems to look very unimportant. The passionate scenes in the film, is far from being romantic. Expected a lot more romance from a director who is herself gay. Shamim, if you yourself do ever read this, do write to me and I will assist you in making better films.<br /><br />my email id: rite2ron@gmail.com
