Pretty Baby is based on the diaries of a woman named Violet who grew up in the brothels of New Orleans. It is also based on the story of Ernest J. Bellocq, a photographer who worked in the same area.<br /><br />There have been numerous reviews written about the film and it's controversial subject matter. Violet is born into a brothel just like her mother and it is here that she enters into the profession herself.<br /><br />I would just like to say that the film is my favorite because of the atmosphere and the way the film is shot. We are voyeurs here. Watching a small window of time involving the people of this brothel in 1919. The sets and costumes all are perfectly done reminding one of an old oil painting. Muted colors, drapes, carpets, couches and ornate wall dressings all add to the mood of the film and you can't take your eyes off of it.<br /><br />People looking for an action film are not going to enjoy this at all. But if you enjoy thoughtful period pieces you will probably enjoy this despite the subject matter.<br /><br />I've watched it probably 50 times and dig it out once a year to enjoy it.
