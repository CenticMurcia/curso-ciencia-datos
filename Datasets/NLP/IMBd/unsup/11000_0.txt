Some time back I was channel surfing and came across this film on satellite. I came in after the beginning and knew that I had missed the prologue. I waited to see it again but I could no longer find it. I now own a DVD of it.<br /><br />When I was the age of either male stars I did not have those problems. My parents had no control over my wanderings as I told them lies. They left me alone. I had many trysts and enjoyed them. I had many partners in the military but never picked up a trick from being in a communal shower. My partners had to be special. By that I mean he had to be intelligent but not necessarily physically attractive.<br /><br />I am a senior citizen and the object of my affection is only 27. He is well educated and extremely handsome. On a few occasions he eye kissed me. I pulled away due to our age difference. What can I do?
