If you loved the original 1984 'COTC', you may take a while to realise how awful this futile sequel is.<br /><br />Reporters begin to flood the town of Gatlin where the children murdered all of their parents some years ago. The bodies are discovered and the children of Gatlin are cared for by the adults of a neighbouring town. But the adults don't realise that the children are planning another massacre.<br /><br />Rather than concentrating on their acting skills, the lead males in the film (Terence Knox and Paul Scherrer) seem to be trying their hardest not to move a single facial muscle in their head for the duration of filming. The completely random death sequences in the film are there to give you a giggle at the fun death methods these mentally-challenged children use, whereas they could have just shot them.<br /><br />You can actually simulate watching this film at no expense by sitting in front of a blank TV screen and repeatedly poking a finger in each eye for an hour and a half.
