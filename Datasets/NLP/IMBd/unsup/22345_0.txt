At first I thought aliens in prehistoric times; this is going to be one hell of a non-sense. I was very pleasantly surprised though. There is no hi-tech jargon or far-fetched sci-fi plot, everything is neat and straight to the point. And the most importantly there is no meaningless dialogue or cool stupid one-liners.<br /><br />Kainan (James Caviezel) lands on Earth in his chase of an alien monster which killed his family. The year is something hundred BC, there is nothing superhuman or extraordinary about him, armed just with a gun version of a lightsaber , soon he is captured by the local tribe. The prehistoric people are nothing out of the ordinary either-a wooden fortress, animal-skin clad villagers and monarch based ruling system. I really liked the political element in the tribe's interactions with the opposing tribe and the logical tactical choices made by its leaders. It comes to show that politics in its essence is just a plain and simple common sense for the people's well-being.<br /><br />The two fighting tribes eventually join forces against the common evil-a pretty red illuminated monster that kills and eats everything on its way. The monster is CGI but it is given almost a human name Moorwen, I have to admit very well done CGI. It blends very well with the rest of the sequences and the monster itself is quite original. All the encounters with it are really gory, though, so I do not recommend it for the faint-hearted. There is the must-have love story as well, between the outlander and the daughter of the king of the tribe, who eventually took over his throne after the monster, killed him mercilessly. There is a little cameo from Ron Perlman doing what he does best as a ferocious leader of the opposing tribe, i.e. acting really tough.<br /><br />This movie has everything you want in one Â–aliens, great action sequences, politics, pretty female, romance with the pretty female, a bit of gory horror and a happy ending with an inevitable casualty of a loved one-what not to like?
