I went to the movie theater to watch 'The Prince of Egypt' and the money I spent was very well used,because it is a great movie and one of my favorites from Dreamworks!(And look,I am not catholic or Jew) We have, in this great story, two brothers: one is Egyptian and with royal blood(Ramses),and the other one an orphan with a mysterious past(Moises). They are best friends and they have a great life in their palace,with strong bonds. But when Moises is so arrogant as his brother Ramses,but one night, when he was walking alone at night after searching for a woman(Tzipporah) Miriam and Aaron met with him and are surprised to see their little brother so close. Moises cannot believe that he is not royal and stays angry with Miriam, but stays in doubt after some while, and reading the walls of the pyramid, he discovers the true: that he has Jew blood and was adopted. Angry and thinking that everything he always imagined to be true were illusions, he run away and starts a new life as shepherd and even marrying Tzipporah. But now he has a new mission in his life(sent by God), that is to help his people (The Jews) to not be slaves anymore and go to the Promise Land. But he will need to confront his brother Ramses in this battle, and this will not be an easy thing...
