Ok, so it's difficult to make a film with very little money. And with all of the straight to video films by this and that rap star, it's probably near impossible to make a film that doesn't showcase ghetto issues.<br /><br />But that's no excuse for such a bad film. When you don't Hav Plenty of money, the one thing you can still do is write a good story. This one is terrible.<br /><br />Hav Plenty lacks a coherent story; the actors, while hype about their screen debut, are uninspired and apathetic; the characters make gross judgments despite being undeveloped; the main character, while apathetic in a curiously nihlistic way, is both passive and unemotional.<br /><br />The dialogue is bad. (I didn't know we talked that way.)Further, while the movie is deemed 'positive'--I guess because nobody gets killed--the dialogue actually reveals the writer's disturbing assumptions about Black women and their view of self.<br /><br />Lastly, while props go out to Christopher Scott Cherot, for accomplishing the Van Peebles-ian task of writing, directing, editing and starring in his own film; Hav Plenty also suffered from the Van Peebles-ian lack of focus, direction and story development in a film that they write, direct and star in.<br /><br />I hope that next time he decides to do just one job--either write or direct.<br /><br />And I hope he does it well.<br /><br />R<br /><br />
