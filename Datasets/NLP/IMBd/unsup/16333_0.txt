Loved it! I hope the upbeat feel of the film will attract audiences away from so much of the downer energy out there. People can get so jaded and cynical about feel-good fairy-tale romances. The story-line was fantastically unraveled and handled. This was a refreshing change.<br /><br />Its a film that represents many people's lives (family, culture, sex and religion). So many films that deal with gay culture build on a huge foundation of shame. This kind of film helps ethnic minorities feel more comfortable about their sexuality. Its pioneering films like this that turn the concept of shame-about-sexuality, upside down. Easily on par with Bend It Like Beckham, yet so different from other East/West films. Cooking and food theme was wonderful - very cleverly done. It did capture the Bollywood escapism and the feel good factor. And the acting was superb! Really enjoyed Suman. <br /><br />And our family belted out singing along to the soundtrack which we are looking forward to buying.
