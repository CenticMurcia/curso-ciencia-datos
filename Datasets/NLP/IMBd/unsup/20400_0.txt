Laurence Harvey stars as a win at all costs chess champion in "The Most Dangerous Match," one of the original Columbo episodes. Harvey, number one at the game only because of the illness of the Russian champion (Jack Kruschen) the year before, panics when he plays a practice match with Kruschen and realizes that this year, he will lose his title. He then plots to get rid of his opponent, only to run afoul of the sloppy lieutenant on the case, Columbo.<br /><br />Harvey is wonderful in the role, a perfect villain for Columbo because he is so opposite -- arrogant, beautifully spoken, and immaculately dressed. He's also brilliant, but he doesn't recognize brilliance in someone posing a greater threat to him than the deceased chess champion - Columbo. Very entertaining.
