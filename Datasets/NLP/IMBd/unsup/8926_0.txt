I've never watched a Zombie movie I didn't enjoy to some degree. That all changed last week when I watched Mulberry Street. I kept wanting to turn it off because the whole "Rat Zombie" thing was really stupid, but I kept watching, not wanting to admit to myself I just wasted 15 bucks. Bad acting and a painfully slow and sloppy plot ruined it. I think they tried way too hard to make the film artsy and give it an indy vibe, but instead it came across as very amateurish. The idea of a disease being spread via rats is a nice, historically accurate addition to the zombie sub genre, but the victims turning into rats? How stupid is that? I did have a few ideas for a sequel, though: the disease is spread by kittens and victims transform into big, cuddly kittens that like to play and frolic instead of eating human flesh. Or maybe the disease is spread via the Olsen twins and everyone becomes anorexic cocaine addicts that still eat human flesh but then promptly vomit it back up so their re-animated asses don't get fat.
