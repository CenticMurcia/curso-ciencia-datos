This is a great investigation into the challenge of having a merely sexual relationship with someone without letting emotions come into it. But, eventually emotions come into it because sex is more than just the release of biological urges. The two main characters Josh and Cin are perfectly portrayed by their players David and Susie. I'm sure they would have put a bit of themselves into their roles. The toughest part would have been filming the sex scenes and for the director filming the scenes without a hint of pornography. My rating: 8/10
