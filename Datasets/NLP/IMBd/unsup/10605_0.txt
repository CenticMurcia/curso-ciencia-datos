Being a big fan of such of such classics as Knight Rider, The A-Team and Magnum, I would like anyone who has not ever seen this series to know that it is great! At the time of writing this, "Renegade" only appears to have one review and it is not a good one? Watch for yourself before believing any negative reviews of this series. This is the first ever Region 1 DVD that I've had to import to the UK as it's that good! Buy it now! Lorenzo Lamas is a brilliant actor and superb martial artist. The only problem this series ever had was lack of exposure which probably killed it off much the same way as "Tropical Heat". Think of it as a modern day Knight Rider but without the Sci-Fi of KITT and a hero who is one of the best fighters ever. Combine that with the constant threat of police capture (much like the A-Team) and you have "Renegade". Another absolutely classic series by Stephen J Cannell.
