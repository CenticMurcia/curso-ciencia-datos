Before I begin, let me remind you not to take all of the comments written above %100 seriously. This movie has a very special, very niche target audience. And I BELONG TO THAT GROUP. For all my life, very ezoteric people laughed at my jokes, and accepted me as a true friend. I, in turn, worked damn hard through all my life and have been eraning six figure income for 3 years now. Yes, I am alone, but I have the money. So I know what rich people laugh at. This magnificent piece of art is offering the audience such level of sophisticated material that only a niche group that I belong can appreciate. I menioned my income level before, and don't think that I am high or whatever and what I say don't make sense. I am one of the most important customers of #2(in revenue) casino in Vegas, so I can appreciate all the ironic messages and can get the insights communicated in this briiant masterpiece. This movie has love, this movie has fear, this movie has the what it takes to stimulate your most inner forces to move the world around. Just see it and your life will change. But first visit Vegas and work hard enough to earn a 6 figure annual income. and also don't forget to thank to God who give people courage and faith to shoot this movie.
