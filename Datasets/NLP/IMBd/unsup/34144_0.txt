Leonardo. You must have seen the acclaimed documentary "design-e2"On PBS. Look for their new upcoming series. The edit and story far exceeds your film. An Al Gore remake is not a smart thing to do.Even if you bring solutions. (Al Gore failed in this). Google; design-e2.com Or go to; kontentreal.com See you on the big screen.You are a great actor. Your intentions are good as well. But Hollywood is a bit to much for me these days. Narration for documentary is fine. Self promotion like Mr.Gore is too much. Also there is so much more that we are learning on a daily basis (Facts) you could have included in your film that were not seen. Anyhow, Nice try but a bit to much like packaging and finalizing a ongoing problem. Kind regards.<br /><br />Rob Stella.
