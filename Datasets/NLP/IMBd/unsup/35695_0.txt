In my opinion this is, quite simply, the worst series ever made. How it even has the nerve to call itself comedy is beyond me. Maybe, to get swans like Fawlty and Python, you have to go through ugly ducklings like this, but I sure wish we'd never heard of Grace Brothers.<br /><br />It was part of an unfortunate trend in the UK for shows where you always knew what the first words out of a character's mouth would be, followed by an explosion of canned laughter from what I can only assume was a lobotomized audience. Some have compared it to the 'Carry On' movies and, while there is a superficial resemblance to the worst of them, this series outstrips 'em all by a country mile for sheer unfunniness.<br /><br />Unbelievably, it was the most popular comedy series on British TV at one time, and ran for a mind-boggling 10 seasons. Eleven too many for me.
