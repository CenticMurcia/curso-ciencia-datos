How can a movie be so stupid, so unbelievably stupid, as to have Heather Thomas in a major role, then not give her more screen time??<br /><br />Can you tell I'm a fan of hers?<br /><br />I'm no fan of "Zapped!", though. Everyone's an idiot in this movie, and those who aren't end up looking stupid sooner or later. <br /><br />You see, Baio plays a high school nerd who gets special telepathic powers thanks to this concoction he makes up in chem class. With these powers, he can either make the world a better place by ending war, disease and famine... or just use it to rig ball games, roulette wheels and pop open Heather's blouse. <br /><br />Guess which road he takes?<br /><br />Come on, it's an '80s movie, dude!<br /><br />At least Baio and Aames worked well enough together here to star together in TV's "Charles in Charge" later on. <br /><br />As far as everything else goes: bad special effects, bad script, bad judgment to use old fogies like Baio as high school students, VERY BAD under-use of Heather Thomas. And bad use of Felice Schachter.<br /><br />Who's Felice Schachter?<br /><br />Exactly.<br /><br />Two stars. One for Heather, and an extra one just to give her moral support for this ordeal.<br /><br />It's okay, Heather. we're here for you.
