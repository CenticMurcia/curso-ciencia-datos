I've just watched this film, PRACTICAL MAGIC. My perspective is the following: Having not read the book, but having read a number of 'user comments' who have, there's no doubt that the script veers considerably from the thrust of the book. Perhaps this explains why there were considerable leaps from reality, hoping the viewer would not mind the 'jumps & jerks' from what was supposed to be a realistic 'peek' at the unique world of 'witches' even though they be of good heart and purpose. Just look at the conclusion (one user/viewer said it was somewhat like Disney's approach) as an example. There no doubt is a 'dark' side to witchcraft, as well as a lighter side, both of which produce their own consequences, which it seemed this story line was trying to present. The romantic side for some reason, was unconvincing, which I'm not sure was Aidan Quinn's problem; this was likely caused by the script. Stories such as this fail to bring in other religious perspectives such as, IF THERE ARE WITCHES, ISN'T IT LIKELY THAT THERE IS GOD AS WELL, supposed to be the ultimate supreme power and being? Wether you are Jewish, Christian, Muslim or any other who believes in an ultimately supreme being, dealing with any form of supernatural power without including 'the supreme being' in the formula of the story, really is quite without credibility. I gave it a 4.
