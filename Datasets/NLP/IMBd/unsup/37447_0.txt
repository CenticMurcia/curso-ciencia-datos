Jamie-Lynn Sigler stars in the story of some friends on a road trip who run afoul of an escaped mental patient who was sent away for killing several people at a haunted house ride on the Jersey shore. By the book and by the numbers story of the sort that hasn't been made in the last twenty years. With echoes to House of 1000 Corpses, Funhouse and other similarly set films this is the sort of thing that we've all seen before, assuming we've been watching horror films for an period of time. Is it bad? no not really, but its far from gripping simply because its so similar to stuff we've seen before. There are some flashes in this film of what might have been-shots small sequences or an odd twist- that signal what might have been. Worth a look on cable (it runs frequently on SCIFI) I wouldn't go out of my way to look for it. This is the weakest, or perhaps the most disappointing of the four 8 Films to Die For from the first year that I've seen.
