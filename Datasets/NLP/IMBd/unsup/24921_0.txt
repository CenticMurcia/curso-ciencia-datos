You will be amazed at the just how bad a film should you see this film. There is not a single fade or dissolve used for scene transitions in the entire film. It is amazing that in the middle of a scene people turn, the scene cuts and -- bang! -- we are transported in time and space. It takes a minute or two to figure out where we are. But it gets worse... you will find that Grieg, now matter what you think of his music, is hardly suitable for slapping a few words on top and pretending it's a pretty song.<br /><br />I'm afraid the actors aren't all that good either. The lead, Toralv Maurstad, has a course voice and stiff acting style. When his friend George (Bernard Archard) sings about the beauty of Norway, he stares as if dead. Florence looks so very young, and she does have a very nice voice. She's the high point to the cast.<br /><br />The shots of Norway, while picturesque, are just crammed into scenes that are ridiculous. Even Sound of Music motivates the exterior shots, but not this film. We just cut in the middle of a scene and show a pretty waterfall or a goat. Yes, a goat is cut between a musical number and a conversation with two actors. I think this may be a comment on the song, but it could reflect on the acting.<br /><br />Overall this is one ugly film and the only compelling reason is either to torment your friends and family or to take a look at Florence Henderson as a young woman. Otherwise ... rent something else.
