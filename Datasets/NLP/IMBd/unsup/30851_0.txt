...lord have mercy!!! This could just be the worst movie I have ever seen. 80 minutes of my life down the drain. Yes, 80 minutes, I left before the damn thing ended, I had to. Worn out sex jokes, crappy plot (an Israeli secret service agent goes to USA to become a hairdresser ?!?), to put it in one word - S*!T! I love Adam Sandler, but this is too much, I can't understand how he agreed to do this garbage in the first place. I didn't expect much from this movie, but on the other hand I didn't expect this little either. Yes, this IS the worst movie I have ever seen. EVER. And I have a feeling it will remain the worst. Mr. Dugan, Uwe Boll is an amateur compared to you...
