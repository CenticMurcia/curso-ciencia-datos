I don't see what everybody's beef is with this flick. I actually found it to be extremely entertaining. For Rob Zombie's directorial debut, it was excellent. A lot of blood, a lot of gore, really messed up stuff, great story and the characters were just superb. I urge people to see this one if they are a fan of the horror genre. There was not a moment in the movie that I felt bored. It was constant killing after killing. A completely original horror movie from someone who's brand new to the directing scene. This made me want to see the new Halloween remake, and I was absolutely stunned by it's greatness as well. I don't know what's up with all the low scores! But that's just my opinion.
