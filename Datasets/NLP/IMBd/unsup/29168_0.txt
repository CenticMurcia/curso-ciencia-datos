Disney added on to the Disney Afternoon lineup with "Darkwing Duck" in 1991. It is about a duck who is an action hero, fighting danger, saving the world!!!!! His headquarters is on top of a bridge, if I remember correctly.<br /><br />Although I have seen the show as a little kid, I can't remember everything about it exactly. Yes, this is another one of those "GOOD" things to come from Disney! That I agree. I'm sure kids everywhere loved this too!!!!!<br /><br />So, for a great cartoon that is never dull and full of thrills, look no further than "Darkwing Duck!" It'll have you saying "Great!"<br /><br />10 stars!<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing: Good Job Disney!!!!!
