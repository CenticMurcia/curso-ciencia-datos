brother 2 is a movie that distinguishes two types of people Russians and not Russians. as a Russian i have to say that this movie is revolutionary. it destroys all the love that the Russians had for the west and firmly takes a shot at the American way of living, so is it a surprise that most western audience will find this film racist full of plot holes etc. and the notion that this movie is like a fairytale in which it's a one man battle, i say to that person who hasn't lived the Russian life and doesn't know that 12 year old boys there can do things that fully grown adults can't, a one Russian man against a bunch of fat lazy Americans looks like the truth to me. Sergei bodrov is legendary in this film and it would be great to see him in a third installment, but because of his tragic murder by the American government aka avalanche we can only dream. a legendary movie and a national favorite but if you don't understand the Russian way of life then keep away as the truth in this movie could scar u pretty bad. 10/10
