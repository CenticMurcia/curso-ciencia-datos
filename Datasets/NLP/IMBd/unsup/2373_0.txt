This movie keeps on getting better and better by the minute! Mike(A. Michael Baldwin) and Reggie(Reggie Bannister) keeps on trailing the sinister Tall Man(Angus Scrimm). Every time they go after him, they keep on finding things that weakens him. Time after time Reggie finds something, so did Mike. On the last movie, one of the silver spheres attacked the Tall Man was Mike's brother Jody. Not only Reggie was a Ice Cream truck driver, he was also a musician on the side. And he encountered the silver spheres himself. When he was spending the night with a woman, she later had spheres for breast. That was very freaky. All the other footages from the last three movies have been very helpful. The encounters, the people, and the unstoppable evil that constantly plagues the town that they are in. They remember that the sphere were not only weapons, they can be used as a key to open the portals. I liked the part when the ball was used to take out the minions of the Tall Man. When Reggie left in the Ice Cream truck, the question remains, "Is it over?" The movie puts the "I" in Intensity, out of all the other horror movies, Phantasm is tops! 5 stars!
