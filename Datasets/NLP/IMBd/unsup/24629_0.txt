I wasn't expecting anything new or spectacular. I wasn' blown away by the tv-film itself, but more so by the potentiality of the program to be a series. I agree with a previous post that with the mind-numbing so-called 'reality tv' horse crap playing, a show like the example here could've been a refreshing change of pace.<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum's portrayal of Ben, an experienced foreign correspondent thrown into the lawless and chaotic world of war torn countries in search for the truth, was quite fascinating. Although it isn't quite new as far as composition is concerned, for tv it works quite impressively.<br /><br />I can't really imagine any other actor capable of such restrain from being overtly expressive. His reserve seems very accurate and is reminiscent of Dan Rather and Nic Robertson (CNN).<br /><br />Had this film been directed by Steven Soderbergh, a probability very slim for tv productions, it would have been very fascinating. I see a very interesting neo-realism treatment to the direction, something Ã  la Traffic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this show just isn't what it could've been. I believe, aside from the obvious plot holes, the useless subplot which for the shortness of the film's length seem to leave too many questions unanswered. A doubtful supporting cast, which appear only to count on Jeff to support them in such a way it seems forced, the show aimed at greatness, but fell short.<br /><br />I believe, a reason for such a miss perhaps was using a theme that is a bit too actual. Utilizing al Qaeda as an actual reference, the 9-11 slaughter and Usamah bin Laden himself appears only a bit too disrespectful for the memory of the very unfortunate victims of terrorism. Specially so soon after the events themselves.<br /><br />Basically, this feature seems more or less like an extended pilot of a terrific show with great prospects, but falls short as far as a film is concerned.
