The first time I heard about this film, I was expecting a twisted thriller on space like Pitch Black. An "Agatha Christie on space" as my friend said. But it turned out very disappointing. The film was actually a failed Star Wars wannabe. It doesn't have any connection to the first film.<br /><br />In Pitch Black, it was about bunch of people, HUMAN, got stuck in a deserted planet. In Chronicles of Riddick suddenly they were Necromanger, Furyans, and many other strange fancy space names. It's like giving a Star Wars sequel to the movie Alien. Does not fit.<br /><br />I couldn't believe that it was David Twohy who wrote the script and directed the film. He did a great job in Pitch Black, but this film fell a long way from Pitch Black. And I still can't believe Judi Dench took part in this film.
