I don't see how people could like this skunk odor on celluloid. Where can I start on how disastrous this film is? Some of the scenes are shot with very poor lighting. The film is a 1950's male sexist fantasy come to life. Women clad in fur go around and beat up men, taking them in as "love slaves." The actresses do a "love dance" in the full moon, but none of them can dance. These prehistoric women also wear makeup for some unknown reason. They also needlessly hurt animals, killing a black panther There's a giant who goes around terrorizing everyone, and in the end, the hero ends up winning the respect of the heroine by defeating this giant with fire. If that wasn't enough to turn you off, there's also a very annoying and monotone narrator as well. About 5 minutes into the film my friends and I were doing the MST3K thing to make it more bearable. <br /><br />Avoid this at all costs, unless you like doing riffing.<br /><br />
