It is sad to say that a film should be "lost", but this is one. This work, directed horrendously by Leo McCarey, was a sorry thing when it was first released during the McCarthy-Witch Hunt period. MY SON JOHN is even worse now... Yes, we may disagree with the statement in a film, but we can also begrudgingly respect its professionalism. None of that is present here in this paranoid monstrosity that brought the overrated Helen Hayes back to the screen as the mom of a (gasp) suspected Commie. She is truly terrible-- the nadir of a career that, in retrospect, was not a great one at all. And poor Robert Walker died before its release. No comment needed. The most embarrassing moments occur when Hayes forces her son to spill his dreaded secrets... ARRRRGGGHHH. Not many films can make you angry by their incompetence. This McCarey disaster, with a big budget, is one of them. It makes "I Was a Communist for the F.B.I." and even "The Red Menace" look competent.. and they weren't.
