This movie not only started off with some intense stuff, but continued on with what I can only describe as pure Hitchcock material. The acting was awesome and the plot was way strong. You see a kid whose gone through a lot of emotional drama that shows hes real held back from his mom and then totally trying to make the best of what can only be described as a hellish situation ( house arrest ) He scouts his neighborhood and finds a psycho path next door, pure gold. I gave it 9 stars because they're some parts where the suspense could have been more so scary. To finish it off, you should def. see this movie for yourself, and if you give it less then 8 stars...well your a idiot!
