Detractors may highlight the unnecessary violence in this stylish piece of film-making. But pay them no attention. N. Refn's 2nd feature is cutting it pretty close when it comes to assessing life's terrible lessons.<br /><br />Using almost the same cast as he did in his debut (Pusher), Bleeder tells the story of how a father-to-be deals with his impending fate. It addresses his current state of mind, his readjustment of values and how all this would adversely affect the people around him. The violence is necessary as the characters emanate from the streets and one can only infer, from the several scenes, that the neighbourhood is rough and littered with gangs and racial tension.<br /><br />There is also a secondary story about the budding relationship between a video store clerk and a well-read waitress which is as sweet as it is subtle. It's interesting to note that their tastes in videos and books are pretty gritty as well.
