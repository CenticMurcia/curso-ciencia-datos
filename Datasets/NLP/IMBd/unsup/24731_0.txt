"Carandiru" is Hector ("Kiss of the Spider Woman") Babenco's sweeping epic about life inside the notorious Brazilian prison of the same name, which was demolished in 2002 following a brutal riot during which 111 prisoners were killed (execution style, supposedly) and not one cop or guard was killed.<br /><br />The film is based on a book called "Carandiru Station", written by Babenco's former doctor, who was the official prison doctor for several years. Babenco, who has made other films about Latin American prison life ("Pixote", "Kiss of the Spider Woman") was intrigued and decided to film it.<br /><br />The whole thing is told from the point of view of the doctor, who spends a great deal of his time trying to educate the prison population about the spread of AIDS which many catch through homosexual sex and dope needles. The bulk of the film involves prisoners coming to see him and telling him (us) the story of how they wound up behind bars. Most of the stories are sad and tragic but not without humor and compassion.<br /><br />The prison itself is not at all like what we in America associate with a prison. Carandiru is more like a super scummy apartment complex. The prisoners come and go with a shocking amount of freedom. The whole thing is basically run by the prisoners. The cells look almost like apartments. On visiting day women and kids wander freely in and around the cells and halls. Very strange.<br /><br />The last third of the film is a re-creation of the horrific riot which claimed the lives of so many prisoners.<br /><br />The film is similar in many ways to "City of God" in that its basically an extended Brazilian crime saga. But where "City of God" is nihilistic and adrenaline-pumped, "Carandiru" is compassionate and humanistic. Make no mistake, this is a brutal, brutal film. But Babenco really strives to turn the prisoners into characters the audience can understand and even empathize with. None of them are scary, blank-faced killers like Lil Ze in "City of God". The violence that happens happens for a very tangible reason, often leaving a tragic feel. The prisoners seem very trapped in lives filled with disease and drugs and vendettas.<br /><br />A sad film, but also one with a great deal of humor. Prisoners like Highness, who is eternally juggling two women at the same time (even while in prison!). And Dagger, a brutal killer who is suddenly paralyzed by guilt over his actions. The images of him wandering, wraith-like, through the yard are haunting.<br /><br />A superb film. Highly recommended
