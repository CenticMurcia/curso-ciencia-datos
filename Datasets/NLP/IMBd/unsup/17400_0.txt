This movie is a an Indian classic.... I don't know why so many people here are going on about how unrealistic it is...... I would wonder how many who commented as such have actually been to that part of India and witnessed the poverty there....<br /><br />The story may well have been copied but the film is no doubt still great. I cant think of many other copies which are actually good. This film does actually touch you with its sadness, and claims of melodramaticness will be gladly tossed aside because we are talking about Indian cinema here...<br /><br />All in all i think this is definitely a gem in Indian cinema, and fit the bill of an all time classic.
