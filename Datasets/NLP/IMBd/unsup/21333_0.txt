The first thing that will strike you about this movie is how totally fake the accents are! In fact, there are probably only TWO people who sounded at all convincing! That said, even though a lot of people have totally slated this movie for other aspects of it, I have to say that I still really enjoyed this as a movie! For those of you who have followed Brian Yuzna's work, you will know that he usually makes very low budget movies, so you expect that the special effects are not necessarily lifelike and more '80's horror' plastic looking, but once again, the movies were so addictive to watch, that it never really spoiled them one bit! They just kinda leave your eyes glued to the screen! (and this movie's certainly no exception!) So please don't be discouraged if you're a Yuzna fan, and you've read any of the negative comments about this movie! I absolutely loved it! especially the ending! But the other reviews are totally right when they say about the actors sounding dubbed! I'm not sure if that actually was the case, but certainly those accents were not realistic one bit! and if anything will annoy you about the movie, that'll probably be what does it! Indeed the Fear Factory movies he's made have slipped a bit, but on the other hand, a lot of his first works were originally taken from H.P.Lovecraft novels, (so just imagine quite what a task it would be to even try to beat those!) Although I must say that just before I had watched 'Beneath Still Waters' I'd just finished watching 'The Darkness' (which he produced). Unfortunately, 'The Darkness' was the first of his movies to truly disappoint me! (and it did it BIGTIME!) but after watching 'Beneath Still Waters', all was quickly forgiven! Yuzna's style was back, and his magic was truly working once again! Don't be fooled by a few bad reviews, it's well worth judging for yourself! ;)
