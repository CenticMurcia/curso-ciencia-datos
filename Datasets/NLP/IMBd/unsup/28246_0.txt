Astro Boy<br /><br />One of the few advantages of having a robot child, as opposed to a human one, is that it can process the concept of divorce faster and with less emotional scarring.<br /><br />Fortunately, the little boy in this computer-animated adventure doesn't have to worry about parental separation, because he's dead.<br /><br />When his son Toby (Freddy Highmore) is accidentally killed by a military robot powered by malevolent red energy, Dr. Tenma (Nicholas Cage) re-creates him in a robot form, powered by benevolent blue energy.<br /><br />But when the military becomes interested in his circuitry, Toby must hideout in the old city, where robots participant in gladiatorial games.<br /><br />Based on the Japanese anime, Astro Boy falls far short of its Asian influence: the character designs are flawed, the voice acting is patchy and the story is unexciting.<br /><br />What's more, uptight North American movie makers didn't even bother selling Astro Boy's used underwear in vending machines.
