On the wrapper, this show purports to be a fast paced comedy, however I found not one laugh in this slow documentary like film shot with an abundance of non-standard camera angles. Don't be mislead by the view angle of the wrapper photo or the text. Nothing like that is in the film. The director's comment on the DVD says the story was created from his wife's experiences trying to get pregnant with the aid of modern medicine. The journey is painted like one into the heart of darkness punctuated by obvious gags. The film may find empathy with those who have made the journey but I doubt even those individuals will laugh.
