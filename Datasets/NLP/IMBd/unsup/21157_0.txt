It's very simple, if you enjoyed Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend, you should enjoy this Urotsukidoji outing. It has more Demon and Man-beast action....action meaning rape and gore. That's right! Monster Rape and bloody gore! Throw in the characters from the first one like Megumi and that little flying gimp monkey thing, and you're right back at home. <br /><br />My only gripe with this flick was that it ended way too abruptly. It did set up for the next outing, but it made it feel like a TV series....but it was 84 minutes long. Eh, whatever. I'm still gonna find it, watch it and love it. Urotsukidoji forever!!
