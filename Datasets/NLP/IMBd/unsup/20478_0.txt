This film had all of the cliches of its genre. But, even so, it just kept up a certain charm. Michael J. Fox had none of the irritation factor that I have long associated with him. The movie is pure corn, but somehow you know this, and it's still OK. Maybe my lust for Julie Warner has unfairly inflated my estimation of this movie.<br /><br />
