"Policewomen" is an action/adventure film that is worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of women's martial arts. Sondra Currie is the main female action heroine whose knowledge of karate is put to use in a prison, in a gym, on a boat and on the back of a truck. Jeannie Bell also has notable fight scenes. Both of them prove that women can fight and that they can look very sexy while doing so. The story is a crime-fighting caper that is enhanced by a good musical score.
