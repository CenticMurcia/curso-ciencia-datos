"Dallas" fans must have enjoyed the inside joke at the beginning of this second reunion movie for the popular CBS primetime soap: Bobby is shown in his famous Dream Season shower scene, turning around and saying hello -- but it's Sue Ellen he's greeting! And this time, the shower scene is actually the dream, and it's J.R. who thankfully wakes up! J.R. is now the owner of Weststar Oil, the largest independent oil company in Texas, while Ewing Oil -- now owned by Bobby and Sue Ellen -- is right behind it. J.R. decides he'd like to get Ewing Oil back. Anita Smithfield is at his side again (returning from the first reunion movie). J.R. finds out that Ray's ranch might have oil under it, and he thinks this could get him the collateral he needs for a loan to do the Ewing Oil takeover.<br /><br />Carter McKay, meanwhile, has an offer for Sue Ellen that he says will make Ewing Oil even bigger than Weststar. J.R. spends part of the movie trying to feed conspiracy theories to Sue Ellen about Bobby to drive them apart. Jennifer Jansen of Jansen Oil seeks advice from J.R., and he's thinking she might be a nice distraction for Bobby. Cattle rustlers force some gunplay at Southfork, and various attempts are made on J.R.'s life.<br /><br />The movie does deliver on all usual fun stuff that "Dallas" fans look for (J.R.'s connivin' and dealin' and all that), though it's a bit painful to see our beloved stars aging.
