It's no secret that the Pang Bothers aren't big on script talent, but good lord, this was embarrassing. <br /><br />A rape/murder takes place in a forest that is infamous as a mecca for suicide. A botanist is researching the ability of plants to communicate with people. His girlfriend is a tabloid TV reporter sensationalizing the ghostly aspects of the forest. A detective, investigating the rape/murder case, believes that plants can act as witnesses so she gets the botanist to bring his equipment to the forest and sets up a re-enactment of the crime where the plants will act as lie detectors.<br /><br />I'm not kidding.<br /><br />I'm not necessarily against inadequate stories but the hilarity of this one seemed to infiltrate everything else to the point that it became impossible to take it seriously. The actors didn't seem dedicated to their characters, nothing appeared genuine here. I love the Pangs and think they often make engrossing films, even despite the stories, but this one was just too in-your-face dumb.
