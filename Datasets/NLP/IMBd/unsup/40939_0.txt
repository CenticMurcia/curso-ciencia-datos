In 1993, in Hollywood, California, the addicted in heroin mother of two children is a decadent ventriloquist that can not find work anymore. When she has an overdose and dies, the siblings Norbert and Angelina are sent to a foster house with their dummy. Later they are sent to their uncle's house; the man sexually abuses of Angelina and the dummy kills him. Years later, the autistic dumb Norbert (Rocky Marquette) and his seventeen year-old alcoholic sister and whore Angelina (Paydin LoPachin) are living on the streets; when the dummy slaughters a boy, Norbert is accused and arrested by the police and sent to an asylum with his dummy. Later Angelina decides to release her brother and find a woman to give an offspring to her family. She breaks in the institution, kills the male nurse and Norbert escapes. When they meet Robin (Katie Chonacas) on the road, Angelina decides that the teenager will be the mother of her nephew and they abduct the girl in a journey of killings.<br /><br />What a crap this "Triloquist" is! The director and writer Mark Jones certainly had the intention of making a film with black humor, but his "heavy hand" made actually an unpleasant and annoying movie but never funny. The story is of a total bad taste and the amateurish acting is awful. My vote is one (awful).<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Dummy, o Boneco Assassino" ("Dummy, The Assassin Dummy")
