This is one of the worst Manuel Summers films, a title that it was made for his son, David Summers and the Hombres G. It is very difficult to make a great movie without good actors, but it is impossible make a movie without any actor. The plot is absolutely ridiculous, without a logical sense. For example, the love affair between David Summers and his girlfriend, Marta, or the boxing scenes in the concert... I don't recommend this film to anyone...
