Ok, this is bad, very VERY bad. I do not know how anyone could find this movie interesting, in any way...The plot sucks bigtime, the music, well 'sounds' are nerve wrecking, and the slasher-scenes are numb...What a dull piece of Japanese non-cinema ! It's supposed to be 'shock-cinema', so I expected something in the line of Cannibal Holocaust, or C. Ferox, etc. But this is a joke !! Perhaps I do not grasp the fine art of oriental cinema, but MY GOD is this a major flunker !!! There are so many opportunities that are left alone, so many gaps in the story, so petty acting !! No horrorfan can just sit back and enjoy EDT2, it is a disgrace to the genre...after 1 hour and 28 minutes you see one or two better scenes (breaking the arm is one of them, but still not impressive), and that's about it I'm affraid. So if you see this one on the shelf, start running the other direction, it SUCKS bigtime !!! Trauma !
