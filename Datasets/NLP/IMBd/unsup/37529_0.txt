Let me just set the scene. The kids are beginning to fix up an old hotel. They look pretty bored while they're sawing and hammering and whatnot. THEN, one of them throws in a Sister Sledge tape. First the black kid starts doing a little air guitar with his broom. Harmless enough. Then the two guys sawing logs start to feel the music and get looks on their faces like "Oh yeah, I can dig that!" And then, and then, it happens....SPONTANEOUS CHOREOGRAPHED DANCING. Wow was that a treat! And to top it all off, the token old guy who is helping them tilts his body back and gives shrieks of ecstasy right in sync with the music! And that is the movie as far as I'm concerned.
