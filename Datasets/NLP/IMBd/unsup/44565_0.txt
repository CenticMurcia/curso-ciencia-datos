Bad, bad, bad. This film could be used as a torture device. I<br /><br />thought Superman could save anything. Obviously not this movie. <br /><br />This movie was the Richard Pryor Movie, not about Superman. <br /><br />Since when was Superman a comedy and not an action/drama? <br /><br />Richard Pryor and poor script writing made this film absolutely<br /><br />horrible. It was very slow moving, and went nowhere. I wonder<br /><br />how Warner Brother execs. approved this. I like Richard Pryor, but<br /><br />he had no place in this movie. I thought Superman IV was was<br /><br />worst Superman movie. I may have to re-think that now, after<br /><br />having to endure watching this one again.
