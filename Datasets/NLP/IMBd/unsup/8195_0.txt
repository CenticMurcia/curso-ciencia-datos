I can see to a certain extent why the critics hated this. It is pretty much made for a selective audience. I actually watched this with someone who had no idea who Stan Lee was. I'm not sure whether this is just really thick or maybe you had to be born at the dawn of the comic book era, or even just be a little sad...but the general public, like your average middle class suburbanite would hate this film coz it can be really gross at times. I do love Brodie tho', definately the best character in this film. Watch it anyway, really brightens up a Sunday!
