I have no words to describe my experience! It's awful, cheap, boring, clich√©d comedy (was it really comedy??)! In my opinion, 2005 has been a wonderful movie year for Bollywood with many good movies! But this one is a shame on this year! This movie probably belonged to 1980's, a tasteless decade in Indian cinema! In some news, I read Shaadi No 1 is last of David Dhawan's comedy! If that is really true (and not a publicity gimmick), I'll be the happiest!<br /><br />I have never seen such bad acting in recent times! Script, Screenplay, Music, Direction, Cinematography... if there is a filmfare award for worst movies, this movie will get at least a dozen award !
