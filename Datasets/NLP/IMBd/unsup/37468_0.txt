there was nothing good about this movie nothing<br /><br />nothing<br /><br />if i could give it negative stars i would<br /><br />if i was missing some sort of underlying "purposely-awful-movie-for-the-sake-of-irony" vibe<br /><br />then i might understand more<br /><br />some scenes attempt introspective depth and just come off as being cheesy<br /><br />the humor is interspersed in a sporadic low-brow way<br /><br />the impression it gives me is that the author only respects artists who are good at realism before they paint abstract things<br /><br />the movie gives off an alienating attitude and shallow view of the subject filmed<br /><br />the characters are mediocre at best<br /><br />it's too bad cause ghost world wasn't that bad
