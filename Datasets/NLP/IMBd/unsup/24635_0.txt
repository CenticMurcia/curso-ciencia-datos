I need to know what the name of the OSB episode (thought it may have been a T Zone one) where a person visits an old flea market and happens upon a pair of cheetah glasses. They buy them and try them on when they get home and become able to hear what people are really thinking, i.e. they can read other people's minds. Various situations transpire where the glasses pass from one person and situation to another. Each one is different and each one experiences a death because of it (as I remember from seeing this one when I was a child.) Does anyone out there know is this indeed was OSB, or another Sci-Fi TV series title? Also, if anyone knows where this can be purchased for a reasonable price, please let me know.
