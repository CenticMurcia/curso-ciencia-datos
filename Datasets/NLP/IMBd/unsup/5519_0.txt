All the ingredients are there for a funny movie and finally the result is really poor. After Papy fait de la résistance,les visiteurs et le Père Noël est une ordure we know what to expect.... and.. no. It is unexpected and finally confusing and boring. Anemone (Claire Trouabal)as soon as she appears will give you a hope quickly destroyed by Götz Otto (one of the main actors (acting as Johnny Zucchini), unknown and certainly not ready to be discovered:-) Disappointing, confusing ... few funny scenes but why do we feel uneasy from beginning to end, you know, like when you drive a car with no gas thinking it can stop anytime?<br /><br />
