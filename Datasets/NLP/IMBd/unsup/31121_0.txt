I located and watched this show because I'm a fan of Adam West's Batman, Conan O'Brien and Robert Smigel. Now that I've seen it, I can understand why people tend to either love it or hate it.<br /><br />The premise is great, Adam West is great, and the Lookwell character is hilariously annoying and genuinely noble at the same time.<br /><br />The clash between the luxury show business side of Los Angeles and the regular, scruffy side is great, too.<br /><br />The actors seem to be well cast, but one issue is that, in some cases, they do stage-y, sketch comedy style acting instead of regular TV show acting.<br /><br />I think a bigger problem is that the script isn't structured all that well. There are too many different characters who get about the same amount of screen time, and suspense doesn't build the way it should.<br /><br />It looks as if neither this show nor Andy Barker, PI has a story editor. It seems to me that a good, experienced story editor would have ideas for ways to make shows like these hold together better.
