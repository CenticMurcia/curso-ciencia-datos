This is the worst version of Joan of Arc I've ever seen - and I think I've seen them all. If you know the real history of Joan of Arc, you'll be very disappointed.<br /><br />Instead of portraying Joan as a sane, sensible, highly intelligent young woman who rationally planned and led a series of brilliant military campaigns lasting multiple days to save France from the English (her profile according to historical records), this film portrays her as a mentally delusional girl suffering from weird hallucinations and irritating emotional outbursts with totally irrational, impulsive military leadership. Since quite the opposite was true according to historical facts as we know them and I don't enjoy watching a raving, irrational female take over leadership from calm, rational people, this is a film I would not bother to see again.<br /><br />The acting was mostly well done (her part was often overdone) and the special effects were on par. That said, I don't think it's a film worth watching, especially if you hope to see a genuine heroine.<br /><br />It's a shame they couldn't have portrayed Joan as the intelligent, rational person history records her as being...one who answered so ably in the heresy trials that they couldn't find any fault with what she said. A better version of this story would be the one with Leelee Sobieski, also circa 1999.
