André Téchiné was never part of my favourite French directors."Les égarés" will not make me change my mind.It's certainly a cinema de qualité with polished pictures,good directing.But his movies (and I've seen a lot of them;"Barocco" "les soeurs Bronté" "j'embrasse pas" the ending of which is particularly infuriating)do nothing for me.<br /><br />"Les égarés" ,in its first sequences on the road ,recalls René Clément's masterpiece "Jeux Interdits" .Then the scenes in the country far from the war might have been influenced by Louis Malle's "Black Moon" which would have turned "realistic",Yvan replacing the twins. The relationship Yvan/Odile is predictable and provides the low point of the film.The one sequence which reaches something out of the ordinary is when the wunderkind starts singing an operatic aria ,in German,which is all the more disturbing.
