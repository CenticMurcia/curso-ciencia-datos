Very interesting product from South Korea, a.k.a. REPTILIAN is equally good as it is bad. Far out story line with unimaginative dialogue. Very good F/X holds your interest. Hostile invading aliens reanimate a dormant giant lizard-like creature named Yonggary to eradicate humanity and take control of Earth. Super cool alien spacecraft and a prehistoric monster should be more than enough to keep Sci-Fi fans happy.<br /><br />Overview of notable cast members: Harrison Young, Donna Philipson, Karl Calhoun, Dan Cashman and Richard B. Livingston. The monster is handsomely detailed and fun to watch.
