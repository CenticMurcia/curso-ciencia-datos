Ah, Bryanston Pictures - the same eclectic group of geniuses what brung us various chop-socky flicks, a couple of British comedies, Andy Warhol's ideas of horror (his Frankenstein and Dracula movies) and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre".<br /><br />And now, here we have "The Devil's Rain". Break out the holy water - you'll need it.<br /><br />Seems the devil worshippers in Rural Backwoods USA have a tough time of it when they are beset by Tom Skerritt and Eddie Albert, who vow to destroy them after Satan-izing innocent people they hold dear - who happen to include William Shatner and Ida Lupino....<br /><br />WHAT??! Yes, it's true, all those names as well as Keenan Wynn, Lisa Todd (one of the original honeys on "Hee-Haw") and Vinnie Barbarino hisself, John Travolta. TIDBIT - this was one of Travolta's first gigs, and he is barely recognizable under that makeup; and he has all of one line, albeit a memorable one.<br /><br />Oh, but I forgot to mention Ernest Borgnine! Yep, Quentin McHale...Marty...the tough sergeant of "From Here to Eternity"...same one. He plays a priest who sprouts horns and a goat's face every so often. And there's satanic worshipping, pagan rites, eternal damnation, inverted crosses, pentagrams, the whole nine yards. Then comes the rain, when....<br /><br />But if you've read this far, wanting to know what happens, you deserve to watch this dirge and find out what happens yourself. As for me, I watched the whole thing and was sorry I did. <br /><br />This whole mess is overblown, ridiculous and portrays everybody (ESPECIALLY the satan worshippers) as world-class round-trip-ticket buffoons; to take a line from MST3K, these are the kind of people who would lick the frozen flag pole TWICE.<br /><br />"The Devil's Rain" is bad. Very bad. Bad like old cheese. Bad like morning breath after a night of eating garlic. Bad in every sense of the word and a few senses that haven't been invented yet. Even when a "surprise" ending isn't all that much of a surprise, you know you're watching something bad. <br /><br />Have I made my point? GOOD.<br /><br />No stars, not a one. And why not; what did "The Devil's Rain" do for me?<br /><br />TIDBIT #2 - Anton LaVey, satan worshipper/occult specialist, plays the "High Priest" of this cult. Gee, I'll bet the suits all congratulated themselves on THAT original bit of casting.
