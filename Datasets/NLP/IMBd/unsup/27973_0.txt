I'd never heard of indigo children until a month ago, and just happened to see this movie while browsing at the video store. I thought it might help me learn a little more about this phenomenon.<br /><br />Five minutes into the movie, I was sure it must have been a made-for-TV movie. Ten minutes into the movie, I was sure it was a really bad made-for-TV movie. Fifteen minutes into the movie, I was tempted to turn it off.<br /><br />Technically speaking, the soundtrack was nothing but irritating. There was sappy violin music playing louder than the dialog. Add to that the fact that the grandfather whispered most of his lines, and you have a recipe for real irritation. My finger was worn out by the movie's end, having to continually raise and lower the volume.<br /><br />The script was unoriginal and predictable, reminding me of a story a 6th grader might write. The movie taught me only one thing about indigo children, and that is the origin of the term (indigo for their "aura"). Beyond that, I'm supposed to believe there are a bunch of Jesus-like children in the world, healing the sick and seeing the future? If that's so, why has there been no media about these miracles? Better they should have interviewed some 'real' indigo children and their families, so we'd get a true sense of them and what they think and can do.<br /><br />This movie was a big disappointment.
