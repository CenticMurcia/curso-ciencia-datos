Appalling, amateurish and entirely laugh free, this almost unbearable adventure has the unfunny duo meeting  you guessed it  Captain Kidd, played by Charles Laughton in a manner which makes it clear he's wishing a painful death upon himself. The 'story', for what it's worth (nothing), concerns a treasure map and whatever and so on. It doesn't matter. There are many, many pratfalls and headbangs in this lame lump of inept crud, and none of it, not one solitary second, is funny. The slapstick is poorly staged and looks as though it was made up on the spot. It's the polar opposite of slick. What more can I say? It's just. Not. Funny.
