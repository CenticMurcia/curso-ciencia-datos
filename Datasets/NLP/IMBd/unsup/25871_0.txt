A great little show that shows children a great deal about the world around them. The stories have a similar setup, Bing and Bong (the hero's) sit on their sofa and a giant catapult throws them to a different tiny planet where they have an adventure before returning back home and going to bed.<br /><br />Within this basic frame work many different areas are explored. Science, nature, music, even conflict resolutions are shown among many others. These stories are never condescending but easy to follow and great for kids.<br /><br />The program is cgi based with vivid backdrops and some inventive camera work. Rather than staying with the traditional side on camera angle, common to animation, the show sometimes puts in tracking or doll shots to place the kids in the middle of the action.<br /><br />Go in with an open mind, sit down with your children and enjoy.
