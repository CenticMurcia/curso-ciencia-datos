Eric Schaeffer's film was a detour from all the thrillers that opened in the summertime. This "small" picture proves that with the right ingredients, an enjoyable movie could be made.<br /><br />It was a pleasant surprise to see the great Jill Clayburgh return to film, after being away for a while, in a starring role. She makes this woman believable and it's a pleasure to watch her fall in love with a man who is real and not a stereotype. Jeffrey Tambor, is right up to the challenge to make this man the object of Ms Clayburgh's affections.<br /><br />This is a very "NewYorkish" type of film. We have known people like the girlfriends that push Ms. Clayburgh to take a chance in dating. Also, Jeffrey Tambor's world is easy to believe. He's the ugly duckling who has a lot to offer underneath his plain facade.<br /><br />Life in this film seems to begin late in the life of the main characters. It was a joy to have seen this movie.<br /><br />
