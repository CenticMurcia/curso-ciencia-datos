I always have hated Adam Sandler movies although I found this one and Deuce Bigalow rather amusing at times. Part of the problem in "getting" the humor is that movies like "Zohan" and Deuce Bigalow in Amsterdam requires you to have a better than average understanding of the culture it is mocking. If you've ever spent any significant time in Amsterdam you'd find the Deuce flick much funnier as the silly satire it is. Same goes for Zohan - it's 10 times funnier if you've been to Israel at least once and even funnier if you understand Hebrew. You must live in New York and have lived through the 80s to really get all the jokes. This is a total "turn off your brain" movie and has a lot of physical comedy, including some "political thoughts" that, in the end, we're all just people. For those who weren't happy with the obvious, predictable ending, the movie wasn't meant to ruffle feathers. Oddly enough, even my friend who hasn't had any background for this movie thought it was a simple, funny movie. Your call but keep an open mind and don't listen to all the critics here. The fact that the Hulk could be an 8.0 says all you need to know about the ridiculous critics here. Go and enjoy.
