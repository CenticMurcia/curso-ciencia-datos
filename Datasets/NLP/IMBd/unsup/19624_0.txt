As some have already noted. this show can't even do a decent bio on the "ghosts" they try to conjure up (usually in places where the ghost has never been or was only present once!) Well, at least they looked for Lucille Ball at the sound stage where she worked on the first Lucy show in the 50's.<br /><br />It's not even good on the unintentional comedy scale as the girl in it is a precious cupcake who jumps at every creak. She reminds me of Bob Hope back in the day. These show won't look good on anyone's resume.<br /><br />Still, I like watching it because of the location shooting. Its interesting to see Hollywood, The Queen Mary and all the other famous spots they film at. The rest is adolescent nonsense. And yes, I believe in ghosts. I just don't believe any self respecting ghosts come within 9 miles of this show. Smart.
