The above reviewers and this site summarize this great retelling of the still-read Little Lord Fauntleroy book. So I won't summarize, but just briefly add my cheers & jeers.<br /><br />Why does this tale (awash in sentimentality in Francis Hodgson's book of the same name) - yet LIVE ON? Anime and even a Russian version are recent. It's still a great tale!<br /><br />The 1936 LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY movie is basically like the 1930's movie HEIDI in one key way...i.e. the GRANDFATHER connection: <br /><br />A prodigal people-hating even life-hating old grandfather is brought back to the human race and to his God - by the love of a kind and good grandchild.<br /><br />In this great (but technically damaged) David O. SELZNICK quality family film, ....The old prodigal GRANDFATHER (the great Sir C. Aubrey Smith as the Earl) is brought back to the human race by his kind and good grandchild Cedric Errol (Freddie Bartholomew, the top male 1930's child star). <br /><br />************** Wade thru the second-rate copy of this movie ...and hope that - the studio does a quality restoration of this great film.<br /><br />NOTE: the current worldwide interest in LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY should make it worth the studio's while to issue a QUALITY restored edition of 1936 LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY. Just make sure to dub it in Russian, Japanese and many other languages!
