If you watch the original food of the gods and have your pause button ready you will notice that some of the poor special effects are real footage of rats getting shot by a slug gun or the like. A bore to watch however it is a movie that makes you appreciate the half good movies out there. and for that reason it should be compulsory viewing for all.<br /><br />You don't realize just how good that b grade movie with the Baldwin brother in it is until you watch this load of vomit ...........must see. If you find yourself in the video shop and cannot find this cinematic treasure, yet the sequel jumps out and bites you , just remember that number one has very little redeeming features where as the sequel contains none.
