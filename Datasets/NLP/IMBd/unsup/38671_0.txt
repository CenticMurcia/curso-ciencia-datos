You learn everything new everyday. Had I never watched this film, I wouldn't have known the following; apparently, cavemen had perfectly sharpened and rounded metal knives and wore make-up; apparently, newborn pterodactyl(whatever the plural form of that word is) have feathers; apparently, if you called an electrician in the late 80's, you'd get a pushy and respect-less jackass who prints out a business card that says "electrician and adventurer". Seriously. The first was decent at best, this is just plain bad. No reason to sugar-coat it, no way around it, it's just bad. It shouldn't even be classified as 'horror', seeing as there are virtually no horror elements whatsoever in the film. The comedy elements are there, but they are just ridiculous and pitiful. The attempts at comic relief are so in-your-face and obvious that it's hard to sit through. The better part of the jokes and gags are cringe-worthy. The plot is nonsensical fantasy-babble. The acting is atrocious. The characters are paper-thin and poorly written. The dialog sounds like it was written by a child(and a mentally retarded one at that). The score is so unbelievably, unforgivably 80's that it's hard to listen to without screaming at the top of your lungs. The special effects are so ludicrously obvious and easy to figure out that one has to wonder if that's what they're supposed to be. The whole film doesn't really make even the slightest bit of sense on any conceivable level... I know this was just made for a laugh, but, for crying out loud, even the dumbest movies have some purpose(if absolutely nothing else, then at least to entertain). This doesn't seem to have any purpose at all(other than to successfully squeeze money out of what I suppose must have been somewhat of a box-office hit of a first movie of the franchise). I recommend this to... well, no one, I guess, except for possibly 80's movie freaks who may get a kick out of just how bad it is. Everyone else should avoid. 1/10
