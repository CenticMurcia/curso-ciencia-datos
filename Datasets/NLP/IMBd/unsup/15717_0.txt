The rights to this film were rescued from Disney. I dread to think what Disney would have done with the book. Thank goodness they never tried it!<br /><br />This book was one of my favourites, so I went to see the film in fear and trepidation. I needn't have worried. It is a beautiful film in its own right. Nothing was overstated. The emotions and nuances were captured perfectly by some wonderful performances, without the need to spell everything out in black and white.<br /><br />Please see this film. I haven't enjoyed anything so much in ages.<br /><br />
