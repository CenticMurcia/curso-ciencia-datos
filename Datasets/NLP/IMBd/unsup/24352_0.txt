Everything you'd expect from a film with this title...nothing. I THINK I remember a woman in a weird house with a cafeteria with guys in white hooded robes staring at soft-boiled eggs on the tables... I remember the mustachioed guy and some painful-to-watch love scenes with said Village Person... I rented this years ago at a Blockbuster. I actually thought I was in for something remarkable- yes, I was duped by the box at a tender young age. I don't remember any sex, violence or nudity in this. Are there (*shudders*) multiple versions out there?? The copy I rented wasn't prerecorded, so I tacked on a little bit of a Disney animal movie on to the end there as a protest. If you have that tape, e-mail me. Look for the credit acknowledging the Church of Satan.
