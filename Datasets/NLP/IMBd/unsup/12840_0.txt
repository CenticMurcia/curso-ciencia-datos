The great writers at Production IG in Japan have done it again, not only have they made a great production in terms of storyline, and animation quality. They have even manage to give a in-depth view into a few of the major characters backgrounds (E.G. Motoko Kusanagi), and also how Public Security Section 9 was formed.<br /><br />As usual there are a few episodes which are stated as Complex, meaning that they fit together to form a large scenario, and Individual episodes, which are stand alone stories. The main feature of this sequel are the return of the ever lovable SPOILER! - Tachikomas - which have been fully restored and are now stated as active members of Public Security Section 9. For those who have not watch the 1st Gig or 1st Season or any of the Ghost In The Shell Movies, do not worry, you don't have to have watch either of these to enjoy this exciting 2nd installment of Ghost In The Shell Stand Alone Complex.<br /><br />Truly a must have or watched for any Ghost In The Shell, anime, Shirow Masamune or S-F Fan.
