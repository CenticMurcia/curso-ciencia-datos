This movie su**ed. I did wanted to see it because i saw the other tow, but sadly i should have known that it will not be better then the second part. The plot was terrible and the happenings were so flat that i almost felt asleep. It was like they wanted to put something together but they only had $100. The acting wasn't that good and i was the one how felt ashamed of how terrible the events were. The first two parts had more too say. The first part was really the one which had it in it and think they though that people will see this one because of it. I really really hope that it will not be so. If you value your life, please don't waste it on this one. I truly have nothing else to say about it. It was just awful.
