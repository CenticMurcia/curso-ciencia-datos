I am not as harsh on this movie as most. LeiLee Sobieski establishs herself as a top young actress. That alone ought to be worth the watching, just so when she wins her Oscar you can say you saw her first great role. Stellan Skarsg√•rd is exquisite as the creepy Mr. Glass, humanizing what could be a cardboard character. Diane Lane is convincing playing against type- proof that she too can really act. too bad she isn't given more character to work with.<br /><br />My emotional response was anger at the abuse, not fear or terror - the obviousness of the outcome was apparent early, the few "twists" minor and uninteresting. The suspense never built. It got intense ( but not terribly so) too fast, and then actually let the tension dissipate several notches. A good thriller has maximum tension at the climax. This movie fails there.<br /><br />The plot is swiss cheese ( full of holes).Almost totally incoherent, and totally unrealistic. Bruce Dern, Kathy Baker and Chris Noth sleepwalk through supporting parts. Don't they have better ways to make money than serving as plot devices?
