Quite seriously, I wanted to commit suicide after I saw this miserable peice of crud. I genuinly felt that an hour of my existence had been stripped from my soul. Avoid this one at all costs, and for heavens sake, do not rent it because the guy on the back of the cover looks so funny. Thats what my friends and I did, and we almost vomited at how horrible this movie was. The "extreme sci-fi showdown" in the finale really shows how a bunch of drunken inbreds can create truly worthwhile props and costumes. I think they got all of their materials from a shriners garage sale, and superglued them togther. This truly is a festering wound in the anus of cinema.
