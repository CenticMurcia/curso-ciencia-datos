I don't know how people with no sense of humour can try and write reviews of a comedy show. Anyone who doesn't recognize the humour and the talent of the COmedy Inc crew is simply brain-dead. <br /><br />Did you see the one where they do Osama Bin Laden? Brilliant! Keep up the good work guys, and don't pay any attention to the morons with no funny bone, and IQ's too low to understand satire.<br /><br />The Comedy Network has lucked out, and putting Comedy Inc. right before The Daily Show is good news too, and will surely increase increase the audience. <br /><br />If you miss Kids in the Hall and Codco, tune in to COmedy Inc.
