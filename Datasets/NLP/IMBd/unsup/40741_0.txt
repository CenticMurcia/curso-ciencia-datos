Awfuly directed by Mark Tapio Kines, the camera is flickering all the time and it's impossibile to watch by audiences. The plot is a bunch of nonsense... The movie is so boring that you may fall asleep. It's nothing good to see here. <br /><br />There are only 3 characters here (that doesn't look good, either) , the acting is bad and the movie itself doesn't worth a penny. It's very low on gore.<br /><br />This is the worst low-budget horror I've ever seen. I don't remember seeing worst. If you want to see this, think about it first: "an imaginary killer on the rooftop". How stupid is this? I mean... what's next? A real killer in the house? You'll never get any worst than this, trust me!<br /><br />1/10
