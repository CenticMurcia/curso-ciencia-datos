Sadly, a great film such as director Lawrence Kasdan's (Silverado) "Wyatt Earp" was not properly realized by the audiences of 1994. Possibly because of Tombstone (basically a film on the same point), having been released only a year prior to it. When comparing "Tombstone" to "Wyatt Earp", I have to say that they are both good films, although "Wyatt Earp" has many points that overpower "Tombstone".<br /><br />First of all, we have a great cast of talented actors including Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Michael Madsen, Mark Harmon, Jeff Fahey, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, and Bill Pullman. I strongly have to disagree with the people who hand out the Razzie Awards. They gave Kevin Costner one for Worst Actor. Although it's definitely not his best performance, it is still very good, not worthy of a Razzie. True, he wasn't so great during the scenes of him as a young man, but when he portrayed Wyatt Earp as a famous lawman during the 1880s, he pulled the job off great. Dennis Quaid's performance of Doc Holliday was excellent and one of his best to date.<br /><br />Music was done by James Newton Howard, who is the most underrated music composer of the day in my book. Howard is one of my favorite composers and he created a mix of excellent scores for "Wyatt Earp". The scene where Wyatt Earp, his two brothers, and Doc Holliday walk to the O.K. Corral shootout is a wonderful theme. The film's main score is also memorable.<br /><br />Of course, the one thing that "Tombstone" definitely beats "Wyatt Earp" by is action and entertainment. The gunfights in "Tombstone" are far better than the ones in "Wyatt Earp", keeping the audiences interested. And probably the only other thing is pacing. "Wyatt Earp" is three hours long and in my personal opinion, a half-hour longer than it needed to be. I could have picked out a few scenes worth removing.<br /><br />"Wyatt Earp" although receiving some positive reviews from critics, was a box office failure and it won two Razzie Awards (Worst Actor and Worst Remake or Sequel) and it was nominated for several others including Worst Director and Worst Picture. In my opinion, it is a great film that is far too compelling to be worthy for those and it should have been nominated for Academy Awards rather than Razzies. The only Academy Award it got a nomination for was its beautiful cinematography.
