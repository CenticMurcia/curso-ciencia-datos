I consider this a mediocre horror flick. The picture quality was not good due to the directors penchant for poorly lit scenes. The director also used other amateurish tricks like facial closeups and excessive blood all over the place. I can't tell you how many times my 14 year old asked questions like 'What is that?' or 'Why did they do that?' This was due to many holes in the plot. Two thumbs down from this house.
