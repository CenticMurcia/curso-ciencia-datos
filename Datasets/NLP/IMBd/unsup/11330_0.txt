Let me explain my view before some of you decide that I'm mad. Firstly most sane people agree the 1st film was absolute garbage. This film has many strengths. The plot, there is a reasonable plot with high level characters taking on an epic quest. The details, a great level of detail on the world actually having a history which gives the setting realism. The enemies, they were interesting having more than just one agenda. The good guys, although certain area's with the characters were a bit plastic, they did have character which was lacking in the first. The traps and puzzles, very impressed with the traps and puzzles which were overcome using methods that players could imagine. Clich√©s are limited which cannot be the same for many other films of this type( one being released recently and hyped to hell!!!) In conclusion this isn't the best film I have ever seen but it does have a lot of the elements that I wanted to see and I hope will spawn more films of this type but maybe a series starting the characters from their first adventure. It'd be good to see a fighter having a go at skeletons and zombies and being terrified and frustrated when bow fire has little or no effect.
