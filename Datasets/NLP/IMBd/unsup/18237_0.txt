A great cast of charachters, combine with several celebrity cameo's to make this slightly typical science fiction story fresh each week. The plot revolves around the destruction of the 12 colonies of mankind, by a race of machines called Cylons. The last remaining Battlestar (Galactica) is now in search of the lost 13th tribe, from it's known origin, which split from the original group & has no known location. They hold the hope that Earth will give them a base to fight their antagonists & to rebuild their own race. This series put Universal in the front of sci-fi developement for a while. Worth watching for any science fiction fans who may have missed it. You'll enjoy it a great deal.
