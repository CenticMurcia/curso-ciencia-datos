Jeff Ltd is a pathetic show on every level.<br /><br />It's a comedy that isn't funny first of all. The acting is terrible, the scripts/stories are terrible, the directing and producing in fact the production as a whole is terrible.<br /><br />None of the characters are likable and that is okay because you can have a comedy show with unlikeable people but the characters aren't funny either. The acting is the big downfall with this show.<br /><br />I hope it gets taken off the airwaves soon because Jeff Lts is pathetically bad.<br /><br />1/10
