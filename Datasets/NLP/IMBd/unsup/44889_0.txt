I'm a drummer myself I'm gonna be in Marching Band again next year and this movie had no point to it at all, I mean I know he can't read music but you can't be in band if you can't read music. No one I bet learned any of the instruments or anything! This movie makes drummers look really bad and thats not cool. Don't watch this movie you'll be wasting your time!
