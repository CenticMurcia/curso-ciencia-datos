This is one of the most monumentally pointless movies I've ever seen. Many have said that this is a dark look at youth, or that it is a daring indie film, and similar diagnoses. However, it's really just a movie for all the Beavis and Butthead fans out there, for whom plenty of sex and a bit of gunplay makes a film.<br /><br />The utter trashiness of this movie is found in the whole 666 gag. Whenever the protagonists purchase something at a store, the bill totals $6.66. That basically sums up this movie's ambition to be daring and rebellious, but exposes how pathetic these attempts are.<br /><br />Everyone who has branded this movie as dark and daring probably just read the tagline.<br /><br />Maybe that's what makes this movie so 'daring.' I suppose that, in a way, making a pathetically bad film is daring, especially when you put your name on it.<br /><br />Simply put, watching this movie is a painful experience. Hopefully it will claim it's rightful place on the bottom 100 before long. However, maybe that's too good for it.
