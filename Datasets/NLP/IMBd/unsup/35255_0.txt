I recently saw this at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival. This is the second feature length film from noted short film director and writer Roystan Tan and I think this may have worked better as a short film rather than being dragged out into a 90 minute film. Very little dialog here. It's a story about an 11 year old cough medicine abusing-latch key boy named Xiao Wu whose mother is on business in Bejing and he's left alone in the apartment with a suicidal tenant from Korea named Jung who is drinking and popping pills. The long stretched out scenes are about exciting as watching paint dry. Xiao Wu keeps a journal about Jung and sneaks into his room and spies on him every morning at 4:30. As a 25 minute short this may have peaked my interest and tied everything in more neatly and concisely and left me wanting for more but as a 90 minute feature it left me wanting to abuse cough syrup or kill myself. I'll be kind and give this a 4.5 out of 10.
