UK does not produce a lot of films, but what it makes, it is well<br /><br />made. The photography of this film is stunning, the scenery of<br /><br />Yorkshire Dales is beyond believe, it is like oil painting. All of the<br /><br />scenery shots are well composed, well balanced. Although I must say,<br /><br />they must have waited for years for the lovely weather to turn up, as<br /><br />usually that part of UK is dull and wet, even in summer. The still<br /><br />photos of the ladies, although they are not the originals,are very<br /><br />artistic and well made. The story line is simple, yet moving. The<br /><br />whole package is a pleasing moving which I could recommend to anyone.
