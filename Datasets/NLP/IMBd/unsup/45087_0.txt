I should have known with this movie being shelved for two years, plus the fact that it lost something like 96 million dollars at the box office that this movie was going to be bad. Maybe that's what made me hit the 'buy' button on the dish, I just wanted to see how bad it was.<br /><br />Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed, bad acting, lame plot, lousy special effects, and those are the good points!!! Being a HUGE John Cleese fan, even his little part couldn't save this wreck. So where did the 100 million they spent on this flick go? It sure as heck wasn't on the script. Eddie, please, we need a good movie from you soon, I'm sure the only reason they decided to release this was due to your outstanding performance in "Shrek", now that was a good movie. Save your money, and go buy a bucket of paint so you can watch it dry, at least it's more entertaining than any given minute of Pluto Nash.<br /><br />3/10, only because of John Cleese and Ralphie from The Sopranos
