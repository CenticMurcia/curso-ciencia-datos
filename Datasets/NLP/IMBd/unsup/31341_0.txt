I love this show, since the first episode. I was a big fan of Michael Wheatherly before and so I wanted to see him again. But I felt in love with the whole show. Especially Abby is a great role. It's funnier than CSI and more exciting than JAG. I want to watch more of these series. I wished to be like Abby without the caffeine shock I wished to be like Tony without the greasy hair I wished to be like Gibbs without the bad mood I wished to be like Kate without being dead I wished to be like Ziva without mixing up words I wished to be like Tim without getting hurt of Gibbs. I am saluting for the producers and I give the order to make more of that!
