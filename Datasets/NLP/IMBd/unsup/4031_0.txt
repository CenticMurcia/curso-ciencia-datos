A Few weeks ago I was at the 15th Annual African Diaspora Film festival here in New York and by chance I happen to attend the screening for this film called A Winter Tale.<br /><br />The film took place in Toronto, in a neighborhood called Parkdale.<br /><br />Now I'm not at all familiar with Toronto or the neighborhoods, or the city dynamics etc. but I loved this movie so much. The acting was really good, well written. The way certain details came through the exposition was handled really well.<br /><br />Its a story thats mainly centered around the events that take place after a young boy is shot in the head, and the effort of one community member to create a support group against the deaths of young Black males in the city.<br /><br />I don't want to give up what happened, but i'm sure some of you have heard, or probably seen the film. (I think it was released in Canada in early 2006?)<br /><br />I really enjoyed how the film focused in on the Black community in Toronto. I caught a little deja vu while watching the film (as a kid my father owned similar west Indian type of restaurant in the bronx). I'm a young Black male and I come from an African American/Caribbean Background, and I knew of certain things issues going on up there but I'm not too informed. (What I know of city issues in Toronto come from my niece and nephew that live up there) <br /><br />watching the move was refreshing because it really is a remarkable work of art, but at the same time I was frustrated because, I said to myself damn why is it they never try to show you Canada from this perspective<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie here are some links about flick: ledaserenesnewz1.blogspot.com, awintertale.ca<br /><br />Best thing about it was the Director and two of the actors were in the audience. The director said that most of the script was based off of improv, that right there was remarkable.
