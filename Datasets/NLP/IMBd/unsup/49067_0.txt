This was bad, even by slasher movie standards. The only reason it got a 2 instead of a 1 was the nudity. The acting was right on target for the genre though--reeeeeally bad. The chick that played Maria was terrible, but she did have a smokin little body. I tend to overlook bad acting in that case. Anyway, this one's good for a gag gift (which is how I got it)--thanks for reading.
