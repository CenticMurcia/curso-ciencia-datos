Though this is not the most thrilling ride (Tower of Terror and Rockin' Rollar Coaster are much better for thrills)Star Tours is fun. It's a ride simulator, or something like that. It's mild thrill so everyone can enjoy it, even the little 4-year-olds. DON'T GET A FAST PASS! The attraction is just as enjoyable at the line as the actual ride. C-3PO and R2-D2 make a special appearance in the line, arguing as usual. Now the ride. You're a passenger on a StarSpeeder which is taking you to Endor. Your pilot, Rex, is a first-time pilot and messes up by taking the wrong turn. You fly through a hanger and, after much confusion, leave. You enter hyperspace, but fly past Endor. Great. You end up flying through a comet, breaking through ice. You exit the comet and what do know! Star Destroyers. You end up being a part of the battle that's going on between the Rebellion and the Empire. You go through the Death Star trench scene(except Luke is NOT blowing up the Death Star). You finally make it to a Star Tours station, but not without almost crashing. You then leave and get to a souvenirs shop. They have anything you can think of there. Now Star Tours is a little outdated. But it's still enjoyable. When I first went on it I was 8, hated Star Wars, and loved the ride. That's how fun it is. You don't have to be a fun of the saga to enjoy it. It's NOT something to pass by at Disney.
