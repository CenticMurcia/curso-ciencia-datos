We liked the movie because it kept you continuously engaged. But do Indian girls like Asha sleep and have one night stand so easily ??? She even says her friend did the same thing running away with a classmate to Goa to have fun just before her wedding. And the worst part is that she says Todd should not show his physical attraction in public. This is so hypocritical. We thought Indian girls don't cuddle up naked in bed so easily before wedding and those who do invariably end up marrying the guy. Or many college girls get into petting and necking. Todd comes out with a very good idea of paying incentives to increase MPI and this shows he is professional but having affair with his subordinate seems so unethical. Do Managers simply have sex with staff so easily ?!
