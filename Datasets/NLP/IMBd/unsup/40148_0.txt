This has got to be one of the worst movies i've seen in the last 7 years and i have seen a lot movies in these 7 years, as i can't watch TV in China. I was hoping for a good flick with some scary monster and a would have taken the bad acting for granted but the dialog killed me - lame as...<br /><br />Awesome actors, original dialog, spectacular effects and gosh i loved the bad guys dressed in black - that actually cracked me up! Gotta love the blonde doctors with killer bodies - the second blond chick was a particular great actress - SARCASM if that wasn't clear yet.<br /><br />Anyway can't recommend a bigger waste of time - top choice this one
