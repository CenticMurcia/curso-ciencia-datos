Saw the film tonight ans honestly cannot see what all the hype is about. It is not badly made, although it is very cheaply made, but it was just trying too hard to be something it wasn't.<br /><br />I feel casting was what let this film down the most, the main character was utterly unconvincing as an immigrant with her forever changing accent. And the criminals in the film were such your typical stereotypes, no originality whatsoever.<br /><br />Also, the locations used were far too overused, it was plainly obvious that they were just driving around the streets of Richmond and St Kilda as the same landmarks kept popping up. <br /><br />This film is much better suited to network television as a miniseries.
