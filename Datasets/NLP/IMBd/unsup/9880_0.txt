Someone must have told Gwyneth Paltrow and Jonathon Schaech they're starring in a serious drama because they're no fun at all in this try-hard attempt at camp. On the plus side, Jessica Lange gets it right because she's as camp as a row of pink tents playing the MIL from Hell with a weird fixation on her cute-but-dim offspring. Hardly a scene goes by without her lighting up or hitting the bottle and her Blanche Devereaux accent is anything but subtle. Judging by the evidence on hand Jonathan Darby couldn't direct traffic but he certainly knows how to write genuine shockers: "Get up! You think you're an alley cat, dropping its litter by the side of the road?!" Jessica makes the most of the over-ripe dialogue so it's worth a look, but if you want to see it in a good movie check out Wild at Heart, with a deservedly Oscar-nominated Dianne Ladd as the ultimate evil, martini-swigging southern matriarch.
