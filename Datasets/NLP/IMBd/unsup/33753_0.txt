It is amazing to see anyone rate this movie highly, or to even have anyone suggest that you might want to watch it if it were on cable and you were bored.<br /><br />The movie is the worst I have ever seen, not because the dialogue, pacing, script, acting, sound or editing are weak, which they are, but because after watching the movie you will feel like you need to wash something off... and you will know even if you do, nothing is going to go away. Watching home movies put together by a neighbor might be dull and boring, but it is not going to be offensive and disgusting.<br /><br />The movie has an exceedingly negative perspective on live and not one character in it has any noteworthy redeeming value.<br /><br />It does not explain aberrant behavior such as infidelity, drug addiction, violence, teen rebellion, or a father having sex with his teenage daughter, all of them presented front and center in this movie, nor does it offer anything resembling insight into them.<br /><br />It simply tosses them out there for you to watch. As you watch you will keep hoping that somewhere along the way there is going to be some payoff to justify putting up with the garbage paraded across the screen.<br /><br />But there is no payoff. There is merely more depravity, and depravity which is not even presented in an interesting manner.<br /><br />Those who consider the family unit to be the source of all ills in society and believe the family should be attacked at every opportunity to destroy it, might see this film as helping with the assault. It is hard to understand how anyone else could see this utterly depressing film as having any other value.
