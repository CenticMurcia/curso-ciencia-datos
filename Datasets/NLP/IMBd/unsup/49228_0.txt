Over a 2-day span, I went to go see this, and The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift. There was a 2-3 vote for Tokyo Drift over this movie, and in this case the majority was right. The storyline was overly clich√©'d, and had far too many big coincidences. The acting, which some say was great, I found horrible. As usual, I found Vaughn and Aniston playing their usual characters. Aniston reminded me of "Bruce Almighty" and Vaughn reminded me horribly of my least favorite scenes of "Mr. and Mrs. Smith". The saving grace of this film was Vincent D'Onofrio, a superb actor, who pulled off his role extraordinarily well.<br /><br />As for the plot... it's pretty much the title. But as for billing it as a comedy... It was funny, at points, and I'll admit that as a comedian, Vaughn shines, where some funny moments got me to look back at the screen, but the overall flow of the movie was lacking, and a good plot wouldn't need funny jokes to get my attention back. The ending actually surprised me, however, because it was not your typical romantic comedy ending. However, seeing as I wouldn't classify this as a "comedy" for most intents and purposes, that makes sense.<br /><br />All in all, the mostly sub-par acting and the yawn-worthy script left much to be desired by this over-hyped summer film.
