I remember watching Emmanuelle with all my friends when I was 13 years old and at the time it was so hot. Now years on and I still love it. Basically, it's definitely not for teenagers. (I know I was under aged when I watched it, so there's no point in pointing that out) But for anyone who's into older movies, Sylvia Kristel or sex, I so suggest you watch Emmanuelle. Granted the story hardly makes any sense and the picture looks a little pale, but my friends and I enjoy an evening watching it. The story is pretty much about an attractive young woman who seeks comfort in the arms of men she hardly knows. That's really the whole story, but my point in watching it is because the sex scenes are not bad at all. It'll give you ideas on what to do next to spark up your relationship.
