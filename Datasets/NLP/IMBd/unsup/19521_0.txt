Poor sound quality really had me pulling my hair out, and the accents of the actors was trying my nerves, but I didn't turn it off. I cared about what happened to Derek Longstreet and I watched until the end.<br /><br />I hope they fix all the technical problems for the obvious sequel and get some well spoken actors next time. The strong point of this film was the fights, nothing fancy, but good energy.<br /><br />
