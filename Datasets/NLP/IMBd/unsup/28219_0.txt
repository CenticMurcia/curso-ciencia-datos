I was driving to visit my cousin recently, & passed very close to the birthplace of W C Fields, a native Philadelphian like myself. It reminded me that W C has somehow gotten out of vogue. WHY?? Back in the 1960's & 1970's there was a huge revival of interest in his anti-establishment ways. We used to have birthday parties for him every Jan. 29th (I won the child-insulting contest one year). His films were on TV constantly.<br /><br />It's time to get old William Claude back where he belongs! He was the greatest, & we need more of his brand of humor now. (Plus, he inspired me to learn how to juggle - a hobby I've now enjoyed for almost 40 years)<br /><br />Best short: Fatal Glass of Beer<br /><br />Best Feature: It's a Gift
