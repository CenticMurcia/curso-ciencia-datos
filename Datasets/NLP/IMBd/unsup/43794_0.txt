The man could do no wrong, it seems. He could make a two-hour film from a story that could have been told in fifteen minutes, full of dead ends, boring, irrelevant fluff to make up the time, dull action scenes and shameless pretentiousness, and yet still the public lavishes him with unconditional love.<br /><br />I loved Metropolis, but Metropolis was everything this film wasn't: a coherent story with balls that knew what it was trying to say.<br /><br />I could go on for a good while yet, mentioning for example the 'influences' from other films that verge on plagiarism (the madness scene in the asylum looked as though it was lifted straight out of the 1930 'Dracula'), or what indeed that whole scene had to do with anything, but what would be the point? I would only get lynched by an angry mob of acolytes from the Cult of Fritz Lang.<br /><br />Don't waste 7000 precious seconds of your life watching this film as I did. You won't get them back. If you want some good German expressionism, that's entertaining as well as intelligent, treat yourself and watch Metropolis, The Golem or Faust instead.
