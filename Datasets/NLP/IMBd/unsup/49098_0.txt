One of the least interesting in the James Bond series, Moonraker is big and dumb and bears no resemblance to the superb thriller penned by Ian Fleming. This is the movie where Bond goes into space to prevent madman Hugo Drax from destroying human kind with the poison from orchids (in the novel Drax only wanted to destroy London with a rocket). Idiocy is rife throughout, from Drax's comical henchmen notably Jaws (who was menacing in The Spy Who Loved Me) to Space shuttles that blast off at a moments notice as though it's as easy as taking off in a Cessna. There's also Drax's space station that is invisible from radar (yes, but optical telescopes and the naked eye don't require radar). The increasing globe trotting nature of the nutty Q (Desmond Llewellyn) is quite absurd also, remember way back in the early Bond's when he was just a common functionary in the bowels of the secret service building. The best scenes are the free fall moments from a plane in the pre-title sequence, Bond's spin (literally) in a centrifuge machine and the death of Hugo Drax's secretary (who Bond has bedded) at the hands of some vicious mastiffs - a scene that is a bit jarring amongst the rest of the campy and less serious than usual action scenes. Those that enjoy the zany and campy such as the 60's Batman and Dean Martin's Matt Helm movies may love this but the Bond character (and the situations)are too far removed from Fleming's version for any satisfaction.
