Wow! This takes you into the heart of a different part of the world where freedom is not something that is taken for granted. Richard Gere gets infatuated with the wrong woman, & when he wakes up, she is dead. At first, he doesn't seem to have a say so in his plea. He has to plea with his (female) lawyer to get her to change it. I am glad that our court system is not like theirs. Richard Gere's decision to put himself back into the hands of his lawyer after he is safe at the Embassy shows that he is honorable, & thank God his lawyer can prove his innocence! The story is both moving & touching.
