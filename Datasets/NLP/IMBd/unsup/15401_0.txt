Me and my friend who goes to Avon Old Farms (the school where this was filmed) decided to watch this movie last night. I thought since he goes there and i spent so much time there it might be cool to see it in movie.<br /><br />B.S.<br /><br />This movie had the fakest feel to it. It took forever to come out first of all, it was filmed when my friends brother, who just graduated, was a freshman there, and it just came out in 2006, and the quality is pretty bad. The acting was third rate, and the emotion, forced.<br /><br />It was funny to watch though. I think the name Walden Academy sounds like a joke, and the people attending "Walden" are nothing like the actual prep school students who attend AOF. I would watch it again just to see AOF's debut, but i regret paying 3.99 for it on demand.<br /><br />Word of advice. If you don't go to AOF, don't watch it. If you do go to AOF, then that means you're paying at least 24 grand a year to Mr. LaRoque. You can afford a better movie.
