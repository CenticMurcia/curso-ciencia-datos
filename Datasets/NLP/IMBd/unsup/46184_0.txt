Definitely a Saturday night trash movie!<br /><br />A serial killer is knocking off female law students and photographing their bodies as he is a photographer professionally.<br /><br />The beautiful lawyer tries to track him down, the trial is an interesting farce and although the twist was predictable it was reasonably well done.<br /><br />The lawyer's former law school room-mate was a victim, and the victim's father keeps on cropping up with pieces of advice and wisdom ... "You have to trust the system".<br /><br />Perhaps he can be Yoda in the next Star Wars film.
