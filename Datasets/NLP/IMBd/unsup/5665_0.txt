I saw Across 110th St. many years ago and to this day it's one of my favorite crime flicks of the 70s, right up there with The Godfather, Serpico, and Dirty Harry. If you're gonna make a movie about the gritty, dangerous hardcore mafia underworld, you shouldn't sugar-coat it in any way. IMHO this is the best thing this movie has going for it: it's realism. There's no Hollywood-style heroism here, just human nature at its worst. Psychopathic Mafia hit-man, corrupt cop on the take, brutal violence, ruthless crime bosses, greedy crooks, all told without soft-core political correctness. Movies of this type really should show the mob society as it is, without coloration, that's how they make an impact on their audience. This one, I must say, does a pretty good job at that. Not perfect, mind you, I also thought Franciosa's character was a little over the top, but good. My rating: 10/10<br /><br />Also if you don't like sadistic violence, don't see this one. See Law and Order
