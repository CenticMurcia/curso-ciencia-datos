... from the 90 mn of the Psychotronic Man, you easily have 30 mn of driving through the countryside with annoying bad country music.<br /><br />That leaves, say, 60 mn of pure movie. Pure indeed.<br /><br />This is not a movie. This is not an essay about a movie. This does not bear any resemblance with art or cheesy fun or anything connected with the movie business.<br /><br />There are some movies which are so bad you can find them amusing, fun, easy to follow because of their badness... well, fascinating stuff. The only fascinating thing here is the will of the director to show us how good the psychotronic man is at driving a car. He is, definitely. He's the best to lead you on the way to total boredom.<br /><br />This is probably one of the only movie in all movie history where a blank screen can be a better spectacle.
