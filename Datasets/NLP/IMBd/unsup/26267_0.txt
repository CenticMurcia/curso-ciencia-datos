The famous Feroz khan used to be noted for his modern lavish productions that pushed the boudaries of indian cinema but sadly this film despite the slick promos falls flat on several occasions. What starts off as a poorly acted and insesitive film ends up being poor. Sadly the main fault in this film lies in its story that is a poor mish mash of poor D grade bollywood storylines, it has everything thrown in... murder, revenge love, action and of course the hoards of bikini clad women who really serve no purpose at all. without the bikinis the songs as just plain forgettable. The superbike championship was a nice innovative idea that tries but fails. this film is also choppy and bitty. scene's that do not seem to flow together.songs thrown in hap hazzardly. A very poor attempt by the man who brought us classics like "App jaisa koi" in Qurbani.
