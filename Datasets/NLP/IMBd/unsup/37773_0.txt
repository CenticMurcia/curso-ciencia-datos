What a B movie this turned out to be, maybe even C; no wonder it never made it to theaters, but with all these bad "scary" movies coming out, it would fit right in. The acting is just plain bad. Even Robert Englund wasn't too good, but maybe it was just the bad role he got to play. The script just lacked any depth whatsoever, no real character development, no real storyline, very little plot, and worst of all, where were all the bloody scenes? Sure there is blood and some gore, but a little more drama from the victims would have been nice. All in all, I found this movie to be quite bad. Robert Englund is a great actor, and unfortunately chose a bad scripted movie to take part in.
