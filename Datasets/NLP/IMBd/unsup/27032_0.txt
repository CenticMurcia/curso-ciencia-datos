I didn't really expect much from this film. I thought it would be just some cheap movie that would hardly have any action sequences and a poor script. I was so wrong. From start to finish there was really good action and the script was really good. I mean Scott Wiper wrote, directed and starred in this film and i think he did a very good job doing all that. The story was good because it was a good and different. Most action films these days will have the same story as other films but this didn't which is good to see.<br /><br />All the action sequences that occurred in the film were really. Weren't over the topped or went on for ever just right. The shootout at the beginning and in the supermarket were both really good. As for the second explosion that was just mad. You could see the sonic wave from it was that powerful. The acting was good as well. Was a bit wooden at times but that hardly occurred. I really like Andre Braugher character in it. I thought he portrayed him really well and acted brilliantly through out the film.<br /><br />All in all this is a really good action film to sit in and watch with popcorn. It a shame it didn't get released in the cinemas because i'm sure if it was more people would of herd of this.
