For all the love I have for South Park, I must say this movie is horrible without even the redeeming factor of being horribly horrible. It just sucks! And no pun intended.<br /><br />Juvenile, concocted (again no pun intended), poorly written, amateuristic direction and very predictable.<br /><br />From the get go I felt no empathy whatsoever with our mormon idiot. Halfway through I was wondering why I was still watching this. And by the end I was wishing for my life back.<br /><br />Even now I waste time writing this review, hoping to save some of you from this colossal waste of time.
