I might spoil the ending by accident, so watch out, but you won't be missing anything.<br /><br />I hear people around me yelling stuff like, "Halo 2 is immaculate!" and, "Best game ever!"... I do not agree with these statements completely, but I do not deny that Halo 2 was an incredibly great game.<br /><br />With beautiful levels and creatures, wonderful gameplay for an FPS game, and an amazing storyline (that never actually completes in the game), this game dazzled me, but I think it was overrated. <br /><br />The ending is what killed this game. When I saw the ending, all I could say was, "What?... That's it?" I'm confronted with an absolutely extraordinary story, but then, it stops before my eyes before ending!<br /><br />This could be a death sentence or a blessing from the gods. It could either mean that Halo will be a lost story and will never be completed, or it could be a prophecy foreseeing a third installation in this truly wonderful game series.<br /><br />I only have 1 controller and I don't have X-Box Live, so I'm not exposed to the true greatness of Halo 2, but I've played these modes at friend's houses.<br /><br />Back to my true subject, Halo 2 is greatly overrated when compared to the TRUE ultimate game... SUPER MARIO BROTHERS!
