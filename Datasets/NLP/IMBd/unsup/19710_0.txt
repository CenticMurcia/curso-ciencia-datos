Maybe it's just cause I'm kinda partial to great flying and big-busted women who kick butt, but "Aces: Iron Eagle 2 is the most fun I've had watching a movie all year (the other highlight being "Princess Diaries 2, but that's another story).<br /><br />After seeing the original, pathetic "Top Gun" wannabee (aircraft engaged in "aerial combat shooting static displays, COME ON!), I skipped "Iron Eagle 2". However, there were some things I wanted to see after watching the previews and seeing the poster. Yeah, those things belonging to Rachael McLish, the only body builder of EITHER gender who ever got my cigar puffing (Yeah, I know this is sexist as hell, but I'm on a roll and it's THAT kind of movie). No nudity, darn it, but McLish is hot and handles herself well, especially with a couple of machine guns. Besides, how many movie's do you get to see with Sonny ("Streetfighter") Chiba, Horst ("Magnificent Seven") Bucholz and Senator Fred Thompson of the great state of Tennessee, not to mention, the downright neat (with the right script) Lou Gossett, Jr.? Yeah, "Aces" is predictable, but that's part of its charm. It was probably also fun for former 007 director John Glen to work with people who can actually enjoy their work without trivializing it. HEY ROGER MOORE AND TIM DALTON: PAYING ATTENTION? Just wish McLish would've had more exposure ...<br /><br />I give "Aces: Iron Eagle 3" a "7". MISS MCLISH: DO YOU HAVE ANY OUTTAKES? THE RIGHT ONES WOULD BE WORTH AN "8".
