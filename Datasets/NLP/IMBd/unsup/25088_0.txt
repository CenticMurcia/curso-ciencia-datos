I have yet to recommend this movie to a friend who didn't enjoy it. I guess it addresses "themes" that many of us dream about. It has several themes going on at once. There is "action/adventure", there is "wild west", there is "love story", and so on. Louis Gates, a modern-day bounty hunter, is seeking some sort of redemption (through self-destruction) for the death of his wife, for which he was really not at fault. Through the course of this movie, we see him find love and peace. I think we all want to believe that we could turn back time and maybe find a Shangri-La, even in the far reaches of the American west, and that is what happens to Louis Gates in this movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the good story and the beautiful scenery!
