Three escaped convicts seek refuge at the home of a black minster and his family, there the family is humiliated and beaten. When his daughter is violated the family begin to embark on some vengeance.<br /><br />A film which has very little to offer other than racial hatred and some rather disturbing scenes of violence. Like many other films not worthy of its cult banned 'video nasty' status.
