Positively one of the worst horror movies ever. Bad script, acting, music... you name it, they've got it.<br /><br />Other bad horror movies are in the least funny. Sitting through this is absolutely painful. Utterly horrendous... The most HORRIBLE HORROR.<br /><br />Loads of cliches and overacting. The cheap ass crap music reeks of teen movies. Romantic lines and scenes just gives me the shivers and I get goosebumps from all that corny junk.<br /><br />I can't stand that idiot cop as well.<br /><br />YUCKS. AVOID THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />
