This movie is an absolutely superb beer and crisps movie to be shared with likeminded friends. If you have been looking for the ultimate barbarian-scifi-dinosaur-ufo combo movie check it out. Who could have believed anyone really ever made i movie of this calibre. I mean, jurrasic park only had pixels, but this movie has full blown papiermach√© monsters. Brilliant! And not only is it full of really bad acting, FX, costumes etc but it's hilarious to watch. Having watched it a couple of times (incredulously on both occasions) we have coined the term to "Yor" when playing games, meaning to destroy or eradicate (by accident) a town or village. This in fact happens four times during the movie i.e. every time Yor meets up with any kind of civilization. Errr, make that five times.
