I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival after watching a bunch of Hollywood galas all week, and "Goat on Fire and Smiling Fish" was by far the best of the bunch. An intriguing storyline, engaging characters, and a phenomenal performance by Bill Henderson made this one movie I will be recommending to all of my friends. The director, Kevin Jordan, and many of his cast members were there, and he said the movie was made for about $40,000: you certainly can't tell that at all. This is a film about two brothers who are very different (played by real-life brothers) who both find love, but their love lives are complicated by outside circumstances. Bill Henderson plays the sentimental and lovable Uncle Clive (whom Jordan described as the "Yoda of Love" at the screening) whose memories of his own true love help Chris make decisions about his own life. This is a wonderful movie, but don't take my word for it: go see it for yourself.
