(Warning: I mention some parts of this film that make it so unique in the comments below)<br /><br />Go ahead and laugh but somebody in Hollywood is going to do a remake of this thing and pull in a ton of money. And you know it'll all be politically correct and probably have a female lead. Yes, it'll star someone like Jennifer Lopez (I mention her name because her pretty face is in one of the Celeb Photos on this Web page) and the person who remakes it will probably marry her too!<br /><br />SO GO AHEAD AND LAUGH ! Someone will remake this movie **, make a ton of money, buy and move into a hellacious house in Beverly Hills, make the rounds on the talk shows, and marry miss J.Lo. And as for you -- you'll just be some unknown smuck who'll pay to see it and then write an IMDb user comment on it like I...like...oh,well...NEVER MIND !!<br /><br />** The following comments are assuming it's a good remake and not done by someone like Tim Burton.<br /><br />And I read through the other user comments and some of you admit there's a halfway decent story in this B movie.<br /><br />I remember after viewing this movie when I was a kid I always wondered where I would run if the Shrews came running after me. You know they're hungry vicious b******s ! You can't climb up a nearby tree, you saw what happened, they just nibble away on that. Forget trying to outrun them. Is there water near by? How long can you stay up on a roof? And what's the deal with the poisonous teeth?<br /><br />I repeat, go ahead and laugh!<br /><br />(Note: I'm basing the above comments on a movie I probably haven't seen since 1968. I never knew its name and it took a few minutes to locate it in IMDb via its search screens. I'm also surprised by the number of user comments this thing has written about it.)
