... of movies like Predator, Alien, Jurassic Park, Rambo, Indiana Jones, etc ... <br /><br />... and of bad script, terrible lines, lame acting, rubber ducks and aliens from "Alien", bad actors, stupid situations, idiotic characters and other stuff in the same category.<br /><br />oh and how the hell can you extract dna from goddamn BONES?? let's clone dinosaurs, shall we?<br /><br />and what IS that thing anyway? is it an alien? "ancient creature" ? I bet those things lived around Caesar or Cleopatra. did they keep them as pets? 'cause I want one then !<br /><br />so... Enjoy !
