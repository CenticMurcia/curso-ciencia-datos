I looked forward to viewing the DVD that included Peru, South Africa and India. Unfortunately, it became clear that adventure for the featured traveling couple, and the producers of the show was tepid at best. They stay in the poshest hotels, take first class trains and dine in four star restaurants. While a massage at an infinity pool must be nice, one doesn't need to travel across the world for a spa treatment. The people you'll meet in luxury hotels, trains and restaurants are wealthy travelers. With that as a mainstay, why would your experience be any different in India or South America? You will likely miss the opportunity of absorbing the color, sounds, flavor and spirit of the country. Melanie and Albin brought nothing to the show; their conversations and reactions which lack insight, reflection or intelligence was baffling. "Wow! Awesome! This is so beautiful! That was so fun!" If the show was created to inspire or educate, it was woefully unsuccessful.
