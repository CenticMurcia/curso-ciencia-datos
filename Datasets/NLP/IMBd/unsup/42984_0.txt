I am not against remakes, but if you are going to do one, at least make it better than the original. Really bad acting (caused by bad directing, of course) and really cheap production, bad lighting, and this coming from the allegedly biggest soap opera producer in the world, really bad quality show. The worst part, not only they have made ''infomercials'' in the show (adverting products in the show) but yesterday a character openly invited the public to vote for a certain candidate in the next Mexican presidential elections. Televisa, a network has its compromise with society, not with political visions. Shame on you, Televisa, Azc√°rraga and the rest!
