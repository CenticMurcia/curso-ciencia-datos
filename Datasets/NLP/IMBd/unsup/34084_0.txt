The "filmmakers" have produced an awful film, but that's precisely the point. The high school actors seem to be winking at us,as if to say, "Yes, me in bad movie, and me proud of it."<br /><br />This is a comedy in the tradition of "Date Move," "Epic Movie," and "Sleepover." Unfortunately, the director, Travis Irvine, fails to understand that true comedy works when it is taken seriously. That's why classic spoofs like "Airplane!" and "Cannibal! The Musical" work: because the actors act as if they are in a serious drama.<br /><br />"Coons" was featured at the 2006 TromaDance. It was the worst film of the night. Perhaps the cast and crew had set low standards for themselves. One would guess, by the obvious lack of production value, that the only goal Irvine and his team had in mind was "Let's make a horrible movie!"<br /><br />They certainly have succeeded. "Coons" is unfunny, and not only that, it lacks skill and professionalism. Even terrible comedies like "Epic Movie" at least aim for quality in cinematography and acting. <br /><br />Take for instance the poor casting. Rather than casting professional, talented comedians, Irvine cast young men who look like high school students, dressed them up in wigs and costumes, and then made them recite raccoon jokes. It looks like the worst high school play you've ever seen.<br /><br />But again, that was the point. "Coons" fails as a comedy but succeeds as one of the worst independent "films" ever produced. I'm sure Travis Irvine and his crew are out there somewhere, smiling as they read this, convinced that they have made the best bad film ever. Yes, indeed, they have.
