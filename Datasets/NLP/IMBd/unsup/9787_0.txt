I recently rented the movie, "Beyond the Silence," and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />As a sign language interpreter, I have read many books about CODA's (Children of Deaf Adults). I think that "Beyond the Silence" does a pretty good job of showing the difficulty and extra responsibilities that a child with deaf parents experiences.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this movie, I would suggest reading the book "At a Loss for Words." It's a very touching story about a girl growing up with deaf parents and coming to terms with her feeling of guilt and anger and also love for them.<br /><br />I'm not trying to be "preachy," but PLEASE don't call deaf people "mute." That term is negative and out-of-date.
