SPOILER Wow. A DVD with Rutger Hauer AND Joan Chen for only 69 DKK... A steal I thought - and I was right. In the negative sense!<br /><br />This movie is simply the worst I have ever seen in my entire life.<br /><br />The first thought that sprang to mind after the movie was: Why did I have to see this movie? Then Why did I have to spend time seeing this movie?<br /><br />The only funny thing in the movie was when Rutger Hauer towards the end jumped to his death through a hole in the floor: He actually looked relieved finally to be able to leave the movie.<br /><br />And that's my recommendation to everyone: Leave this movie alone.
