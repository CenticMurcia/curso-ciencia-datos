Felt like being beaten over the head with a "gun's are bad" stick for an hour and half. Paper thin characters and very contrived plots. Mixing them around doesn't really add anything to the movie. Each story wouldn't stand on it's on. We get shown the exact same message multiple times. I like the idea of the movie but the execution just wasn't there.<br /><br />Above is my original review, but apparently it's not long enough. I really can't think of much more to say about this movie. I'm not sure you need to expend this many words trying to explain how mediocre it is.
