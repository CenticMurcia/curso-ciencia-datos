I was expecting it to be a bit cheesy and low-budget-looking, but I wasn't expecting to be insulted.<br /><br />This "film" has similar production values and acting caliber as you will find in an average daytime soap.<br /><br />It's as if the crew of "Days of Our Lives" borrowed the studio's gear for a weekend and went and shot a "Sci-Fi/Thriller" because those are popular these days, so we should be able to make some cash with it.<br /><br />It wasn't scary, wasn't thrilling, wasn't even sci-fi-y, just boring and predictable. No plot, bad lighting, laughable critters, wooden acting, no reason at all to force yourself to sit through a turd like this one.<br /><br />The rave reviews here have to be from people associated with the production, or else who haven't actually seen the "film".<br /><br />Avoid at all cost.
