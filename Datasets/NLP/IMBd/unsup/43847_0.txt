This film was average because it resembles True Romance too much. A couple looking to make a better life for themselves, stolen cash, bad guys and Christian Slater. The couple are in a rut, he finds some dirty money and the couple set off across the U.S., get married and visit a casino. Bent cops then chase them to get their money. Local law enforcers get involved and a whole load of people all get shot. The likeness to True Romance was evident from the start and the constant 'I love you' between the couple added to this. However, it wasn't as good as True Romance and the fact that it seemed like it was meant to be just like true romance made it worse.But worth a watch if not doing much else. The film was very average and to be honest not worth talking a whole lot about. Having said that, to grade it a 2 out of 10 is unfair and it deserves around a 4. If True Romance had never been made then it may achieve a 6 or 7.
