This is a bad, bad movie. The original Dragonheart was no Oscar winner, by any stretch. Not a bad movie, but certainly not great. In truth, it did not warrant a sequel. Yet, despite this, A New Beginning still manages to do the original no justice by being a total flop. The plot, acting, and directing are all bad. Don't bother with this one.
