For the love of God Ron... 122M  for this... Probably the worsts Blockbuster of the year, and maybe the decade.<br /><br />2.30 minutes of suffering. Bad construction of the plot, there are times in the movie that u are filled with info and others that u are thinking what u will eat tomorrow for lunch...<br /><br />The caracthers are median... Tom go away... Audrey not bad and Sir Ian probably only the good cause for a 5 ticket...<br /><br />I really don't like the changes that the production made to the book, specially in the end of the movie. And for God sake, the end with a praying Tom above Louvre's piramid... Simply hillarius.<br /><br />I'd like to see wath a good director would do with something like this.
