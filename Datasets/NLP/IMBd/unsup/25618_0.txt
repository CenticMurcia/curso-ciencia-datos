This movie was hysterical. It mocks all the stereotypes and in a delicious way. I am sure Californians would rise to the occasion if ever put in this predicament but for the first 24 hours it would be this silly, ridiculous and tragic all at the same time. This movie only showed the hypocrisy and bigotry on the state and local levels. In real life we saw it all the way up the ladder of leaders after Katrina. The most significant line was said by the character that was Lila when the acting Governor asked her to tell the Mexicans "We need them" and she replies "They should have heard that sooner". I will continue to recommend this movie until all my fellow Mexicans have seen it.
