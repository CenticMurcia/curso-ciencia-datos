This is a movie where the laws of science are bent <br /><br />1 ) Apparently if you're hanging off a helicopter and you slip you fall sideways through the air <br /><br />2 ) If someone screams " The copter can't take off , there's too many people " the helicopter will crash AFTER several people fall off thereby not lightning the load <br /><br />3 ) A volcano on the middle of an island will cause a tidal wave <br /><br />4 ) If you scream very loud mirrors will break <br /><br />5 ) Hotels attract fireballs being spewed from a volcano <br /><br />In many ways WHEN TIME RAN OUT is a throwback to the childish and silly productions of Irwin Allen like VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA . In fact the whole production feels far more like a TVM ( Especially where the very poor FX are concerned ) instead of a big budget cinematic movie and you have to ask how on earth did the producers get so many big names to appear in it ?
