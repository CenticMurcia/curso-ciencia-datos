I see some folks liked this film, but I truly hated it. Saw it in the theater and would have left if I was there by myself, was bored almost to tears. It's in my worst ten, but I don't go to the movies much, and if something stinks on video I turn it off as soon as the determination is made. That was all I had to say but gotta make 10 lines so: Pros of Sister Act 2 1: Completely predictable ; You won't risk hurting your think-bone. 2: You can use the time to contemplate what exactly Ted Danson was thinking when he decided to get with Whoopi. 3: It will show you everything you'll be missing when you go to one of those "good" movies. It was so bad , I'm posting this now, because the memory has never left me some 12? years later.
