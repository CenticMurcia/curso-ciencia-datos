Sometimes, while I'm watching this show, I actually begin to wonder if this was sort of a "how-not-to-make-a-sitcom" show. Every tiny little aspect of the show is unoriginal, and the same jokes are used over and over throughout the show, such as Megan's pranks, Josh's "speech impediment" or whatever you want to call it, and the whole girl thing with Drake. What makes it even worse it the fact that not one of these repeated jokes are funny. In fact, if it weren't for the laugh track, most people wouldn't even know which parts are supposed to be funny.<br /><br />Not to mention, the show is very predictable. If Drake comes across a girl he likes, guess what's going to happen? He's going to end up with that girl by the end of the episode. And if Megan ever says to either Drake or Josh that she won't pull a certain prank on them, guess what's going to happen? She's going to do it anyway.<br /><br />In addition to all of this, the acting and scriptwriting is terrible. Drake, Josh, and Miranda are all horrible actors, and most of the guest stars are useless when it comes to acting. As for the scriptwriting, the jokes and such are very bad and not very well thought out, and at some points the dialog just stops making any sense. In fact, if memory serves correctly, Megan, in an attempt to explain just how dumb Drake is, actually compares Drake's brain to a black hole by saying that they both "keep sucking things in and never let anything out". How that can possibly be meant to be an insult is beyond me.<br /><br />The one thing that irks me the most about this show is the way Josh pronounces certain words, such as "huh", "whoops", and "nice". The makers of this show somehow got it through their heads that this is funny, but it really isn't in the least, and is actually somewhat annoying.<br /><br />Overall I believe that this show deserves a 1/10.
