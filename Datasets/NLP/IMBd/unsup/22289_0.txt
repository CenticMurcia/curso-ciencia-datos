I saw this movie while in college in 1975. I laughed until I cried. I was in pain. I rolled on the floor in agony. You actually get to see photographs of " Invisible Flying Critters ". Plan 9 from Outer Space and Robot Monster have good production values when compared to this movie. The narrator talked about a 4 engine bomber that encountered a UFO but the film shows a 2 engined C-47 military transport. The saucers are tin pie plates dangling from fishing line attached to fishing poles! The guys who made this had a lot of fun. See it with friends as this heightens the effect of the absurdity and creates a bootstrap laughing situation. However you must be careful if food or drink is made part of the experience since choking and projectile fluids could be a problem. Someone should check out credentials of who made this movie. Was their a sinister motive like CIA disinformation or just an attempt to slay the audience with peals of laughter? Wonder if it came in under budget. Did it have a budget? A classic of its kind!
