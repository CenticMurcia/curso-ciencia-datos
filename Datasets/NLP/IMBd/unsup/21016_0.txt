Return of Jafar is the sequel to the 1992 animated Disney film Aladdin, which was an animated blockbuster starring Scott Wienger, Robin Williams and Jonathan Freeman.<br /><br />This sequel is, to put it simple and blunt, an utter disgrace. It basically has a classic "defeated villain wants revenge" plot, where Jafar wants to kill Aladdin as he sealed him in the magic lamp at the end of the first movie.<br /><br />After looking at the animation, it wouldn't be hard to come to the conclusion that the animators were drunk when they made this awful movie. The colour is too bright and the shading techniques aren't even close to matching up to the original film. Also, the characters have weird, stretched movements, and huge lip animations in areas. Overall, the animation is awful.<br /><br />The voice cast is the same as the first movie, except for one major difference: Genie. He is no longer voiced by comedy legend Robin Williams but by Dan Castellaneta instead (famous for voicing Homer Simpson in The Simpsons). The guy doesn't do a bad job, but compared to Robin Williams he is just not as funny and doesn't give that exciting spark to the character Genie that made him the funniest character in the 1992 movie.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is bad. Bad. Very bad. Very, very bad. It's boring, badly animated and shows that Disney just wanted to grab some quick cash. Don't buy this movie if you love the original: it will melt your heart (in a bad way!).
