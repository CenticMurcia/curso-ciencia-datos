The 1949 European Champion and 1948 Olympic runner-up Eva Pawlik from Austria is excellent both as the leading lady of the Vienna ice revue ensemble and as an actress. I have seen this movie about ten times and I must say it is worth watching even more often. I can strongly recommend this movie to everyone interested in the history of figure skating and of ice shows. I have seen many a movie with the legendary Sonja Henie from Norway, thrice Olympic Champion, but there was none among these films that was as charming as "Fr√ºhling auf dem Eis".
