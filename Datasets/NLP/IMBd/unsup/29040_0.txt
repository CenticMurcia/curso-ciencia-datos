This classic is rarely seen on TV. Old Dark House scenario with a murder mystery to solve. Lionel Atwill, a 1930s Universal Studio staple, is terrific--just mysterious enough to keep you guessing. Elizabeth Patterson does her best Una O'Connor imitation as the frightened old maid type, and the youthful Gloria Stuart sings. Edward Albert is a standout later in the film as the investigator of the mysterious goings on. Due to the short running time, this little thriller catches steam rapidly and comes to a satisfactory conclusion. Remade several times, including once as a musical. This film has terrific atmosphere, due to the relatively elaborate sets, considering the "B" film status.
