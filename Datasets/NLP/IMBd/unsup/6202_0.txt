OK, this is not high art - and there are no bombs or swordfights. There's no famous young American star and there's no spectacular car chase... but there is a great story, told by fabulously talented actors and mindblowingly beautiful cinematography. There's poignancy, wisdom and laugh-out-loud humour. If you're open to a great story and a celebration of maturity - go and enjoy this movie.
