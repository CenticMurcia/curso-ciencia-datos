Hard to abide the realism of this striking movie...<br /><br />Not the blood and the excess violence but the pure reality of - how anybody do something like that to other- caused some of the audience leave the movie in the first half.<br /><br />We have seen these kinds of headlines everyday in the third pages of newspapers (maybe not as barbaric as this) and get used to these kinds of savagery news. But to see this realism in a well-played and directed movie shocked the most movie goers.<br /><br />These kinds of things is happening all around the world and makes the victims' whole life non-tolerable.<br /><br />Thanks to Serdar Akar for his plain directing and also would like congratulate Serdar Orcin for his great play as a psychopath. One of my best in Turkish movies.
