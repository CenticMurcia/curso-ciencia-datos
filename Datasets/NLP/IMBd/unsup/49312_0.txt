People whom have called this film "fun" are basically saying that they wouldn't mind if someone ripped apart their final work and turned it into one of the worst movies of all time, only saved by those who enjoy it for being entertaining. I'm sorry to say that this is the most disrespectful work I have ever seen, basically it's liking digging up a corpse and putting it on strings. Maybe I was just to loyal of a fan to the great one, because I can't watch this without turning it off. Those who like it, have somehow found a vehicle to ride where this seems to be entertaining. I picked up the Enter the Dragon 2 DISC DVD, and if you want the fighting footage from GOD, it's in there. So basically this film has no use anymore, and hopefully people stop watching it.<br /><br />The buzz on this film from my idiot friends continued to tell me that this film was "good", so I believed them. I had seen the four main Lee films (Chinese Connection, Way of the Dragon, Big Boss and Enter the Dragon) a bunch of times, and wondered why this guy hadn't been mentioned to me earlier. I popped it in and was completely struck with a brick of hatred for this piece of crap. Horrible EVERYTHING is the only phrase I knew of this, and how people could take this for entertainment is beyond me.<br /><br />Bruce is still the greatest martial artist whom has ever lived. His presence alone made him the martial arts genre worldwide, he was truly a man before his time. But to see something like this that just pains me every time I see it, it just shouldn't exist. Anybody who likes this film like a "Mystery Science Theater kind of way" should be destroyed. Hopefully this craptastic waste of time is forgotten and people destroyed for ever liking this film.
