I wasn't looking forward to seeing this movie again. I've seen it twice. For some odd reason, and I don't know why I felt it was a chore to see it again (maybe it's because The Musical isn't exactly the most world-changing genre out there). Anyways, once I got IN to watching Show Boat again, I was totally transfixed again! There's just something about it that makes it timeless.. The songs are all top-notch, the singing and dancing are all great, but I think it's the actors that make this version the one to remember. I just love Ava Gardner in this. I TRULY believe she should have got at LEAST a supporting actress nom at the Academy Awards. And what about Howard Keel? Great as always. Yes, everyone, from Joe E. Brown to Gower and Marge Champion look to be having w whoop of a time here. And it's contagious!
