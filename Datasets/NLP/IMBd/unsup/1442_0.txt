This is one of those excellent short subject films that doesn't seem like either TV episode or someone attempting to get investors to expand it to feature length. It's a very simple, straightforward narrative brought to soul-stirring life by the gifted director. Ignore comments from those who seem too jaded to appreciate this little gem of a film. And at less than 30 minutes what do you have to loose just to check it out.<br /><br />In fact the reason I am writing this at all is because I wondered what he had done since (I saw this years ago) and found to my shock and dismay no one has given him a project.<br /><br />It is included on the DVD for the now defunct Film-Fest DVD series, Issue 3 (along with some other good shorts)
