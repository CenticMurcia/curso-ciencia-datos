I thought Anger Management was hilarious. The star of the movie is Jack Nicholson. He is unbelievably funny. Although the spotlight is on Adam Sandler, Jack Nickolson is the real star. He makes the movie truly hilarious. Sandler is also good, and though he's most known only for Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, Sandler was also hilarious in this movie. He is more laid back, and a lot less goofy than in some of his earlier comedies. While Nickolson steals most of the spotlight as far as funny lines, Sandler is actually the more serious character in this movie. The "monk scene" is one of the funniest scenes in a movie that i have ever scene (WILDEBEST!!!) The movie is full of laugh out loud jokes, and is, in my opinion, Adam Sandler's best work yet.
