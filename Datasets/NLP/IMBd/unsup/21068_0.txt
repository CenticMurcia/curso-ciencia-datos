This is the Best Biblical Movie Ever made to Date!!! It was extremely accurate in script & context. The portrayal by Luke (Richard Kiley) was superb! Bruce Marchiano was Spectacular in his role as Jesus! The scenes where Jesus interacts with children are heart warming. The scene with the gentile woman asking to heal her daughter is heart rendering. No one has ever played Jesus so well before!!! I loved how Jesus portrays love to all even while he is rebuking them for their wrong attitudes and self-righteousness. While there was violence, it was not excessive nor gratuitous. The casting for Peter was unique but acceptable. The only real problem I saw was the special effects in a couple of scenes. However, the outstanding performances made up for my disappointment.
