I found after I watched this movie I was just speechless! I couldn't believe what had happened to the Jews its so sad. I found that the storyline was great and Kristen Dunst was outstanding as she played the main role as Hannah.This movie isn't just a real life event but we also influence others on how not to treat people. I found as a teenager that this movie has influenced me so much I mean you can read books and everything but when you see such a terrific made movie your just speechless. I watched this movie in my English class after reading the book "Night". this movie I really recommend for any high school class you learn so much!
