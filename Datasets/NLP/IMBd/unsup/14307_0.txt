OK I think we all will agree the visual effects where outstanding, but this story has been done before (Land Before Time). I cant help but feel disappointed in this movie, It was nothing like I expected. First off the movie would have been better if the movie ended with the astroids instead of 10 minutes in to the movie. Second, it was showing off too much I mean come on how many times can we sit through a T-Rex chase. Third, the movie was way to violent I'm sure Disney was trying to appeal to teenagers but there not going to see it little kids ages 5-10 are. Well if you want to see a good family movie this summer go see Pokemon: the Movie 2000, I know I am.
