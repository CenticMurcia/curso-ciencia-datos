The movie is called First Spaceship on Venus in English. The guy before me called it "visually stunning". He must have the braille version. This movie tries, and any movie with Yoko Tuni can't be all bad, but the special effects, while ambitious, are pretty lame. The Venusians were about as scary as laundry flapping in the breeze.<br /><br />I watched this movie on my ~Sci-fi Classics 100 Movie Pack~- a great way to spend $20 bucks, by the way. First Spaceship on Venus is a crawler. Way too much moralizing, and not enough action.<br /><br />Yoko Tuni looks great in her silver space suit, so I have no regrets about watching this movie.
