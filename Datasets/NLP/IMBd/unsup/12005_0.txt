This is a modern version of a 1970s sleazy exploitation movie. Somebody went and got all the satanic talismans, upside-down crosses, lots of candles, and the kind of satanic nick-nacks that you can find at a Flea Market, novelty shops, or occult book store. <br /><br />What is up with the candles? There must have been a clearance sale on candles when the Special Effects department went shopping. Every time I see one of those movies were a scene has hundreds of candles lit, I wonder how uncomfortable was it for the actors and film crew? So many candles even on a film set must give off a lot of heat. Has anyone ever met a person (or cult) who really lights up their house with hundreds of candles? Talk about a fire hazard!<br /><br />Devil's Prey features lots of T & A teasing, skimpy outfits, and bare breasts if you rent the video (I saw it on TV where the breasts are fuzzed out). This movie is boring except when the really cute young ladies are prancing about, especially if you are viewing the film without the censorship-fuzzies. If you watch the TV version, then this movie is very very boring because all you can see are bouncing fuzzies. <br /><br />The plot is that a bunch of marginal youths who are into drugs and drug dealing get stuck in a satanic cult's land when their vehicle breaks down. They are captured by the cow-cult and scheduled to be sacrificed to the cow-god or something. There are a few bad guys who love to dress up in the ceremonial garb, laugh demoniacally, and they like to look at each other with demonic smirks. There is a bad girl who is sinfully cute, and if this movie were a swimsuit video it would have been a lot better.
