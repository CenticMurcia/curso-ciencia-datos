If i was to sum it up in one word it would be 'hilarious'<br /><br />I bought this DVD expecting it to be just live performances and stuff but it was filled with much more! Mike and Joe show us their artworks, we see Chester's tattoos (very amusing!) and we have 4 of their video clips, plus much more! Mike, Chester, Phoenix, Joe, Brad and Rob are just as funny as they are entertaining! We get to see the guys doing things they would normally be doing. It also includes the making of 'In the End,' two extra songs which aren't on their albums and 'Crawling' sung by Bryson Jones and the Sweethearts of the rodeo all-star band. This DVD is a must have for all Linkin Park fans, and fans will not be disappointed!
