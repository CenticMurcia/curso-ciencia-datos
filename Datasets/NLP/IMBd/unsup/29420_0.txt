Angelina is one of my favourite actresses. She is of a natural beauty and grasps your attention nearly automatically. She is very professional in acting and gives herself totally for a role. I think you can see that in this movie as well. In this movie she has to play a bad person (Julia). But there is some good in the character as well. You will notice this in different parts of the movie. The mysterious beauty and serenity of Angelina are important for this role. It gives the movie character bad and good sides at the time. From the beginning of the movie, you'll know something is wrong with Julia. This is also emphasized by the way the filming has done. The whole movie is shot with great camera perspectives and good sphere setting. This is due to the good work of the director Michael Cristofer.<br /><br />Antonio Banderas is also playing well. Antonio is the perfect romantic figure that the movie needed. On the other side he is aware what happens but lost himself in the love for Julia. This gives the tension between Antonio and Angelina which is an attractive aspect of the movie. Maybe you think this movie will be too romantic for some, but there is a good lot of tension in it. It's just not a simple love story. I think the acting, pace and storytelling in the movie are just right for the type of movie. If you like more than simple action movies, you like this one as well.
