After many years from seeing this performance on TV, I purchased the DVD, and after viewing it I had forgotten how amazing and entertaining this concert was. It is by far the best concert that I have seen to date. What sets it above the rest is the way Bob Fosse directed it. Not only does Liza and company give an outstanding performance but Fosse actually brings you up close and personal with his choice of camera angels, cut a ways to the audience, back stage shots and those beautiful close ups of Liza, you feel like you are there on stage. On the technical side, the costumes, sets and lighting are minimal but pack a powerful image that complements the entire show, kudos to the technical staff and designers. The sound and orchestra are right in sync with the dancers and Fosses choreography. I recommend this DVD and give it a Zen, (oops) I mean a ten. Thank you.
