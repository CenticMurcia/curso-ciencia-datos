Watching this collection of people both fascinated and disgusted me. The odd interchanges between the two "adults" were embarrassing, disjointed, truly horrible. The few scenes of kindness toward one another were almost worse than their mutual spitefulness. Watching the father with his multiple mouth fixations nearly made me gag. Usually I enjoy independent films; I can't see the reasoning behind any aspect of plot, character development (or lack thereof), or conflict. The only thing I felt was understandable was why the son had moved so far away from these self-centered, thoroughly unredeeming characters making up his creepy twisted family tree. If I really had it in for someone, I would force him to watch this inaccurately titled movie.
