This European co production recounts the lives of three people who tragically collide in an explosive threesome of oppression, forbidden passion, betrayal and revenge. Though at times hard to watch, the film is ultimately a provocative exploration of the human condition under great duress. Another reason to watch is to see its three now very well known stars, 9 years younger than they are now. This includes a teenage looking Julie Delpy, and a sexy, (speaking excellent French) fortyish Hanna Schygulla, in her last turn as a sexy beauty (albeit the older woman, but still stunning). Rent it. The NTSC Video is unfortunately not listed at Amazon.com (hint, hint, list it..), but I recently bought it in Canada, where the English subtitled version is available through Alliance-Atlantis/MCA Home Video. This is not a commercial plug, just a service to IMDb users like myself, who had heard about this unreleased film in the US and most of South America (though it was in Argentina), and may want to gain access to it. Watch it if you like a good psycho drama, in a historic context, with three of Europe's best actors.
