I've seen "The Eye" and "The Eye 2" and enjoyed them both, so when I heard about this one I got my hopes up that I could watch another scary horror movie.<br /><br />I settled down, and at the start it seemed as though that was exactly what we were going to be treated to ... but then it all went downhill. I found myself wondering whether the film was supposed to be a horror film or a comedy film. To me it was neither. There were some great scary moments in it, but then you'd get an attempt at some at comedy. Notice I said "attempt". I don't think I found any of it that funny at all, and all it did was ruin the suspense and horror aspect of the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The actors didn't really seem to know what to do or act in a lot of the scenes - and that didn't help either. The only saving grace is the length of the film - it's short!<br /><br />I've given it 3/10 only because some of the scary bits were quite well done, but don't take that as any sort of recommendation. My advice - give it a miss, especially if you've seen the first 2 and expect this to be anything like them.
