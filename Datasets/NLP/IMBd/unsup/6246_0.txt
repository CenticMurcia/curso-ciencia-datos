Raul Julia's finest moment as an actor was also one of the finest Latin American-themed films of all time. Julia portrayed the diligent bishop Oscar Romero with an aplomb which few actors could have embodied. Sadly, this film ends up as nothing but a blip on the map. Few people have actually experienced the power and creativity placed into this film. Perhaps it was too political or too dark, what ever the reason, it will remain one of my favorite films of all time. Perhaps years from now, the appreciation this movie deserves will be given to it.
