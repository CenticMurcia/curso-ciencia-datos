Though a very few people know about this hidden gem, "Perfectly Normal" is one of those comedies that can make you laugh, and at the same time adds a high profile depth of humanity to it, making it both entertaining and inspiring at the same time. It's a shame that this movie is so obscure and so overlooked because it deserves at least one look just for all-time sakes.<br /><br />Michael Riley plays the leading role as Renzo Parachi who works in a beer bottle factory and volunteers as a hockey goalie with his company's pathetic hockey team during the day and works as a cab driver at night. Renzo seems satisfied with his ordinary predictable lifestyle. His life takes a shift for the better as he picks up a con-artist named Alonzo Turner (Robbie Coltrane)who persuades Renzo to cash in his late mother's inheritance into an Italian Restaurant in which the crew must dress like opera characters and to entertain the customers with a floor show. <br /><br />Okay, so it's nowhere close to winning a Genie award, but the numerous subplots are what makes this zany comedy remarkably funny which is very similar to the more successful comedies like "Comfort and Joy" and "Lost in Translation". I can hardly wait till it comes out on DVD, it ones of those movies on my A-list.
