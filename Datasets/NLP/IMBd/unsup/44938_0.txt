I only watched this because it was on Film 4 last night, and wanted to see if it deserved the bad reviews, well it most certainly did.<br /><br />I am astounded that Channel 4 saw fit to invest in this vile film that just set out to shock.<br /><br />It also worries me that we have sunk as low as this in terms of humanity to consider this as entertainment,I love horror movies, but this had no redeeming features whatsoever.<br /><br />As an aside, if the people portrayed in this film are an accurate representation of young Britons abroad, then I'm glad I don't bother with run of the mill holiday resorts with the binge drinking and all that goes with it.
