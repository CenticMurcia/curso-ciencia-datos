I unfortunately own a copy of this movie, and I spring it on people when I'm feeling particularly evil. ;<br /><br />But seriously, the flick looks like the director gave up on it 5 minutes into the movie, and his replacement tried to put as much artsy-fartsy, has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie symbolism as he could. (although watch for the "Tic-Tac-Toe bathrobe guy, not only is it the director, he always gets cheered at the mass showings). You know a movie is bad when you have to dub an English speaking actress into English.<br /><br />This movie is prime MST3K fodder! In fact we're working on a MST style script for it now.<br /><br />NOT FOR THE FAINT OF STOMACH!!!
