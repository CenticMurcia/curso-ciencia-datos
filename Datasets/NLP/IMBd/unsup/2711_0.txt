I have given the 9 to this series, and I think I would vote with the 10 in case it was a traditional movie. On the day of the Russian TV release of "Master i Margarita" I watched a talk show with the director Vladimir Bortko who commented on this film saying it was a life necessity to create mini series rather than movie. The work is all too good to be mini, though.<br /><br />As has already been said, the plot summary for this movie is so oversimplified that it appears to be missing the essence of both the book by Bulgakov and the efforts of Bortko. Master and his passionately loved one, Margarita, have found what I would not call "the love." Their relationship, depicted by Bulgakov with his brilliant talent, broke the social borders, and so these people stood in line with "Woland's evil." They say that Master and Margarita are Faustian alter ego.<br /><br />The story told in this movie shows how those who are in love, who are free, and who are spiritual are able to (no matter with the help of Satan or not) see the "light." The idea of the light and the "rest" is a central point in the movie. Master and Margarita were in fact killed by a Woland's ally Azazello, and they were given the rest, but not in paradise... Bulgakov did not give them the light, but it was impossible for them to live in this world too. To me, it was rather painful to follow the love story of the two beloved through the series. Bulgakov is a brilliant dramatist.<br /><br />What about the characters? I liked all characters and I liked Begemot. Speaking about Margarita, I feel that Kovalchuk played not very well.<br /><br />The computer generated effects were very simple. :)<br /><br />In the end, I just want to add that if that mini series was a movie, the impression from it would be deeper. "Master i Margarita" is for everyone to watch. It is even more to be discussed by everyone.
