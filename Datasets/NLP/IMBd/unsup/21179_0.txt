I was really looking forward to this being a fan of Cary Grant, Irene Dunne and screwball comedies, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />My main concern was the dismal treatment of Gail Patrick's character (Bianca). It wasn't her fault that Irene Dunne (Ellen) wasn't dead yet she is treated so rudely and offhandedly that I found it irritating and frustrating.<br /><br />In addition it often simply wasn't funny.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this, watch and watch again "The Awful Truth" starring the same pair instead, and contrast the treatment of Ralph Bellamy's character with that of Patrick's.
