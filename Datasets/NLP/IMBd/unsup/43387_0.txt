[Includes a "spoiler"]<br /><br />Strangely enough, it is not often that Jason himself puts up an appearance in the fourth entry of the series. Why he is absent from such a large chunk of the film, I cannot be sure, but from a financial point of view, isn't that a bit counterproductive? After all, that's what the fans pay to see, Jason killing people, isn't that right? His absence reveals the movie for what it is: a bad teen melodrama that happens to guest-star Jason.<br /><br />Most of the characters are so annoying that we actually root for Jason to kill them, and so he does, but not nearly soon enough. That's the problem here; there's not enough slasher action to sustain such a thin plot. The result: a major bore. <br /><br />Granted, Corey Feldman and Crispin Glover have some appeal. Makeup artist Tom Savini obviously had a hand in the script, as Feldman is portrayed as a child prodigy with an interest in special effects. Glover generates some sympathy as a lonely young man. Savini himself does a good job crafting Jason's gruesome demise. However, these elements aren't enough to prevent the film from being a tired rehash. <br /><br />By now, it is useless to comment on the fact that Paramount lied when they said it was the last. Jason simply can't die, and we must live with that fact of life. <br /><br />* (out of ****)<br /><br />Released by Paramount Pictures
