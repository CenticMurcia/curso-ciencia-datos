Lets see, some poor idiot plays a clown for a living and barely makes any money. Everyone hates him and nothing goes right for him. He lives in a dump, people throw bottles at him and even his own mother insults him. Then he decides to be a transvestite clown for bachelor parties and is attacked and raped by three men! And that's the first 35 minutes of the film! Low budget film is a wretched mess made only because filmmaker Kevin Smith has a heart for fellow filmmakers and helped produce this abortion. Smith also acts in it! I don't know what else to say about it but its awful. If you forgot why you hated clowns then this will remind you why.
