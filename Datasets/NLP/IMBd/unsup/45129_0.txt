Combining stunningly inept film-making and obnoxious religious zealotry, this shot-on-video quickie manages to make the Apocalypse look, well, not really all that bad.<br /><br />Compared to, say, a radiation-scared Jason Robards stumbling through the smoking ruins of a nuked Kansas City in "The Day After" - this Peter & Paul Lalonde vision of the End Of Everything looks positively cheery and stress-free. Everyone is well scrubbed during the Tribulation and look like they get plenty of rest and regular meals. Sure, there's a bit of bother with the Antichrist, but that more-or-less sorts itself out and, anyway, the One World Order doesn't seem to affect anyones day-to-day routine like a 10 megaton thermonuclear weapon tends to.<br /><br />The only thing that saves this film is, well, nothing. Nothing saves this film. Sorry. I can't lie. "Apocalypse" is a complete waste of video tape from back to front. The wooden acting is unwatchable, the sets are poverty stricken and the script is lowest-common-denominator god-bothering trash that alternates between laughable and hackneyed.<br /><br />There are plays written by 7th graders that have more depth and nuance than this miserable pile of dime-store eschatology. But the absolute worst is the film's smug expectation of forbearance. It permeates every wretched frame like a sulfurous stink. "Apocalypse" expects it's audience to forgive it's definitive lack of anything even remotely resembling competence because it's intentions are good.<br /><br />And we all know which road is paved with good intentions.
