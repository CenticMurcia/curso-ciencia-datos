I recorded this gem off the "Foremost Movie" late one Sunday night and am surprised this film isn't more popular or available!! After watching so called 'Hollywood North' spring up over the last 20 years or so it's great to see where the true pioneers came from. Dogpound Shuffle was shot entirely in Vancouver sometime in 1973 and has a pre-Starsky and Hutch David Soul along with Ron Moody who apparently made his fame in Vaudeville in England. The story is basically about two down on their luck bums who spend most of the movie trying to raise enough money to get Steps dog, Spot(alternate title) out of the East Vancouver dog pound!! For anyone living in the lower East Side (one of the worst drug problems in the world) it's great to play recognize the location after watching "Rumble in the Bronx" one too many times. But God knows how you're going to do that when you can't find the movie ANYWHERE!! I seem to remember it appearing on e-bay awhile back but why the hell ain't it on DVD??
