I have a theory. First, we all know that French have had a love affair with Jerry Lewis' movies,...right?! Second, they MUST have seen this movie. Third, the French now HATE the UNITED STATES. So, I assume this movie is the reason. It's got to be--as this film only serves to enrage normal people.<br /><br />So, is it funny? Yep--for about 2 minutes. That's about the length of the airplane skit. It's VERY funny and highly original but hardly makes it worth sitting through this mess!! I am serious when I say this is one of the only movies I have seen that made me physically ill. The one and only time in my life I had a migraine occurred as I watched this and I know it was the fault of the movie!! For example, the movie begins as Lewis enters a therapist's office and spends the next 75 minutes slipping on the floor and sliding off the vinyl furniture. Okay, maybe it only lasted 30 minutes--but it seemed like it would go on forever. THEN, later in the film he repeated this sequence AGAIN!!!! My head felt like it was ready to explode!! Somebody needed to tell this man to STOP! Fortunately for the studio, this film was not released since they knew it was a bomb and it was later released on cable and video. For this, someone needs to pay! If you LIKE pain and want to see other Jerry Lewis monstrosities, see most of his flicks after his breakup with Dean Martin (particularly Slapstick of Another Kind) and avoid The King of Comedy (where Lewis did an excellent job playing it straight).<br /><br />PS--Despite its being raised to "classic status", The Nutty Professor wasn't funny. At least without the use of alcohol, drugs or a severe blow to the head.
