This show was absolutely addictive, the storyline was perfect, the acting was perfect and the characters were so unbelievably unrealistic I thought I was watching a recording of real life. It was perfectly cast and set in the right setting (1980's). It would've most definitely been a dominate television show if not been canceled, but the only bad part would be that long depressing state between seasons when all i can think about is more Freaks & Geeks. My older brother said that i watch stupid shows and i had him watch Freaks & Geeks and couldn't get him to stop watching them. For everyone who ever lived, this is, to put it simply, the best.
