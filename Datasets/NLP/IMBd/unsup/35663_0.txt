Spoilers.<br /><br />I rented this one back around Halloween of 1988. I was hoping to be scared, because (as usual), the previews made it look good.<br /><br />So there's this weird dream everyone seems to be having. The words are garbled, so you can't understand it. The footage is grainy. It was made at the height of popularity for the 'shaky camera' videography technique (watch reruns of the first season of NYPD Blue and you'll know what I mean). And they play this clip over and over and over and over andÂ… You get the point. It was almost as bad as that '8 more days 'til Halloween' jingle from Halloween 3, Season of the Witch (an even worse movie). But at least there wasn't a song stuck in my head for the next week.<br /><br />If you like lots of bugs, this movie is for you! I personally don't find bugs scary in the least. I think it's a cheap way to freak people out without spending anything for special effects. 'Hey, Larry. Dump another box of roaches in front of the camera!' Yep, bugs galore. But bugs = Satan? That's where you lost me.<br /><br />So then they play that dream clip a few more million times. I know I mentioned this, but I'm trying to take you there on the short tour. Man, this new shaky camera thing is all the rage! Woo hoo!<br /><br />At the end, the girl gets sucked into the mirror with Satan and she's floating underwater in another dimension. You can see his big Satany arm grabbing for her. Then someone smashes the mirror, trapping both of them in there. You then see the look on her face as she realizes just how royally screwed she is. That was the only decent part of the movie.<br /><br />It makes you wonder why they didn't just smash the mirror in the first 5 minutes.
