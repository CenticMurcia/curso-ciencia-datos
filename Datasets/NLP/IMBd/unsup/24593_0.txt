In a non-specific city somewhere in the U.S.(New York? Chicago?),a sullen,carrot-eating loner named Smith(Clive Owen,clearly relishing his chance to be as unkempt and gnarled as possible,among other things in the movie)witnesses a pregnant woman being chased by a violent man for reasons unrevealed. Against his better judgment,he jumps into the fray and becomes embroiled in what ultimately turns into a war of wits(and guns,of course)with a frothy,flop-sweating--but scarily intuitive and intelligent--crime boss named Hertz(Paul Giamatti,spitting and hissing his lines with dangerous intensity). Along for the ride are the baby Smith delivered and the gorgeous,Italian prostitute(Monica Bellucci,smokingly hot)who is something close to a girlfriend and the only person he can trust.<br /><br />While the plot seems forced,and the tempo and pacing of the film knows only one speed(well,okay,maybe two),the film is so rife with eye-catching and dazzling stunts,acrobatics and gun-play,and tied together with dialog that seems to be lifted and dried off from old James Bond movies(perhaps a nod to Owen's flirtation with becoming the next 007)that it is perversely enjoyable for its own excesses. Director and writer Michael Davis keeps it lean and very mean as he uses eyes for dimension to let the viewer in on the ping-ponging action,not using much more dialog than necessary and keeping a sly running joke having to do with the sort of happily violent relationship between Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. The expression "This'll put hair/fuzz on your peaches"comes to mind when I think of this film,and it will appeal to a basically select(read:guys,mostly)audience,but that audience should be pleased with a movie like Shoot'em up. You'll get more shots than just ammo with this 90 minute-plus ride.
