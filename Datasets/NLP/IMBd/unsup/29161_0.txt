Ever since I was a little girl, I loved Darkwing Duck! I loved the way he said, "I am the terror that flaps in the night..." and the way he talked with his smooth, dark voice. I even loved his naughty, mischievous, little daughter Gosalyn, because she was spirited! I wish Disney had made a Darkwing Duck movie because I loved this series from the beginning to the end! I wish they had a fourth season or even more, and I could have seen, "Pranks for the Memories," if they hadn't canceled the good series after the end of season 3 because it was a very good series. I missed good old Darkwing Duck after they removed the show from Toon Disney and replaced it with Jetix.
