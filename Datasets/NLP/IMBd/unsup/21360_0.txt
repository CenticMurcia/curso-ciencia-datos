Of course the previous versions are better, i have to agree with that. But even if it wasn't what i expected it to be, it still is a good movie. It's another genre that doesn't fit into a trilogy with the first 2 ones and yes it becomes a (lightweight) comedy at some moments but that doesn't mean its a bad movie. So i gave it a 7 in his kind, not comparing it with the previous movies of "the eye".<br /><br />For people who think comedy and thriller/horror in one movie is bad, then you certainly don't like this one and you don't like the American's "scary movie's" also.<br /><br />greetz
