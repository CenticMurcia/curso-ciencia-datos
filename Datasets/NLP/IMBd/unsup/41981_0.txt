This movie was good... about as good and tasty as a cow manure sandwich! Every now and then, I suffer through watching movies made by a group of severely UNartistic and UNtalented people. I like to see how NOT to make a movie. I'm just not a fan at all of these "campy" horror flicks. Sometimes they turn out to be more comedy than anything, laughing at how dumb the whole thing is... with Uncle Sam I mostly just rolled my eyes, lookin' forward to the ending credits.
