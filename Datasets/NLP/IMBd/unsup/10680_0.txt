This is the cheap mans phantom of the opera.Did Disney really think no one would notice? I mean seriously just change the word "megaplex" with the word opera! I really hate this movie. I really do. This movie has horrible acting, horrible plot development and just about everything else. Though it does have its few moments but those wont last long at all. This movie just suffers from being a ripoff i mean if you have seen phantom of the opera you would know what i am talking about. I have seen this movie once and hopefully i will never have to go threw the torture of watching it again! This movie could have been a nice little kiddy movie but it wasn't. STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS
