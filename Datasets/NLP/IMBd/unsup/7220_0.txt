Joe Pesci, Marisa Tomei, Ralph Macchio, and Fred Gwynne are very fine actors who make this movie a total success. Joe Pesci plays Cousin Vincent "Vinny" Gambini, a upstart lawyer from New York who goes to Alabama to defend Billy(Ralph Macchio, "The Karate Kid" and "The Outsiders") and his friend from being executed for a murder they didn't commit. First, they thought they were arrested for shoplifting, instead the clerk was shot to death. Vinny and his fiancée Mona Lisa Vito(Tomei) goes to motel to motel. Tasting hominy grits for the first time, meeting a judge(Gwynne) who doesn't play around, and dealing with his argumentative fiancée. Vinny's inexperience cause problems, yet when he does get the taste of courtroom drama, he gives out his serving of justice to the platter. When the pictures of the car tracks racks his brain, his sudden sense of getting the answers get his cousin and friend out of the hot seat. The judge was impressed with his work, yet he doesn't agree with his methods. A masterpiece of comedy, well done! 5 stars!
