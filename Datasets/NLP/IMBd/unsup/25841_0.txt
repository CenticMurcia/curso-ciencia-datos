This is one of the best pieces of creative work. What makes this movie even more powerful is the fact that it is based on truth. It makes one realize how lucky one is to be born free and live & breath in environment where there are no shackles. It instills in you the love for free world where one is born and where life runs and smiles and where humanity prevails over the anguish & pain of inhuman torturous places like Devils Island. We must learn to love our freedom while we still have it. The movie portrays the horrors of solitary excellently and of all the worst things that a human may do to the other, i think solitary lies at the lowest level of humanity. You can feel it through, the unbearable distress of solitary confinement and how it cripples all you ability to think and believe. I think Mcqueen was excellent there. I recommend this for all those who have the desire to understand the urge of running from a hell like devils island and back into the world, our world!
