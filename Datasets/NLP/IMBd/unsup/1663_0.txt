Musical about Randolph Scott and Irene Dunne falling in love when he inherits a dress shop (named Roberta's) in Paris. The romance is OK but the dialogue is terrible (if Scott had said "swell" one more time I was going to throw up!); Scott is big, hunky and unbearably handsome but seems very uncomfortable in his role; Dunne is absolutely gorgeous but wooden and her singing got on my nerves (her operatic version of "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes" was ear-splitting). And there are way too many fashion show sequences.<br /><br />But I'm still giving this an 8. Why? Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. When they're on screen the movie leaps to life. They're both young, full of energy, in very playful moods and seem to have a great time working together (unlike later movies). Their dancing, singing and interplay is just great--there's a sort of "dance fight" near the beginning that's just unbelievable. This movie is a must see just for them. Also Lucille Ball is purportedly a fashion model in this but I didn't see her.<br /><br />So, see it for Astaire and Rogers...just fast forward through the rest of it or grit your teeth and bear it.
