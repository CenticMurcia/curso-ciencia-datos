Didn't Hollywood get this putrid mess out of their systems back in the 70's when filming all those abysmal James Bond dogs? Now they come back with a rehash of the same old crap with 2 popular actors; who, I might add, could and have done better. This turkey never left the ground it was so weighted with a dull script and terminally stupid dialogue. Had the producers cut out all the silly one liners and unrealistic footage, the show would have lasted about 10 minutes. Travolta deserves better than this, but I guess he couldn't say no to the payday.
