This is a hoot -- a Mexican drug family with few redeeming qualities, corrupt politicians, and fumbling DEA officers. If there's one problem it's that there's almost too much going on -- were it a series, the action would take longer to play out. Picture it as a drug cartel family soap opera. The first episode alone was hilarious --a wacko cousin of the Kingpin doesn't like it when Kingpin's wife shoots her mouth off, so he plans to tear off her blouse and whip her! And this is when he isn't feeding the body parts of his victims to his pet tiger! Needless to say, he gets it in the end because he's a threat to the family business. But there are lots of other nutso people running around, causing trouble. The only weak spot is Brian Benben as a plastic surgeon/drug dealer who's too goofy to take seriously. Overall, though, the whole thing is murder, mayhem and kitsch with a unique latin flair.
