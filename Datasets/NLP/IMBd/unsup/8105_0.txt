Martha (Monica Potter) is single, sexy and she's so sick of her life she's off to London with the last of her money.<br /><br />Daniel (Tom Hollander) is single, successful and after one look at Martha he thinks he's in love. Frank (Rufus Sewell) is one of Daniel's friends, despite the fact he is always trying to get one up on him. Lawrence (Joseph Fiennes) is another of Daniel's friends, and he is always caught between Frank and Daniel as they jostle for supremacy.<br /><br />The casing and script are both strong, and the feel of the movie is nice and original, even with the usual clich√©s in the romance element. It's funny, it's romantic and it has sex appeal for both men and ladies, so obviously its worth a watch; if you don't try it, you'll never know.<br /><br />7/10
