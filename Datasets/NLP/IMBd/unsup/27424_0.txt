Visually rich, somewhat slow paced, and hung together by varied amounts and quality of connection between the characters and a slight plot, the film manages to hold audience attention and intrigues the viewer. Many fascinating new faces to watch, moderate amount of tension, excellent acting, and an interesting-enough story line make this Canadian film worth seeing.
