Here a pretty cool little Spanish exploitation flick from the 70s that definitely exercises the old saying "two wrongs don't make a right". Or in this dude's case it's "six wrongs" that comprise his whole downfall, turning him from a mild-mannered, poverty stricken butcher to a full-fledged serial killer. It all begins when he and his chick hail a taxi, start busying it up in the backseat, annoying the driver. When things get ugly between them after the couple is kicked out of the cab, the drive starts wailing on the girlfriend, which results in a "heroic" rescue, leaving one very dead driver... So she's now freakin' over what happened and when she threatens to go to the police, homeboy strangles her and keeps her body in his bedroom. Soon, the guy's brother returns from a trip, finds the body and is bashed with a monkey wrench... Brother's girlfriend shows up looking for him, finds the TWO bodies and has her throat slit. You get the idea... Witnesses come along quicker than this guy can murder them and it's stressing him out. He also develops a strange, suggestively homosexual friendship with a nearby dog-walker and bumps uglies with the saucy waitress of the local diner... Both of these acquaintances are desperately shielded from his sadistic rampage - sort in the vain of those old sitcoms. Keep the guest out of the secret room! Apparently, a half dozen bodies stashed in a room in your rundown hovel for an unspecified amount of time will lead to some 'funk' not all find too pleasant... What do you do about that? Well, this guy hacks 'em up and dumps 'em off at work... The slaughterhouse... "The Cannibal Man" is entertaining enough, though not all that gory or stocked with T & A, yet it moves along briskly, has a nice solid story with good pacing, and establishes the characters well. Recommended!
