Alright, I've seen worse. The problem is this one had a 2.5 million dollar budget. What happened? Did the producers try to shoot it on a weekend?? Someone got so busy blowing smoke they thought they were reinventing the way a car rolls; we get it, we really do- stop spinning your wheels turbo. Screwed up people, killing and screwing stupid kids. let's deal with that and leave our twists and turns for the end. <br /><br />Twenty minutes could've been cut off this movie and possibly saved it; unfortunately, it can only afford to lose ten and still be considered a feature; however, that's ten viewers could have back so here's some suggestions for the DVD release. Opening sequence where we give everything away? Why?? Gratuitous sex scene with no Tn'A? Why?? Can we get stoned and listen to this song? Why?? I don't need to see two fools flirt, while ones girlfriend is havin' a snooze to understand what goes on when they "get wood." I get this from a nice job of acting by Vanessa Viola as Amy. Moreover, the sinister look as Ben and Brielle leave the motel, from Grandma? WHY!!!! Are you idiots? There's ten minutes gone in the first fifteen; furthermore, some of it was a SPOILER IN YOUR OWN MOVIE!!<br /><br />By the way I've seen far worse acting in better films. There were a few decent performances here, James Burns is fun as the sheriff with some nice campy one-liners, with the exception of, "let's equalize this." I also thought Trevor Torseth as Kane stumbling out from behind the tree exuded an intensity and malice not characteristic of bad acting. But if there is a sequel, put a bag over his head or a mask; I'd love to find out how much the producers saved on their make-up budget. Hope they had a nice luncheon in Beverly Hills. NEXT TIME SPEND YOUR MONEY SMARTER!!<br /><br />Overall this film suffered by not embracing the "stupid" convention of horror films. Too many people in this production took themselves far too seriously, from Actors all the way up to Producers.<br /><br />Oh wait! I almost forgot, " The Family tree." HA! PLEASE!!!!! Or did we have to have it so, "the family f*** fest" line would work. In retrospect I'm not sure if the INCEST HAMMER was sufficient.
