I picked up cable -- it's as lousy as I remember with the same B-movies you would expect, but with 355 channels now instead of 99. Out-of-Towers is one of the B-movies. Playing 459 times this month on all the Bad B-movie channels, Steve Martin plays a watered down Neal Page from "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," a much superior movie. Goldie Hawn plays a bimbo with smarts again, but one thing that was neat about her role is that they acknowledge her age and "over-the-hill" sex appeal that someone like Richard Gere still hasn't figured out. John Cleese reprises p****d-off hotel manager Basil Fawlty from the very funny BBC show "Falwty Towers" and gets a good amount of laughs, even if one is a cheap cross-dressing joke. Plus its great to see the Kids in Hall star Mark McKinny get slapped by one of his his mentors, Python's Cleese. Do some laundry, dishes, sort through your video collection like I did; it has some good moments. Not a great movie, but ok to watch maybe once. Average C-. 6.8 of of 10.
