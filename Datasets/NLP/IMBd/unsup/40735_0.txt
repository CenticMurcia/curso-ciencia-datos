I picked up this movie with the thought that it would be a low-grade campy, poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly shot horror film, but it would at least be entertaining.<br /><br />I was right about everything but the last bit.<br /><br />There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The action sequences are awful, looking as though they were choreographed by a drunk homeless man the crew picked up off the streets of Tokyo. The writing is done in similar fashion, though perhaps "drunk homeless man" gives too much credit to the writing team. They may have taken the "100 monkeys at typewriters" metaphor literally, because that is the only remotely feasible explanation I can come up with for this nonsense. The acting is terrible, with the title character looking like constipated cardboard 95% of the time and looking like the East Bunny with Dracula fangs the other 5% (more on that travesty later.).<br /><br />The movie itself resembles nothing more than a series of poorly edited clips that aren't even cut together in the correct order. There are several moments where something like this will happen: a character will fall over with no bullet wound, there will be a close-up shot of a gun firing, then another view of the dead character (now complete with gunshot wound to the head) in a totally different room than the one that they died in, in a completely different position! Also, the movie looks as though it were assembled of entirely first takes. There looks to be absolutely no effort and even less talent on the part of the camera/directing crew.<br /><br />The final nail in the coffin has got to be the horrendous "special" effects. Bottle rockets for bullets. These "bullets" actually caused the only laugh for me in this movie as they were ricocheting off of the PAPER WALLS. Plastic skeletons. Rubber monsters. Sword sound effects that sound as though they were ripped straight from the first season of the "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers" TV show. Gallons of fake blood erupting out of the most ridiculous places. While excessive blood is usually funny in a movie of this style, in this case it feels as though they are trying to pass it off as serious. Never a good thing. Lastly, this ridiculous "werewolf" suit that resembles nothing so much as a mange-ridden Easter Bunny with Dracula fangs.<br /><br />If I could rate this movie lower than a 1, I would.
