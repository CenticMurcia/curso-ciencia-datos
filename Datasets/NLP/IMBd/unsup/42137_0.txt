I hated this movie. It meandered pointlessly and unevenly with no hint of realism. Everybody in this film- all these so called friends- were so impossibly cheery in the face of disillusion and disease. That is not how I experience life. I mean- how odd that these acquaintances were so cute, so quirky, so forgiving- no matter what the crisis. Doesn't sound like anyone I know. I suppose the writer/director was aiming toward a light comic drama. However, in my humble opinion, the fluff of this film so encrusts any depth this script might had with a sugary- I'll-love- you-no- matter- what- you- do- even- if- you- kill- a- guy- and- you- can- have- sex- with- whoever- you- want-and -adjust- your- morality- to- whatever- situation- you- want candy coating. This film will entertain a liberal crowd, but film buffs should stay away.
