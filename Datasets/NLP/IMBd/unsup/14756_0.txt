I picked up this DVD for $4.00 today and just finished watching it. I've watched a whole lot of really bad independent films, but I guess I'm just an eternal optimist. Green was one of the better ones I've seen in a while. It was clear that the director had a vision for this film. He knew exactly what he wanted and he made it happen. It's well acted and the script touches on some very serious topics, but with quite a bit of humor thrown into the pot to make it all go down easier. <br /><br />If you're looking for something different, but well made, then Green might be just what you're looking for. Go ahead and take a chance on it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
