Dialog which is a little "off", and a certain kind of pointlessness pervade this film. Lancaster is a suicidal parachutist but we're never told why, nor do we get hints (why he's suicidal, not why he's a parachutist). Kerr's attitude is perplexing, unclear. Half of the time one is either wondering what a particular dialog was about or why a character said something or reacted in a certain way.<br /><br />The aerial sequences are the highlight of the film... Basically, this is a mediocre drama, but whenever one stumbles on a mediocrity and Frankenheimer's name is attached to it  it's never a surprise.<br /><br />What IS surprising, to say the least, is that Le Grande Dame of British Cinema actually shows her breasts! I am referring to Deborah Kerr. This completely threw me away; the absolutely last thing I expected to see in this film was Kerr topless. And now the big question is: how did Frankenheimer convince Kerr - of all actresses - to bare her bosom in 1969?... And at the age of 48?... Did they drug her (like they did with Julie Andrews's character in "S.O.B.")? Or is she really that dumb to be duped by a slime-ball such as Frankenheimer that "it's all for the good of the ART"? Whatever the answer, one thing is for sure: Frankenheimer must have special talents we know nothing of! (Certainly very little directorial talent, but otherwise) His power of persuasion must be immense. What a diplomat he would make. They should send this guy to the Middle East. Or Kashmir. Or the Balkans. Or East Timor.
