I love Jean Reno. He just has that air about him that makes a great detective.<br /><br />Here he plays a retired police detective that was drummed out under mysterious circumstances, or was he? He teams up with a Police Captain (Jocelyn Quivrin) to solve some mysterious gruesome murders in Paris.<br /><br />In the meantime, some nefarious things are going on with the police and the military that involve a policeman's wife (Arly Jover).<br /><br />Nothing is what it seems in this film. You are constantly surprised and reassessing who to cheer for. While things seem to tie together at the end, there are still questions.<br /><br />Great direction by Chris Nahon, who did Kiss of the Dragon. Great cinematography and music, and great acting, especially by Jean reno.
