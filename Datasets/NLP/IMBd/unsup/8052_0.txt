This film is quite good,very dreamy,and the nudity itself quite pleasant.The spider scene staggers belief!But imagine the room is full of opium smoke,and the film makes sense immediately.Its a bit like the unreal feeling of a heavy flu,it doesnt matter whats going on,its all happening anyway.Dont expect much more than what it obviously gives,and indulge in euro-trash at its most surreal.
