This game is a fine example of how one is supposed to use the new media. The story really grabs you tight and the only thing you want is more.<br /><br />Mankind is fighting a losing war for survival in a galactic war against the evil catlike race Kilrathi. The game begins at the carrier "Tiger's Claw" and evolves quickly to an engrossing story about humanity's finest hour.<br /><br />I surely can recommend this game!
