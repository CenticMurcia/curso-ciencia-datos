For me this film is the best of Jarmusch and one of my favorites films ever. The reason is simple: Is original, yes this film is one of the most originals films in a lot of years, the five stories, the five different cities and is all only in one night, for me that is awesome and excellent because Jarmusch is the only filmmaker that could do that. About the film: well my favorite story is the one with Roberto Benigni that takes place in Rome, the reason is Benigni, because for me this is the funniest performance of Benigni and well the story is great, the part when Benigni tell his story about the sheep is just very funny and of course the other five stories are great. The other story that i loved is the one that takes place in New York with "Helmut" is very funny and i think that Jarmusch want that: funny and great stories with a message like the message in the one that takes place in Paris, whit the blind girl and the taxi driver. Well this all i can say about a great film and well i have to say that hope that you can see this film and enjoy Roberto Benigni, Winona Ryder and more (yes the cast is great). Night on earth: 10 Roberto Benigni: 10
