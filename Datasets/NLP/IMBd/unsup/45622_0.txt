Me and a friend sat down to watch this movie last night, I hardly know where to start... I kept looking on my watch to see how far we were in, and how long it would drag on. Clive Owen made it so terribly monotone, the end of the movie couldn't come fast enough for me. It offered nothing new, nothing surprising, there was not one moment where I thought 'Wow! that's original'! There was no bonding with the characters at all, nor were they likable enough to Not need a background story. We kept on guessing the movie would show what 'it got' in the next 5 minutes, and we kept repeating that to ourselves every 5 minutes, but when the movie ended it still had not happened. To me it was a big let down. I was tricked into seeing it after seeing the positive rating on IMDb, and the positive comments, so I guess enough people like this kinda movies. Just if you're more into a fast paced stories, I suggest you skip this movie.
