This is the movie that has been cloned more times than sheep and hamsters combined. Bruce Willis shines and stars in this high tech action thriller. Everyone knows what the movie is about. Everyone knows how the movie will end. That doesn't mean that it isn't GREAT. It is the best Bruce Willis movie to date, in my opinion. Die Hard with a Vengeance was almost as good as this was. Go see the trilogy today. 3 3/4th *'s out of 4 *'s.
