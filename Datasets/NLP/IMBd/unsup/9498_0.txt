I think the people who just reject this film out of hand should really rent "American Pimp" or some other documentary on prostitution. The question you really have to ask yourself is, "What makes Han-Ki so amazing?" Han-Ki is a form of the superman in pimp form- he is superpimp. And the definitive action of a pimp is the turning out of the girl. Thus, you should realize at the end that Han-Ki was, in fact, trolling for talent at the beginning of the film. The entire film ties back in on itself, a trope which was hinted at via the beach sequences. Han-Ki, being superpimp, saw Sun-Hwa and immediately recognized her as the natural she turned out to be. Thus, there is no "revenge" in this film. And the ending, with the two united in their relationship via a bordello-on-wheels, is a brilliant joke. For God's sake people, if you're going to watch Kim's films, you're going to have to think!
