I just have to say that this was the worst movie I have ever seen. And to think the writer is trying to teach my video class...<br /><br />The movie is a waste of valuable time. Don't even bother. If you must watch it, check out episode 405 of Mystery Science Theater 3000, even then it was hard to get through without walking away. The only payoff of the MST3K is the end credits where they say it was the worst movie ever.<br /><br />The author himself claims that E.T. was a ripoff of this movie, but I think that Time Walker (Being from Another Planet) is a ripoff of E.T. and written much better.<br /><br />Other than the lacking plot line, the acting is simply horrible. Not much more to say about it.
