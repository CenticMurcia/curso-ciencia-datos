Guys and gals alike will like this one, just be patient. There is a real story here, clearly understandable and enjoyable by everyone, just give it a chance.<br /><br />Anyone who as a teen has wrestled with grown-up problems can understand clearly what is being told by this movie.<br /><br />Guys, shouldn't be too quick to dismiss this as "a chick flick" because you will be missing an inside to women that can be very informative.<br /><br />And the acting is well done, too. Kudos even to stiff-board Brolin for adding believability to his dumb runaway father character. Brooke Adams is believable as the low income mom trying to cope with her daughters' problems. Ione Skye puts a whole different view on the "easy girl" we remember for high school. And Fairuza Bulk puts a nice believable twist on her role as narrator learning about real love.
