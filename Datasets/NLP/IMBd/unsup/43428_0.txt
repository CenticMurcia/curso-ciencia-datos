Having just sat through this it is hard to put into words exactly what the viewing experience was like.<br /><br />The plot is pretty much the same as every one of these type of films - Some ancient artifact creates or resurrects a monster, people run around a bit and the monster is killed.<br /><br />What saves this film from rating a 1 is that it is hilarious (but not at the points where it is supposed to be). There seems to be more pointless and stupid chases in this film than any I've seen for a while.<br /><br />The monster looks pretty fake but is not so bad that it ruins the film. The music is totally awful and is almost as bad as the dodgy disco music from Friday the 13th Part 3.<br /><br />The acting and wardrobe are slightly on the dodgy side but it just adds to the charm of this gem of a film.<br /><br />One to see and then try to forget.
