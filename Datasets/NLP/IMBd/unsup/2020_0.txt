Must admit it was the cover that sold me on this one - 3 foxy Asian chicks in sexy cat suits and tooled up - and its a belting movie as well... Qi Shu plays Lynn who with her younger sister Sue(Vicky Zhao) run a high-tech assassination group - they do this because their Father designed a satellite surveillance system but got murdered by the gangsters who wanted it for themselves and the two sisters undertake to revenge themselves. Lynn manages to gain access to the baddies HQ and guided by Sue who runs all the techie stuff manages to kill the Chairman - one neat trick is too flood the building security systems with music - in this case The Carpenters Close to Me - so you end up with a kick ass Kung-Fu fight sequence set to Burt Bacharach.....which you don't see too often.... A local maverick cop(Hong at Hong - Karen Wong) is soon on their trail - things become complicated when the next hit they undertake turns into a set-up and soon the two sisters are fighting for their lives while trying not get arrested. Soon we are up to ears in car chases,gunfights and HK action fighting - all brilliantly done by Coery Yeun(who was involved with both Crouching Tiger and The Matrix) - there is a also a central bond between the two sisters that provides an emotional core that acts as a counter-balance to all the action. An event takes place half way through that is the pay-off to all this and Sue and Hong join forces against the rest of the bad guys(more than a hint of John Woo's The Killer) resulting in some really stunning stunts and wire-work. The whole thing culminates in a bloody samurai sword fight and with more than a hint of lesbianism thrown in this is the kind of movie that Taratino gets his rocks off to.... The 3 leads are all excellent - Qi Shu is stunningly beautiful(she was the girl in The Transporter) and the whole thing is done with such style and grace it proves just how ahead of the pack Hong Kong still is.
