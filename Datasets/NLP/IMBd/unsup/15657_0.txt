How come Hollywood doesn't make movies like this? Comedies like this? Here we have a story built from scratch that reminds me of the old John Candy days. It starts off with this guy who wants to buy some weed. And I mean it jumps right into it. Right when the movie starts, this guy is talking about all the weed he wants. He gets it then gets busted. Now his friends don't have they weed they thought they were going to have. So they got to hit the road and make things happen for themselves. But it's not going to be so easy. They get caught up in some stuff that had me praising this movie. I don't want to spoil the entire thing but you have to see for yourself. Let me just say that the filmmakers had some balls doing this, but that's what we need more of. We need people to take chances and stop being scared because Hollywood has their own "way of doing things" The actor who played the cop/security guy, he needs some props and I am going to give it to him. The guys who made this movie, they get props too. Aside from being very very very funny, they said, all the hell with it and made a good original comedy that is not going to remind you of anything else. Go watch it and take a break from all the Hollywood remakes, sequels, old TV show movies, and Comic book cartoon movies. See this movie!
