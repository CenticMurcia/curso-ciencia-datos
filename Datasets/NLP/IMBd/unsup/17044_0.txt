This is a strange movie. The title, the DVD cover, the 18 rating (in Germany) all suggest it's at least soft porn. But it comes out as very much else.<br /><br />If you don't want to be spoiled, don't read this - for to give justice to "Naked Fear", one must discuss the ending ten minutes as much as the rest.<br /><br />One might summarize it in a headline: "Crime statistics reversed - last year: 5 women disappeared, this year: 5 woman molesters killed". The first part takes up most of the film, in gripping intensity (and yes, no porn at all) it builds an incredible tension - and then we get a maybe oversimplified, but ultimately satisfying solution.<br /><br />Is this a feminist movie? I can't really tell - but the solution appears to be much more on the female side than, say, Thelma & Louise. Those were in less thrilling troubles, and ultimately went down in bliss - Diane here takes her summary revenge, becoming a terminatress, and seems to live on quite happily (ever after?)<br /><br />Even though I'm male and got attracted by the promise of frontal nudity, I now find this film strong for totally different reasons. The concept of being hunted in a wilderness (wasn't New Mexico where Steve Fossett went missing for half a year without trace?) does not depend on gender. And the woman's point of view comes over very convincingly. Very strong piece.
