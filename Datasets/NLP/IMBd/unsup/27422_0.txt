I really feel the splendid ideas of scripts and the good quality of cinematographer and music too. But overall, this s a second-handed-European-kind-of-style film that might be hundreds out there ever year in Europe and all better than this one. This one is not so fell into place. The pace is not nessecerrily slow and dreadful yet the links of 5 senses are too weak and trying too hard to be connected. It's much like it tries too hard, too hard to wanted to fall in 5 senses in order to speak the film's name. I really believe Jeremy could do better with much mature skill after years practice. Mary-Louise Parker is so not acting well this time, really not knowing what's wrong with her depth of acting, it's just as on the surface as the tone and expression she acts. anyway, I love art films like life, this one, really is a well intentions and ideas but so poor in flavor and style.
