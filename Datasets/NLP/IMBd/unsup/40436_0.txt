This is possably the worst movie ever made! Even the beautiful Natasha Henstridge suck in this movie! I have no clue what so ever to how this movie even got past editing, cause they had to see how very, very, very bad it was there...<br /><br />Stay clear of this one! I just want to cry because I spent $4 renting it...
