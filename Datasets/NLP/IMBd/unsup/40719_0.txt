Don't know how these good reviews came about. Must have been related to the actors. This is beyond atrocious. Let me count the ways: 1. cringingly over-acted by supposed 'high school' students who look about twenty-five years old. They even ride a little yellow bus to school. Totally absurd. My 5 year old niece has performed "I'm a Little Teapot" with more skill. Hell, she's like Brando next to these people. 2. the killer, once revealed, chases the unsuspected 'teens' through a warehouse whilst slowly meandering around taking her old sweet time to do her 'deeds'. Of course the 'teens' can't get away from her despite her slow knife-wielding saunter through the hallways-- she's like Michael Myers with a D cup. (Although that is an insult to Michael Myers.) 3. the 'teens', whilst running from this hideous frightening killer (who wears a snarl like she's posing for her 'high school' picture on a bad hair day), look like they studied acting with cartoon characters right down to the double takes, the "I want to get away, someones chasing me, but I think I'll stand here and wait for her to come down the hall", and rounding the corners as if wearing clown shoes. I could go on, but suffice it to say, in a few final words: avoid like the plague. Although even the plague would be preferable.
