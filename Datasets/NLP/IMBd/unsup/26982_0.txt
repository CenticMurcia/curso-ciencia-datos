Jason Momoa is an ABSOLUTE GOD!!!!! His presence dominated the entire movie...I kept staring at him throughout the entire show...I didn't know they made men like him!!! (YUMMY!) I thought the movie was beautifully played, excellent location. I thought Emma was a bit too old for him though, and the fact that Jason looked too young to have a fifteen year old son! that threw me a bit. I didn't feel the chemistry between them...but HELLO!!! if I had to leave a home where I felt unappreciated to go to a tropical paradise and met Jason..I would be on him in seconds!! he is just so absolutely perfect. Even though Emma's role was uncertain at times just having Jason's presence in the movie made everything worth watching again...and again...and again...
