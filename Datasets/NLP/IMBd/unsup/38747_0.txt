and by ever I mean of the last 10-12 years. this movie makes jack frost look good. Believe the nay sayers. but then, if you actually are browsing these reviews to consider this movie, you probably have some semblance of what makes a good movie.<br /><br />Don't rent it- you will be compelled to demand another free rental in lieu of the time & $$$ you wasted. just don't watch it. ok it says I gotta write more. ON that skull thing at the beginning: I can make better computer animations with MS paint. Go evesdrop on a random neighbor's conversation- it will provide more interesting dialouge than is in this movie.<br /><br />This movie has the fake-est southern accent I have ever had the sheer chalkboard-against-fingernails repulsion to experience. The villians in the 2nd story I could have beat up in my sleep. those 3 were about as evil as marshmellow peeps.
