Well directed, brilliantly acted and filmed, basically it seemed to be about the earth fighting back, maybe trying to shake off the humans responsible for seemingly devastating it. Very sad in this respect, but a movie that needs to be seen, hopefully to get people thinking about their impact as a collective mass that everyone is having on this poor planet we call home, often to the detriment of all other forms of life which have suffered terribly in one way or another, and I think this is what was being shown in the film, and the spirit of the earth and it's misplaced creatures rising up conveyed this message very well, though not in such detail as to spoil the mysterious effect but in ghostly ways that were just right, not too little and not too much, but just enough to get the message home to what it was really all about. Maybe the director had a different vision to what I am interpreting from what I have seen in it, but this is how it came across to me. Also a very beautiful film to look at in it's pristine whiteness of wilderness.
