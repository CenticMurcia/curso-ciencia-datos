If my 3-year old could review this movie, she'd probably give it high marks. She can watch it over and over. Of all her movies, this is one that I really don't enjoy. I like its idea of a war between cats and dogs who are secretly more technologically advanced than we are, and a lot of cleverness went into the situations, but the dialog is corny. There's a load of great acting talent, but their main instruction seems to have been to ham it up for the kids. I'm not particularly fond of the animations in this, either. When a movie like this comes out and does something that hasn't been done before (in this case, mixing live-action and animation to tell a story with talking and ninja-fighting animals), it makes a big splash. Then, a few years later, when technology's improved and many other movies can do the same thing but make it look more realistic, that first movie will be forgotten if there isn't a great movie behind all the effects. And in this case, there isn't. It's a fun movie for kids, up to a certain age. If you have kids and want to leave them alone with this and feel safe that they're watching something wholesome, OK. But if you're looking for something to watch with them, there's not much here for an adult to enjoy. Even "Sesame Street" will drop a line, like a movie reference, that's clearly there to make the adults laugh. Some better comedy would really have gone a long way with this movie. Once the novelty wears off, it's a waste of time.
