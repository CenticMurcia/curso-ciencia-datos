OK, currently I'm living in China, and I bought what I thought was Jurrasic Park 4...which I didn't think there was. Well, there isn't...at least not yet, Steven Spielberg is about to produce it in 2009 or 2010. So when I put this DVD in, to my surprise, the only dinosaurs I saw was stolen stock footage from Jurrasic Park 3 which they continued to play over and over again but without any real relevance to the story/plot.<br /><br />Now I noticed that the other comments on this page didn't mention anything about this stolen stock footage, so I guess I should feel lucky that the Chinese steal everything and sell it cheap too. Awesomely bad movie!
