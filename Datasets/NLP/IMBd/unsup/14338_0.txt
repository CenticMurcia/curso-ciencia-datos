I have probably seen this film 10 times in my life, the most recent the DVD version which has some nice extras.<br /><br />I have been a huge Bogart fan for close to 25 years and this movie defined him right at the start of his second, more mature venture into films. The acting is good all around, although I don't think the football player was that good.<br /><br />I have to say that I find it interesting seeing the interaction between the black characters; it was very funny and also quite ahead of it's time.<br /><br />Although some of the references in this film are lost to younger viewers, I still think it has held up well and certainly is worth watching even if you are not a Davis or Bogart fan per se.
