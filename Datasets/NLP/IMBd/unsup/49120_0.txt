Sorry about my crappy English. It isn't easy to write this comment without laughing...<br /><br />And the award for worse wig ever goes to... The entire cast of "Tre Solar"!<br /><br />I don't think I've ever laughed this much to a Swedish movie before and I doubt that I ever will. This is so bad that... that... I can't find the words to describe how awful this really is. Throughout the entire film I excpected Terry Gilliam & C/o to show up, banging coconuts together, pretending to ride imaginary horses.<br /><br />Finally, I beg to the producers to NEVER ever show this film outside Swedish boarders. We can't let anybody think Swedish cinema stinks this much. Because if you do, nobody is gonna give us foreign money so we can film the books about Arn.
