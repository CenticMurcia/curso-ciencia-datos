A boyfriend and girlfriend traveling through Texas on their way to Florida have the misfortune of running up against the likes of Leatherface and a brand new clan of nutcases(including a young Viggo Mortensen). The film shows a barren landscape of dirt and forest. The forest is the setting at night and inside it is where Leatherface and his clan(including a mother with a mechanical voicebox and a father whose been dead quite a long time)live..a compound very similar to the one we are familiar with from the first film. Ken Foree is Benny, a hunter passing through who almost hits the couple trying to flee Leatherface who had just tore the trunk door off it's hinges. Will Benny be able to help the couple escape the cannibal clan's clutches? <br /><br />I watched the mutilated version with studio demanded cuts. If it weren't for the excessive profanity, this could've easily covered the PG-13 market because the gore is missing. Even true graphic violence almost always appears off-camera. The ending feels like it was hacked by a chainsaw. And, Benny must have 9 lives, because there are at least three different instances where, for all intensive purposes, he should've been killed. The flick's cannibal clan aren't that demented enough and the direction is rather limp. There's no moment in this flick that raises you to a different level and the photography is just not that effective. The film might increase in quality a notch if the gory bits are inserted, but I'm not sure if even that will help much. The flick is uninspired and silly. Leatherface, despite his BIG chainsaw, isn't that menacing or memorable. Kate Hodge, as the terrorized female, is not very good. She really isn't even put to the test like often happens in other films. It also feels like it aspires to be a macabre comedy which might work if the humor was smart enough. It could just come down to Burr's direction which is anything but stellar.
