Considering the all-star cast and the fairly large budget (this is no indie film), there's no reason why this film should be as bad as it was. <br /><br />Ian McCellan gives a stellar performance, but otherwise this film is rendered almost unwatchable because of the performances of Aaron Eckhardt and Britney Murphy, and most of all, because of the insufferable/clich√©d writing, which makes every effort to pull at our heartstrings. <br /><br />Don't let the allure of the cast (in addition to McKellan, Eckhardt, and Murphy, it also features William Hurt, Nick Nolte, Alan Cumming, Jessica Lang, and more) draw you in -- stay away from Neverwas!
