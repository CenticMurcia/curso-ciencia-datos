This movie contains some beautiful cinematography and an enjoyable soundtrack. The acting is terrific and the plot easy to follow. I enjoyed this movie immensely. It is quite a departure from the other Chinese movies I have seen and enjoyed. It may appeal to those who did not like "Raise the Red Lantern," "Red Sorghum" and other Chinese movies that had strong political messages. This movie lacks that political undercurrent and is a pleasant contrast to the aforementioned (very excellent), titles.
