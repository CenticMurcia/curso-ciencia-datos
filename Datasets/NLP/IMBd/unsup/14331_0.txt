The tag-line for Dinosaur is 'You have never seen anything like this', and it's a fair statement. Dinosaur is stunningly detailed, top-heavy with beautifully framed images and perfectly paced scenes filled with discovery and adventure. It's just a pity I'm not nine years old because I've certainly heard all this before many, many times over. Honestly, surely Disney realize that grown-ups take kids to see these things? It's hard to imagine a more formulaic plot and the dialog and characterization could only be this trite on purpose (maybe someone lost a bet). Kids will love it, and I guess that's the main thing, but it's not hard to see why Pixar has stolen Disney's thunder at the box office.
