I thought the movie was horrible. It had good intentions until Shue went crazy. With all the characters in the movie you would have thought the director would have used them more. For instance the mother, what mother would not come to see her first grandchild because she was scared to fly. How did she get there if she was afraid to fly? The housekeeper who knew something was wrong but never thought to call the husband to say to him "I found a knife in the crib." I mean there was a lot of unanswered questions. The girl Jenny, the diary. I hope there are no plans for the making of a "First born 2" This could have turned out to be a good movie if the director would have used his characters more.
