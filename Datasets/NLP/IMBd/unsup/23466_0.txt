Ignoring some of the awful reviews on here, I decided to buy this movie on DVD, and have just watched it.. quite frankly I can say I wasn't disappointed ! OK, so the plot wasn't amazing, and you knew pretty much who was gonna live and who was gonna die, but you know what, that didn't matter - a gay horror flick is just what the genre needed...<br /><br />The direction was good, the actors not bad (although would have been nice to see Matt Philips (Toby) out of drag - damn he's hot), and I would LOVE to see a sequel... if they could make one for IKWYDLS, then they can do one for this...<br /><br />Watch this movie !!!
