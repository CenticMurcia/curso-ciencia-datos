Hey, we all loved 'Rudy' and gladly accepted the sub-par acting due to the fact that she was so young at the time. But that was a long time ago. For those of you that did see this movie, you most likely sat through it praying that Cliff Huxtable would make an irrelevant but much-needed cameo appearance to the film to give it at least some A-level acting. The plot was predictable, the emotional outbursts obviously phony, and the only thing comforting about this movie was to see the attractive face of 'Ray-J' Norwood step into a scene and make the young teenage girls and boys scream to the top of their lungs while watching it in their rooms (at least someone enjoyed it). On the plus side (and I include a plus side just because it is the right thing to do), it was nice to see Keshia Knight-Pulliam's return to TV and at the same time have a positive holiday movie that the whole family could sit down and enjoy.
