I might be one of the biggest horror fans you have ever seen. And I am just INLOVE with slaughter, slasher, frightening, great horror movies! Though, I state my self as a "Fan" so as any other horror fan, I hate the movies this year like, jennifers body, the haunting in Connecticut, Sorority Row. You know, the *beep* in movies, that are terrible. No, no, no I like REAL horror movies. Some of my favorites would be: Slither The Devils Rejects The Shining The Hills Have Eyes. Halloween(John Carpenter's) And the highly anticipated "Trick r' Treat, to be hopefully released straight to DVD this October.<br /><br />But out of all the great horror movies, there's only one thats my 1# Favorite. And of course that has to be Behind the Mask. The acting is refreshing, because the characters aren't unaware of the situations. And the under-rated actors + actresses, make the movie nice. The filming is what really lights the spark; most of the movie is filmed with the technique of a cameraman's point of view. But when it transists to the over-fantastic directing of Scott Glosserman, made it to my 1# horror movie. Scott is so ingeinus when it comes to his directing. Overall, I love the writing, acting, and overall production value of such a amazing under-rated film. This is truly a great horror movie.
