It is worth the price of admission, but I did not like the quick-editing techniques in the movie. I was with the movie but 20 minutes before the end the story could have been written better. Just a little less vengefulness was needed in certain places.<br /><br />All and all, Sly Stallone's acting is enough to make this film entertaining. It is good to see him put himself and his style of acting into the film.<br /><br />I might add, movie score and incidental music was superb Good compositioning and orchestration. Good Seattle scenery, and some Pacific Northwest scenes.
