I am sorry to say, that i am really disappointed. first by the movie i had to force myself thru right now, as well as by the amazingly high rating it got on IMDb. And i have to say: i am not at all against romantic comedies or if you want "chick flicks". But this one just had nothing to offer for me at all. It was filled with annoying clich√©s, the acting was embarrassing and the story totally, and i mean absolutely, predictable. there were so many scenes in the movie that made me feel physically ashamed for everybody involved in this production, that i still feel a bit dizzy. the music was awful and can be only compared to the terribly cheesy pictures the so called "artistic" main character is drawing. but that not enough. after 90 minutes of bugging the viewer how unimportant looks are the only slightly likable character changes his whole dressing and hair style to get the "hot chick" of the store, that seemed to be his friend already for years! It is hard to believe nobody else found that somewhat against the often cited "important message" of this train wreck. sorry, but i recommend to see forgetting Sarah Marshall a second or even a third time instead. the only reason i gave it 2 points is the standard editing you cant feel.
