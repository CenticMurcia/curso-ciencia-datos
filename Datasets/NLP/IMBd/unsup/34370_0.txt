This film is actually quite bad. Perhaps the only thing I would save it's the OST.. and also I have to say that some things are not easy to understand if u don't know a bit of the ambient where it was actually filmed. I mean, being Spanish helps for that, and of course I guess there is no translation but for the subtitles but.. To sum up, do not waiste your time or money guys. The story is nothing new, this girl discovers the boyfriend cheating on her so she decides to move with her best friend to the big city, where, I have to say, things are not always like they pretend in the film. Actually nothing really happens in there, I mean, there is no exciting story at all . Regarding the actors, the guy is well known in Spain as he is leading a pop band extremely popular with teenagers, and she is a complete unknown-
