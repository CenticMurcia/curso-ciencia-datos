At no time throughout this movie did I know what was happening. It was a headache to watch and certainly I read on the back of the DVD what it was meant to be about. NONE of this was conveyed in the film... I was like what the F%@! the whole way through. Unfortunately I had to watch it all as it was a part of the crappy movie marathon we were having but this one takes the cake..... it beats EVERYTHING. Why money was wasted on putting this supposed film on DVD I have no idea. All I know is it WINs, OK Pat, you WIN! I thought it would be a laugh to begin with seeing as the catch line is "he's not clowning around" and seeing the hilarious evil clown photo... it was the hardest movie I've ever had to endure because I honestly did not understand any of it. I think the only people on this planet that would make sense of it are all in mental institutions..
