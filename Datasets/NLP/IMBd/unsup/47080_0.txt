Sensational cast in Elia Kazan's adaptation of his own book concerning a married executive with a mistress who attempts suicide. Aloof, disjointed melodrama has stars Kirk Douglas, Deborah Kerr and Faye Dunaway suffering in a well-heeled vacuum. Dunaway released a slew of pictures in 1967-69 and was probably at the risk of being dangerously overexposed; she's gorgeously coiffed and manicured, but her heavily made-up face and cool personality doesn't involve the audience (one hopes that Douglas will simply come to his senses and let her go). All the characters here are fairly unsavory anyway, and the actors are not helped by the campy lines of dialogue and uncompelling conflicts. *1/2 from ****
