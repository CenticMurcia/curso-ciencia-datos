This movie is true to form with the opening of racial prejudice towards the nuns who're not Mexican.<br /><br />I have read many reviews in where this movie was very confusing but this is not the case because this generation of movie viewer has to have everything explained to them because it hurts to think. Blame capitalism, blame the information age, Hell, blame me but if you have read such reviews don't take it to heart for ye will surely be deceived!!! The movie is about a nun who's harassed by the devil all because of her purity or desire to be chaste. Eversince she's been in contact with El Levid whom I shall refer to as (The Count of Dantecrispo, sister purity gets the urge to seduce goat herders and fellow nuns.<br /><br />I will not share any more but for me, it's worth the investment. I like this movie more than Alucarda and that's saying a lot since Alucarda's pure Kult Ov the Kult of my video collectiones.
