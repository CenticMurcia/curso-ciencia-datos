Having seen Vanishing Point and enjoyed it, I was pointed in the direction of Two-Lane Blacktop (which is very difficult to get hold of in the UK!).<br /><br />What I enjoy most about this film is the story. There is no real introduction as such; the film begins with a drag race and ends, abruptly with a drag race. It is a chapter in a longer story. Where did the cars come from? Why are they on the road? Where does their journey end? This gives me the impression that I am looking in on a week or so of several lives as they meet and then go their separate ways. In that respect the story is about the brief relationship of four individuals, rather than the individuals themselves<br /><br />There are several incidents during the journey and we can see from these that some of the individuals learn and others do not. The car accident they come across following the short race against the Charger and Warren Oates' character picking up a gay hitch-hiker are notable moments.<br /><br />The low quality of the film compared with more modern films show it up as a relic of its time and give it a documentary quality, making it seem more realistic, particularly in tandem with either poor acting (rehearse your lines!) or superb improvisation. <br /><br />I enjoyed this one as much as Vanishing Point, but for slighty different reasons.<br /><br />IJ 10/01/06<br /><br />P.S. I'm not sure if I'd prefer a Pontiac GTO or a Dodge Challenger but they both look amazing on screen!
