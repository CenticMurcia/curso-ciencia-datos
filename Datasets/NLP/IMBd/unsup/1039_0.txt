Bon jour. I am attending the Cannes Marche du Film and just saw this. It is really good. It is much better than the Jack Black movie which I could not stand. Although, I must admit that Jack Black as Paul Green was perfect casting.<br /><br />If you have any recollection of 80s hard rock, I think you'd like this. These kids do a great job with Billy Idol, Alice Cooper, Black Sabbath and Zappa.<br /><br />I am a fan of documentaries and enjoyed Rock School. I didn't think it was as good as Dogtown & Z Boys (which I loved). But, if you enjoyed Spellbound, you will probably enjoy Rock School.<br /><br />I hope it gets picked up for wide distribution.
