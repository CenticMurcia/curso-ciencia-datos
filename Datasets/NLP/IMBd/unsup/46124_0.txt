Dario Argento: ILL FANTASMA DELL' OPERA (1998)<br /><br />When one of the most celebrated directors of horror genre decides to make his own version of many times filmed story the result will either be really good or really bad. In this case it is the latter.<br /><br />I admire Dario Argento as an Italian horror director. His works from 70's and 80's are visually fantastic horror movies. I became fan of his when I watched movies like THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMMAGE, DEEP RED and TENEBRE. He earlier made a shocking thriller set in the opera world named OPERA and his film SUSPIRIA must be one of the best horror movies ever made! <br /><br />So what goes wrong here? The story, which Argento made with Gerard Brach, is set in Paris opera house in 1877. The Phantom (Julian Sands) in this version is not deformed or scarred, he is actually quite handsome. He was abounded as child and was raised by rats. OkayÂ… Story doesn't tell how he learned to speak, write and read, not to mention dress himself and play organs. He fells in love with a singer named Christine (Argento's daughter Asia) and decides to get rid of anyone who stands in her way to become next leading soprano. But what kind of Phantom is this guy? He masturbates while surrounded by rats? And in anger rapes his beloved Christine?!? Oh this is so wrong.<br /><br />So, if movie is this bad why am I, a die-hard POTO fan, thinking it is better than 1983 TV movie? Unlike in that version, here Argento puts the opera house in a good use. Film was shot in Budapest's opera house and it really gives an eerie surroundings. One could think it is housed by something evil. Especially when Ennio Morricone's hauntingly beautiful music is played.<br /><br />Last word: A terrible version of classic story which only purpose seems to be upsetting as many Dario Argento and POTO fans as possible. I'm both and I'm really upset.
