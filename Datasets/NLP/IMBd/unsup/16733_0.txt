Futurama is one of the greatest cartoons ever. It was smart, witty, and humorous. I don't see how people could easily lose sight of it's beauty. All the characters were set up in just 2 episodes and it was extremely easy to follow throughout the season. The storyline was consistent and the humor wasn't rude enough to offend, but it was rude enough to make you laugh. Simply put, Futurama had it's charm and I think it should have lasted one or two more seasons before it got cancelled. Otherwise it WOULD have wound up like the Simpsons. In my opinion, it is the greatest show to be put on television. If you haven't bought the DVD sets yet, look into them and see for yourself how great the show is if you haven't already. I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised :D
