Okay so I laughed on and off throughout the entire picture, so that is why I gave it one step above a 1. Now, the scene with the wheelchair is not only one of the most freaking hilarious things I've ever seen, but it is also flawed like there is no tomorrow. How on earth can some fly directly sideways (staying in their wheelchair the entire time) when being hit straight on?<br /><br />More clarification: The road is parallel to the bingo parlor. The lady is in the street crying and the bulldozer nails her a good one. She doesn't fly into the street! She fly immediately sideways right into the bingo hut.<br /><br />this movie is bogus on every account and should be deemed only a comedy from this point forth.<br /><br />on a side note: the teenage girl looked really good. What kind of dude just unbuttons a shirt and leaves it at that. He doesn't even want to look at them?
