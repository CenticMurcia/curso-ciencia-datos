When you come to hear a great idea about a movie you usually build a lot of pressure if the outcome is not what you wanted it to be. Metal. The headbangers jorney delivers in every aspect you can look for in a documentary, especially if its about metal music and the people behind it.<br /><br />Mainly what makes it so good is the simple fact that it was made by a fan, that nows the music inside out. Hearing about the darker times of the genre you start to really think how much Slayer, Metallica, Dio, Children of Bodom, MÃ¶ntley Crue and which ever was the band you liked meant for you when you where a kid.<br /><br />For a film to have so much influence on you that i can feel proud of being a Headbanger, Metal kid or whatever its always a great thing. Im not saying that i don't feel proud of who i am. This film just underlines the fact that you are a bit different, but so are the thousand kids behind you screaming as they all reach for the stage devil horns up in the sky. <br /><br />This movie is great for every metal fan, and if you don't even like the music its still entertaining and builds up you understanding about Metal, Headbanging, and why Norwegian Blac metal stinks. Metal saves lives it doesn't take them.
