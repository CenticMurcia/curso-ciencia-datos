Nothing like seeing a blatantly politicized and inaccurate film presented in "documentary" form... the worst since Farenheit 9/11. I like the comments from CPB and PBS ombudsmen following an investigation into its airing on PBS, an allegedly non-partisan public channel: Using the words "slanted" and "no hint of balance," in the report, CPB Ombudsman Ken A. Bode concluded, "The producers apparently do not subscribe to the idea that an argument can be made more convincing by giving the other side a fair presentation." Bode wondered whether PBS had been used as "the launching pad for a very partisan effort to drive public policy and law." If so, the documentary violates PBS' mission statement to be non-partisan and "provide multiple viewpoints." PBS's own internal ombudsman offered a separate analysis, "I thought this particular program had almost no balanceturning itinto more of an advocacy, or point-of-view, presentation." Avoid.
