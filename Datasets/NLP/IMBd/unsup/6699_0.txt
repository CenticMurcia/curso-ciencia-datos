I love this movie! It's the one for Christmas Time and contemplative hours. Wonderful music, snow, a charming Joseph Brooks! The romantic song: "If ever I See You Again", which Bob Morrison once wrote for his first love Jennifer,leads you through the whole film.( I wonder whether this lovely song is available on CD?) Sometimes you think, that the uncharitable Jennifer is not good enough for Bob! But, in any case, keep your handkerchief ready!
