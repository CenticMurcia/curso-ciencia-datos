I agree with last comment. It is formula movie with copy of western songs and dances in the hope of appealing to NRIs who may be nostalgic or those who aspire to be an NRI. This is obvious when Devgan talks in terms of $ instead of Rs to explain the exchange rate. <br /><br />Every one seems to be overacting and insincere. Devgan is not only a builder but suddenly he is shown to be expert in every business so that he can send Kapoor to Thailand instead of Singapore for horticultural research. Thailand is shown to be a technologically advanced while India is still so backward.<br /><br />You may watch it if you have nothing better to do.
