Having read the comment of the person who had to work in post-production on this film, I extend my sympathies to you! This is a very hard film to sit through and keep an unqueasy stomach. In fact, I think I got about halfway through, having been quite patient, before deciding that whatever point the filmmakers had did not justify their approach, and I left the theatre to see another film at the festival. If I had not been at a festival, I might have hung around for the ending (at this point I must say my fest friends are continually amazed by my patience with off-putting art films!) This movie is unrelentingly focused on the gross material aspects of existence. The reality we all live in is full of death, life, pain, pus, blood, mud, bodily orifices, rain, sun, and everything else our senses are inundated with, but the presentation of it in this film feels like having your head ducked into a trough full of manure. What is most unsettling is the impression that this is exactly what the film makers were trying to do...
