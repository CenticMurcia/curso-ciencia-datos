I am very disappointed that I watched all the seasons of Deadwood. Not because the show was disappointing, but because the show ended. This was a show that was 360 degrees of amazing. A show that hit that gritty side of life in a way that leaves you feeling satisfied with its honesty.<br /><br />I really feel unsatisfied with the way HBO finished Deadwood. I am not foolish enough to think that it is all about me, but after reading the web Blog's and feeling other viewers comments I know that I am not alone.<br /><br />When and if HBO ever does anything about this I will be there to pick up where Deadwood left me...
