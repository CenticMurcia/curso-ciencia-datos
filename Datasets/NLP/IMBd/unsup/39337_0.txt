You know, throwing out a psycho thriller in 2009 with fragmentary cuts, somber tone and final twist, and doing it as if it were the most profitable years of the genre (namely, a bit after the release of se7en) is risky to say the least. But the worse part of Horsemen is how badly does nearly every thing, from lazy actors, a script so inconsistent on what it is telling that I cannot understand how anyone approved this (characters coming out of nothing at half of the movie, others disappearing, blatant incongruence in the investigation...), and a direction that does very little to hide the weakness of the story. The fascination with hooks and skin was better and more gruesome (and interesting) in the Hellraiser movies or in The Cell, the kind of millennium murders are something too old for its own good, and this movie just repeats the same clich√©s all over again without any inspiration, any intention of being original in anything. OK, there's a smart subtext of young nihilism readable in some of the lines, but that subtext is destroyed by horrendous dialog and laughable melodramatic scenes. So a failure in every sense, but most of all a failure of Michael Bay, who I see as the responsible for having this project go ahead.
