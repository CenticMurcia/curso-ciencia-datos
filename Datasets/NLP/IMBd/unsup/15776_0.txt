I think this film gets a wee bit overrated on these pages, for though it is a well made, enjoyable effort and better put together than many slashers, especially the late period ones, it is hardly some great underrated gem. The plot and general course of events are predictable but compelling, as an avid reader of pulp horror finds herself pursued by a disfigured, murderous writer. The film has a neat Fifties pulp feel to it, though updated with more scares and a bit of bloodshed. Director Tibor Takacs maintains a constant sense of reality bending intrigue and though nothing is especially surprising, the film has such a well oiled, easy flow that its near impossible not to get caught up in it. The acting helps a treat, Jenny Wright is constantly appealing as the heroine, Clayton Rohner is effective in the clich√©d unbelieving boyfriend role and Randall William Cook makes for a splendidly creepy villain. The dialogue is occasionally stilted, but it all fits the sorta campy tone. I could definitely have done with more gore, for while the kills are well filmed and have the rare skill of being effective without being graphic, there aren't too many and there are only really three notable grisly moments. The first kill is a cracker and sadly the later ones aren't as good, but they still just about work in the context. It helps that the effects, designed by Randall Willaim Cook, are pretty ace when they do appear. The film is sadly a bit underwritten, I could have done with more background and more explanation for what was going on, as well as perhaps some downtime to develop the characters a bit more. Its good fun while it lasts but it does rather streak by and afterwards I did have a number of questions about various plot and character points. Still, I can't really be too harsh on this one because very simply, I enjoyed it quite a lot. Worth a watch, though best not too expect fireworks.
