So, there's a Bigfoot roaming around out in the woods. Lance Henriksen and a couple of buddies are out hunting it. They all get killed early on. I guess they couldn't afford to pay them for the whole movie. Another guy who's in a wheelchair is staying at a cabin, along with his therapist. Across the way is another cabin, this one full of young college girls. The guy in the wheelchair spends the movie looking through binoculars at the Bigfoot hanging around outside the girls' cabin. Yes, Hitchcock did something similar. The girls keep accusing him of being a peeping tom. Eventually our Yeti knocks off most of the girls, and the sole survivor takes refuge with the guy in the wheelchair. There's the usual cornball climax and the usual cornball setup for a sequel.<br /><br />Overall, it wasn't any worse than average for a Sci-Fi original. The female characters were uninteresting and interchangeable clich√©s, Lance Henriksen and his buddies at least had a bit of personality, and the guy in the wheelchair did a good job, but never really rose to the lever of being interesting. The worst part was the Bigfoot, he looked extremely silly. He had a huge grin on his face every time we saw him. There was a tiny bit of nudity and a fair amount of gore.<br /><br />I'd recommend this if you're a lover of B-movies and in the mood for something vaguely interesting to watch on a Tuesday night. Don't wait to watch it on a weekend, weekends deserve something better like Sabertooth or Chupacabra Terror. At least the characters in those movies had personalities.
