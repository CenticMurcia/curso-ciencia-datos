Columbo episodes always seem to have the same formula. Especially since we know who does the crime after the first ten minutes, we love surprises in how Columbo catches his man or woman. In this episode, George Hamilton shows off his acting talents. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the man can act very well. He plays a psychiatrist who kills the husband of Lesley Ann Warren's character rather than ruin his reputation. The fun with Columbo episodes is that the crime is never too gruesome or motives are never too dark. Anyway, the doctor's patient is the prime witness and he gets her in the worst way. The crime happens at a beach-front estate secluded from neighbors and traffic. Anyway, watching Columbo catch him is particularly worth it especially sine you don't feel for Hamilton's character as a victim.
