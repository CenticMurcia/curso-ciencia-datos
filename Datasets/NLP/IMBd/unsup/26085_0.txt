Expect a good mystery. The film explores the full spectrum of Bombay culture and scenic background. The locations and sets are delightful. The characters are well developed. The author of the book gets screen writing credit. Those who are introduced to Inspector Ghote by viewing this film, will probably become interested in checking out the full series of books. There is almost a laugh or chuckle a minute, i.e. chase sequences, pratfalls and sight gags. Cameo appearances by "animals" are a plus. This film belongs in the same category as the "Pink Panther" movies. There is a short run TV series starring Sammy Davis Jr. as "Inspector Ghote". Please email me if you have more info on that to share.
