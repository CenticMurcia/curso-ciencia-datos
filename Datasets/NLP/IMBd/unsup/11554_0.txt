This movie is so awesome. A true Cinemax classic. <br /><br />I remember falling into this movie as a freshman in high-school. Many a night was spent giggling myself silly in the basement. I'm pretty sure that my memory of the film is actually better than the film itself, but it truly does rank with my favorite comedies of all-time. Menlo Schwartzer might be one of the best villains ever. (Whatever happened to that guy? His Jerry Lewis schtick was spot-on.)<br /><br />Oh, to be young and stupid again. (I know better than to rank this a "9", but I really do love this movie. The average viewer would probably give it a "3", maybe a "4".) It is one of my truly guilty pleasures, along with "Beer" (another Cinemax discovery), "Bad Lieutenant", and "Showgirls". I'm actively searching for this movie on DVD, as my VHS tape of it is completely worn-out.
