I rented this movie by mistake cause, i was actually searching another one with a similar name, but boy was i blown away. I remember that I was watching with friends, and we laughed so much, it was probably the funniest film I've seen in years. It's a new-age comedy, but with a twist of the old Serbians classics. The storyline is amazing, thus the characters are chosen so well, and the actors are the best Yugoslavian actors there are today in the acting business.The whole storyline is carefully planned, although it might seems a bit confusing at first, you get used to it, and after that it's just a Joy ride from than on. HIGHLY Recommended !!!
