Pauly Shore is one of the actors you love to hate; so much so that it got to the point where his whole career was based on people's dislike for him. But, Pauly Shore is Dead proves that it's not funny when he's in on the joke.<br /><br />The film is a self-mockery, where Pauly Shore  played by himself  fakes his own death for credibility. Not a bad concept, but in the end just comes out arrogant and obnoxious. It certainly proves that Pauly Shore shouldn't have any control over direction or screenplays, as the jokes are stale, lame and predictable. The only way it holds itself up is by the various cameos.<br /><br />Even though this is an obvious self-mockery, Shore seems to take himself very seriously to think people actually want to see him write and direct his own film, as if to say "hey, guys - I'm in on the joke too!" while looking down at his fans who are portrayed as obsessive rednecks.<br /><br />Even though Pauly Shore clearly can't write, I think I'm one of the few that really enjoyed his early films. But, from early on to now, they're really went downhill: Encino Man: The first film where Shore had leading role. Easily his best film, and shows that it's probably best for him to be a secondary character.<br /><br />Son in Law: Certainly no Encino Man, but still some funny moments.<br /><br />In the Army Now: I'd stay away from this if you've seen Stripes and care about originality. Overall, pretty good film, though.<br /><br />Jury Duty: His last watchable film. It really, really should have stopped there.<br /><br />If it had stopped there, there would still be a few remaining strands of credibility left, but, unfortunately, he had to pull an arrogant and pretentious stunt by making Pauly Shore is Dead.
