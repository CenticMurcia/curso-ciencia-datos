My friend lent me this film and to be honest I was not really interested or excited about seeing it. I only put it on because boredom had took over me so I was not expecting to see a good film!! <br /><br />The film starts off with lots of characters shouting and arguing, also I am not used to watching films with subtitles so to say I was slightly confused would be an understatement!! 15 minutes in and I was hooked, I wont give anything away but the film focuses on a selection of inmates and their life in Carandiru prison. It also has sub stories on how they became to be inmates. Some amusing, shocking and interesting moments throughout the film will have the viewer completely tuned in to the way of life these inmates had. This is a true story about the massacre of inmates at the prison when police dealt with a riot. It is an amazing film and the ending is brilliant. I have watched it 4 times with different people and they too agree it was excellent. If you like prison movies and don't mind reading subtitles this film is for you. In my opinion its almost as good as shawshank redemption (my favorite film) and better than midnight express. This is only my opinion and I am sure people will argue otherwise but from me this film gets an 8 out of 10.
