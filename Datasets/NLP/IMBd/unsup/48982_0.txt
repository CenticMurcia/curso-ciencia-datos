This thing makes Malibu's Most Wanted look like American Beauty. I'm being generous in giving it a 3, but only because I chuckled a few times at some of the 80's references. This movie has one thing going for it, Michael Rosenbaum. He is incredibly funny in it, and I'm sure most of his stuff was improvised, because it's the only bright spot in a badly directed, badly lit, badly everything turkey that should've been released in January or February. Rosenbaum has fun with his role, and he even manages to reference Oliver Stone's 'The Doors' if you can believe it. Skip it and put it on your Netflix list if you're really bored.
