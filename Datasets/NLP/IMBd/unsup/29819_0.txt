This movie is basically a action-movie at its finest. It severally lacks depth and story but compensates that with its action. It surprised me (even for a Paul WS Anderson movie) how mindnumbing it is, but it never leaves you bored and thats why this movie is better then the original Death Race 2000 in my humble opinion. Although that isn't really saying that much since this movie really doesn't have much in common with Death Race 2000 other then the title.<br /><br />Jason Statham is perfectly casted as the actionhero. The movie also lends a few nice video game-like aspects but Paul WS Anderson knows how to handle such things, and really sets himself apart with this movie from directing-failures like Uwe Boll.<br /><br />Overall there isn't really much else to say. The ending is great so I'm not going to spoil it, just see it for yourself. If you are a action-fan you will not be disappointed. Don't expect too much storyline though.
