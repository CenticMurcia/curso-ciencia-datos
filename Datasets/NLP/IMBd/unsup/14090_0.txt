A 15 year-old schoolgirl is found hanged in a locked apartment in Rome. Further police investigation reveals the apparent suicide to be a murder.<br /><br />Many more deaths lead police closer to the source of a conspiracy to entice young teenage schoolgirls into a prostitution ring in this sordid but well-done giallo.<br /><br />Similar in theme and style to the same director's 1972 "What have they done to Solange?".
