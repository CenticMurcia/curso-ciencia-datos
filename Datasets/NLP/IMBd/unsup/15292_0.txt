I will not write anything about the plot here at all.<br /><br />I think this movie has it's flaws. The budget seems low and the cast is far from excellent.<br /><br />However, I think the movie is kind of great. The story is a mix of a lot of movies like Alien, Predator and 2001 for instance. But they did a good job with what they had on this movie and I really liked it.<br /><br />Keep an open mind about actors and budget and you will have a good time. They managed to create a mysterious mood through out the whole thing. One thing that strikes me is that they probably had big problems but still managed to get some of the strange mood you get from the movie "2001".
