That the tag-line is deliberately misleading is not a good reason to dislike a film. Neither is the seeming lack of a plot/story throughout the beginning two thirds of the film. Likewise for the anticipated martial arts action. Just because you expected roast beef and got vegetable lasagna instead doesn't mean the lasagna is bad. Admittedly, it is bad form to promote a side dish as the main course, but the main course wasn't bad. Also, the beginning side dish was quite tasty.<br /><br />There were lots of slow parts to the film, but it isn't easy to link together all the parts of what is essentially a long music video minus the dancing. If you need a plot/story in a film to make sense, rest assured; it does in the end. However, that may not add to the enjoyment of the film. This is a film best enjoyed without a lot of expectation. There are special effects, attractive women, attractive men, nice music, even a plot/story - what more do you want?
