"Evil Dead II" is one of the most hilarious, over-the-top, gory, and tasteless comedies of all time. Naturally, that means it's a great film. Sam Raimiis a surprisingly energetic director, and puts a brutally quick pace on the movie. Bruce Campbell gets the role that made him into a star, and with good reason. He is great fun to watch - energetic, and dashing. The fact that the plot is basically non-existent (and what is there consists of ridiculous horror clich√©s) only serves to make the film more amusing. Sam Raimi's and Scott Spiegel's script is brilliant with it's bizarre jokes, and insane situations. The ending is particularly clever.<br /><br />Any fan of black comedy will find "Evil Dead II" hard to resist.<br /><br />7.9 out of 10
