The Hills have Eyes part 2 is an unbelievably dull and uninspired film that, like most sequels, desperately tries to milk the original for a few extra dollars. Craven makes constant references to his raw original and even edits entire sequences into this film. It seems like old Wes damn well knows this sequel is inferior and he misses the 70'sÂ…the only era in his career he actually delivered brilliant movies. We're back in the desert, only a few miles away from the initial tragedy that overcame the Carlton family, and the cannibals (including the charismatic creep Michael Berryman) are still lurking around. On the menu this time are a group of motorcycle-racing teenagers, on their way to demonstrate their brand-new developed formula of super fuel. Also part of the posse is the now civilized girl who abandoned the mountain-family near the end of part one. I guess it doesn't require a degree in rocket science to immediately spot this follow-up completely lacks the raw and shocking impact of the original. There's very few gore, dreadful attempts to bring insert humor and truly annoying character drawings. In this film, it becomes very clear that Craven is an overly pretentious director who's not even embarrassed to repeat is own clever premises. The only time he more or less reaches a similar quality-level here is during the sequence where a blind psychic girl stumbles around a forsaken area, with nothing but her friends' dead bodies on her way.
