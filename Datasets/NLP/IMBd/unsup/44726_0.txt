Sorry, but this movie is terrible. It insults your intelligence at every turn, lacks any real bite, and, I assure you, flash clothes aside, this movie will ruin your evening. The production is slick, the editing pointlessly rapid, but where it really lets itself down is the writing and plotting. Was this movie REALLY based on a book? Where's the story? The New York 'fashion scene' is so toadily portrayed and offers so little insight, I wondered just who it was that the film-makers were trying not to offend. But it's when the plot creaks and flops into Paris, in what passes for a 3rd act attending - ahem - "Fashion Week" that this movie just falls apart. <br /><br />Why does aspiring 'writer' Andy, with her cool Bo-Ho credentials, stick around in the world of 'Runway'? Okay, so she landed the job that 'a million girls would kill for', but the inevitable high moral cost for someone as principled as Andy is never satisfactorily explored. She's blatantly seduced by it, but we never get to understand any of the tension her character feels, or why she's the one we're meant to root for. Okay, it's a comedy, but does Andy have to be such a vacuum? Her boyfriend seems to be there to continually remind us what we should be thinking.<br /><br />Its trite superficial appeal, and relentlessly toothsome cast has garnered it some wincingly favourable reviews, but great title and the casting against type of Meryl Streep aside, this undercooked movie deserves to be quietly forgotten.
