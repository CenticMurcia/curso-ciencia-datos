I must say, that I liked this movie. Of course, there are some flaws, but they are minor, so I don`t even want to mention them. But Antikiller rocks! I liked the book, and the screenplay was also a very fine job. Fast paced, with good performances all around. Honest and breathtaking action sequences. If you do want to see a good russian action movie, see Antikiller. My vote: 7 from 10.
