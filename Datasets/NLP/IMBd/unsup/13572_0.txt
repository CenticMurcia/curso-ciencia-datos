I think this was a wonderful movie for any person who likes a good romance story and science fiction. It blends the two together very well to create a wonderful story line. Robin Williams was excellent, as usual, in his portrayal of an android. Although a little more on the serious side, his wit and humor still shown through. I would recommend this movie to my friends.
