Easy is an honest and sensitive film, with a good sense of humor. It has a simple story, but treated with special charisma and magic. Sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, sometimes wild. But always soft and with a special flavor. Great acting and soundtrack (provided by Grant Lee Phillips). Nice ending and rhythm. If you're ready to fall in love, you're ready for it.<br /><br />
