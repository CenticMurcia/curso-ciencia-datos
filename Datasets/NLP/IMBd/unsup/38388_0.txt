This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long while and I went to see this with friends, basically it turned us into those kids you hate in movies.<br /><br />The movie had no plot at all and the pointless turns which drove it about was as good as sticking a knife into a toaster whilst it's cooking. The characters were poorly acted out and very stereotypical. The scenes dragged out a lot and I really can't describe any it was that bad in taste. I'm presuming they were trying a clich√© of high school angst and romance but it failed in any of those subjects.<br /><br />A waste unfortunately.
