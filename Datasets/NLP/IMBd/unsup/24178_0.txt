Just re watched this film with parents on Blu Ray with surround sound connected. I have to say even at 19 years of age i love this film so much.<br /><br />Very entertaining for all the family with some characters which you become attached too and go on the emotional journey with them. The special effects in this movie are also stunning with the occasional blip here and there but this does not create a hindrance to your viewing pleasure.<br /><br />If you are looking for a film to watch with family and friends one night make sure you check this out, this film delivers a good package for every audience member with the addition of comedy and action which is featured in various parts of the film.
