The director and producers of the movie used symbolism to truly make a statement beyond just the obvious. The movie begs you to come and see it again because of the truth that it shows. The casting was well done, and the scenes, especially that after the death of his grandfather, brought even the hardest audience member to an emotional breaking point.<br /><br />Amanda Leigh Brozana, Wilkes University
