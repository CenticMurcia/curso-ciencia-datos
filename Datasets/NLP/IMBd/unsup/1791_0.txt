The return of slick cop, Axel Foley(Eddie Murphy) is in for another adventure in Beverly Hills. In the first movie, Axel goes in deep of finding his friend's killer. In part 2, Police Captain Bogamil(Ronny Cox) get shot, and his daughter Jan(Alice Adair) notifies Foley in Detroit. Knowing that his friend is in danger, he does the noble thing and heads off to Beverly Hills to find out more about the incident. First, he gets to get past a bureaucratic police chief(Allen Garfield) who is mostly all talk, and no action. Both Taggert and Rosewood(John Ashton & Judge Reinhold) work together to bring the criminals to justice. I like the music selections the movie made: "Shakedown" by Bob Seger, "Cross My Broken Heart" by The Jets, "I Want Your Sex" by George Michael, etc. Everything in the movie turned out great. Using the Mack R-Series Mixer as a "decoy" vehicle really did the trick on thwarting a robbery. Brigette Nielsen really hit it off after "Cobra", she was a very intimidating character in the movie. A little more exciting than the first, although I prefer Part one for the music score. Part 2 got more action. Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars.
