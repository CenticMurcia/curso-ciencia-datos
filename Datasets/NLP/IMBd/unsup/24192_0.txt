I was expecting a ho-hum story but instead I found myself pleasantly involved with the characters, especially Eric Stoltz, who wasn't a lawyer or a plumber, but a male nurse. This could have been very predictable but it wasn't, and I think that's why I enjoyed the story so much. It was great to see Maureen O'Hara, who I might add looks very pretty for her age. Overall this was a very touching movie.
