I get it, I really do. What is not to get? This show is a sketch show that attempts to parody local public access and cable TV. Tim and Eric go out of their way to "appear" to be incompetent, bumbling fools. OK, message received. But that is all you get. 4 seasons (and counting for some unknowable reason) of awkward silence, broken by miscues and babbling incoherence. And vomit. Lots and lots of vomit. Drippling down chins, or being propelled across the room. And don't forget the homo-erotic overtones, which I am quite fine with by the way. The problem I have with their treatment of it is that it is in no way funny. Instead it becomes awkward and painful to watch. They are not laughing AT homosexuals, and they are not laughing WITH them either. In fact on one is laughing at all. <br /><br />I loved Mr. Show, Bob Odenkirk, and David Cross. I like everything these two fine comedians have ever done. Which is why I am baffled that Mr. Odenkirk would let his name, and face, be associated with this monotonous drivel. His appearances certainly do stand out against the backdrop of failure. But to compare this show to Mr. Show is a stinging slap in the face of true comedy.
