"Dragonball Z 8: Burning Spirits!! Valiant Fight! Violent Fight! Super-Exciting Fight!", or "Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan" in the English dub, starts off with our heroes relaxing and having fun after peace has been restored on Earth. However, the peace is soon interrupted by the landing of a spaceship. Out comes a huge army led by a mysterious Saiyan named Paragas, who asks Vegeta to come with him and become the king of the new Planet Vegeta and rule the new Saiyan empire. Paragas also tells of the Legendary Super Saiyan, who threatens to destroy the Universe, and that only Vegeta can stop him. After hearing this Vegeta decides to join Paragas to New Vegeta. Trunks, Gohan, Krillin and even Kame-Sennin (who apparantly had a little too much to drink) and Oolong come along for the ride. Meanwhile, Goku is told by Kaio-sama (or King Kai) that the Legendary Super Saiyan has just destroyed the South Galaxy, and now has his sights set on the North Galaxy. Goku is off to find the Legendary Super Saiyan. The trail leads him to New Vegeta...<br /><br />This movie is the longest of all, and the length isn't just because of long-winded fights that DBZ has become infamous for (at least in my opinion). The movie is one of a kind in terms of storyline. It is the greatest story in all the DBZ movies, with the plot slowly unfolding as the movie progresses. There is a good amount of humor, especially from Kame-Sennin's drunken ramblings and behaviour. Action comes in truckloads in the second half. Brolly, who the Legendary Super Saiyan turns out to be, is one of the deadliest and most memorable villains ever concocted. He has some memorable dialogue, but the greatest thing about him is his insane and totally unpredictable behaviour. Needless to say, Goku and pals have a hard time taking him down, and their efforts are some of the most memorable battles in all of DBZ.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is not to be missed by all DBZ fans.
