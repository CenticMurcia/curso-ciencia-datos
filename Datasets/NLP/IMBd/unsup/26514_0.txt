I think this movie is best summed up as follows: Eventually all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs: 'I am haunted by waters' ... I too, folks, am haunted by waters. As the old saying goes: Just because you don't graduate head of the class, doesn't mean you won't one day own the school. Overall this movie exemplifies the fact that without innovation and without trying you can't do anything, and if it doesn't kill you it'll only make you stronger. It must also be said that Warwick Capper's performance as 'Braindead Prisoner' is truly dizzy stuff, folks.
