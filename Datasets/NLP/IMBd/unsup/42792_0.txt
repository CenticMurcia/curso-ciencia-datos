I was expecting a great movie hearing all the good comments it got from my friends. However I was utterly disappointed last night when I saw it.<br /><br />The title of the movie suggests that the movie is about a knight templar with the name Arn. Funnily though, you won't get to know mr Arn at all! Or any of the other emotionless characters in this film.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the director thought about when he made this movie, but I guess he thought that he could make about 100 scenes with people saying 2-3 lines, then another 100 scenes of scenery. Cut them together like a zip-lock and then let the audience do the rest.
