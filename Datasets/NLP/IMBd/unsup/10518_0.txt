I am astounded by those who see this mainly as some sort of pro or con statement on the Balkan wars. It seems clearly about loss of a man's soul to sorrow and his road back to redemption. The violence, although frighteningly real, exists in the film as both the problem and solution for the main character. Indiscriminate hatred and violent atrocities against all humanity provide the locomotion, propelling this gripping drama to a bitter-sweet ending. There is alway a bias from those who have actually lived the history of these times and they feel it is incumbent on them to point out the factual errors--and perhaps they should. I know a few people from New Orleans who hated the exaggerations and misinformation in the movie "The Big Easy". I am not from New Orleans and enjoyed the film. Movies are not documentaries unless they state they are documentaries--and even then you can never be sure of unbiased facts (Michael Moore). "Savior" may have used the Balkan violence as an environment to place his story about "Guy". It could have been Korea, Germany, Iraq and been just as effective. The big picture was certainly not about Croasian or Serbian morality. It was about one very troubled man's trek to find peace within himself.
