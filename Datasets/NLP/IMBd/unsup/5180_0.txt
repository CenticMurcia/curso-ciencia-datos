This was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I obviously wasn't expecting this National Lampoon film to be anywhere near as good as Van Wilder (really funny movie--a must see) or even Dorm Daze (which was okay, not extremely great), but this one was just pathetic. The storyline (girl chooses to stay a virgin but her boyfriend isn't keen on that idea) seems like it would be interesting, but without some comedy it was made out to be just plain awful and perhaps too realistic. The characters were the typical college kids; nothing too extravagant. I must say that my favourite thing about the whole movie was the choice of music played-that's all! Boring, pointless and not at all comical pretty much sums up this lackluster film. Honestly, unless it is the only movie you can get your hands on to watch, don't waste your time or money on this!
