I saw the film on Amazon. (Because of a fluke, It didn't stop the 2 minute "preview" after the first 2 minutes of the film. ) And I am watching it on Hulu now. It is a great film, and I must warn you, I WILL put major spoilers up.<br /><br />Short Synopsis: A comfortable underachiever and serial prankster, in the midst of their quarter life crisis, reunite against childhood enemies in a contemporary suburban epic.<br /><br />I'd say my favorite character is either Swank or Officer Scar. And speaking of Scar, I AM saying how he got his scar, and my thoughts on the otherwise described "EMBARRASSING" scene.<br /><br />OK, so it is a rainy day, and Caleb, Montag, Swank, Scar, and some other kids are playing Basket Ball. Scar (Who's real name is, if I remember right, Jim) keeps winning, Montag gets mad, and tackles him. Scar fights back and repeatedly punches him. Caleb grabs a trashcan and throws it at Scar, who gets pushed into a fence, his face pressed so hard, and I guess the metal also being wet and cold, cuts his face. He swears he will have vengeance.<br /><br />What did I think of that scene? Um, it was actually pretty sad if you watch it, because of the music, the most. But It didn't seem so embarrassing to me.<br /><br />My final thoughts on the film? It was great!I can't really say I don't like anything about it. 10/10!
