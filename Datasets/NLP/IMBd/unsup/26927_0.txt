I saw this film for two bucks and just got my money's worth. The film suffers from a identity crisis. It wants to have kick ass fighting along with real heart tugging emotion. It is near impossible to have both ,CTHD withstanding. I was bored during the weepy scenes and almost walked out...The ending is the best part. My advice is to rent it while doing chores and stop and watch it during the good parts. AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT "CAUSE THEY KILLED KATO. Bert Kwouk who plays uncle Tai was Kato in the Pink Panther films. Hasn't the poor man taken enough punisment.
