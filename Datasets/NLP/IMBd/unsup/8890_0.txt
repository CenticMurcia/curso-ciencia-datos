This film is part of the Val Lewton Horror Collection, released on DVD a short time ago. Each disc contains two feature films. This one was with "The Ghost Ship." I found the latter far more entertaining than this movie.<br /><br />I first saw this movie in the mid '90s, was not that impressed, but gave it another look when I acquired the Lewton set. On the second viewing, I lost interest halfway through and stopped it.<br /><br />After a great start, with an extremely suspenseful scene with a woman outdoors alone on a dark street with a panther loose, but after this dramatic part the film bogs down big-time....down to a crawl at times. If only the second half had kept that early momentum up.<br /><br />There are a lot of nighttime scenes, as was the case with a lot of Lewton's atmospheric films. Since I still own it, I'll give it another look. Who knows? Maybe the third time will be a charm.
