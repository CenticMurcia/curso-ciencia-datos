Pirate Islands is an utterly unremarkable children's television show along similar veins to the computer game Curse of Monkey Island, along with various other games and shows of the pirate nature. This show has many failings: effects, props, story, script. However, special attention has to be given to the cast, who are uniformely dreadful. The main girl is cast at least 10 years too old, while that Mars chap appears to be suffering a mild concussion. The man who plays the pirate captain Blueberry is overwhelmingly terrible, while Nicolas Donaldson does a fair job of wearing a green t-shirt for the duration of the entire series while displaying the acting ability of a coconut tree (many of which feature in the show, and are considerably more impressive). Not enough characters die, despite apparently being in constant mortal peril, which is a huge disappointment. This is possibly the worst series to feature an irritating singing plant, and an olive-green shirt. Avoid.
