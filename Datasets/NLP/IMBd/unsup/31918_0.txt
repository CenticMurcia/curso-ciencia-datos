This movie is a joke from the beginning to the end, the characters do and say what the writer wants them to, not even remotely what they did or said. Atahualpa is portrayed like a moron, naiv person (he seems to be not an Inca but a caucasian with a very good tan) and Pizarro like a sensitive one. If somebody thinks part of this has to do with reality, that person is wrong, I think the writer and director should have read at least a school text before making a film like this.
