The only funny parts of this movie are when someone is actually heckling, or when Kennedy actually interviews his "hecklers", and critics. The hunter becomes the hunted in pretty much all of these interviews, and you find out just how much of an unfunny douche-bag Kennedy really is. This guy makes Dane Cook look like Bill Murray.<br /><br />Pretty much all of the "comics" involved in this film are unfunny and bitter about it.......period. Andrew Dice Clay has a pretty funny scene, and Tom Green has a couple of interesting things to say, but everything else is just pretty inane and very lame. Jamie Kennedy is the "star" (lol) of this film and spends most of it pondering why people think he sucks, basically. Then he gets a bunch of his comedian and other showbiz cronies on to give him some cred. Some (and I use that term very liberally) are funny and interesting, but most of them are just obnoxious, ego whoreing, whiny babys. <br /><br />It's really no wonder the guy gets heckled a lot. I actually found myself wanting to heckle the frigging TV watching this tripe. It's just like, make me laugh or stfu clown. You have nothing interesting to say.<br /><br />Here is how a typical scene in this movie goes (so I can save you an hour and a half of your life, I wish someone had saved it for me):<br /><br />Scene begins: A clip is shown of Kennedy doing some god awful standup routine as he gets heckled. It goes something like this: "Stop me if you've heard this one folks! You ever hear that there country music with them there guys talking about I lost my dog I lost my wife aherherherherher........(it's bad, painfully bad, I'm wondering if this is an Andy Kaufman thing where he is purposely being terrible just so he can later make a documentary about why people think he's terrible. It's shear genius! I start to think. Then I remember Kaufman did some legitimately funny stuff at some point in his life and Kennedy.........not so much.<br /><br />We cut to Kennedy sitting in a room with one of his douche-bag comedian buddies across from one or two of his hecklers/critics.<br /><br />Kennedy: Why do you hate me? Guest: because you are not funny, and never have been, yet you insist on telling people you are hilarious and that "The Mask 2" was not this generation's "Ishtar".<br /><br />Kennedy: How could you say that? Guest: because everything you've ever done is painful to watch, and just basically sucks on ice.<br /><br />Kennedy: Well what would you do then? Guest: instead of running around telling everyone how funny and talented I am, I would actually try to do something funny, or something that required talent. And if everyone told me I was lame and sucked ass, I'd probably just deliver pizzas or something.<br /><br />Kennedy: You're a jerk man, you're an evil evil jerk. I hate myself, I know I suck, all my comedian friends keep me around to make themselves look funny, booohhoooohoooohooooo.<br /><br />Guest: I'm just being honest man. Maybe if someone was honest with you early in your career I would have never had the extreme displeasure of running into one of your woeful movies on late night basic cable.<br /><br />Kennedy: I get crazy blowjobs man! Hah! I mean crazy blowjobs! And not by men either man! (lol) I mean women man! women actually put their mouth on my penis man, i swear to god it's true! Guest: (has puzzled, sad look on his face, like he's looking at a retarded baby midget with lesions all over it that's crying in pain. Like.... it would be wrong to kill something like that.....right?..........) End scene. <br /><br />Thanks for another piece of absolute trash Jamie. You should have at least played that rollin' with Bob Saget video on there, that was mildly amusing at some point. Oh, and way to include Carrot Top in one of many sad attempts to make yourself look funny. It didn't work, rofl.
