Two paramedics, David (Johnny Messner) and Victor (Jon Huertas) received a emergency call to help a mysterious woman (Deanna Russo) and her daughter Libby (Saige Ryan Campbell) in a deserted area outside from a gas station.

Which they are composed by Scientist, Philosophers and Mathematicians. Which is controlled by a man, who called himself "The Teacher" (Daniel Benzali). But David and Victor learns by the Quanta Group truly believes the end of the world is coming soon and they are preparing a mass suicide. While Victor is been seduced by this group. David tries to escape to from this cult with the help of Libby and saves his friend before it's too late.<br /><br />Directed by Daniel Myrick (Co-director of "The Blair Witch Project") made an fascinating, clever, low-budget thriller with hints of horror and science-fiction. Myrick certainly handles well the low-budget of the movie by giving good performances from his cast, creating genuine suspense and an creepy atmosphere in the story. For a Direct to DVD project, this has good qualities. The director certainly shows a lot of talent behind the camera. But the film does it's usual share of flaws, especially during the third act but Myrick certainly does take his time by making the movie works. I think, the viewers will find themselves intrigue by the premise and they also will be modestly entertained by the picture. It's certainly worth seeing. (*** Â½/*****).
