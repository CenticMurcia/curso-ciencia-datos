This is my all time favorite movie. I am never disappointed in the acting, the writing (from the brilliant Tom Wolfe novel), or technology. The film is basically historically accurate, with some interesting interpretive film making involving John Glenn and his first flight and other tidbits. If I happen across this film on a movie channel, from whatever point it is at, I watch it until the end.
