When i noticed this movie had not yet even been reviewed by its release date, I knew it was going to flop. I decided to see it anyways on its first showing at the local theatre with my friend. There was a total of 4 people (including us) in the theatre. Oh geez, I thought. A fan of SNL and Norm MacDonald, I figured it can't be THAT bad. Well, I'll just say as soon as the movie started, I was laughing. I never stopped laughing, honestly. It was one of the funniest movies I had seen in the theatres since The Whole Nine Yards. I could definately see that some of the immature humor would turn off some people, but if you like goofy, slapstick comedy, or are a fan of Saturday Night Live, you will probably find this movie entertaining. If not, so sue me.
