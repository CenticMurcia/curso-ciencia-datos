When i first got this game i was most pleased with it. But soon after i found it to easy and completed it in three days. Also a number of things let it down for example: The two twins you see on Cold Reception you are expecting to fight them, however you do not. But it is an unwritten rule that on a Bond film the person who introduces Bond to the Prime villian always ends up fighting him, however on Agent under fire you do not. Another thing is that Carla the Jackal appears quite deadly however when you fight she fights worse than a............. well Carla the Jackal. Another thing that was a let down was the AI intelligence and the fact that the bodies disappear, even perfect dark can handle that and thats on the n64. (Which has less memory) Also the multiplayer was a let down the legs on the players moved to fast for the speed that they were going! And the fact that you can only get three AI bots, Perfect Dark can manage eight. Overall not bad but alot of room for improvement.
