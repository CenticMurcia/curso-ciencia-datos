Free love, wild visuals and cool tunes. Not an AFI classic, but an under-rated period film of the late 60's. Actually, I consider it a better film than a lot of what is passed off today as "great entertainment". The acting is interesting, the direction is adequate, and while Buck Henry's screenplay deviates (?) from Terry and Mason's novella rather haphazardly, the film is still one to recommend. Especially while lounging in a bean bag chair on the purple shag carpet.<br /><br />The stereo soundtrack, (ABC ABCS-OC-9)featuring backgrounds by Dave Grusin, Steppenwolf and a wicked version of The Byrds' "Child of the Universe" is long out of print, and I have read that the master tapes were discarded in a 1970's clean out when ABC was sold.<br /><br />
