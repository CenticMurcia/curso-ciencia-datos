If you're looking for a scary movie with a simple plot this is the one to get. It isn't nearly as scary as it probably was in the 70s but you'll jump a few times.<br /><br />The plot is as simple as it gets. A group of friends and a younger brother who tags along all go on a trip. They run out of gas and find their way to abandoned house. Little do they know they'll be killed off one by one.<br /><br />The characters are pretty one dimensional. I did like how you learn more about the younger brother and his brother's relationship. That helped me actually care about the characters.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a great teen flick. The plot is easy to follow, the characters aren't complicated, and it's as scary as heck!
