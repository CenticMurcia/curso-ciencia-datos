Any person who has seen this movie and didn't laugh has no sense of humor. From the opening theater scene to the last "BLAH! BLAH! BLAH! BLAH! at Ernest's funeral, this movie kept me laughing throughout. Streep, Hawn (love her eyes) and Willis kept me "doubled over" and I thought they worked great together. I would highly recommend this movie for any one looking for a FIERCE "dark humor" comedy!
