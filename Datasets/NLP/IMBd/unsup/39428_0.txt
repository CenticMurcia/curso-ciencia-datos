Recap: It is soon prom night and every teenager, boys and girls alike, think about sex. Some have more or less disturbing small adventures, shown in short episodes, all about one kind of sex or other.<br /><br />Comments: A comedy split in small episodes, each with a little different story only loosely connected with each other. What they got in common is that at least one person in each episode is a teen who is attending the local high school.<br /><br />The jokes is only focused on sex, and actually even more crude and low than they use to be in a teen comedy. Some is so bad it is only embarrassing, but then again, there are a few jokes which are still pretty bad, but where I couldn't help myself and laugh a little. Otherwise, perhaps the best part of the movie is that it is only 73 minutes long and over quickly.<br /><br />What is a little surprising is that the they got such a big cast to agree to this, and surprisingly a few known actors and actresses. But as a movie, there are lot better comedies to choose from, there are even a lot better teen comedies to choose from.<br /><br />3/10
