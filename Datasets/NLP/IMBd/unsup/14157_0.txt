Excellent remake that is actually better then the original. Great acting by the supporting cast and fine direction by the always demented Tom Savini - who will be the next genere director to breakout!<br /><br />Really conveys all the terror of a "zombie attack". The standard one guy in the group who is nothing but an @$$hole comes off really well - I hate that guy.<br /><br />Looking for this one on DVD.
