I just have to sit down and write out a review to counter-act all the nonsense I have seen from people who give this movie a 10! <br /><br />I am the first to admit I loved the first two Santa Clause movies and was really looking forward to this third installment. I even scoffed at the IMDb overall rating for this movie. I thought to myself and told my friends - critics don't know anything about movies and they were hard on the first two films in this series (both average around 4.7 out of 10). This movie can't be as bad as they say and on and on I went.<br /><br />Well the people have spoken and the people are...uhm...well...hmmm...they are absolutely correct! I have to eat crow! This movie is a disaster! This movie SUCKS!!! This movie put me to sleep!!! I had to give it a one out of ten. I don't want to ever see this piece of dog doody again.<br /><br />A movie that relies on farting reindeer for laughs??....sheeesh!!! Enough said. The movie looks like it was thrown together at the last minute with a mish-mashed story line that is so transparent you can see clear through it. <br /><br />Even Tim Allen can't save this movie from being perhaps the worst Christmas movie ever made! If you suffer from insomnia this is the perfect remedy. Buy it on DVD and in minutes you will be nodding off. A word of caution though...should you wake up in the middle of it you will probably scream in abject horror...you will think you are having a Christmas nightmare...or hope that it really is all just a bad dream!' <br /><br />Disney should be shot for releasing this lump of coal. I guess everybody was naughty this year...that is the only explanation for releasing this piece of punishment! Tell your friends to save their money and hard-earned cash and stay the hell away from the Santa Clause 3. They will thank you for it in the end...I promise!! <br /><br />Ho Ho Ho Hurry up and run away from any theatre near you playing this load of reindeer dung!<br /><br />My rating: An absolute disaster - 1 star out of 10!! (as zeros are not allowed!!)
