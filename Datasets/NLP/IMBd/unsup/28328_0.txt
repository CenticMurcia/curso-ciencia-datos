I didn't know anything about this movie before I rented it, but being a seasoned horror/thriller movie lover I though I would try it. I only wish I hadn't. Why? Well lets just start with absolutely awful script and the dreadful acting, add to that the fact it feels like you are watching a pirate DVD (this isn't the Blair Witch) and that just about does it. I felt like switching it off about 20 minutes through, but I didn't and along it plodded until to my eternal shame it made me jump, just the once though. But that was it, and it was quite early on, later in the movie there were other things to disappoint, bad make up and effects, along with some more pretty awful acting. Some people may say this film was good for a low budget movie, I say I thought it was written, directed and performed by a class of first year performing arts students, and that is what I honestly thought. I thought I would watch the extras on the DVD and be amazed by this tale, of a group of performing arts students who had made their first movie which had become a cult hit and propelled all of the stars into Hollywood stardom, but sadly not. It was made by professionals. It was a film which just didn't deliver, well it did but the wrong things, bad acting, bad script, bad make up and bad effects, the worst movie I think I have ever seen!
