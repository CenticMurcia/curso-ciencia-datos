Is there anyone here alive that HAS experienced time-traveling and knows from the experience what it feels like? If no, our discussing the matter is but a mind game. I may be wrong, but the only suspicious thing about this feature is its alleged intention to become a blockbuster (yes, the rotating camera and the slow mo!). Now, i never question the way a movie i like came into being. And i love movies with unexplainable holes, exaggerated gags, unmotivated behavior, unsophisticated dialogs, clicheyed punchlines, clumsy acting, because they are SO funny you can laugh yer ass off! (Of course if you put aside the Humpty Dumpty's posture for the time being - the highbrow attitude is not always a must to make one smile!) Besides, Slipstream has an above average soundtrack. Talking about homaging, ripping and other forms of cross-reference, i saw this movie as Master Samwise's dream he was having with the Ring on (something not shown in the LoTR). Roars of laughter. Though in fact this one could easy be 30% shorter simply for the riddim sake.
