Corbucci is not known for any serious films and that this turned out to be one is maybe something of an accident - but there is no mistake about it, many scenes reveal the true nature of this film and especially the end, which is nothing less than gripping. To live for what is right and maybe dream but with open eyes. Often this film is mistaken for Two Comapaneros a much inferior effort although using some of the same actors. Whereas Tomas Milian is unreal in most of his films, so is not the case with Tony Musante and especially not in this film. It's a film about revolution but it does not neglect the hidden problems in all of us regarding this. There are traitors all around and some of them are given the right treatment in this film. All and all this is a film with a heart where you least expect it - right in the very center of what appears to be only a cheap "Spaghetti"-western. A film made in the very same times as the phony 68-movement but without being phony itself. Why did not this film receive a descent DVD-treatment instead of the much inferior "Two Companeros"? Your guess is not as good as mine - because I can tell You: American companies do not like truly revolutionary films. Yes, Criterion, this would be something for You to have a bite of!
