I was a huge fan of this series when it first aired. I recently stumbled onto the DVD Boxed set and just finished up with the final episode last night. I was reminded of just how much I loved this show. Granted, I haven't seen the original British version, but recently found a boxed set and I'm anxiously looking forward to viewing. Of course, I understand the desire for those who have seen both versions to make comparisons. I'm sure i'll be doing the same once I finish watching the British version. But if you just take the American version on it's own merits, it's hard to find another show comparable in quality and sheer grittiness. Pastorelli's Fitz is a deeply flawed human being. Many times his disgust and disdain for others is off-putting and makes one question why we care for him. Just as often though we see the kinks in his armor. His humanity is shielded with walls of self loathing. It's that dichotomy of his inner struggles which what make this such a great show and a breath of fresh air to watch. It's unfortunate that American TV just wasn't ready for the dark realities that this show portrayed. There's nothing better than watching a TV show that dares to be REAL with multi-layered characters. It seems there have been some on here reviewing this show with a black-and-white bias comparison to the original British version. I'm truly looking forward to watching Coltrane's Fitz with an open mind, which is what others here haven't seemed to be able to do with Pastorelli's Fitz.
