Hi everybody! I found the movie really an exaggeration of all the most common stereotypes about Sicily. I hope that the audience of such a movie is aware that this is a movie set in a small town of Sicily of 40 years ago, and that it does not ABSOLUTELY describe how cities are there nowadays.<br /><br />To all people that think that this is the reality, I strongly invite you going visiting Sicily. The movie was made on purpose to describe terrible happenings only and make Sicily and its inhabitants appear as the very hell... The part I disagree most is especially the beginning where Marja was a so good holy creature and everybody else was a devil... even the music in the background recalled the hell, whereas look at the peaceful music background played during those few extremely peaceful parts set in Finland, during the sauna near the lake (rantasauna) in the middle of the forest...<br /><br />Reading the comment of Masuchris (which wanted to give a motherly advice to her 17 years old daughter about marrying a Mexican guy or from any other terrible nation) really confirmed my fears: people cannot really make the difference between a movie talking about the worst case, the worst possible experience one can have in a certain place and what the reality is normally.<br /><br />Please, do not believe that this has been a good description of what Sicily is, because it is not.
