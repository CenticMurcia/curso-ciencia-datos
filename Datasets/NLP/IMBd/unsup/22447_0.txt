The best Hollywood film that Hollywood never made! This has instant classic stamped all over it. A film that plays, teases and laughs both with and at it's many possible influences, not to mention itself along the way.<br /><br />Stunning cinematography and 'bravura' performances from the female leads, this is the perfect TV Sunday afternoon film if the world was sound instead of being the bonkers screwed up place it actually is.<br /><br />Unreservedly recommended to anyone and if you don't find it engaging, maybe it's yourself that needs a reassessment.<br /><br />Now just how does one get to see his other movies??!!!!!
