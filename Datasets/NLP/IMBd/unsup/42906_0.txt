OK, lets keep this short and sweet. This movie is possibly the worst movie i have EVER seen, as the first one is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time i have been bitterly disappointed twice so far !please save yourself the same heart ache and just watch the first Starship Troopers again while imagining in your own mind the endless possibilities they could of embraced to build open, then if you really must, watch the second and third films and see how it was completely and utterly screwed up. As for Ed Neumeier, you should be ashamed of yourself sir.<br /><br />Sorry about the rant but some things just need to be said.
