My Rating: *** out of ****. <br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer saying that The Black Album is not a classic. I certainly think it is. It contains some of the best songwriting Metallica has ever done. Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Nothing Else Matters, and Of Wolf and Man. I also believe Holier Than Thou, Don't Tread on Me, The God That Failed, My Friend of Misery and The Struggle Within are underrated. The weakest song on the album is probably Through The Never but its still a great song. So yeah I completely disagree with you about The Black Album not being a classic.<br /><br />What I do agree with you on is that its not the only Metallica album that deserves a DVD like this. I also agree with you that its not their best. Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All are definitely superior. The songwriting is undeniably great on The Black Album but yeah it is superior on those two albums(Master of Puppets and One are my two favorite songs).<br /><br />A case could be made that the Black Album is probably the most important album in Metallica's career. It is their most financially successful album and it gave them a ton of new fans. After The Black Album things were very much different for Metallica. They took a different step in their music and made the Load/Reload albums, probably the most criticized of all their albums (well maybe thats actually St. Anger but its close). For better or worse, The Black Album was a major turning point in their careers.<br /><br />The DVD is definitely worth watching. I thought it gave a lot of interesting information about the songs. I enjoyed watching these guys talk about the album, I really just enjoy watching these guys. They are awesome. Lars Ulrich maybe a bit of a dick but he is hilarious. James Hetfield gives a lot of interesting background on some of the songs and he seems like a really cool guy. Kirk Hammett can certainly jam on the guitar. I liked that Jason Newstead got to talk about My Friend of Misery and to show off how talented he really is. <br /><br />Overall, the DVD is worth watching and the album, in my opinion, is a must-have. The DVD maybe a little limited but it is interesting. I am really looking forward to the Some Kind of Monster documentary.
