Just watched this film, ironically, on the same DVD that another commenter did, paired with a mob film on a $1.00 DVD. The acting by Manz was awful, sound sucked, and the ending really did come, "out of the blue". Hopper looked to be three sheets to the wind the entire flick, which he probably was, and thats fine. I kept watching to see where it was headed, because I had no clue. I kinda missed the incest angle, unless the kissing and noodling in the truck and cars were supposed to represent something more sinister. ONe commenter was shocked that the family was referred to as white trash. Well, yeah, they were. I'm from the northwest, and would have been 18 when this film was shot....there's lots of folks that have a beer with there kid when they just got outta prison!
