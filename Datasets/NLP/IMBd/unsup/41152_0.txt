Can this be possibly the worst movie ever put to celluloid? OK obvious over-the-top characters, frat boy, lesbian's, lonely guy, black token actor and female lead, was this script pulled from the are you smarter then a 5th grader.<br /><br />SPOILERS: 1.first off what was with frat boy not changing the flat 2.who closes the sunroof on there friends while they are hanging halfway out.<br /><br />3.exactly what patch of road did frat boy hit to cause him not to stop the vehicle safely, never mind at such a long distance, unless he was looking for the nearest branch.<br /><br />4.even as obnoxious as frat boy was not even he should have been so callous as to be concern with the car then his friend being cut in half.<br /><br />5.why would everyone leave the car and leave the one girl behind with half a lesbian? 6.why were these supposed young people so winded after running a few feet.<br /><br />7.when the lesbian was running away why couldn't she leave limp-along in the dust? 8.why would frat boy having noticing what was producing the smoke not share this bit of info with his girlfriend at the very least? I can go on and on about the well I won't say plot holes u really need a plot to have holes to begin with, and besides Sophie's Choices (pun intended) going off on her own and not having the strength to fight off some tired old hag, oh yeah never mind having been drowned for all about 20 seconds and her so called friend not even trying to resuscitate her.<br /><br />But what was the deal after having grabbed the sheriff's keys and running right passed a perfectly good escape vehicle? I don't comment much here, actually this maybe my second time, and it's often said there are much worst movies out there, but this is the worst I've ever personally experienced!
