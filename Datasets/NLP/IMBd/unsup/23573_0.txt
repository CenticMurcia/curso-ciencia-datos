A group of explorers find themselves stranded on a plateau where prehistoric beasts still live, cut off from the rest of the planet's evolution.<br /><br />This is still the best adaptation of Conan Doyle's gripping novel. It may be silent but the characters are exactly how they were envisaged in the book, the dinosaurs are well-made and there is barely a dull moment. The first film of this genre to really attract attention is still one of the highlights.
