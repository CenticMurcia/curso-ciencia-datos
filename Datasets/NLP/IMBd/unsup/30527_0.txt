As I write this, Jane Wyman died two days ago (9/10/07) at 93 years of age. I did not watch this because I knew that, it was merely coincidence.<br /><br />Stage Fright is basically a "whodunit" because you, the viewer, will think you know who the culprit is in this for a while and then realize that maybe you don't, after all. Jane Wyman knows of this murder, and helps the man who seems to be a suspect, and tries to "go undercover" to expose the woman who supposedly is the culprit, as played by Marlene Deitrich, in all her scary Teutonic glory. Wyman is also assisted by a police officer ("Ordinary" Smith) and her parents, one of whom is played by the wonderful Alistair Sim, not long before he played "Scrooge" in a Christmas Carol. This is entertaining and amusing but not, to me, top notch Hitchcock. The Master himself also puts in one of his famous cameos in this, as usual. This was Hitchcock's last film made in the UK until "Frenzy". If you're a Hitchcock fan,of course you'll want to see this if you haven't. I enjoyed it but it dragged on a bit at times. 7 out of 10.
