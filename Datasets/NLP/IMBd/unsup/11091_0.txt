Where to begin, I guess I'll start with saying that Adrien Brody was awesome! This is one on my favorite films! If you haven't seen it yet you need to because it is just wonderful. Anyways Adrien Brody plays a psychotic murder named Harry, who kidnaps a woman and buries her alive. He does this as an attempt to get ransom money from her husband. Harry gets a tape to the husband which explains that if he wants to know where his wife is buried he must not contact the police and pay him the amount of money he asks for, or Harry will never tell where she is. Well of course like in every movie the husband goes to the police. In a wicked awesome chase scene Harry is captured, but keeps to his word of never telling the woman's where abouts. Maura Tierney is the only person Harry says he will talk to. As soon as she sits down the police are taken on a wild goose chase by the brilliant young killer. As the police say,"He's the brains in the operation." or something like that. With wonderful acting on both Maura and Adriens parts Oxygen is a fast paced thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
