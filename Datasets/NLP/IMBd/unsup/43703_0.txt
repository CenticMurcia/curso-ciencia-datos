Maybe I was just not wasted enough for this film. As mentioned in an earlier review the story line sounded very promising. The cast was excellent I mean Andrew McCarthy did an excellent job as usual and Robert Patrick was good and Nick Mancuso can play the crazy as well as anyone and Portia, well she was not at her best(so much better in Arrested Develpement). I kept watching it hoping it would get better. It didn't. I mean come one when you are sneaking across a maniacal doctors compound why would you run right for the spot light? Would you not slink against walls and trees trying not to be seen? Also stated in an earlier review too bad MST300 is not on this would have perfect for it. And come on some FBI guy tells you to stay put and you keep running after him, I'm thinking, not. What happened, no really, what happened?
