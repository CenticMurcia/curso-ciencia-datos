I haven't seen his movie since the early eighties when I rented it. I remember dudes drinking motor oil, eating garbage and fish carcases off the beach. My favorite scene is when these two surfer buddies are too enthralled with their surfing stories to notice both of their girlfriends have unclothed, they finally notice and comment in a Spicolli manner, "You guys are nude," then they go right back to their surf discussion. It's got nerds, surfers, zombies, hot-ties, weirdos, garbage eating, motor oil drinking, and a beauty named Crystal or sum-thin like that. The only thing bad about this movie is I can't find it anywhere. My guess is that it never went to the DVD format due to it's obscurity. So if anyone reading this can get a copy of this baby, do so.
