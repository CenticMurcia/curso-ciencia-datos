Nancy Wagner (Sandra Dee in her last movie role) is a librarian at the Miskatonic Univ where the only copy of the Necronomicon (an evil book) is kept. Sinister Wilbur Whatley (a young Dean Stockwell in a hideous mustache and hair do) uses her to get access to the book. He then invites her to his house in Arkham. He gets her there and drugs her to make her stay...he has plans for her! Also there's someTHING in the attic banging at the locked door. Two of Nancy's friends come to get her and all hell breaks loose!<br /><br />First off, this is NOT a faithful adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's story (I should know--I just read it a few weeks ago). Some scenes are taken from it but the script is very different from the source. That said it's not a bad film. It's elaborately done (beautiful settings, eerie sounds and rich deep color) and is mildly engrossing. <br /><br />Unfortunately it's far from perfect. The script is OK but there are far too many plot holes (for instance, Dee tells Stockwell she can't stay the weekend...in the very next scene she's saying she is!). Also the acting is really bad by the two leads--Dee seems uneasy and unsure of how to play her part; Stockwell (who is a great actor) is, surprisingly, terrible! He acts like he's stoned half the time (maybe he was) and is just horrible.<br /><br />There are scenes of a monster stalking about (hey, it's an AIP film!) and attacking which are very psychedelic (lots of flashing lights, negative film, different colors, loud sounds) and quite effective. Look for Talia Coppola (later Shire) as one of the victims. However, there's no graphic gore or blood. Also, a real cool ending. Also, there's an odd somewhat homophobic line in this--a friend of Dee comments on her staying with Stockwell--"If he were straight, I wouldn't be worried." ??????? Is that supposed to be funny? It's pretty stupid and offensive today.<br /><br />All in all, an OK film. It's been reissued in VHS and DVD in a beautiful new print with great color and sound. Try to see it that way--it really helps the film.
