It wasn't as corny as I thought it would be. "Something's Gotta Give" was *much* harder to sit through! However, the first half of the movie is a giant plug for the band "Simple Plan." There's a performance scene where the band members even get lines! Lucky for me, I love them, so I enjoyed getting to hear a new song in it's entirety and see all their close-ups. I did find it very strange, though. I'm wondering how much money their publicist paid to get them plugged like that in an Olsen twins movie??? And what's with Dr. Drew as the dad. He's a sex doctor, man! There's something just unwholesome about that! There's also one seen in a black hair shop where the twins have many outfit changes and everyone is dancing. It is the most ridiculous movie moment ever! It's completely out of place. Especially since the end result is their hair being straightened. If they removed that scene from the movie, or at least took out the wardrobe changes and dancing, then it would be better.
