On the plus side, "Camp" has a lot of energy and loads of affection for it's young characters. Some of the musical numbers are fun ("Turkey Lurkey Time" from "Promises, Promises"; the funny All About Eve-ish scene with Sondheim's "I'm Still Here;" the Todd Rundgren song at the end). So you can't really dislike the film.<br /><br />However, the bad far outweighs the good. Director/writer Todd Graf has done good work as an actor, but his dual turn here is far from promising. The dreadful script leaves no tired cliche or cliched character unturned & the dialogue is stilted and amateurish. <br /><br />Some of the scenes are just plain unbelievable (e.g. the straight hunk suddenly trying to come on to the gay kid). Some are groan-inducing: for example, when the group starts doing a new piece by the cynical, self-pitying, alcoholic composer, it brings him around and he joins the band.<br /><br />Also, the film stretches credibility with some of the choices of shows the kids do - would anyone really try to put on a production of "Follies" or "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" with teenagers? These scenes exist for nothing more than easy laughs.<br /><br />The cast of unknowns are a mixed lot - some are more personable than others, some are a little awkward, but the dialogue doesn't help any of them.<br /><br />Graf based this film on his own experiences at a summer theater camp for teens, but you'd never know it. There's not one fresh or uncontrived moment in the film - it could have been made by anyone who's seen "Fame."
