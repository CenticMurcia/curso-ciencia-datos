After watching the "Cheezy Horror" preview discs Vol 1 & 2, I've been in the mood for Cheese Horror. First up was Shark Attack on the Mediterranean  and that more than fit the mold. Next was this overly clichéd werewolf story. but with one catch: It really wasn't that bad. Yes, all elements were there, the characters you knew were gonna get it and in which order and the predictable (no spoiler) door left open for Bigger, Badder Wolf. But the performance from Sam, the change from normal wolf-man to talking, pants wearing creature and a mild subplot of how he came to be. Yes, the movie was bad, but the efforts involved, makes it overall, really not that bad. I've seen a lot worse, a lot worse werewolf movies (see Howling II-XXVII). Worth watching on "instant" than waiting for in the mail.
