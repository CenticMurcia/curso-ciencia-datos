This was such a wasted opportunity. The main character was so weak - what where these silly film makers thinking? Quite a wasted opportunity. Something else also bothered me - but I can't quite put my finger on it - the picture quality seemed off. Maybe I need to watch it again I am wondering what the budget was for this movie? Was it a low budget film or a student project? Something was definitely not right here. I could see the potential here but I think the boat was missed in a big way.<br /><br />I wanted to laugh in so many places but I was being told to laugh by the direction, but it just didn't hit the right note.
