Some people throw around the term "worst movie ever" but I don't. Not since I was 10. When I was 10, I saw this movie. At that age, I had digested a lot of bad movies and television (like the Small Wonder sitcom... any sitcom... and movies like Plan 9 and Howard The Duck) but watching this movie was the first time that I had ever pressed the fast-forward button on my VCR because what I was watching was so bad and I wanted it to end. My high tolerance to worthless trash was put to the test and failed. It started near the beginning, when I pressed the fast-forward button because Andy was going to the video store on his bike and they just showed gratuitous shots of his determined face and peddling feet for SO LONG that I began to doubt that there was an end to it. And then when he left the video store, they showed more minutes-on-end of Andy just peddling home. Was this supposed to be entertainment? I would've tolerated it if there were some credits over the imagery, but it was already 15 minutes into the movie. All I remember about the movie was that he went to the video store and met some creepy guy and rented a silver videotape and went home to his sister and when his sister watched the video, she was sucked into the t.v. and he went in after her to find her with his magic remote and they traveled through the channels and battled the villain, who turned out to be the creepy guy from the video store. What an amazingly original plot! Everything else is a blur and I'm guessing that I repressed the rest of the movie, even though I watched it a few more times in simple shock that it was so bad, even by my lax standards. And I would see if I could watch the whole thing without hitting fast-forward or stop/eject. I have since forgotten everything after Andy goes into the television, except for a few fuzzy details. This movie shocked me with its lameness when I was 10, which really says something about how it sucks. Stay away!
