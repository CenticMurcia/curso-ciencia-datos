This was one hilarious film. Adam Sandler cracked me up!! So did Ben Stiller as the nasty intern at the nursing home: "Could I trouble you for a glass of warm milk?" "You could trouble me for a warm glass of SHUT THE HELL UP!" That was so funny. And the "Mista-mista" lady that Sandler runs into twice in the movie. This is my sister's favourite movie, but I think "Caddyshack" was better. That one was a classic. <br /><br />But this movie is still good. The fight between Happy and Bob Barker (of "The Price is Right") was hysterical ("The price is wrong, b**ch") and Kevin Nealon was funny as that weird golfer ("Send the ball home, Happy") <br /><br />There is also one really funny scene which is only on some TV versions. Happy tells Ben Stiller that he's been told about how bad he treats the old people at the nursing home. Stiller is then thrown out the window and beat up by the old people. That might be on a DVD version of this movie but I don't know.<br /><br />***1/2 out of *****
