The only familiar Looney Tunes character featured in this one is Porky Pig. It's about 6 1/2 minutes long.<br /><br />The setting is theoretically 1930's era Egypt. A bunch of guys sit around wearing turbans and loin clothes. A woman wearing harem pants and a little top struts by with a jug on her head, then removes her face veil to expose a very ugly face. (She doesn't dance, though.) Then the scene shifts to a guy in loincloth and turban sitting on a bed of nails. He swallows a flaming sword which gives him indigestion. Next a tour group of people clad in European-style safari garb boards a camel to go sightseeing. All of this happens within the first minute and a half.<br /><br />Porky Pig tries to join the tour group, but gets left behind. So he gets on his own camel and heads out. They get lost in the desert under the blazing sun. The camel freaks out and starts playing bagpipes, then dances the Highland fling. (Yes, it really is recognizable as the Fling complete with shedding. The camel's turnout isn't half bad... As for what it's doing in a cartoon titled Porky In Egypt, well, remember, the camel IS freaking out.) Porky sees a mirage of the camel sitting in a pond of cool water and tries to jump in with it, and finds himself buried in sand. The camel gets its sanity back long enough to take them back to the city.<br /><br />I'll admit, Porky isn't my favorite Looney Tunes character, and 4 1/2 minutes of the camel freaking out got to be a bit excessive for my taste - at first it was amusing, but then it started to drag and seemed like it wasn't going anywhere. So in general I'm not fond of this cartoon. But I was amused by the first 1 1/2 minutes, and I did like the camel's Highland Fling.
