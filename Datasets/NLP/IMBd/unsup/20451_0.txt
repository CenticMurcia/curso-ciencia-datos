Okay, I'll say right off that I could possibly *SPOIL* the 'biggest' part of this...er...'film'. Well, if you can really *SPOIL* something this bad.<br /><br />I consider 'The Item' the worst movie I ever saw in my life. Worse than 'Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey'. Worse than Vanilla Ice's 'Cool as Ice' (although ya'll gotta check that out to hear how he says 'horse'...that alone is worth the rental price). <br /><br />Basically, a bunch of people pick up a box they're not allowed to open. What do they do? They open it. Inside is what appears to be a cross between the old children's toy (Glow-worms...you squeeze 'em, they light up and glow) and a moldy sock with some sort of nuclear waste poured all over it. That's it. Just this fluorescent worm-like thing that speaks in tongues and makes people kill themselves.<br /><br />The irony of the whole thing is that without the cheesy sock, it could have been a good movie. The gore factor was pretty good (and when I rent horror, I want gore...unfortunately, I picked this from the 'bore' section). I could tolerate most of the acting. A couple of the characters obviously needed some psychiatric help, but that's not unusual.<br /><br />But the sock. Unfortunately, due to the fluorescent sock, this movie sunk to the dregs, being rated, at best, with 0 stars out of 10.
