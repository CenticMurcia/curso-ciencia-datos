A lot of Rocky buffs expect viewers to suspend all disbelief, with each passing installation. You can only keep pummeling a series so much, however, without revolt. Most Rocky fans are not children anymore and can not be expected to play along as such.<br /><br />The emergence of Tommy Gunn was kind of fun, but the premise of the plot is so fabled, as to be impossible. There is no fixing this kind of disappointment.<br /><br />The only positive thing that can be said about this film is the quasi-inspiration, though prototypical, premise of sticking together and weathering the storm. The father and son dynamic is rather good in this one, making this film an installation with some merit.<br /><br />But it is all undermined by the ridiculous and highly unlikely plot points.<br /><br />Kudos for trying, I guess.
