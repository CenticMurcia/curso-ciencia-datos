What's not to like? A gritty crime movie with lashings of the old ultraviolence all round! I like the way the film makers portray the desperation of life on Moscow's streets, i.e the Granny that steals food from a corpse, the banker who has to hire maniacs to protect him from gangsters.<br /><br />It seems the Russians love their action movies too - but in many ways it's more like a Japanese anime film with it's convoluted intra-gang politics and cartoon violence.<br /><br />True, they could have done with more money - but what the hell, CGI looks crap anyway compared to real stunts. Another gripe is the way things would explode for no reason - like that visual gag in The Simpsons where even if a pram crashes it blows up. But these shouldn't bother anyone who really likes their gangster movies. Korolev is like the Man With No Name, he bludgeons his way through Moscow lowlife until the job is over.<br /><br />This film r0x0rs! (oh and apparently there is a PC game of it too)
