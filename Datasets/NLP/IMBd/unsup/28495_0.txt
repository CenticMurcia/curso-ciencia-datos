This is Akira Kurosawa's venture into noir, and a definite departure for those who are more familiar with his samurai films. It stars Kurosawa regular Toshir√¥ Mifune as a young war vet turned policeman, who loses his gun on a crowded streetcar. His wise boss pairs him with 25 year police veteran Takashi Shimura to find the gun, which has been used in an assault and robbery. Before it is over, the gun will be used to kill a woman and Shimura will also be shot.<br /><br />I can say with certainty that this is one Japanese movie that will never be remade in Hollywood. The overriding theme of this film is responsibility. I can no more imagine an American cop in the anguish of Mifune, and offering to resign because his gun was used in a crime, than I can imagine, well, I just can't image anything more foreign.<br /><br />Mifune was consumed with his responsibility in the matter and was relentless in finding his gun. With the help of the wise veteran Shimura, he managed to overcome all odds and succeed. But, Shimura reminded him that he would soon forget the matter as there were many more Yusa's out there preying on the people.<br /><br />It was an excellent look at post war Japan and the struggles of the people to exist. It was another brilliant work in the outstanding collection of Akira Kurosawa.<br /><br />Not to be missed.
