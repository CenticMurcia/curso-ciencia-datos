This film was just about perfect. My main complaint would be that it was not long enough.<br /><br />It is right up there with The Decline of Western Cilvilization: The Metal years and VH1's 4 part series on Metal. If you like punk, then you would enjoy American HardCore as well.<br /><br />The cool thing about these documentaries is that having grown up when most of these sounds were just kicking in, you get to relive the excitement and fill in a great deal of blanks about what happened behind the scenes.<br /><br />Sam's next film should be out soon: Global Metal. I look forward to that one as well. The more music documentaries the better!!!!
