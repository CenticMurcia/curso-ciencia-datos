HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS - Kate Hudson, Matthew McConaughey (PG-13) "How to lose..." is a story about a how to journalist (Hudson) who plans a story on how to blah blah blah. McConaughey soon becomes her little experiment, but little does she know that he has a bet to make her fall in love with him in 10 days. In the end, of course, they end up falling in love. <br /><br /> This movie was so painfully boring that I wanted to slam my head in the seat in front of me! The only thing that saved this film from being a complete catostrophe is Kate Hudson. She once again proves that she is great actress. Too bad McConaughey screws up the film for her. All I have to say is this movie was horrible. Save your self some money and time and just rent it when it come out on dvd! ** out of ***** (2 stars for Hudson's acting)
