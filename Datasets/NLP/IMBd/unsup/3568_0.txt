This is one of my favorite (non-animated) Christmas movies. It is just so sweet, pure sugar. It will make you happy and put you in the Christmas spirit. This is such a departure from some of Mimi Rogers other work and Marla Maples gives this movie lots of camp. It always makes me want to get a seasonal job at a department store when I watch this movie. The little boy whose mother died reminds me of a young Joey Lawrence. I try to catch it each year but I always have trouble finding it. I wish it was played more often. I do not believe it is available on DVD/tape. If you get the rare opportunity to catch this movie, make sure you do.
