How do these movies get made? Asinine script, predictable plot, terrible acting, bad scenes, and awful stunts add up to one of the worst Hollywood has spewed forth. Don't waste your time. This movie was made for 12-yr old boys. I can say nothing good and not enough bad about this phlegm. That's right, it's not even a 'film'.
