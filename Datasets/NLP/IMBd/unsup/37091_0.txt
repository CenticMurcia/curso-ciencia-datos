In story, cinematography, and acting, I see the strong influence from Jean-Luc Godard's films in the 80s, especially arty-and-pop "amateur" crime movie First Name: Carmen. The behavior of Edward (Damian Young) after being tortured is reminiscent of Godard's acting; it cracks me up.<br /><br />However, I have to say this film is terrible for the following reasons: student film level of acting, full of meaningless dialogues (e.g. "I'm sorry" "For what?" "I don't know"), and an abrupt ending. Please no more clich√©d amnesia gimmick to make a plot. Please no more "latest" technology gadget--I'm talking about that pathetic floppy disk joke.
