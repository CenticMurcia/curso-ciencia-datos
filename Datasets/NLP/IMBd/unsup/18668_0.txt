You just do not see good films like this being advertised anymore! This movie totally exceeded my expectations. I loved everything about it.<br /><br />First of all the story was a new twist on an old subject. Granted, I know there has been movies about men posing as women in the arts previous, but none told like this one. There is no right or wrong answer to any of the questions this movie poses. The idea of sexuality, masculine and feminine is so complex. The writers know this and do not try to explain it or give their view about it in one hour and forty-nine minutes. Rather they just indulge you in a time and place where plays were just that, acting. No glamour, no starlets, no paparazzi, just acting.<br /><br />I applaud everyone who participated in making this film. I had to roll the credits back at the start of the film in order to re-read that Robert De Niro was one of the producers of this film.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie tremendously and a bit dishearten that I did not take the time to see it in the theater. I will not make the same mistake twice and now I will have to buy it for my collection!
