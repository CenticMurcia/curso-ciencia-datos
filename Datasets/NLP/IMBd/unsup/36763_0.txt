With the cast and the pictures on the cover, it looked like a safe bet but it was absolutely one of the most appalling films I have ever seen. It was like watching an accident, dreadful but you had to keep watching because you couldn't quite believe that anything could be so abysmal. I am amazed that it drew the cast it did. How desperate could the cast be, or does Dwight have something on all of them? Every single actor did an awful job. It was wooden, totally unrealistic and had no plot or meaning to the story. I wondered whether perhaps it was all a big joke at first. Seriously, don't even bother, unless you want to be open mouthed in disbelief!!
