Yo I'm not a huge fan of The Game, but as a avid listener of hip-hop music and it's many offspring, I've been following the beef he and his Black Wall Street crew has with 50 Cent and G-Unit. Listening to interviews involving both sides, it seemed like nothing more than two chiefs arguing about who should have more feathers. Nothing wrong with that. After purchasing and viewing the Stop Snitchin' Stop Lyin' DVD, I felt that it solidified all I had heard to be true about the whole 'kicking out' of The Game from G-Unit. Game wasn't gonna be a pawn of 50's like certain other members of G-Unit. He definitely showed that he has the talent and the mind state of a Boss. On the DVD he enters Queens, NY, the "home" of Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson and leaves without a scratch on his face because it seemed like 50's own hood doesn't respect him. On the DVD there's proof of 50's alleged snitchin' and putting someone in prison for a very long time. "Don't Snitch" is a code in the streets (a place 50 must've forgotten about) that shouldn't be broken and a guy that has made a career off of being a "street-dude" broke that code. There are two sides to every story so if you want to hear The Game's side and you're in the mood for drama and comedy wrapped into one, then grab the DVD! It's 100% biased so purchase at your own risk!
