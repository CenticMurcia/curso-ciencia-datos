One of my favorites of the 30's and 40's light comedy-mysteries. Spooky house, hidden passages and a murderer to catch. Carole Landis never looked better, and Joan Blondell is at her funniest. A shame that films like this one aren't seen much anymore. The B/W version is better to watch than the colorized version, but either is worth watching. Recently re-issued as a low cost DVD.
