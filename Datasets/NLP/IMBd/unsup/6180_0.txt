Big, bronzed Steve Reeves is Hercules, Greek stupor hero who burns 50 brain cells per second. I guess these epics were big during the 50's, but watching them now is like seeing a documentary with nitrous. There's supposed to be a story, but the makers felt it better to emphasize action rather than plot. It doesn't work and you get a lot of choreographed fight scenes. Watch Herc hurl chocolate bunnies. Plenty of Greek guys in skirts. Must've been the fad back then. I thought Hercster could've made the movie a lot better by snapping Ulysses in half. Plus, he has an affair and still keeps his hotty bride Iole. The ending is a blockbuster fight scene with lots of people flying, horses dying, and audiences crying.<br /><br />At least Steve Reeves is less annoying than Miles O' Keefe.
