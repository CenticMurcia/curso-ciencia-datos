I have to agree i went to see this film with my mum and we throughly enjoyed it. Everyone in the film has acted well and the Laila Majnu climax is one of the best adaptations that i've seen. It's truly a beautiful concept and a feast for the eyes. It felt as if i was in a theatre enjoying a stage play. Madhuri has done well in this film, the role suits her perfectly but hats off to the other actors who have shown their talent in the climax. The songs are also pleasant and fit in perfectly with the pace of the film,not once do you feel that they are out of place. In my opinion this is much better than Om Shanti Om and should have been released for the festive season instead of OSO. Don't miss this film in the cinema, ignore all the critics and go see it for yourself!
