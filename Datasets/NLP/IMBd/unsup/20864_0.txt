Little Britain is one of those shows that just makes you laugh regardless of what you think is funny. I personally hate the vulgar humor sported by Madtv, but for some reason Little Britain doesn't seem to bother me, although it is more crude. The characters do repeat themselves and most of the skits are the same joke, but that's what makes it so funny! You know the joke is coming and still it makes you laugh. Take Lou and Andy for example. Andy is always changing his mind, and getting up and running around while Lou's back is turned, but the joke is always funny because it is always new in some small way. In the United States, we're so worried about being politically correct that we avoid what is truly funny, and we show horrible programming. Little Britain is a refreshing change for me, and it has killed my interest in American broadcasts.
