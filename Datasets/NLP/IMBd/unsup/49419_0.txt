i was dragged out of my bed for this film and frog marched down to the local cinema where i paid my money and i intended to enjoy a film, which i was convinced would be in the style of Bowling for Columbine ... 3 hours later after i had sat through the same point being rehashed and retold to me by various people i ran outside with a splitting headache i had such high hopes for this film, the film had its heart in the right place but the director obviously didn't cut his film enough.<br /><br />i really do want to say something good about this film, so i will - it made a good point - i just wish it had not made it about 7 times, i do honestly believe this film could have been better had it been scaled back - i realise there is a lot to bring to the attention of the viewers but not at the expense of alienating them
