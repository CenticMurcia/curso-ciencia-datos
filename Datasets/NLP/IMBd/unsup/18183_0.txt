A sadistic woman killer throws suspicion on a well-meaning Priest, and the clergyman struggles to bring the truth to light. Hackneyed melodrama with religious overtones is made compelling and watchable by an extraordinary performance by Brad Dourif.<br /><br />MPAA: Rated R for nudity, sexuality, violence, and language.
