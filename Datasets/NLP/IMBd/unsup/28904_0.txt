I watched this film before Christmas when TV decides to play movies all day long and I get very easily distracted. As I have been studying a few Cary Grant film over the past semester I wanted to watch Penny Serenade because I thought it may help an essay I am writing currently. My mother also sat down to watch with me. At the beginning I was unimpressed to be honest but as soon as the story really gets going and the drama unfolds I was hooked. I cried when Irene Dune couldn't have children anymore, I cried when The adoption baby was bought out and I sobbed and sobbed when the little girl died. I wasn't expecting such an emotion attack but I was fully involved in the narrative. If you like Cary Grant or Irene Dune watch this, If you like very well acted dramas watch this, If you like films watch this, I seriously doubt you will be disappointed! 10/10
