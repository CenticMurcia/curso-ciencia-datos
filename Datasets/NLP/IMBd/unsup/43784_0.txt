The original screenplay, ("The Devil's Doorway"), showed promise but re-writes apparently turned this into one of those muddles which has no clear point or purpose other than to string together a few creepy scenes in the hope an audience will "buy" it. Things start to go wrong in the very first reel when Katherine Ross and Sam Elliott arrive in England where Ross has a job waiting for her. They're involved in a road accident and get a lift from a man who turns out to be the reason for their coming to England. Is this a coincidence? If so, it boggles the mind. If it isn't a coincidence, then what is it? The movie never explains because, hey, it's a movie, and it's not supposed to make any sense. Note how leading lady Katharine Ross is overdressed throughout in floor-length skirts and long-sleeved blouses whereas leading man Sam Elliott quickly and completely strips down for a rear-view nude scene -- buns by Michelangelo! -- in which he's shown walking into a bathroom and climbing into a shower. There's no plot purpose for this blatant display of male skin and one suspects someone on the film-making staff simply decided that as long as one has a hot, hairy hunk like Sam Elliott in one's employ, why not tell him to take off all his clothes? For the sake of art, of course. (I'll bet no one missed being on the set the day Sam let it all hang out!)
