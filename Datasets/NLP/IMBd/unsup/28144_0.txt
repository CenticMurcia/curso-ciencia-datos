Based on a true story, this is one sick and very very disturbing movie. A foster Mother has a couple of young Sisters join her foster family, and the boy next door becomes friendly with the oldest girl. The foster Mother is an unbelievable bitch, and for no reason gives the younger impaired with leg braces Sister a spanking with a long brush for nothing. But it's the older Sister that gets taken to the basement and strung up by her wrists as other kids begin to torment her, stripping her, torturing her, even raping her later, while the foster Mother encourages them on. And believe me, the worst was still to come for this girl. The boy next door tries his best to help her, but there's not much he can do, except never forget it for the rest of his life. I was glued to this movie, as was everybody else watching it, and when it was over, it was like wow, that was one disturbing movie. You'll probably hear about "Girl Next Door", especially being a true story, and I would suggest you check it out. The last fifteen minutes are pretty hard to watch. I saw the movie at a special preview at the Indianapolis Horror Hound Weekend convention.
