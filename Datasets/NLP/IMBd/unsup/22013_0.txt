From the start the movie has that feeling that "Reality Bites" or "Empire Recods" once had: friends doing nothing but everything at the same time, discovering who they are and what they want. I won't spoil you, 'cause that's not my intention anyway, I only want to express why this movie is SO good! <br /><br />The cast is amazing, every single one of them. I'm a Jensen Ackles follower, so I concentrated on his character (which was amazing in every sense, he can always pull it off, no matter what he's playing) but I was immediately in love with every single one of them. Miss Betsy, the writer, is an awesome writer, and she was able to create a bunch of AMAZING characters, Priestly being, of course, my favorite. He's the type of character that everyone loves, doesn't matter if you know Jensen or not; you simply love Priestly.<br /><br />There's something for everyone, and everyone will enjoy it!<br /><br />I recommend this movie, and I hope we get a DVD... PLEASE!!!
