Columbo's Most Dangerous Match is about chess. An unlikely subject or motive for murder in my opinion. The star is Manchurian Candidate's Lawrence Harvey who plays a deaf chess champion. He is terrified of losing and will do anything to maintain his status as world chess champion. His competitor is a Russian chess champion who unlike Lawrence Harvey's character is well-regarded and loved instead. He lures him into an unusual trap to prevent him from defeating. Columbo always knows how to work a prime suspect and does it by being fascinated in their work particularly chess. One of Columbo's trademarks is that he gets interested in the character's passion and in this one, it's chess. He finds it a hell of game with a lot to lose on each side. You have to know that it's kind of hard watching Columbo catch this one. You almost feel sorry for him and in that, Lawrence Harvey gives a memorable performance since his role in the Manchurian Candidate.
