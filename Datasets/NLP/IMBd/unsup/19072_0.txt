" Empire of the Wolves" is a smart and hip thriller with some supernatural elements. Two, at first glance, unconnected stories slowly, but surely merge and form the whole puzzle. What stands out in this movie is the rainy, drizzly cinematography.Gray, stifled light, lends an oppressive aura to the already deeply affected viewer. Paris in this story is not a city of love and romance. This Paris is a city of filth and rats, of human slavery and relentless violence. Maybe, not a great advertisement for expected tourists, but a welcome twist for movie lovers. All in all interesting and fresh movie, with spark of originality.
