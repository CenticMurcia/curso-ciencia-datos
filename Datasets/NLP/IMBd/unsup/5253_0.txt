I can see why movie critics destroy this game, opps, i mean movie! It isn't done the way a Ridley Scott would insist! But, it is cool to see the names, and faces of our heroes and enemies! We liked the game, played it alot back in the day and were built up for years with the idea of a movie someday. The game is self has been history for years, so I think it came out late to capitalize on the game players addiction.<br /><br />The movie is done on budget, and with budget actors, with the excepton of Jurgen. I am not sure why the famous "U-Boat" commander did this movie, perhaps he was a game player to. The famous German actor hardly needed to do this movie, but did anyway. He does do a nice job of commanding the loading, and firing of TORPEDOS, as no one else could do it! In fact, his line there was identical to DAS BOAT. The guy is awesome! To bad he could not persuade more famed actors to bring notoriety to the movie. As it is, the actors chosen, play the computer game roles well, and are what I expected, especially MANIAC! Long Live the TIGER CLAW!
