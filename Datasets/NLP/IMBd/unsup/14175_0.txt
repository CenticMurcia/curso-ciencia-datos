Pretty faithful remake (written by original NOTLD co-creator George A. Romero) of the zombie classic in which seven people are trapped inside a farmhouse while a plague of the flesh-eating undead beings roam rural Pennsylvania.<br /><br />In updating this story, some changes are inevitably made: it's now in color, and the violence is more graphic and explicit. However, I actually enjoyed this a lot more than I would have expected to, given that remakes usually don't cut the mustard - especially when the original was just fine to begin with. Makeup effects veteran Tom Savini, making his directorial debut, does a respectable job. The movie moves at a decent pace and it's effectively gut-wrenching. The best change is that the heroine, played by stuntwoman/actress Patricia Tallman, becomes much tougher this time around. And genre superstar Tony Todd, who soon after was cast as "Candyman", is super in the lead. Actually, this cast has no slackers. Harry Cooper may be as much of a worthless jerk as he was in the original, but actor Tom Towles is completely successful at making him a one-dimensional character instantly deserving of our ire.<br /><br />And because of an obviously bigger budget for improved makeup effects, the zombies look even better.<br /><br />10/10
