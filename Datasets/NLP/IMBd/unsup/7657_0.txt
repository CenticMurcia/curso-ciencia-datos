Years ago, Vestron released this on U.S. home video as INVASION OF THE FLESH HUNTERS, in case you've wondered why there's too many alternate names listed for it. This one deserves a fatality because it is extremely out of focus! Watching people nibble on human flesh does look nasty at times, despite the poorly translated U.S. release having had the excess gore cut. The big problem is that it fails to recognize itself as a bone-chilling horror show. A lengthy police stand-off scene and some action-based elements have nothing to do with its supposed frightful imagery. Adding to the frustration is that these "cannibals" are compared exactly to vampires! Very bad scripting and directing jobs succumb this "nightmare of terror". Unless you've seen this film elsewhere in the world that had extra gory material in it, you might have liked it. I looked forward to seeing and enjoying this one, and I guess that's too bad!
