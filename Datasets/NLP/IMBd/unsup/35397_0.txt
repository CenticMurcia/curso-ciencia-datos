I watched this after seeing Lindsey Lohan in the better than average "Freaky Friday" and the brilliant "Mean Girls". my expectations were fairly high as i see Lindsey Lohan as the next big thing. But i was disappointed at this film OK, so it's a Disney film, so i couldn't expect a Mean Girls style of humour, or a Solid easy storyline, like that of Freaky Friday. but i at least expected a little more passion in the movie. The storyline was drab and very slim. there wasn't much to go apart from the Lola (Lindsey Lohan) characters dream of being a starlet. The plot was so weak, that absolutely anything could of happen, which isn't really a good thing. The acting, especially from Lindsey, was very amateurish. Linsey's character was so OTT that it looked as though she had ignored the director and decided to improvise her role. Alison Pill's role (Ella) was boring and lifeless, and i could see that she was upstaged by an over excited Lindsey. the sub characters were poorly written, especially the love interest Sam (Eli Marienthal), who is brilliant in "Tucker" and "American Pie", who is wasted and underused and also completely pointless to help push the story forwards. the only saving grace in characters was Adam Garcia as the drunken Rocker Stu. is utterly superb playing a drunken White stripes meets Keith Richards character. he lifts the film at one point. But He can't save this Turkey of a film. I would recommend this film to Lindsey Lohan fan's who like her music more than her acting and 10 year old girls.
