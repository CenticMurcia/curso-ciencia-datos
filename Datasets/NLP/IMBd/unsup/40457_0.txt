Wow, I can recall this movie when it came out, but never did get a chance to see it. Now I have and it is nothing to write home about. It's not a bad movie, just kinda bland and some moments very incongruous. To me, it looks like a TV movie of the week. The cinematography is adequate, the script inconsequential. The best part of it is the full roster of character actors (including the fabulous Kenneth Mars, Ted Cassidy from "The Addams Family" as well as two, count 'em two former Bond villain henchmen.) chowing down on the scenery like it was their last meal. The leads are cute and all, but as actors they only vaguely adequate at playing themselves. It's a testament to their bubbly personalities that they shine, despite the weaker than weak script. How weak is it? In one scene, when Donny is pointing out to Marie someone who might have been one of the criminals chasing them in an earlier scene, she says she can't see them because she's not wearing her glasses? HUH?? She can't need glasses too much, because she wasn't wearing them for the whole movie. Heck, she manages to ride her motorcycle while being chased by baddies without wearing glasses. Also, not sure why they had her on a motorcycle, that was a little odd. Mostly, this is an excuse to have them singing and dancing on stage. Perfectly fine, no harm, no foul.<br /><br />I have no ax to grind, I was a huge fan of them back in the day, but this film has not aged at all well. I'd say it's family fare, but I doubt any children are really going to care about this movie. I'd say this is only for nostalgic adults, and even then I can't really recommend it. I don't regret having seen it, but I don't have any desire to see it again.
