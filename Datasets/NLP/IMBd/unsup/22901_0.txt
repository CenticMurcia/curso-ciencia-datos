What a great movie! I've delivered pizzas on and off for about 5 years and can easily relate to many things in this movie. From the nice lady who wants her pizza delivered to her window to the ass who thinks a dollar tip is gods gift to PizzaDude. No Hollywood lights, no glam or special effects, just the honest display of the b.s. drivers must go through to earn a couple bucks. The characters make this movie, especially with Mang being in his own little world, and Little Debbie's honesty. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has delivered pizzas. Pizza delivery is a bittersweet job and takes an overwhelming amount of patients and humor. I will be watching this one over and over again.
