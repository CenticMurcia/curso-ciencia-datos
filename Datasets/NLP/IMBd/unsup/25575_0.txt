As far as Norm McDonald vehicles go, Screwed is better than Dirty Work. Depending on your tastes, that might not be saying much. However, I'm proud to announce that Screwed can stand on its own legs, away from the shadow of Mr. McDonald, as a genuinely funny movie.<br /><br />Having read the reviews for Screwed, I was amazed; nearly every critic was thoroughly reaming this film. They blasted the plot; in response, I ask you, readers, who watches a Norm McDonald movie for its plot? They blasted the acting; in response, I ask you...well, you get the picture.<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is, this movie is hilarious. McDonald, Chapelle, Devito, Sherman Hemsley, et. al. are there to make you laugh, not to court the Academy for their respective Oscars, and they succeed marvellously. Screwed's pace is just perfect; the laughs are fast and frequent, although you are given a slight breather just before the next joke hits. Some of the jokes don't work, as in any comedy, but more often than not, they hit the mark flawlessly. Yes, gore, innuendo, vulgarity, all of it appealed to the 18 year old author of this review and got him laughing.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie rules, and I'm ashamed that the critics millions of Americans put their trust in have condemned Screwed. Apparently they were just to highbrow for it, and forgot how much fun a good, vulgar comedy can be if one leaves his inhibitions at the door and stops trying to be the art-aristocrat he *thinks* he is.
