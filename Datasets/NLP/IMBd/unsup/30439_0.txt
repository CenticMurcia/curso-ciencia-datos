Jimmy Durante is having a lot of fun playing a vaudevillian. His character happens to play piano and sing. As wild as he is when performing in this movie, he was much wilder on stage when he did his shows with Clayton and Jackson and later with Sonny Knight.<br /><br />In this film, Jimmy's character never meets the title character, but The Schnozz still shares some scenes with Rupert. The story is nice and should please all family members.<br /><br />The most fun in this movie is the opportunity to look back at the US in 1950 where we see the cars and fire engines and even a soda fountain which were all very ordinary for that time period, but which now would be found in museums. $32 a month for an apartment. Seems steep.<br /><br />Money can either change people, or make them more like what they already were. We see the effect sudden income from above has on two families here. We also have some fine music from a tuba, a harp and a concertina. And Jimmy at the piano.<br /><br />All the characters are likable, including an IRS agent and an FBI agent and police investigators. Nice for Christmas viewing.<br /><br />Tom Willett
