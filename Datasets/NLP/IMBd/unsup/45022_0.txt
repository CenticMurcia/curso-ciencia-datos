Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. Those are just a few of the words that describe TEENAGE ZOMBIES. One of the worst bad movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. However, as others have pointed out, the fistfight near the end is worth suffering through the rest of the film for. I have rarely laughed so hard. Too bad there are no decent prints of this film (the DVD transfer is awful), because the bots and Joel would have done it proud.<br /><br />Did I mention this was BAD?
