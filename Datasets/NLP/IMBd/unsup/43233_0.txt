Marabunta is definitely a "bad accident" type movie. You see a scene and you think to yourself, "this is terrible!", "What the heck were they (the writers, director, producers, actors, etc.) thinking?", "It must have been a continuity flaw." , "It can only get better."<br /><br />But as you continue to watch, it get progressively worse. The continuity flaws have their own continuity flaws, the movie spins around and around the drain, constantly circling but never quite going down, no matter how much you wish you could end it's miserable existence.........<br /><br />I think the "Horror" categorization was also stretching it quite a bit. I was totally cracking up even without the mimosa breakfast.<br /><br />In one scene, Dr. Jim Conrad & Laura Sills try to flee from the hungry ants by climbing into a rickety old canoe and paddling down a stream.<br /><br />The stream becomes a series of rapids and small waterfalls that first damage the canoe, then the bow breaks off while Dr. Jim and Laura, respectively, continue to paddle and scream. Finally, the canoe disintegrates and we begin to thank the movie for ending that scene, but no! Dr. Jim & Laura now tumble down the waterfalls and jagged rocks for an other mile or two. We think to ourselves, "well, no one could possibly survive the certain concussions our heroes must have." All their limbs are sure to be broken now especially when the movie is showing this in slow motion! But No! Dr. Jim and Laura finally roll onto the shore, stand up without a broken bone or bruise, make-up still absolutely perfect. They straighten out their completely clean and untorn clothes, c0ck their hats (that somehow managed to stay on during this whole scene) in a fashionable way, and run towards some other c0ck-eyed scheme to thwart the ants. I must give the movie makers a little credit for "misting" Dr. Jim and Laura after they allegedly got out of the water. I seem to remember Laura even acting like she was squeezing the 'water' out of her hair. Both their faces were mighty dry-looking though, so they didn't completely disturb the movie's track record for anti-continuity. Incontinuity? I think that is the proper word as far as this movie is concerned.<br /><br />The scooter chase that follows is priceless!<br /><br />
