I'm 15. I was only a year old when The Wraith was released into theaters. As I grew older, I would always try to catch it when it was on T.V. but a lot of the time, I couldn't. Now after finally buying I could finally watch the film in its entirety.<br /><br />One night, a kid named Jamie was caught making love to a girl. All of a sudden, a gang of punks, led by the fearsome Packard(Nick Cassavetes), bust in and they beat up and finally killing Jamie. <br /><br />Now a year after his death, a kid named Jake(Charlie Sheen in a pre-stardom role) mysteriously rolls into town on a bike. He immediately starts a friendship with a kid named Billy, who works at the local burger joint. When Jake begins hitting on Keri(Sherilyn Fenn), who also happens to be Packard's girlfriend. Soon after, a mysterious car, the incredibly rare Turbo Interceptor, rolls up and challenges one the gang members to a race. As the race draws to a close, the gang member crashes and has a fiery death. One by one each of the gang members meet with lots of gruesome deaths. I won't go any further than that.<br /><br />This movie is totally underrated. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten much attention over the last 16 years. You'd think it would, even with Charlie Sheen in it.<br /><br />I especially like some of the performances, mainly the two gang members Skank and Gutterboy. You can easily tell they are the comic relief in this movie. Seeing Skank get high off of anti-freeze is absolutely hilarious. <br /><br />Now to get to what I think is the prize of this film: The Turbo Interceptor. From what I read somewhere, only six were ever made, hence making it probably one of the rarest cars ever brought into existence.<br /><br />10/10
