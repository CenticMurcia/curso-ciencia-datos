On the whole not a bad film. I may have been influenced by the fact that I didn't have to pay to see it but I would say that this film is a reasonable attempt at a remake and will prove fairly entertaining to most people, whether or not they have seen the original. On the whole, certainly not the worst remake ever. 7/10
