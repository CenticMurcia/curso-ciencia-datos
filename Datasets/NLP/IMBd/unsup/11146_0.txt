I think "Life Size" is a great movie. It's too bad that it is just a TV Movie and will not have copies of it sold in stores. I never would have known that Tyra Banks was such a great actress. She was excellent for the part of Eve. It's a great family movie and I hope that they decide to release a video of it in stores.
