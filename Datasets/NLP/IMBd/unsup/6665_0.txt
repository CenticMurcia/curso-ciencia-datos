OOOOOhhh my God. This is the Worst film i've ever seen in my life. who told this guy he could direct???? art movies are one thing, but this piece of crap, does not qualify, the actors really cant act, except for Ana. If you think you've seen everything, you haven't, there is the ugliest woman in the world naked and having sex in this movie. she weighs like 300 pounds and is like a midget. now, why on earth will Mexico support a movie like this??? they say the director is a genius. this is exactly like the story of the stupid king, that was tricked in to paying to have made an invisible suit that only smart guys could see. really, whoever tells me that this guy has talent as a director or that this movie is a master piece is a real idiot. It is incredible that at this day in age, someone still supports this kind of crap. please, Do not see this movie, the images of its bad directing will haunt you forever.
