I just watched "My Cousin Vinny" again on HBO. I can not count how many times I have seen it. I know the exact line that is coming and I chuckle every time. The reason I find it so watchable is the sensational performances by all cast members (OK maybe not Machio!). My most vivid memory of the movie was that after seeing the theatrical release and thinking it was hysterical, I rented it while on vacation with my folks. To be honest, I didn't remember the language being so... ah... harsh, and I sat there in shock thinking they would be mortified. Well, after 15 minutes my Mom was howling with every morning wake up, every confrontation with the judge, and we almost lost her when Austin Pendelton started his "stuttering" defense! She loved Marisa Tomei (who didn't?)! I will never forget that night.<br /><br />The movie itself is the classic "fish out of water" tale. Joe Pesci, who I always found annoying in his Mafia roles, is perfect as the New Yorker who will "learn as he goes along". And Marisa Tomei, his long suffering girlfriend, creates a character so coarse, blunt, likable and drop dead gorgeous, I haven't seen her equal since. I am always amazed that people question her Acadamy Award credentials. The fact that comic turns are not often rewarded doesn't mean it wasn't a sensational characterization. And this was also a career capping role for Fred Gwynne. He captures the respectful Southern Gentlemen Judge, struggling to suppress his slow burn, perfectly. <br /><br />So tune in if you haven't seen it, enjoy it again if you have. This is great entertainment, but remember, its rated R for language!!
