This movie aside from being completely horribly made. Lacked any real plot,one minute there supposed to be making a video. The next they're playing f***ing Scooby Doo. It lacks all meaning and the horrible scene where the characters do heroine is... Well there are no words to describe the apparent acted reaction of the actors. Not only that, but there is a scene in the movie where the characters attempt to nail a door shut, that opens in the other direction... The audio and visual of this trash fest was both poor and horrible. One of the characters spent the whole movie chewing on someone else's tooth. I wouldn't even suggest watching 13 seconds of it. The poorly edited pictures that were supposed to give hints as to what would happen next, where done in two different mediums and did not make any sense.
