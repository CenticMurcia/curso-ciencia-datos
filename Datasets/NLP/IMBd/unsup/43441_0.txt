i don't mind the movies not being the real world, i don't mind magical, unlikely or challenging, even illogical but half-baked, over-flagged nonsense is simply disappointing. There seems to have been a good idea for a film here as others wrote but its impossible not see what's coming. In fact I thought well perhaps there'll be some twist I'm not expecting.... no, not really. Oh well, I do like Cuba though. I just wish he didn't have to look so uncomfortable.
