This movie is tiresome, not funny, and with Brando playing an Asian including fake eye makeup and a buck-toothed accent offensively racist. Ouch, what a waste of a rental. Stay away from this turkey. It seems to have been made on a shoestring, at one point during the introductory scene the boom mike dips into the picture as it follows a young Harry Morgan down to the floor. In another scene, a posturing wrestler chosen as a town leader inadvertently almost stumbles off the podium - they never stopped the camera, just kept filming as Glenn Ford seems to badly ad lib his lines. Save your money and your time.
