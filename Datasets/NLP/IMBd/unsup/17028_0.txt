This movie is one the greatest comedy I've ever seen... The actors are so good, I can't compare it with any other movie. The singing performance by Benoit Poelvoorde is perfectly incredible too ! Nevertheless,I guess american audience would not understand this movie, as it deals with a french music symbol, Claude Fran√ßois...<br /><br />That's why I let myself dream of an american transcription of "Podium"... imagine Adam Sandler or Bill Murray play some unlikely Elvis double... If some producer could read it :)<br /><br />Congratulations, Yann Moix !!
