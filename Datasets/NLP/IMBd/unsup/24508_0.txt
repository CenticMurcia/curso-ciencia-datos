I watched this movie, do you know what you did? ;o) Of course the summary line is also a link, that this movie is obviously linked to American teen horror movies of the recent past and tried to copy them as good as it could.<br /><br />So if you like this kind of movies, you might be more excited than I was. I mean I liked "I know what you did last summer", but it had also a lot to do with Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and the others. They weren't excellent, but good enough. And although the actors hold their own here (for a horror movie that is), something is missing. It never really get's really scary, that might be it ... Not the worst movie ever then (not close to that), but still not something you have to watch (unless you're a fan, as I said earlier)
