I was only two when the original miniseries came out, but ever since I was in about grade 5 or 6, and first saw it, I've absolutely loved it and even created a webpage dedicated to The Thorn Birds.<br /><br />On a down note, I was highly disappointed in The Missing Years. I think they should have just left it with only the miniseries. Those who were in it, for the most part did not suit their role. Luckily they were able to get Richard Chamberlain in it. The storyline just didn't do anything for the original. There were many things in which you know would never have happened.<br /><br />Although I did like the part when Ralph fought with Luke. And the ending was sweet. But many parts just seemed too far fetched. It was a nice try to make this, but they should have just left it. Especially altering the actual characteristics of the original characters such as Fee... And Vittorio.... That's just wrong o_o<br /><br />Anyway, as I said before, I found it quite disappointing and many other fans seem to agree with me upon it. I have watched it and I do have a copy, mainly because I already have the miniseries. But it can sometimes be amusing to watch it just to see how very different it is from the original and to see the fight scene.. Even if I've only seen it two to three times since 1996...<br /><br />Some people like it, some don't, just hope the original comes out on DVD.
