Good to see something other than the usual SF fare about the Vietnam way. This is the first movie i have seen that references the job the dogs and dog handlers did in Vietnam. But the movie is let down by a lot of factors, namely the helicopters, weapons, and tactics. Modern weapons were used instead of the correct weapons, the helicopters were the wrong type, and some of the acting was atrocious. the best part of the movie is the dogs themselves. It was rare for the dogs to be returned to the states, as risk of disease was too high. most dogs remained in country, either with other forces, or were euthanised. Out of approximately 5,000 dogs, only around 200 returned to the states.
