The opening sequence alone is worth buying a "Dolphins" DVD. This movie is one extended moment of intense beauty, more like a modern dance performance than a theatrical production.<br /><br />There is no dialog, so don't worry about having to deal with sub-titles inherent foreign films. The movie unveils itself in such a way as to reach any person in any modern culture.<br /><br />The story is small and the plot simplistic, but you won't care. I promise.
