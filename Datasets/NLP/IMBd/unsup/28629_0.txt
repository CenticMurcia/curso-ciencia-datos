i saw a preview of blast today and i was not impressed. the story has been done several times before and a lot better. the acting was bad with the exception of Meyer & griffin who were cool but everyone else sucked especially Vinnie Jones who just can't act. griffin plays a former fireman who quit when his best friend died in a fire and is now a tugboat captain and is now raising the son of his friend. griffin the boy and his crew board the oil rig shortly before it is hijacked. Vinnie Jones leads the terrorist group and plans on launching an electro magnetic pulse bomb over California with plans on hacking into several banks and stealing billions of dollars and destroying the records of the transfers with the emp. Meyer is a member of the terrorist team who in fact turns out to be a federal agent who ends up helping griffin. a little comedy here and there, action sequences were okay but overall a disappointment.<br /><br />3 out of 10
