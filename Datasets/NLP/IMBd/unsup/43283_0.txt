For anyone who comes here to read comments about this horrible celluloid abortion, please skip over the post titled "My Musings on The Pet".<br /><br />I actually made the mistake of reading this pretentious tripe, and there's only one conclusion that can be drawn from this person's post: he's one of those imbeciles that spend all their free time role playing as a "Gorean". None of that lifestyle "information" he spewed can be taken seriously by anyone who seriously practices said lifestyle. He needs to just shut up and go back to drinking from his sip-pee cup, and not interrupt the adults. Go back to Gor and never enter the daylight with the rest of the normal people!! <br /><br />***Caution! The following contains spoilers, read at your own risk! (Scroll down if you wish to read the rest of the review, spoiler free)***<br /><br />This movie is absolutely horrible. It does not show the lifestyle in a positive light, and pretty much makes a mockery of the human slave trade. The main male character is a poor excuse for a human being whose only reason for taking a slave is because his dog died. Really? Really? And you know, it's pretty sad that the dog lived longer than the girl. The main female character is an idiot. She does all this stuff that doesn't even begin to make sense. Sitting on the floor at a restaurant? Yeah, like that happens all the time by people in the lifestyle. And through this entire movie, these people were getting into situations that they could have easily called the police on.<br /><br />And then there's the scenes in which there's some sort of slaver's convention/party/bat cave, complete with the web servers that have the website for slave flesh speculation. In Utah of all places! This "master" doesn't want to sell his pet, so he brings along her ownership tag. To a get together in which they're what? SELLING SLAVES!! Then, he "accidentally" drops it, and somehow, the "pet" is too stupid to not go "um, hello? you just dropped this tag" And it only gets worse.<br /><br />The best part, though, HAD to be the redneck who was doing the Slingblade impression. If he had busted out with something like, "He sure does like his pets branded, mm hum", I would not have been the least bit surprised.<br /><br />***END OF SPOILERS*** <br /><br />If you are into the lifestyle and looking for a good lifestyle movie, or one that presents it in a positive light, this movie is not for you. If you are looking for a good movie that touches on the tragedy of the slave trade, this movie is not for you. If you are someone who enjoys movies, this movie is not for you. If, however, you are someone who spends their free time pretending to be a master or Gorean, and have somehow gotten the idea that you have any reason to speak, then this movie is perfect for you.<br /><br />About the only thing this movie would be good for is for those people who are in a coma. Play this movie, and they're sure to come out of the coma, even if it's just to beat you for making them suffer through this horrible excuse for wasting people's time.
