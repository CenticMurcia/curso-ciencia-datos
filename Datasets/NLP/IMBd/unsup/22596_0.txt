Lovely. Round. A great example of what independent film making is all about. Great humanely story, with great performances, excellent production -with almost no economic resources-, lively photography; what Robert Humphrey did with the photo is amazing and ErikÂ´s direction is so sensuous you perceive the characters and their lives vividly. I enjoyed it a lot. Congratulations to everyone that took part on it.
