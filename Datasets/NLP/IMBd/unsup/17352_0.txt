This movie made me feel real sorry for one of the old ladies that is trying to get a date. Even years from seeing the movie at the theater, I think about that lonely old heart. What I didn't care for was the ending of the movie. I had this big ole buildup with Ellen Barkin and that was the end? Please! Give me an ending that is just as suspenseful as the rest of the show was. I just felt like the director took an easy way out after entertaining me the entire film. The acting is fantastic, the script is wonderful, casting unbelievable, the ending just kind of sucked. And guess what, I have a stack of 45s and I'm still waiting for them to become valuable.
