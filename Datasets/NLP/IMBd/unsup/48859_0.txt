when i see a movie review with such polarized opinion, i want to give it a chance. i bought this as a previously viewed DVD from a national video rental chain and only paid $5. not worth the $5. all the bad has been said already.<br /><br />the acting is about on the par of a softcore film on cinemax. bleh. the only thing i liked about it (maybe didn't dislike is more appropriate) is that the actresses in this movie are pleasing to look at.<br /><br />i didn't think i would be getting a great movie here and biy was i right. the worst movie i have seen a quite sometime.<br /><br />this one's going in the garage sale pile.
