Cronyn and Gardenia give sparkling and Emmy-winning performances. This movie presents a personal perspective of the aging process. Faced with contrasting experiences of "getting old" - Cronyn with a keen mind and frail body vs. Gardenia with the onset of senility and a healthy body - the two friends are friendly adversaries of the aging process. They provide mutual support to each other and their families as they "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night." The portrayal of the nursing home experience is fairly accurate. I highly recommend that families view it together before they are forced to make difficult decisions about the welfare of their aging relatives.
