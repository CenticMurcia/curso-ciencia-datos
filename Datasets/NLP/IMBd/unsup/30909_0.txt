Ghosthouse...a movie with horror and mystery in damn doom depth without deterioration! I don't exactly know why, but since I watched this movie first in 1988, I've seen it about thirty times. Why am I addicted to this movie like no other move? In 1988 I was only eleven and got afraid that Henrietta would turn in front of my bedroom window or beneath my bed. No other movie had the same terrifying impact on me. Then I felt sorry that it scared me, but nowadays it feels just thrilling in a nostalgic way. I used to be afraid of deserted empty houses in forests and even for the empty attic in my former home. Ghosthouse gave an extra dimension to this fear. The sounds that are used for Ghosthouse perfectly rhyme to the building-up of the suspense, even from the beginning on. Objectively considered, the story is not quite original as most persons die in a similar way as could be expected. The plot is similar to some other horror movies as well. However, the way Mark and Martha little by little discover the origin of the doom in the house is very suspending: Valkos was very violent and mysterious so that could logically be declared that he caused most of the horror. However, with some hazy hints, Mark and Martha slowly found a trace to the burial and the black man on the burial told them the immaculate truth in the end! Most of all, the radio signals built up the suspense by the first very vague but thrilling impact they had on Mark and Martha. Even when they found the transmitter of Jim, they couldn't understand how the signals were conceived. Finally, I think Lara Wendel played her role very well: the fear she felt while being haunted perfectly was reflected in her eyes in many ways. An excellent non-eradicating epic of horror!!
