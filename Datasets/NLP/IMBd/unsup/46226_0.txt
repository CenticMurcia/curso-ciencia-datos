I saw "The Old Man and the Sea" for the first time last night and I cannot say I really admired it. In 2009 we are perhaps more sensitive to the suffering of our fellow inhabitants of the planet and although I suppose the film is a masterpiece, I cannot enjoy seeing an animal given a slow and tortured death anymore than I can bear Hemingway's favourite sport, bullfighting. I realize it was shot with a false looking fish but it is not a good example for the young. There are so many wonderful sports for them to learn about. Teaching children to kill any creature that is doing no harm is, to me, immoral. I realize I am going against the grain somewhat, but I hope opinions are changing about what is acceptable on film. I know animals are better looked after nowadays when in a film and there are stricter rules to protect them. So much the better !
