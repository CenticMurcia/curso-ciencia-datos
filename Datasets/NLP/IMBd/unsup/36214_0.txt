This is not a good movie. You never find out what exactly Michael Clayton does or why he is needed to do that thing that he does. The story has a bad plot and fails terribly in continuity. Just who are the bad guys anyway? There are better movies out there to watch rather than waste your time and money on this one. Example of bad thought out ideas --- Bad guys use a GPS, that does not work correctly and has nothing to do with a car bomb that is triggered with a cell phone --- DUH!!!!! And what will Michael do after this movie??? This actually looks and feels like a TV pilot that was rejected, but they had too much money in it to let it go on the floor. Do not feel too bad if you walk out of the theater after this movie and ask "What was that all about?" The movie keeps you waiting for something to happen and then disappoints when it does. If there is a book, maybe reading it first may give you some idea of what is happening in the movie.
