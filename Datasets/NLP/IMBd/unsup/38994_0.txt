What if the Confederacy won the Civil War? Sounds like a interesting premise for a sharp satirical mockumentary about an alternate American history, right? Unfortunately, as promising as the concept looks on paper, in reality "CSA: The Confederate States of America" is massively disappointing and unfulfilling. I can't even call it a valiant effort hampered by some weaknesses, because that would be too generous.<br /><br />In fact, throughout the entire movie, there was not one scene that elicited any kind of positive reaction from me. The movie could not even produce a single laugh or smile. Even the worst of the worst comedies ("Date Movie", "Failure to Launch", "The Benchwarmers"), as horrible as they are, were able to make me chuckle at least ONCE. One laugh: is that too much to ask?<br /><br />Here I just sat there, feeling the movie literally suck the life out of me with its colossal non-entertainingness. When your mind wanders to ponder the intricacies of this year's income tax forms, you know the movie you are watching is bad, bad, bad.
