Special-effects and terrific 5.1 surround sound are the highlights of this science fiction film. And what highlights they are - tremendous in both categories, at least for 2000 when this film and DVD came out. At the time, they were the best special-effects I had ever seen, but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see. Audio-wise, the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie I've heard.<br /><br />As for story, once the beginning plugs for evolution and political correctness are over with, it is a simple good guys-trying-to-get-the-bad guys fare. It's pure escapist fun made so with tons of sci-fi effects. The characters aren't particularly involving, either the "good guys" or the "bad guys." The two leads, played by Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, should have been, but weren't. Jackman's "Logan/ Wolverine" always seemed to be pouting and angry, but I guess he's a favorite of females. <br /><br />For me and most males, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos was a treat for the eyes. Her outfit was something to behold.<br /><br />If profanity bothers you, the film was treat in that department, too, as there was very little. Obviously, this film was popular enough to spawn not only a sequel but more in the making.
