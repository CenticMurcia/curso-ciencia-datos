Usually it is the other way around with America remaking a foreign language films, so this is quite a refreshing film in that regard.

The piano is Tom's return to childhood naivety, dropping his responsibilities to emotionally free himself from his father's grip.<br /><br />Utilising hand held camera work, Audiard creates a chaotic sensibility. The camera is constantly on the move, seeking different angles. This chaos evokes an immediacy, not the urgency its seeking. Scenes are fast, many not lasting very long, for all the frenetic pacing, Audiard keeps it cohesive; along with one very commanding and captivating performance by Romain Duris. A wonderful mix dark brutality and beautiful music are skillfully balanced, with beauty found in the brutal and an emotional darkness in the music.<br /><br />The Beat My Heart Skipped is a captivating film that immediately draws you in.
