This isn't as good of a film as Boys Town, but then most sequels don't live up to the original. Mickey Rooney gives a refreshingly toned-down portrayal of an older, more mature Whitey Marsh, and of course Spencer Tracy fits right back into the role of Father Flanagan. A bit idealistic and old-fashioned, but perhaps that is exactly what draws me to films like these? Any fan of classic movies, Spencer Tracy, Mickey Rooney, or all of the above will have a nice time watching this movie.
