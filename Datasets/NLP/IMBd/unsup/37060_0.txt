Great - what a poorly done movie. I am a person who adores any kind of literature and loves good movies. The film being an adaptation of a fantasy trilogy that I haven't read, and the movie itself promising an interesting story that just advertises for the old paper medium, I just had to rent it on DVD to give it a shot. I should have rented the books, I assume.<br /><br />There was no tension present over the whole length of 102 minutes, since the story just drags on an on without ever catching the audience's interest. This is mainly due to its poorly executed characters and uninteresting actors. Biggest disappointment was Andy Serkis, who totally failed giving birth to the story's main villain. Adding to this major flaw, a terrible script that is even outdone by most TV series nowadays helps to oppress any magic that might wanted to be conjured to the screen. Even the CGI effects were badly done - and too rare to be even worth mentioning. Yet concerning the genre of this movie and the possibilities of its source material, some nicely done CGI effects were the least fans could have expected. And, most significantly, since it completely fails to conjure any magic to the screen, CGI might have helped to create at least a visual spectacle - like many other mediocre movies do.<br /><br />All in all it deserves 2 stars out of 10 for being totally uninteresting and boring, to a point even annoying. And all this though, sadly enough, I do love books and movies...
