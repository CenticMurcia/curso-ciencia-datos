I'll credit Milla Jovovich with an excellent performance within the framework of Luc Besson's interpretation of the tale of Joan of Arc. Besson borrows quite a little from other writers and directors in this film but his chief borrowing is from 20th and 21st Century psychiatry. In the end, he tells viewers through Joan's visible conscience (portrayed by Dustin Hoffman) that her "voices" were the product of hysteria and that the Messenger from God simply told her what she wanted to hear. To make this approach credible, Besson introduces the murder and subsequent rape of Joan's elder sister, which she witnesses when she is 10 years old through cracks in the door to the closest where she is hiding. "Hysteria" is a modern and plausible explanation for religious visions, but there is no historical evidence to serve as background -- and I found the modern day psycho-babble more than a little jarring, even though Dustin Hoffman does his best with the role. Fay Dunaway also performs very effectively but John Malkovich is John Malkovich, not the Dauphin. Despite acting that is generally good, I found this to be the least satisfying version of the Joan of Arc story that I have ever seen, and I've seen most of them at one time or another.
