I've never heard about this cartoon before because Nickelodeon shows it at hours I don't watch TV (i.e. too early). Yesterday I accidentally zapped into it and immediately liked it.<br /><br />Usually I'm more into cartoons meant for grown-ups (Rocko, Ren & Stimpy, Simpsons, Futurama, Cow & Chicken and so), but I also do like stuff like Spongebob. Yakkity Yak seems to have children as a target group, but the humor is quite "sophisticated" for that. Not only that the verbal jokes are funny, but also the drawings are silly enough to make my flat mate laugh who isn't into cartoons at all.<br /><br />I guess I'll be spending more time at noon in front of the TV the next weekends to watch this one.
