I read the negative comments made about this movie and I was moved to reply not only as a movie goer but as part Indian as well. This movie was done with grace, cleverness, and with such brilliance that anyone who did not feel that they wanted their lives to matter more didn't get the true message. The actors were full of whit and at their best. Anyone who watches anything from Bollywood knows that Shahrukh delivers best in any of Yash's films. Bravo to Yash Productions and boo to anyone who didn't appreciate it. I can only say that if you want to see a great movie with a colorful cast, great humor and something that will touch your heart, watch Kal Ho Naa Ho. This movie is why I watch movies.
