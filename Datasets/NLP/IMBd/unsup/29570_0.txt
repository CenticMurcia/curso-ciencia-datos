This was a disappointing film. I thought that with Andy Lau and Rosamund Kwan in the film that it would be decent, but I should have expected to be as crappy as it was since it had Wong Jing in it. The special effects were just not up to par with Hollywood films. In addition, the supporting American cast was awful, as was their dialogue. I also could not get over how bad the English of the Chinese cast sounded. Go watch another film.
