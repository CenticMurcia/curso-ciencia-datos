This was an excellent black comedy on the harshness of the American corporation and some of the villains that work for it. I appreciate any film where it is difficult to predict what will happen next, and "In The Company Of Men" was definitely one of those films. A great acting job by Aaron Eckhart as the man you love to hate. This one is not for the weak-hearted or sensitive types. 10/10
