Watching 'Coffee and Cigarettes' is analogous to sitting through 96 minutes of teeth pulling. 11 vignettes specifically designed to highlight the general public's inability to indulge in meaningful conversation (or basic communication for that matter), the dialogue is little more than moronic jabbering. If this is even a vague (comic? don't talk nonsense!) representation of what people do in coffee-houses then they should be banded as oxygen thieves. It was so bad that I was compelled to stay until the end to get my sadomasochistic fill - constantly asking myself: how bad can this thing get? It is unfortunate that the soliciting of refunds from multiplexes is so impractical; my only recourse was to walk into a screen showing 'Shaloin Soccer' without paying. This film is founded on little more than pretensions, the content is insipid and vacuous, the result is annoyance.
