I remember the AMAZING SPIDER-MAN from when I was a kid,it was one of the first memorys I have when we came to this country. Spidey taught me a lot for just being a fictional hero,I only wish I could get all the movies so, that I might share them with my son one day. Until then I have my memorys and the cartoon , for now that will have to do. thanks
