It's always instructive to watch films released no more than a year apart, tackling an identical subject, with many ideas in common, yet made in different countries and causally unrelated: take Australia's "Better Than Sex", and France's "A Pornographic Affair". It hurts to say it, but the French completely outclassed us. (AND they got in first.) But you don't have to see the French film to work out what's wrong with this one. English critic Cosmo Landsman put it best: "There's nothing here you couldn't learn by reading 'Cosmopolitan'."<br /><br />I have nothing against 'Cosmopolitan', but before starting work on a project like this you must decide if you wants to create a "How Compatible Are You?" quiz, or a work of art; its one or the other. They bathe the paper on which 'Cosmopolitan' magazines are printed in a kind of aesthetic disinfectant, and this film has gone through a similar process. The acting is good. It's the one feature of Australian films... And, I should admit, there's enough real humour to make it all wash down easily. But I got the uncomfortable feeling afterwards that I hadn't seen a movie at all. The taxi driver, who could have been a delightful fantasy element, was instead an embarrassingly naked cop-out, and that's what the device of interviewing the central protagonists turned out to be, too. Two films handled it much better: "When Harry Met Sally", and the French film. There was a point to the device in both cases. In "When Harry..." it's an outside-the-narrative device, placing the two central characters in the context of a larger world; in the French film, it's an INSIDE-the-narrative device, letting us know that the central characters have since reflected on the past. In "Better Than Sex" it's just a clumsy extravagance.
