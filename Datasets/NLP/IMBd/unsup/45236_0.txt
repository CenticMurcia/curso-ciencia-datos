I went to see this film because I have admired Kathy Bates' acting for years. I must say that I am confused as to why she would accept a role so beneath her abilities. Given that, she could have brought life into her character.<br /><br />As for Sarah Jessica Parker. Well, her ability to portray emotions ranges from clutching her chest to clutching her stomach. And when is this 40+ year old woman going to stop squealing like a stuck pig. Girls in middle school are able to express themselves better.<br /><br />The male actors were, well, unimpressive at best.<br /><br />The story line could've have been developed a lot more, with interesting banter and twists and turns. But it wasn't. Yet there were times when there were some good one-liners.<br /><br />For a inexpensive matin√©e, why not. For a full priced movie ticket...
