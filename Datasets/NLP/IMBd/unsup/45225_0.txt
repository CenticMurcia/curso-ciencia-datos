My friend saw this a few months before I did, and warned me that it wasn't very good. I decided to check it out for myself. She was right. It wasn't that funny.<br /><br />I found myself roaring at only two scenes throughout the whole film. And the only parts that I did laugh along with, were only in the scenes with Zooey Deschanel. She was the real gem of the film, and quite frankly the only person in the film, who really played her part well. Although, I will say that I was impressed and quite pleased with Bradley Cooper's performance as well.<br /><br />Sarah Jessica Parker is too old to be playing these roles. Maybe her character was the same age as she is in real life...she just came across on screen as not the right age. Matthew McConaughey, although usually a very good actor, I found at least his role, to be very numb, and not of much use. It was a very bland character, and although he certainly is a lot of eye candy, the role may have been better suited to a different actor.<br /><br />The parts that were funny, were hysterical. But, be forewarned, there are some very, very stupid scenes, almost all including animals. It was very apparent that these scenes were meant to be funny...but they just weren't at all. They ended up being stupid and really of no use to the audience.<br /><br />I have seen better films. The idea behind it was very funny, and it was a well directed film, however most of it, left me shaking my head, "no".<br /><br />But, if you like light romantic comedies that are dumb, and really of no particular point...give it a try. It's mindless and quite light.
