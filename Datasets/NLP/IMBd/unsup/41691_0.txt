This movie had such great potential - handsome leads and storyline that could have been engaging. The two actors playing the leads deserved a script that was considerably less wooden. Lingering (as in "when will something happen") shots with no point permeated this movie. Tours of the Dallas freeway system at dawn seemed to be the director's way of getting this film to something that would qualify for feature-length status. It even has a home movie within this home movie that is a musical rendering of worst kind. This is a movie that doesn't deserve community support - even in its DVD form. If you watched this film on You Tube, there would be long stretches when you think your computer has locked up because nothing is happening until you realized that the crawl bar is actually moving.
