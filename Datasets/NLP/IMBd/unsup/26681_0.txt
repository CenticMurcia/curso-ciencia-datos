The screenplay of this animated movie had been based on the classic novel by István Fekete, of the same title (freely, but not aggressively). The story starts with a tragedy in the fox-family, which leaves Vuk the little fox as an orphan, all alone in the woods (I wouldn't call this a spoiler... Right after the film boosts off, hell breaks loose). Despite the fact you haven't get to know his family too much, this scene surely gonna bring tears to your eyes... for the first time in this movie. For its a story about LIFE itself, with all its tragedies and joys. We follow Vuk from this moment till the time himself becomes a father too. Through this period, we watch him as he explores the world around him, learns to hunt, to move like a shadow, meets new friends and foes, falls in love, and eventually: grows up. We see as the many events in of the story changes the motivation in the way he lives his life, and we get the chance to watch this character advancing WITHOUT being forced to struggle trough several morals of the fable, and several annoying cliché's you might get used to in cartoons. Simply: wonderful!:)
