And the first of its kind too. The first movie made of Arthur Conan Doyle's "Lost World" story, and the first motion picture ever to use stop motion animation. Over all this is a wonderful flick. The sets and staging are all well done, costumes and makeup are far better than average, the photography is very well done, and the acting is for the most part first rate. I thought Lewis Stone particularly impressive as Sir John Roxton. Stone had a way of coming across as natural, which thing seems a refreshing oddity in older movies like this when "over the top" was thought to be a requirement. Wallace Beery's Prof. Challenger is also extremely well done. Bessie Love isn't my idea, being familiar with the tale, of the Paula White character. Other than that everyone else seems to fit their roles right well. But it was the stop motion, the sets, and the makeup that awed me. The ape men LOOKED like ape men, and not some guy in a gorilla suit. These were all of such better quality than, say, the majority of movies of a similar ilk from the 40s, 50's, 60's and even into the 70's. Lots of talent in these areas, making the film just that much more worth watching. And then there is that added advantage of it being a silent. The question of sound quality is, well, mute.
