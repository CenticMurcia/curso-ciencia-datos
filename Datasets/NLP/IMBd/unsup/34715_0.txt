First 10 minutes is the most grim, stupid, predictable, screaming female, dark, predictable, bad acting....god it goes on. The taxi accident was the worst crash effects I have ever seen. Rachel rolls over the taxi like a sack of wool (in slow motion) mixed with potatoes....<br /><br />The script is jarred and seems to go from one point to the other - there's no cohesion.<br /><br />This is I'm afraid as bad as it gets. I didn't watch the full film, so I might be wrong and all actors and director might have improved after the halfway point...yes, I could not take any more the 35 minutes. I like movies, but not this one.<br /><br />This is 1 point above Ed Wood directing.
