The eyebrow-wagging Lionel Q. Deveraux (Groucho Marx) is tired of dragging down the career of his fianc√©e, Carmen Novarro (Carmen Miranda), as the untalented half of their nightclub act and quits to become her agent. His powers of persuasion soon get the Brazilian singer a job as a featured performer at the Copacabana - twice over. She is forced to do double duty as herself and as Mlle. Fifi, a veil-covered Parisian chanteuse. The owner of the Copacabana, Steve Hunt (Steve Cochran), insists on romancing Mlle. Fifi, much to the frustration of Deveraux, who has already staked his claim to Carmen. Also frustrated is Anne Stuart (Gloria Jean), Steve's dutiful secretary, who is secretly in love with her boss. Another Copacabana singer, Andy Russell (himself), plays Cupid.<br /><br />An irritatingly stupid script, poor production values and almost no good lines for Groucho spoil this slight musical comedy. Andy Russell, who can sing but can't act, cancels himself out. Carmen Miranda fans may want to skip over everything except her numbers, which are good. Groucho fans may want to skip this altogether, unless they want to laugh at the awfulness of it all and imagine the sarcastic quipster delivering a scathing commentary track.
