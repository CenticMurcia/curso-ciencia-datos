I didn't even want to give this title a 1 because it just really sucked. I don't have any clue on why anybody likes this movie. The only reason I even rented this was because Bill Murray was in it and honestly I want the 2 hours of my life back. I would rather watch a dog take a crap than watch this movie again. Trust me...Steer clear of this one. If you want to see Bill Murray be funny than watch Caddyshack. If you want to see Mathew Gray Grubler than watch R.V. or better yet Criminal Minds. It was beyond terrible. I don;t think there is a word in the English language that describes how bad this movie actually was. Because of this movie I never want to see anything Wes Anderson makes again.
