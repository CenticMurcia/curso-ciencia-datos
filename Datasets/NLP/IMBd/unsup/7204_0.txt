I remember watching this show as an 11 year-old and LOVED IT. I'd look forward to it each week and would not miss it for the world. It seemed like it was preempted ALL THE TIME by something in the news, just like the other reviewer said. Of course, I'd tune in the next week and get to watch it. No problem. But this kept happening. A week on the air, a week off the air. Finally, it was "preempted" by another show. It took several weeks before I realized it was never coming back. At least I still had "Tales of the Gold Monkey". The best way to describe this show would be as follows: Wizards & Warriors was to the Dungeons and Dragons genre as "Sledge Hammer" was to cop shows. A true classic that needs to be released on DVD.
