Saw RINGU 2, along with RINGU on Saturday, August 2, 2003 and must say that I felt that both films were quite well done. However, I felt that the Hong kong import DVD that a friend had that I watched was quite inferior to an otherwise excellent film, for one thing, it was obviously cropped, and equally obvious that it was taken directly from a videotape, as you can hear the tell-tale whirring throughout the movie. to add to this, the subtitles were blurring and white with no dark outlines, which means whenever someone in white is in the scene he obliterates the subtitles, thus making it hard to follow the storyline. Otherwise, the film itself was well-done and logically follows the storyline. An interesting sidenote is the fact that there is one scene (The first visit to the hospital), which was recreated in the US version of the first film. While not as good as the original, I still recommend it, if you can find a better print of it on DVD.
