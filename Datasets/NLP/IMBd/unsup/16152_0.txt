Candyman 3 day of the dead is pretty much one of the best horror movies you can find. The plot is not any thing special because it is pretty much the same plot as candyman 2 farwell to the flesh but the movie itself completely makes up for it believe me. This movie is about a women named Caroline(Donna D'Errico) who is an ancestor to the candyman(Tony Todd). Candyman wants to bring Caroline back to the grave with him. This movie is probably the second goriest movie in the series behind the original candyman. I would highly recommend this to a fan of Candyman or Scream. I give this 2 thumbs up.<br /><br />Roosterz review for parents, My ratings are either Minor,Mild,Moderate,Heavy,Strong,Graphic or pervasive.<br /><br />Sex:Moderate Violence:Graphic Nudity:Moderate Gore:Graphic Language:Heavy.
