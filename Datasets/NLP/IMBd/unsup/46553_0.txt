Legally questionable, though horrific. Anyone who hates even the concept of rape, should perhaps be sort of okay with this movie.<br /><br />Anyone even complicit in such an act should be guilty. And punished.<br /><br />But to be honest, the way this movie goes about trying legally entangle anyone present in such a foul act, is sort of forced. Not that there isn't any legal way to do it, but the way the director and writer do so, very much a question mark, and sort of a poor writing example.<br /><br />Not a bad concept. But to be honest. Not a very good performance. Though the individual performances are mixed. Some quite fine, some others not so much. The court performances on all sides are quite awful. <br /><br />Caveat: Foster is excellent. She has so much talent.
