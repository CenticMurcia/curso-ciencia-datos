Director Genevieve Robert has attempted to make a comedy-drama that makes serious comment about modern day sexual relations, and with "Casual Sex?" she is well wide of the mark.<br /><br />The storyline is very weak (concerning two young girls' search for the perfect guy), while the serious and moral content makes very little impact. Don't be deceived by the title.<br /><br />Finally, the comedy only works very occasionally, but look out for Andrew Dice-Clay in a stand out performance as the 'Vinman'. "Casual Sex?" may have been much better made purely as a send-up of sex in the 80's.<br /><br />Thursday, July 2, 1992 - Video
