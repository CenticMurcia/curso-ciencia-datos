The difference between this film and The Blair Witch Project is simply, this one gives us the 'horror of what happened to the filmmakers' from a different perspective. Rather than us going along on the journey with them, we are given collective interviews from different people in the style of another episode of VH1's Driven...shows. While I do have respect for what the creators of this movie accomplished, I still hold stronger feelings towards The Blair Witch Project. I suppose I just enjoy going along on the ride more so than having the story be given to me through the eyes of the documentarian covering the deaths of the filmmakers, although the ending does give us a rather splendid surprise. 4/10
