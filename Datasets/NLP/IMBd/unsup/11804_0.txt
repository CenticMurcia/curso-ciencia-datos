As others have suggested, vantage point wud be a gud return on your money if you went to see a thriller with action sequences, blasts, car chases and a lot of shattering glass.<br /><br />Vantage point is a story of an assassination attempt on US president from 8 different viewpoint, each revealing something new about the events. This repetitive nature of the plot gets frustrating after a while. The concept worked for run lola run but a thriller like vantage point is supposed to go forward not rewind itself 8 times.<br /><br />If u are in the theater to enjoy a thriller and not bother about the plot, well n gud, you would come out a lot happier. But if you expected anything more then the loose storyline would really disappoint you.<br /><br />The writers have a lot of explaining to do. If any of the people responsible for a US presidents security would have watched this movie then the writers are in a real soup. just 7 guys guarding the presidential suit, with outsiders having access to the hotel and a local guy working as bell boy (who easily sneaks in guns and explosives into the hotel), a single guy wiping out each of the agents (even rambo would hv had a hard time at that). At the venue where the president gets shot the bad guys are able to sneak in a remote controlled fan and gun right under the nose of the secret service.<br /><br />then no one bothers to explain why gud guys were blackmailed to assist the plot when the same thing would have been easier with dedicated bad guys, the role of the rouge camera man, role of the rouge secret service guy, he risked his life just to retrieve the gun (I don't think the bad guys were that pressed on funds that they needed to retrieve the assassination weapon), massive car chases on 2 lane streets, at times even going the wrong way, colossal explosions sparing the lives of just the important members of the cast.<br /><br />well all in all a very mediocre thriller
