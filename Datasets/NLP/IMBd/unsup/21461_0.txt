This is the one film of Joan Crawford's that I could watch all the time. I think this is the one that got me started on keeping everything neat and tidy and in its place!! Thanks a lot Joan!! LOL But, honestly, this is a very good film--good acting from all involved, great music, especially at the end when the final scenes are showing, and a great settee--or whatever that couch thing is---sure don't look like the furniture we ever had. That poor thing would not have survived in our family. You know how poor white trash do everything on a sofa except sit on it!! LOL I really thought it was a bit much how, when Harriet goes to visit her mother in that nursing home, it was so spacious!! Man, I wish I had a bedroom that large!! LOL And how sweet of Harriet to bring her mother washcloths as a gift--how thoughtful a gift for mama!! LOL I know I am making fun of this movie, but I do love this film very much. I only wish that someone would show "Craig's Wife" with Rosalind Russell, as I have heard that this version is superior to Joan's version and I would like to make my own choice as to which is better. I give this film a 10 out of 10.
