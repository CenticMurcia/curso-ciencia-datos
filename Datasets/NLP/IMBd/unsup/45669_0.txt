Even as a child I never really liked this show. It was extremely repetitive and gross, with lots of jokes about rotting food, etc. The child actors were very run-of-the-mill and the adults looked like they were sitting out a spell in purgatory. I think much of people's adulation of this show comes from the fact that at the time it was on the air, cable was still quite a luxury and being able to watch it was one of the bragging rights of elementary school. Perhaps this show should have been named "This Program Is Not Up To The Standards Of Network Television" to help clear up any confusion. I am not surprised that most of the actors involved (excluding the little-seen Alanis, of course) faded into obscurity.
