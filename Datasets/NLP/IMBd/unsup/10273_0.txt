It's one of the best TV series of 2005 in Turkey.Nazli;a Turkish girl from Gaziantep doesn't want to marry Kadir(her childhood friend)and run away from home and goes to Bodrum where she will meet Niko who she will fall in love.But there's a huge problem because Niko's Greek.Greeks and Turks do not get along well generally but their big love won't be ruin by this problem and they decide to get marry.Niko comes to Gaziantep and meet with Nazli's family and the comedy starts.The cast of the series are all experienced Turkish actors and actresses except Özgür Çevik(Niko)but he acts like he's an actor for years.They are all very talented.Sumru Yavrucuk(Nazli's mother) Erdal Özyagcilar(Nazli's father) Arif Ekin(Nazli's grandfather) and Binnur Kaya(Nazli's elder sister)are the most funny characters.Probably Anna and Kadir will fall in love and maybe Memik and Niko's grandmother too!!!And also Yabanci Damat will be played at Greek TV channel Mega TV in july.Anyway let's keep watching this beautiful and funny TV show...(I really don't understand why greeks like Nehir so much, she is hundred times uglier than Natalia Doussopoulos!!!)
