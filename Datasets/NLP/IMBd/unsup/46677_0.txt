Hmm, that should sum it up right there, but I'll go into more detail. Okay, the story was pathetic. The Chinese randomly blow up a Russo/American space station and of course the two nations react and come close to a war with China. This somehow causes two alien objects to come up out of the ground, one that heals and one that destroys. When the waves of each of these collide, the earth would be re-terraformed and start over without humans. The only way that these aliens will leave is if they see their son that they got by impregnating Dr. Mason Rand's (David Keith) wife 10 years ago. Of course, they wait till the last couple minutes to bring his son, who also has healing powers and can bring people back to life. The acting was pitiful, I'll go over some huge standouts in a segment I like to call: What I Learned From This Movie:<br /><br />1. When soldiers are shooting at an armed enemy, they stand out in open space and fire randomly.<br /><br />2. Soldiers can look intimidating with their guns, but if you get into martial arts moves, they collapse.<br /><br />3. When shot in the leg, people can keep walking without noticing it for five seconds.<br /><br />4. Even though the aliens are 2-3 feet tall, the passageways to their structure is conveniently sized for humans to be comfortable.<br /><br />5. Ex-Special Ops cannot shoot a stationary target.<br /><br />The acting was pitiful the whole way through though. Keith did not have his best stuff at all. Not even close. It seems as if he tried way too hard to do a crappy job. The directing, to have at least that many noticeable major errors, is awful. He had more than that, those were just the first to come to mind. The visual effects were awful as well. The explosions looked fake, the Toris didn't look convincing at all, and the blood didn't even look real. I picked this up for a free rental because I thought it looked cool; that was a mistake. Avoid this one, you'll want your 90 minutes back.
