It is shocking to think of how big the High School Musical franchise has become for Disney. In 2006, the first film became a surprise hit, and the sequel is expected to follow along the same lines. It is embarrassing to admit, but I bought a month's subscription for Disney Channel on Demand just so I could see High School Musical 2 before anyone else, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Let me say it right here and now: High School Musical is thousands of times better than the first film, with improvements in every category. The movie is longer, most of the scenes are more realistic, the directing and the acting seem to have vastly improved, and most importantly of all, the songs and the music are just AMAZING. These are the type of songs you would expect from a Broadway film or production, not some TV movie musical! The lyrics are beautiful, and nearly all of the songs are spectacular. All of the original cast members return for High School Musical 2, including Zac Efron, Ashley Tisdale, Vanessa Hudgens, Lucas Grabeel, and Corbin Bleu.<br /><br />The plot this time around is incredibly different from the first one, and much more structured. It has a certain unique flow to it. Summer has arrived and Troy and Gabriella's love has to stand the test of time. Summer break just happens to be the ultimate test. Sharpay's parents own a country club, and she allows them to hire Troy, but all of the Wildcats come along for summer jobs. Sharpay will stop at nothing to tear apart Troy and Gabriella. Troy must discover who he is and what the future really holds for him along the way.<br /><br />The best thing about this sequel is the fact that Disney seems to care so much about it. It's not one of those crappy sequels like Inspector Gadget 2 with none of the original cast returning. This sequel brings back the entire cast, and fleshes out the backstories for each and every one of them. With a longer length, there is more time to develop the characters, and this time is utilized wisely with a number of songs with amazing lyrics. Each and every song brings something new to the plate and is a realization of one thing or another. Every song has its own sound and feel that is much more unique than the first one. The soundtrack is simply amazing, and even the one song that didn't make it into the movie (Humuhumunukunukuapua'a) ended up as one of my favorites.<br /><br />The acting is considerably better this time around as all of the cast members have had a year or so to work on their acting. Lucas Grabeel steals the show as Ryan, who finally breaks free from being Sharpay's accomplice in everything. Zac Efron gives a flawless performance with some amazing vocals, and it's very easy to see why he has become such an icon so quickly. Everyone's hairstyles and clothes look much better this time around, and there is much less of that corny Disney-Channel-show feel to it. The writing and the script are very well-written, and there are very few scenes that don't come out the right way. The dialogue and the music and lyrics balance themselves out perfectly in the movie.<br /><br />High School Musical 2 is not only the best Disney Channel Original Movie ever made, but it is also sure to become a classic, and one of the best film musicals I've ever seen. It is better than the first film in every way imaginable with better humor and comedic moments, better writing, and much better songs. Don't miss this filmÂ—you won't be disappointed! It is nothing short of amazing.
