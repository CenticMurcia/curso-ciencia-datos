This Val Lewton produced film from the mid-1940s isn't fast-paced but it is very effective. Boris Karloff turns in yet another unforgettable performance--this time as the Greek General Pherides who tries to battle a plague and defeat it as he would vanquish any other enemy. But is it really a plague that threatens the lives of all the characters in the film or something more sinister?? Maybe Madame Kyra's vorvolaka? Often surreal in look and atmosphere, this is a wonderful gem of a film filled with creepy and effective little moments.
