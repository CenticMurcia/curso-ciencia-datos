This movie started off really horrible and I almost gave up on it because of the stupidity but then there were tons of sex scenes and the whole movie redeemed itself in some way. The thing with the talking plant was really stupid. The plant looked like it came some Sesame Street or something. I pushed fast forward to get past the plant and get to the sex scenes but when I got there, there was this creepy guy, Henry, who stands there and grins. That really ruined the whole scene when they cut to him playing in the bushes. I wondered what was going on with that gay guy at the flower shop. I would just suggest taking out the plant and Henry and his mother and just making a dirty movie. We don't really need talking plants do we?
