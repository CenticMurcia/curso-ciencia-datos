This one sits on the shelf besides Double Impact and gathers dust. Its a toss up for which film is worst, but I give it to Death Warrant. A few exciting fight scenes. He never would have made it out alive, but its a movie. Reminds me of Tango and Cash, and I did not like that one either. Don't even rent this one, but my dad seems to like this one when he watch it late one night.
