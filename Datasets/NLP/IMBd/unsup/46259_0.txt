I guess using the Kingston Trio song as a script instead of writing one from scratch was a lot cheaper. Why bother trying to use any imagination.<br /><br />This b/w thing could almost pass for an episode right out of GUNSMOKE, without the good graces of Festus and Miss Kitty. It has all the same Columbia ranch and Newhall locations that have appeared in hundreds of B movie oaters, so you can almost identify every tree or stump that comes into view, a thousand times over.<br /><br />Another standard Columbia quickie made before Michael Landon landed as Little Joe on the Prairie, this one must have been filmed in less than 7 days and really doesn't have much going for it. They should've saved money on the film stock that they wasted.<br /><br />Three Confederate soldiers ambush a Union stagecoach not knowing that the war is over. The townsfolk come gunning after them without any belief that they didn't know that the war had ended. No excuses, they have to be hung, plain & simple.<br /><br />The townsfolk come across as a bunch of bloodthirsty dummies and the rebs (including Landon) aren't much smarter, making them all look unreal. I guess the folks over at Columbia weren't that much smarter, either...<br /><br />3 out of 10 for being a bunch of dummies.
