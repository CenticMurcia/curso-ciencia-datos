Although the locations were authentic and Cinematography good; the plot was very unlikely and not credible. It was as credible and plausible as an Eagle picking up a beagle dog taking him to great height, dropping him, the dog catching a pigeon in flight, the Dog landing in pile of Hay, bouncing harmlessly, making a great meal of the pigeon only to be found by the rancher who was just thinking about buying a Beagle for his daughter who had been begging for one. C'mon!! the writer should NEVER be allowed to write again.<br /><br />The acting was indeed cheesy and corny at times. probably induced by bad writing and bad story line. I actually, rolled my eyes, huffed and puffed at times<br /><br />granted that this movie tries to appeal to the Human condition and tries to make a story about romance and love, it just doesn't work! The writer tried to create a jigsaw puzzle with pieces and elements that did NOT belong to the same set.<br /><br />it is also puzzling that the director did not catch any of this. and appeared not quite prepared to be a director and unable to guide the actors.<br /><br />I also noticed that all the "GREAT" reviews here, were all from people in Los Angeles where this company is based. no doubt from people all connected to this movie and thus meaningless to me.
