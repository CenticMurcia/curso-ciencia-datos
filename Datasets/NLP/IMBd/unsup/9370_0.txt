The Fly definitely has to have one of the most interesting story in film history about a scientist who teleported himself in his invention without knowing that there is a fly with him. The best thing about the movie is that he didn't turn into a fly straight away after he left the machine; he was slowly throughout the whole film which really created the suspense & the tensive mood.<br /><br />It is a remake and a hi-tech update of the 1958 classic and is David Cronenberg's biggest hit to date, granting Jeff Goldblum his finest role as the teleported monster hybrid and granting an Oscar for its gruesomely icky special effects. Generally flies are the most useless & annoying animals especially when they sit on your food but for once they did become useful for the idea of this terrific film. I've not seen the original Fly because I'm not keen in really old films and I don't think it will turn out to be as good as this one.<br /><br />It's rumoured that there is going to be another remake in 2008, I don't mind remakes as long as they turn out to be good but most of them are rubbish. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London, Gremlins, A Nightmare in Elm Street, The Terminator & Predator, the list is endless. Overall The Fly is a masterpiece with a classic story that has been tackled in a lot of cartoons including Dexter's Laboratory & Johnny Bravo. It is really underrated because mostly people gave it an 8 instead of 10 out of 10 and it should be on the IMDb top 250.
