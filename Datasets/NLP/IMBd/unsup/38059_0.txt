I saw this movie when it came out in theaters last year, not by choice, by force! I'm sure I wasn't the only guy forced into this sorry excuse for a movie by their girlfriend. I am not one of the average guys who are only interested in hardcore action, or something else advertised right... My mind is open to almost any movie, but crap! This movie is about as original as my post for it ( not original lol)...I saw another "Chick Flick" around that same time called "Down with Love" and enjoyed that one, one hundred times better. In "View From the Top" the characters were terrible and undeveloped completely. The plane could have crashed in the movie and I definitely wouldn't have shed one tear of sympathy for Christine or any of the other flight attendants on board...DON'T LET YOUR GIRLFRIEND DRAG YOU INTO THIS ONE!! lol 2 out of 10...got the 2 because of Mike Myres's small part.
