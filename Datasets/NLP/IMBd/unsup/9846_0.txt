Upon first viewing of this movie, you may automatically think Species rip-off. Even with the clearly lower budget it offers so much more and actually trys to be different from the average made for TV Sci-Fi weekly movie by combining a mixture of comedy, horror, and of course science fiction. The movie takes place on a college campus in Canada! Where we follow a group of students who have an American Pie type of vibe to them, by busting out jokes and repeatedly have discussions about losing their virginity and performing other sexual acts. And that's where the hot blonde sorority babes come in...and that's where the Species comparisons may come in.<br /><br />Yes, just like the Species series, in order for this hot blonde undercover "ALIEN" race to survive they must reproduce with the male human virgin freshmen. We do get some actual time to meet the characters and their stereotypes, and you do get a feel for them. It's clear to see who the lead players are and even though you know who's gonna go, you still root for them like they have a chance, something you don't see too often.<br /><br />The hot blondes in their natural form do resemble the Species creatures quite a bit, but I guess they go by the standard alien description, hairless body, big eyes, human but almost bug like. The awesome Kim Poirier actually plays one of them "Constance". She gets quite a bit of screen time while not actually being the lead, you might also recognize her from the Dawn of the Dead remake, she's got quite a memorable scene in that one! When we do see these reptilian aliens, sometimes it is real effects that do look fairly good. But for most of the action sequences the creatures are CGI but even though it's easy to tell, it still looks good since they move so fast.<br /><br />This movie also mixes in a bit of cop drama with the good cop bad cop showdown, although unnecessary it still seems to work in the entire B-Movie atmosphere of the rest of the movie. So we follow our lead college male "Luke" played by Corey Sevier as he must prove to the others that Aliens do exist and they're taking over the campus before it's too late and his friends give in to sexual peer pressure.<br /><br />The movie builds up quite nice to an inevitable showdown between the lead male and entire Alien species. We get some nice action sequences and with all the time spent actually getting to know the characters you don't know whether or not to root or boo for these aliens creatures.<br /><br />In the end, you get the expected victory with an unexpected twist. The first time I watched this movie it somehow slipped past me, but it actually seems to work quite well. I'm not gonna spoil it for you just in case you haven't seen this but keep an eye out for it when you do! This is definitely a movie you can have fun with if you don't take it too seriously, think of The Faculty + Species and a Lil' bit of American Pie and you got a surprisingly enjoyable movie. Of course it finishes off with room for a sequel and of course a sequel was made, how could they not? If you get a chance give this one a watch, even though you may have seen this type of story before, it's more fun then you may think.<br /><br />7.5/10
