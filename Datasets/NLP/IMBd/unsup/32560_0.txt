I've seen better acting on cable access at 3am. Unbelievably bad. This 'movie' never would have made it to DVD if it hadn't been for Kevin Smith's name. And that's the rub; anyone who watched it was conned into 2 hours of crap by Kevin Smith. He should be ashamed. This 'film' appears to have been shot with an 80's era tube camera, lighted with bare bulbs, and edited with a rusty razor blade. And the audio! It isn't even synched to the video and varies in volume throughout. The only thing that could have been good is the script, but it takes intense concentration to notice that through the horrible production quality and the shameful acting.
