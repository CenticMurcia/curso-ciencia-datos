There were, including myself, a total of 5 persons in the auditorium. One walked. I should have followed. Animated Coke ads were far more entertaining than this cliché-ridden garbage: armies of Munchkins borrowed from Wizard of Oz, ear-splitting insipid music stolen from Star Wars to induce an artificial sense of excitement, a forgettable tale of morals with no morals. I could quote the tiresome dialogue before the words had been uttered. Wearying ideas and effects stolen from Indiana Jones and Lord of The Chinese Ring of The Nibelungen made for an altogether dreadful yawn of a yarn whose characters I could not care a bean for, even if ALL of them had been peed on. I was acutely aware of the passing time. I fidgeted through it only because I was with someone. I was far too polite; just wanted to click my heels and go home. Look out for Forbidden City 2it may smack youright in the face.
