This movie was made by The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter-Day Saints(AKA: Mormons, LDS) in 1969. Though made for any type of regular viewing, other than religious, its purpose was just a teaching tool to show value in every person and that there is beauty in everything. And sometimes it takes a little encouragement to show others the beauty.<br /><br />Set in the early 1900's on an island in Polynesia, the film starts out with a local trader who barters for a wife. The father of the young girl is surprised why anyone would want his daughter as she is not the islands prized beauty. The father, thinking he can barely get 1 cow for his daughter tries to start high and haggle down low to gain his own respect. The trader comes up with an outrageous high number of cows and shocks the town when he arrives with all healthy and the full number of cows he promised.<br /><br />This is truly an inspiration to ones self esteem, showing that worth and beauty is always in the beholder. Excellent to have in any collection.
