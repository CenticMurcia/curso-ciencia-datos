Believe me what i said above is really true. Kal Ho Naa Ho is really the finest movie of 2003 yet. Before watching this movie there was a thing in my mind that produced by Karan Johar and acted by Shahrukh Khan this movie will really going to rock. And the same thing happened. This movie is without any hole. A perfect direction by Nikhil Adavani. This movie is proof of Shahrukh's emotional acting and that he still rocks. One more thing that this movie is a bit funny too Saif Ali Khan looking great in this field as look in the 2001's movie of the year "Dil Chahta Hai" by large number of critics. However the music of the movie is not so good as Karan Johar's previous movies Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham but the story of the movie is great. A perfect family movie. I give it 10/10.
