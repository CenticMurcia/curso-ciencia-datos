If you really want to make history boring, I advise you to see this epic 1949 flop.<br /><br />I imagine this misery was originally in black and white. Attempting to colorize it completely destroyed the texture.<br /><br />Fred March is the title role is totally colorless here as well as the writing.<br /><br />When the ships are at sea, the writing is so monotonous and it's only mid-September 1492. You can actually start rooting for October 12th to come. When it finally does, Columbus encounters new world people who are as dull as the picture is.<br /><br />When he talks about a hanging, he brings in the name Haman. Were the writers suspicious that Columbus was really Jewish? At least, they could have played up that angle to make the film more exciting.<br /><br />His enemies in Spain never relented and Columbus was charged with thievery and ineptness and was brought back in shackles in a scene similar to Charlton Heston's Moses coming in to the kingdom in shackles when it was discovered that he was the deliverer.<br /><br />Angry, that Ferdinand and Isabella have decided to keep him in Spain, he angrily retorts: "My name will be long remembered long after they're both dead!" He walks off and the film mercifully ends.<br /><br />1492 also marked the inquisition of the Jews from Spain. We should have also inquired why this abominable film was ever made.
