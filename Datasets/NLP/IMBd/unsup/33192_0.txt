Don't waste your money on this one. The acting is horrible at best, the special effects are poor (when there is any) and the sound track doesn't fit in with what's happening in the movie. There really is never a feeling of suspense or impending doom. None of the actors tend to behave like a real person would in the same situation. One guy jokingly sticks his hand in a farm auger and when it turns on his hand is obviously mangled, but he dies instantly and his girlfriend runs off instead of helping him. Later, we see him dead and his whole arm is mysteriously gone. After all three boys are dead and the girls are being chased, one girl screams when she sees the farmer and the other girl actually asks her why she's screaming. Another scene, the girls arm themselves with knives and when they come across the farmer, they hit him with the flashlight instead and run off. On top of that, they seem most concerned with finding a place to warm up instead of the fact that their boyfriends are dead and they're next. Be prepared to feel like you've lost 50 IQ points if you decide to watch this one. What a waste of time and money.
