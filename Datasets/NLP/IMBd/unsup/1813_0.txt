I have to start with the fact that this will certainly be one of the most compelling and most unforgettably sincerely romantic films that you have ever seen. The title does not suggest the true meaning and thought provoking power of one of the greatest films in existence. While the war is the backdrop and plays a strong supporting plot point, it does not suggest the feeling of love and the knowing that every moment counts that the film ultimately portrays. I hope that everyone who reads this will take the time to seek out this film. It is the quintessential example of a form of art that can really alter your outlook on life for the better.
