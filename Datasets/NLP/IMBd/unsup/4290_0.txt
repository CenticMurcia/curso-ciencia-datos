Certainly one of the best movie that i enjoyed. yes enjoyment all the way...very touching scenes from our daily life. The characters are so common in our life. I felt i am watching myself with my friends. <br /><br />I have always been a biggest fan of AAMIR KHAN and this is one of the finest performance by him.From his hunky funky flirto type to intense mature person in the end, you love him all the way. Both SAIF and AKSHAYE were perfect.Saif was so likable and played it to perfection. Akshaye did a real just with his character which i think was very difficult as well A lesser actor would have easily failed to bring the expression and mood to the character but he performed as this character was made for him. In fact the trio worked so well...the on screen chemistry between them was so great that the made it look so real. Preity showed why she is one of the best in Bollywood. Music is the high-lite and all the songs are hummable,well choreographed and picturized. "DIL chahta hae" still reminds me of inner me. "Janay kiyon" will mesmerise you and "koi kahe" is foot tapping number that ll sure bring you on the floor. The last one "TANHAI" was picturised superbly and expressions by AAMIR were tremendous. <br /><br />You cannot say that this is the debut movie for FARHAN AKHTAR. An excellent effort by him. Wish he ll be back with some more flicks like this.
