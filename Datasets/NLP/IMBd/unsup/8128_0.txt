Right you are commenter's that Ironmaster is low-brow and or low-budget but I really like this kind of sword and sandal, cave dwellers, Hercules, and or Tarzan movies that are no longer made except very rarely. Morality and a keeping of the body in this case Sam Pasco as Ela and others though less so are entertaining, inspiring, and for me hope giving in life. With the comments of some others I read I think Sam Pasco nor any of the cast were bad at all. In fact they're quite good including Vood, the women, and their followers on both sides. Much thanks to whomever inspired the making of this film. It is not a waste in the slightest. <br /><br />Good afternoon or late night escapism that does not need thinking.
