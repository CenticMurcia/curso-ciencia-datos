Brennan Huff's mother and Dale Doback's father get married and go to live together. Since Brennan and Dale still live with their parents (even having 40 years old), they need to live as step brothers. They don't like each other and don't get along. The main problem will come when they start to shake their parents' wedding.<br /><br />What a HORRIBLE movie! I haven't laughed even once! It is as bad as ''You Don't Mess with the Zohan '', but even more retarded! (If this is possible!!)<br /><br />How can someone even laugh with those ridiculous situations? The two lead characters seem two retarded men whose main objective is to destroy their family's lives. They behave like babies and they are what? 40 years old?<br /><br />I cannot believe this movie has almost a 7 in its rate. This only proves how many people with bad taste live in the world.<br /><br />Don't even bother to watch this movie, or you are going to lose your time with one of the most pathetic movies ever made by humanity.
