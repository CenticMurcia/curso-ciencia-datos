I saw this film at the South by Southwest Film Festival where I was privileged to hear several of the "subjects" of the film speak. Not only was I impressed with the level of dedication of the filmmaker, but with the incredible virtuosity of the film-making itself. The cinematography evoked the deepest emotional states of the characters and the strange beauty of the harsh prison environment. Filmmakers made an engaging, dramatic and compelling film while also staying sensitive to the subjects. The subjects could easily have been seen as victims, but instead they were empowered to tell their own stories within the framework of the filmmaker's profound storytelling vision. Though this film has many political implications, it is not a "political" film. It steers clear of easy points and summaries and paints a complex portrait of complex characters caught up in a severely flawed legal system that punishes children more than adults. If you can see this film, SEE IT! It is the best documentary I have seen in years. In fact, I recently read that it will be on PBS as part of the Independent Lens series.
