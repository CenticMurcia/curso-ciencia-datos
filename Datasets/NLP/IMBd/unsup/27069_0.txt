Enjoyed the great acting performance that Mariel Hemingway did with her role as (Christine Connelly),"Lipstick",'76, in which she plays a very frustrated girl friend who is madly in love with Kurt Russell,(Malcolm Anderson),"Stargate",'94, who tries to retire as a reporter from a big city newspaper and go to a quite newspaper in Colorado. Malcolm goes to his Managing Editor and tries to resign but becomes involved with a young girl being murdered and from then on all kinds of hell breaks loose. There is lots of action and mystery involved and Richard Jordan,(Alan Delour), "Posse",'93 adds greatly to the plot and gets deeply involved with Christine and Malcolm. It is sad that Richard Jordan went to a higher stage to perform on and suddenly passed away at an early age. When ever Mariel Hemingway or Kurt Russell perform, you can always expect a great film to view and enjoy.
