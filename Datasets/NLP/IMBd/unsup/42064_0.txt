Unbelievable that a movie this amateurish even got a decent release, I purchased this clunker at Best Buy. How does this kind of thing even get released? Simple plot about vacationing girls "molested" by local redneck punks is needlessly complicated by boring supernatural twist and "cops" on their trail.<br /><br />Long, boring, and tedious with a coupla gore FX thrown in from Halloween Express, this thing looks like it was shot on VHS tape or a low pixelated DVD-R camcorder.<br /><br />The tone- unbelievable! Was it a comedy? An Ed Wood attempt? Or was all the stupidity accidental? One minute it's serious, one minute it's slapstick, the next...who knows, it's just completely confusing.<br /><br />The lead gals are lookers and the nudity is nice, but they aren't into their parts or the "lesbian" scenes enough to make it worth your time.<br /><br />I'm floored the lead singer of MINISTRY contributed some halfway decent music to this production, or the camcorder makers just stole it, synced it up, and put his name on it.<br /><br />Ineptitude of the highest order, I certainly hope this team of wannabes does not embark on any more ventures, pleeeeeze, I wrote all your names down so I will avoid all future projects each and every one of you "behind the sceners" are involved in.<br /><br />WICKED LAKE gives horror flicks...camcorder flicks...and underground movies...the clich√© negative reputation it deserves because so many hacks hawk up luggies like this smegma.<br /><br />Stay far away from this thing, and shame on FANGORIA magazine for giving the camcordermakers so much publicity! Shame on everyone involved for making such crud! I'm telling you, you can't imagine how inane this thing is til ya try to sit through it...Ugh!
