It was a Friday night and I had nothing to do when i saw that A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 :Freddy's Revenge was going to be on. I enjoyed the original so much that i thought i would enjoy this movie greatly as well...but i was very disappointed. The Acting was awful. and the script was terrible. This film was not scary at all. The final scenes where Freddy is destroyed by Lisa's Love for Jesse was pathetic and definitely not how ANOES movie should end. This movie was just terrible all around with the only good thing being Freddy Krueger- who only makes a few appearances. I give this movie a 3 out of 10<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this unless you are a huge fan of the nightmare series. Even then you will be disappointed.
