What made me feel good after watching this movie was ... a good story and brilliant acting.. specially Priyanka Chopra has done a very good job... she is the lady who knows what acting is.... and no doubt if she will be the next bollywood queen... John Abraham has also done a very good job playing the character of a hit-man... all together a good movie to watch ... worth the time... And I think after a long time had bollywood came up with such a brilliant movie I don't know why such movies are not liked by the Indian audience... they go in for crap... I would say that Karam has got a good story, good acting and screenplay, but still this movie did not do much business ... sad to hear that... Indian audience ... wake up plzzzzz....
