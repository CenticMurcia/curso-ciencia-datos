A policewoman goes to jail to help a girls' gang of criminals escape to recover some stolen diamonds hidden in a swamp. The situation gets more complicated with a kidnapping, a lot of infighting and a few deaths.<br /><br />Actually, Swamp Women is not too bad. It's not great by any means, but it's a fun, campy, low budget exploitation flick that can't help but entertain. The viewer does need to suspend disbelief at times-for instance, why the gang isn't more suspicious of a new inmate who knows all about the stolen diamonds and just happens to have a workable escape plan on her first night in jail, I'll never know-but that just adds to the "charm" of this film.<br /><br />It's not an extreme film by any means, but it's fun and recommended for those who like this kind of low budget exploitation flick. Go in with low expectations and you won't be disappointed.
