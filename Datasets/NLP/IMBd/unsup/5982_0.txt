Deathmaster is a new twist, on the old Vampire film genre. Robert Quarry stars as Khorda, a guru-like character, who happens to also be a Vampire. The film takes place in the early 70s, when hippies were still around, and on the fringes of society. The main setting for the movie is an old abandoned mansion, inhabited by a group of young hippies in southern California. <br /><br />It begins with a mysterious, hulking black dude, who plays flute on the beach. He's adorned with lots of bone necklaces, and a colorful flowing robe. A coffin washes-up on the beach, and is intercepted by a young surfer. The black man chokes the surfer to death, then hauls the coffin to the mansion containing the hippies.<br /><br />Meanwhile, two of the hippies, Pico and his girlfriend Rona, are hanging-out at the local Nic-Nack shop. It's owned by an eccentric older fellow, who is a kindly father-figure to Pico and the other hippies. A belligerent biker named Monk, arrives with his girl, who's named Esslin. Monk threatens the shop-owner, over the price of a bauble that Esslin is interested in. Pico intervenes, and has a scuffle with Monk. But Monk is no match for Pico, who uses martial arts on him. A cop comes to investigate, so they all flee. <br /><br />Pico has no hard feelings towards Monk, and so he invites him and Esslin to the mansion for dinner. The large mansion is teeming with the dope-smoking, philosophizing hippies. Pico offers his guests a sumptuous meal of organic foods. The eerie black guy who killed the surfer, is a part of the group too. They call him Barbado. Barbado is a mute, who 'speaks' through his flute-playing and bongo-drumming.<br /><br />Outside the mansion, the coffin that Barbado had brought there opens, and a large bearded man emerges. Beneath a spooky full-moon, he waves his hand, and a sudden storm blows-up. He enters the mansion, announcing himself as Khorda. The hippies think that this weirdly charismatic guy, is 'far-out'. <br /><br />Khorda spends the evening regaling the enthralled hippies, with advice about 'life and love'. They are looking for ways to find meaning in their lives, and Khorda seems to have all the answers. Little do they know, Khorda is a Vampire. Soon, Khorda's influence over the hippies, results in horrifying consequences for them all.<br /><br />Robert Quarry, is mesmerizing as Khorda. His piercing gaze alone, is enough to send chills up your spine. The supporting cast is mostly lackluster. The notable exception, is Betty Anne Rees, as Esslin. Esslin becomes a Vampire, after being ravished by Khorda. Betty Anne Rees infuses the character of Esslin with a scary, yet irresistibly hypnotic aura, as Khorda's newly converted Vampire mistress.<br /><br />All in all, Deathmaster is an intense, yet campy 70s horror flick. It's the kind of B movie classic, shown in the drive-in theaters back then. For fans of 70s B horror films, Deathmaster is a must-see.
