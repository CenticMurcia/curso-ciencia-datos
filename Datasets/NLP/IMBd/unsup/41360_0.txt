Honestly, I thought this movie would be worse than it was. And it was TERRIBLE. But better than I thought. I honestly felt bad for the people who put so little money into this movie (which should have been made for TV, the plot was so small and not universal). It sent messages about both how you should be yourself and how you should be cool. My ears weren't burning, my eyes weren't falling out, but I didn't want to stay in the theater. Honestly, it's a toy I played with when I was little. You can't make a movie out of it. But they did a surprisingly crappy-but-not-sickening job. Yeah, the sets were cheap and stupid, the actresses were practically B-lists, and typically, played characters with as empty and ditzy expressions as their own, but it could have been worse. But I'd prefer you don't buy this movie. And that they never wasted it and ruined the careers of some of the people who worked on it.
