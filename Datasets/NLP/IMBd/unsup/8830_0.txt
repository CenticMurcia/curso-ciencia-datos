What interested me the most is Nico's love affair. Nico (Kim Raver) looks great and plays very well. The love affair story is so touching. There is no right or wrong for Nico per her situation. It's good to see her goes through the process of thinking what she shall do to deal with her emotion, her job, her lawsuit, her feeling for her husband and her affair. I'm truly impressed with Kim Raver.<br /><br />Lindsay Price (play Victory Ford in the series) is another interesting actress. I haven't known her before. The more I watch her in Lipstick Jungle the more I like her. She's not very pretty but not ugly. There is something about her to hook me into watching her.<br /><br />Overall, I love Lipstick Jungle and can't wait to see the next episode and read the book. A little bit hestitate to read the book before finish watching the show.
