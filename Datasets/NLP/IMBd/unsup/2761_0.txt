Before viewing this film, I watched the trailer to get a quick glimpse, and immediately I classified this film as a comedy, but after actually viewing the film I realized the seriousness of the piece. Denzel Washington startled me with his "decent" British accent and his ability to remain consistent throughout the film. I, in no way, can relate to the plight of the protagonist yet I understand the feeling of betrayal, therefore I was rooting for him all the way. The plot was definitely long-winded and I was lost a few times, but surprisingly it all came together at the end. Even though he met his demise at the end, I was happy to see one of the many antagonist (the crooked police officer) killed off (this is where the sheer delight comes in). Overall the movie was pretty good and kept my attention. However, I found certain segments of the film unnecessary. Will I view again? Probably not.
