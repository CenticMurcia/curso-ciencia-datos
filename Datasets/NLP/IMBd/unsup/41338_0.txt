A film about absolutely nothing, populated by exceedingly boring, uninteresting characters. The black & white is not justified as it does not serve the film well. I suspect it simply served the budget. <br /><br />Why is it that gay filmmakers are only capable of making films about their<br /><br />favorite subject... their own sexual proclivities/fantasies? Every time I see a gay/ lesbian film I am struck by how consumed these filmmakers are with themselves and the exploration of their own sexual deviancy. Same old same old.<br /><br />This film was excruciatingly interminable.
