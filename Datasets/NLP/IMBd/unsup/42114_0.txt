I just finished watching this and was so disappointed I logged right in. I have never read the book upon which this is based, but being a science fiction fan, I have heard of it. Now, I'm not so sure I even want to read it.<br /><br />This movie was just terrible. It made no sense, the characters were empty shells, everything seemed completely contrived.
