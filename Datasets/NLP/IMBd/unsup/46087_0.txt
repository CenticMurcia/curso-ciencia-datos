This movie is a wonderful exploration of different art-forms, such as cinematography, and special visual effects. Jim Stacy delivers a wonderfully "lensed" film, in what is probably the finest cinematography credit of his career. The visual effects produced by Phil Letourneau, could be the finest he has ever done as well. Bruce Mitchell delivers an award-deserving performance as the believable, yet unpredictable Zap Rowsdower. The plot is relevant and highly believable, while maintaining it's fantasy charms. Flying Dutchman Productions made a daring decision, choosing to release the film in Monaural audio. Although some have told me they would like to see a 15th anniversary re-release that is remastered in THX certified digital surround sound. See this film, and judge for yourself, although I think you'll agree, that digitizing can't make a film that is already of this quality any better.<br /><br />Kudos to director Tjardus Greidanus, you couldn't have made a better film.<br /><br />The bottom line: This movie will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and the ending will keep you guessing.<br /><br />That was easily the finest stream of horse garbage I have ever typed...<br /><br />"This film is the ultimately worst film of all time. It shares this distinction with absolutely no other films. Bar none, no holds barred, no filmed overlooked, this is the worst, and any opposition to this opinion, to this notion will not be acceptable as a form of logical, reasonable, or understandable argument."<br /><br />Sincerely<br /><br />Nick Criggar<br /><br />My Rating: 1/10<br /><br />(To the IMDb editors: Please allow access to a new rating: 0 (God Awful) for this film only, as it is the only film that has or ever will have truly earned it.)
