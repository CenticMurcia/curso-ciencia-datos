Adam Goldberg plays Delpy's neurotic American boyfriend who had a bad time in Venice. He got dysentery, and photographed everything. Has he never heard of those simple things that get most Americans around the world? The only remaining two days of the holiday are to be in Paris, Delpy's hometown, before they go back to New York, where they live together. They move in upstairs from her parents, played by Delpy's real parents. Culture shock cuts into the American Adam Goldberg beginning the first meal, braised rabbit.<br /><br />The couple wanders Paris, talking in that way that lovers do when they start to get on each other's nerves. It is a reflection of the inevitably incompatible sides of people, as Paris brings out a part of Delpy that Goldberg is stunned to see: Is she a fanatic political extremist and a blatant slut? They come across old boyfriends so frequently it makes Paris give Goldberg the impression of a petite village, and when Delpy attacks one of them in a restaurant for taking a vacation to Thailand to do some nasty things that she says in French, Goldberg is fed up, unable to understand.<br /><br />This movie lives and breathes Julie Delpy. As well as casting her parents, Delpy puts herself into this film in many other ways: She starred, wrote, edited, directed, co-produced, and composed and even performed some of the music. Delpy actually has made a smart romantic comedy with a sharpness. There is nothing forced or corny about it. Her couple bares things about themselves they never thought they'd divulge to anyone. Julie Delpy is a woman who declines to be distinct or restricted. What she has done here is shunned all inducement to reuse the standard lovers having relationship problems that we see all the time in movies, and has shaped two unique, odd characters so preoccupied with their differences that Paris is almost an agitation.
