From all the French movies I've seen, this one is quite different. When I say different, I mean that this movie has faster pace compared to other French movie that are usually slow-moving.<br /><br />The events folded seamlessly and the acting of the three main actors were great, with one flaw. Stanislas Merhar was supposed to look normal, not effeminate, according to the script, and according to Miou-Miou's character. However, he still looked very effeminate. I don't know if that was the real him or that was what the director wanted him to be.<br /><br />On the contrary, the ending was not that good. I think it was because the writer wanted to end the story, but didn't know how to end it logically. Anyway, this movie is worth seeing.
