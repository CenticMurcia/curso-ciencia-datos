Tagline: Trashy HK entertainment at its best Review by Neo: HK in the 90s is known for creating just as much trash as classic movies. Black Cat does not qualify as a classic, but as far as trashy entertainment is concerned, it is really pure guilty pleasure. Imagine, someone who killed a police and in the process being recruited by the CIA and somehow become a CIA agent. As bizarre as it seems, it didn't really matter, as the film is ultimately fun in a trashy way.<br /><br />In the early 90s, it is almost truism to say that any movie that look trashy, sleazy and with some degree of sexual tension, there will be the ever dependable Simon Yam. Yam is easily an underrated actor, whose talent is still yet to be recognised within the HK Films Award. It is a shame as Yam is certainly someone who has come a long way since those Cat III days and one just need to glimpse at recent films like Eye in the Sky and Election for any indication. Here he is the typical early 90s Simon Yam, whose screen presence alone allows him to ease through his supporting role.<br /><br />Playing the title character of the Black Cat is Jade Leung, her raw and uncomforting acting makes her perfect for the role. The opening scene may seem a bit too staged, but Leung's facial expressions when she kills the guy and the cop is just priceless to endure. However, due to not fault to Leung's effort, one must wonder why the director Stephen Shin didn't bother developing her character further. While the Black Cat succeeds in being trashy yet entertaining, it is once again another case of what could have been. With the ending perfectly panned out for a sequel following, Black Cat 2 is already on the list of upcoming movies Neo is going to watch.<br /><br />All in all, the Black Cat isn't really trying to do too much, nor is the director aiming for such lofty ambitions. Still, somehow, the flick manages to succeed all its trashy goals and the result is giving the audience some guilty pleasure. Perhaps, Neo is just abnormal, but in all truthfulness, Black Cat isn't going to win any awards. Still for mindless entertainment alone, you can probably get a lot worst than this and for one last time, Black Cat is just plain trashy fun (Neo 2008) <br /><br />I rate it 7.75/10
