There is one thing that was really funny about this movie: Some of the effects or rather some of the sets where probably originally from the mi of the 20th century. It reminded me of monster movies from the 60ies. Overall though it was a really bad movie - especially since the reference to the badly arranged sets of 1960'es B movies was probably unintentional. This one can't be good for the reputation of Patrick Steward! I liked him a lot in other roles but even he could not save this film from dwindling in the meaninglessness of a remake of a remake of a movie made from a originally very good book. Actually - the original story seemed to have been lost during this remaking-process, since This was merely a cheap action flick with no much meaning and props that looked so much plastic that it could be debated if the company bought them actually at a toy store.
