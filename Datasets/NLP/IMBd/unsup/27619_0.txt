Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor are a pair of doofuses who decide to leave New York for a better life out west. They get a job at the local bank as a pair of dancing and singing woodpeckers apparently as a promotional thing, but things get hairy when two bank robbers steal the costumes and rob the bank, and the police blame Wilder and Pryor for the crime and are sent to jail, they get a chance to take the case to court, but are found guilty and are sentenced to 125 years in prison(no joke.)At first, prison is considered to be a living he** for the both of them. But Wilder is chosen to be the main rider in the prison's annual rodeo, but the warden is actually planning to rig it so his prison wins it and not the other. This is a great send up of prison films with a lot of memorable scenes including one in which Pryor is treated for an appendix operation in the prison's hospital by a Korean doctor recently new to the United States. This is the second movie featuring Wilder and Pryor so be prepared for big laughs.
