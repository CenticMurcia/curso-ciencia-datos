Oh my God! I have never seen anything like this before. The actors are the best thing about this movie - and they perform like high school kids on too much caffeine. The plot is quaint and dosn't really lead anywhere. The whole movie progresses slowly with lots of pointless chit chat and keeps feeding the viewer with questions without ever providing any answers. Big parts of the story makes no sense and seem to be there only to show off special effects - which BTW would seem outdated 15 years ago. This movie is a complete and utter waste of time!
