this is definately one of my favourite movies and in my opinion, Mike Myers' best movie ever made. I just about know every line off by heart now thanks to DVD.<br /><br />This movie doesn't rely on bodily function jokes (ie Austin Powers ), but on a very clever script.<br /><br />The casting was great and I loved and laughed at Alan Arkin, Michael Richards, Phil Hartman and Charles Grodin in their small, but effective roles.<br /><br />I found it funny and enjoyed the twist at the end. Do yourself a favour, please rent this one out.
