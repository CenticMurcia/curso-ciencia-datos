It`s often said that a short story is the most difficult thing to write . I agree that`s true and that`s probably the reason why I`ve never seen a short film that satisfies me , and I agree with the other reviewer who comments on the fact that DUMPING ELAINE is confused . Why do a young couple keep revisiting the cafe if they`ve broken up ? And why do the two waitresses seem so interested in them ? Gawd their whole interest in life seems to revolve around this on/off relationship. Why can`t people just mind their own business ?
