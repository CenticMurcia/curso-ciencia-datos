"My Cousin Vinny" isn't the great court room drama because it's filled with things that are simply against the rules of court, but since the film is told in such tongue-and-check fashion, it simply adds to the great on-screen chemistry of the actors involved and themes of the film. People may argue that's its contrived, ridiculous, and all that garbage, but this film isn't to be taken seriously. It's a comedy. It's a feel-good-story of believing in someone, and it is incredibly effective. <br /><br />"My Cousin Vinny" delivers a ton of laughs, some great acting from Pesci, Tomei, and Fred Gwynne. Joe Pesci and Marisa Tomei have a ton of fun with this role and really do a great job acting off one another. We become so invested in this story and so invested with their determination that we're sucked into these characters. A smile is brought to your face just listening to them talk. The court room scenes are dynamite. "My Cousin Vinny" is a classic feel- good comedy that's enjoyable from start to finish.
