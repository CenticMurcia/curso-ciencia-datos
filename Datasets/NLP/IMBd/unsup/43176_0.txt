Fans of Kickboxer 2, don't seem to mind that a character so important to the original (and played by such a presence as Van Damme) was killed off so easily and cheaply. But I see a lot of them raising a stink over David Sloane getting killed off. Basically they told us to "get over" it and "accept" this little wimp as the new kickboxer. David Sloane was a little weakling with no muscle that had no place in these movies. In all the sequels he would becoming back as the lead and people would think him as the "kickboxer". I loathed him and couldn't stand that his character was now the star while Van Damme's character was dead. Now, finally he's killed off and good riddance.They put in Mark Dacascos who really should have been in the sequel. He's a real martial artist with a strong build, unlike Satcha Mitchell who's a skinny B-grade actor, with no physique. I was actually glad to see David Sloane die as I never felt he deserved to live off Kurt's success. Now the David Sloane fans feel like all the other movies were pointless as he was going to die anyway. Well that's how us Van Damme fans felt in the sequel. They felt it was still a good movie despite being without Van Damme, well we fell this is a good one despite no Satcha Mitchell. I hope you feel as angry and annoyed as we were now that David was killed off so easily and cheaply as Van Damme was in the sequel. So enjoy this movie, cause David Sloane is never coming back! Accept it and get used to it!
