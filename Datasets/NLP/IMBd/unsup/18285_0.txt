Sonic the Hedgehog was one of the best TV shows of the 90's. It is quintissential 90's TV and is a fine example of what cartoons used to be like. The villains were great as was Sonic the 90's version of Bugs Bunny. This show is aimed at a particular audience of kids who grew up watching cartoons all the time and for that generation Sonic was ideal animation. There was also a tone of sadness underneath the shows exterior that one would have to find out by watching the series. Even so the show is full of hum our and is perfect for kids. Or at least it was. Weather or not today's kids will like the series is another matter but for this person who grew up watching this series Sonic is a awesome 90's show that deserves the same attention as the much loved games
