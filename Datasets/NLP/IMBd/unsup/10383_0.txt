Say what you want, this film makes you think...<br /><br />if people are truly not hypocrites and believe in the fundamental moral value that you should view and treat others as we would want them to view and treat us then this film will make you think it is this fundamental human value that really separates us from other animals well, some of us this film makes us see our biases towards others and makes us wonder about our outlook on the world I film was well done and would recommend it to anyone who has a open mind and is not too single minded
