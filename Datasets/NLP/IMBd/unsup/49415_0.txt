I like documentaries that point out the flaws with real world things such as corporations, but man, this movie pushed it way too far. I was intrigued at the cases they presented and the examples (such as the Monsanto dilemma), but this movie was unbelievably biased.<br /><br />I mean, this movie paints corporations as the devil himself and they don't realize one thing. If everyone turned against corporations (all are not bad), then we have no economic system. They serve a purpose and without them, you wouldn't have the luxuries you have. I say luxuries because we don't need it, but want it. That's what they do. Not only that, they employ us (for the most part). This movie makes it seem as though corporations should be boycotted as a whole, and that is wrong. This movie misrepresents a lot of things, but at the same time presents many useful things.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, except for the fact that it is way too biased for a documentary. It seems as though Michael Moore, who speaks in the movie, made it himself.
