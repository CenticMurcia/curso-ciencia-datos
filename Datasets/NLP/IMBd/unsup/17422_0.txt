I saw this movie two years ago. Not a day goes by that I don't think of it. I have seen nothing like it, before or since. What begins as a simple concept grows into something truly horrific. <br /><br />It's effective imagery and straightforward storytelling leaves you feeling out of place and truly haunted.<br /><br />I think everyone should watch this movie. Do it soon before an American studio buys up the rights to re-make and ruin it. Certain aspects of this movie will not translate. Americans won't "get" it. But if you want to watch something that will thrill and terrify you for years, Ka√Øro will not disappoint.
