Another movie with Christopher "There's a clause in my contract that says I have to be in at least one scene of every movie" Walken where he wastes his talent. <br /><br />All-American Murder is a pretty pathetic movie, especially the ridiculous ending. I would compare it to 'Blue City,' the Alley Sheedy/Judd Nelson "thriller" about some fast talking cocky kid who wants to avenge his father's death. But, he never stops with his cocky, mouthing off, even in the face of a mafia and corrupt government officials. And his adversaries only react with stupid, empty threats. Where's the action? Where's the suspense? <br /><br />Like it was in 'Blue City', the main character (Schlatter) and many of those around him react too unbelievably, given the situation they're in, making it one laughable, ridiculous movie. <br /><br />The story centers on Schlatter, who plays a similar fast-talking, cocky kid, but a well-meaning one. A student a college, he tries to sweet talk one of the sorority girls into going out with him. But, unfortunately, he should've just settled for 'no,' because when he shows up one night, she bombs out of the building and burns to death. And since he was the only one around, he must be the culprit. Well, surely a misunderstanding such as this calls for ample chase scenes, as Schlatter tries to prove his innocence, especially with a cold cop breathing down his neck and giving him a deadline, basically, before he hauls him into jail, his patience wearing thin.<br /><br />But, neither the killer's identity, nor the motives, nor the finale, are all that interesting, and the end is just plain stupid. At least if the rest of the movie were just simply mediocre (it is actually worse than that), than a strong ending might've saved it. But it didn't. Not at all.<br /><br />I can see why Schlatter was in this movie. This is basically his schtick--the happy-go-lucky charming guy who tries to get the girl (see 18 Again!), and he's good at it, except this kind of story doesn't call for that kind of character throughout the whole movie. Everybody seems to be too passive in situations that require emergency, making the whole thing seem pretty stupid. Schlatter's good nature humor may've worked if there was anything really going on in the story. But there isn't. And of course, just because Christopher Walken is in a movie, doesn't make it a good movie. Here, he is a good actor in a bad movie. <br /><br />If it's thrillers you're in the mood for, even cheap ones, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.
