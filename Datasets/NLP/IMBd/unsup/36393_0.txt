Without Kate Beckinsale in it, there would be no reason whatever to watch this piece of mindless drivel.<br /><br />I haven't read the book, but I can well imagine it was a rollicking good, unputdownable page-turner. It should have been easy to make a good movie from it. So why didn't they? I don't think Jim McBride is a bad director, so let's not blame him. So I guess it must be the screenwriter, and maybe the producers, if they agreed that the finished product was what they wanted in the first place.<br /><br />Anyhow, as I said, there is absolutely no point to watch this other than to marvel at Kate. She seems to have been a top actress from the word go. If you're a fan of hers, you'll like this. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Especially don't watch it if you know anything about chess. You will be frustrated and enraged. Did you know that experts call rooks "Castles"?
