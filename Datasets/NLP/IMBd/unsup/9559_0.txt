This is the best novela ever made in my opinion. It's unlike any other novelas i saw. All the characters have both bad and good sides. There isn't any character put in negative light, nor any epitome of greed and prejudice like in most SOs (especially Mexican ones). Because of this moral balance, the plot and the relationships seem credible and appeal to you. It also leaves the impression that the mastermind actually spent serious time after coming up with such issues fertile for reflection. The love triangle between the mother, daughter and Edu is one of them. Pedro in-between the three women is another situation that stays interesting and unpredictable. The acting is excellent. I guess it has something to do with the nationality of the protagonists. The Brazilians are warm people and I always enjoy seeing and hearing them talking. The set is also a big plus. Rio de Janeiro and the ranch are both superb sites (although Rio has it's problems with poverty and violence). Over-all an excellent series. Don't mind the soap-opera tag, something like this has never been done before and i doubt something to best it is to be done soon.
