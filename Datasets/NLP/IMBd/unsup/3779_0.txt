and you ever want to go to sleep again. I just saw this for the second time* and I wasn't going to watch because it scared me the first time. But...it's so well done that it just pulled me right in. And I sat there, this time knowing what was coming, and watched right to the very disturbing end. The lead actor Donnadieu and the supporting cast are all convincing in a very believable story. And the psychology behind the motivations of the various characters was well thought out and shown.<br /><br />Also, my heading may be a spoiler, I'm not quite sure, so I've indicated that just in case.<br /><br />*It was showing on IFC where they bill it as The Vanishing. There also seems to be a 1993 Hollywood remake.
