One of the more enjoyable 'fun' films I've seen in a while, Excess Baggage left me with a smile on my face. Del Toro seemed a little uncomfortable on screen, and it's always hard to see Harry Connick, Jr. trying to play a bad guy, but Silverstone was wonderfully bratty without overdoing it and Christopher Walken served up yet another delightful performance as the 'problem solver.'<br /><br />The scene in the garage/warehouse with all of the exotic stolen cars, the bad guys, and good ol' Ray (Walken) with a gun was simply priceless.<br /><br />Don't look for anything 'heavy' here. Just kick back, relax, and have some fun, and enjoy the film for what it is.
