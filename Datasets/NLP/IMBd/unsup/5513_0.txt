It started off like an action movie for a minute, then it goes back into time to the lead-characters youths.<br /><br />The beginning has got BRANDON HAMMOND (from SOUL FOOD the movie) and PERCY DAGGS III (from VERONICA MARS) and 2 other unknowns which are all pretty good.<br /><br />And YES I do enjoy the first 30 minutes where the characters are in their teens, even though it seems a little far-fetched how short time it takes for the boys to start killing the competition (I am not spoiling anything this is 20 minutes into the movie or something).<br /><br />Anyways after 30 minutes the guys are around 30 years old or something and wearing suits and all that business-like styled persona.<br /><br />And it just turns into this snooze-fest where there's hardly anything happening except for a big number of dialogs exchanged about "The Game", and the crews various ideas of how to play it and the threat of investigating police.<br /><br />You are suppose to believe that all 4 friends are bosses of one gang each, but there are no gang-members shown in the movie which makes it even less convincing.<br /><br />Also the acting from the "old" cast is so much worse than the "young" cast, I especially didn't like ALLEN PAYNE's character, perhaps it was because he looked like he needed to do number 2 on the bathroom half or all the time through-out the movie.<br /><br />I thought WILLIAM L JOHNSON playing old E.BONE was the only reason to keep watching, well that and I did pay money for the DVD so I had to continue for it to end at least.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes was reminiscent of BOYZ N THE HOOD (which of course is a good movie) but the rest 90 minutes was reminiscent of SUGAR HILL (Wesley Snipes) almost a copy of that movie actually but with a lot more twists and stuff.<br /><br />If you happened to like SUGAR HILL then you might like it, but I don't like neither.<br /><br />If you want a Hood-Movie there are plenty of better ones, such as: SNIPES, HUSTLE & FLOW, CLOCKERS, GET RICH OR DIE Trying, BABY BOY... the list could be long but I will stop there.<br /><br />3.5 out of 10
