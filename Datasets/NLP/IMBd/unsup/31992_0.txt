The acting was good, the plot seemed interesting, the directing and scenes were good, and the movie keeps your attention well. But in the end, the plot is horrible. You watch the whole movie trying to piece the multiple themes together; e.g. the murdered child, the bank robbery, her visions or premonitions, her marriage, the safety of her daughter etc. In the end, you simply learn that basically the whole movie was a hallucination. It's like the old episode of Dallas where the entire season was a dream. You feel cheated, especially if you were struggling to put the plots together. From a plot standpoint, it really does not take much skill to throw twelve random plots into the mix, and then in the end reconcile all the threads by saying that it was all imaginary. We watch Columbo or Monk intensely because we hope that in the end it will all come together; when it simply does not, we are robbed.
