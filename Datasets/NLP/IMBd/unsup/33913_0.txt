Altman should have hung them up right after making M*A*S*H. This movie is bad. The character development stinks, the plot is incoherent and humor is scarce. Paul Dooley - as always - puts in a great performance which is totally wasted in this scrap heap of a movie. What was Altman even attempting to say in this bowser is beyond me.
