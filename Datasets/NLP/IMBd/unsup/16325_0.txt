When I first watched this cartoon short ages ago, I was amazed by the film itself. Such a hilarious cartoon playing out to the tune of a classical song, there are few of.<br /><br />The story is that of a foreman, who is a lion, who "conducts" a group of human-like animal construction workers to build the tallest building, the Umpire State Building, a clear parody on the Empire State Building. While the animal workers strive to build this construction, hilarity quickly ensues in the form of the workers messing up each others' workings and a multitude of hilarious events which make this cartoon short well worth watching! I recommend it to all who enjoy a good musical parody.
