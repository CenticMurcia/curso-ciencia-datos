Get Real is an excellent work and I highly recommend it! The content/subject matter is absolutely timeless. Main characters display an extremely realistic perspective of teen reactions to the situations that face them. Of course, the British "humour" only adds to the overall flavor of this particular flick. Linda and her comments and driving lessons give the work a uplifting life goes on kind of feel. All of the characters were very well developed and actors carefully selected. As far as the "coming of age" and "coming to terms with one's sexuality" films are concerned, this one really captures a realistic view. I would highly recommend it to any teen male who is questioning his identity, as well as to parents, teachers, and other adults who work with teens. It is not in any way pedantic nor does it preach to any topic. It is simply a very well developed and realistic film.
