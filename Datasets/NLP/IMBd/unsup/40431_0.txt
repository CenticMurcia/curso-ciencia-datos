Before you choose to approve or disapprove of this comment, realize that I do not claim to speak for all men on the issue of fashion. All I can safely say in my introduction is that this show is hard evidence that the two genders really do show differences in the way we think! That out of the way, let's talk about What Not to Wear.<br /><br />When I first saw the show, I didn't really know what to expect. So I was rather surprised to see that virtually all of the participants were women. Figuring this just had something to do with ratings--after all, how many straight men routinely watch shows about fashion?--I decided to see just what all the hub-bub was about. And I almost liked the show, but there was one critical component that hit me very, very wrong: The $5000 gift card.<br /><br />To me, giving someone five grand to spend on nothing but clothes, sends women a message that there is nothing more important that a dollar can buy than a set of clothing--not her home, not provisions for her kids, not investment portfolios, not even food on the table. Now if they would give participants five HUNDRED dollar cards and had them buy the best clothes for the lowest cost, then I might understand. Perhaps they could teach the participant how to balance the need to maintain good finance with the desire to dress in good fashion. But no, they dish out the money like it grows on trees. Great lesson there. Not!<br /><br />Yes, this flaw completely does the show in. In a society that judges women almost entirely on how they look and very little on how they think, this show does nothing but enable that culture. If there are shows out there that praise the modern woman as intelligent, confident, and independent, What Not to Wear is not one of them.
