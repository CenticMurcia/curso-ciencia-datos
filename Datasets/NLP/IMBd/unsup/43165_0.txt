I didn't want to believe it but seeing is believing. The finale to the best show ever turned out to be crap. First of all at least half of the episode is wasted on talking about things we already know. The Mulder trial is unrealistic in every sense, it's childish and poorly executed. We learn nothing new. In non-trial scenes you have Mulder & Scully hugging each other all the time - the most unfortunate fact about this is the total destruction of Scully's character. She used to be strong, independent and smart - now she's depressed, whiny and helpless who can't do a single thing alone. Bringing CSM back felt a bit forced but William B. Davis saved a lot. And at least he had a few good lines.<br /><br />Mulder's quest for the truth turned into something childish and uninteresting during the past two seasons. That's the biggest mistake the writers did along with the fact that they destroyed Scully and what she used to stand for.<br /><br />Can't think of a worse way to end a show.
