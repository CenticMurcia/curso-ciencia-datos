This must rank among the worst documentaries ever made, and that's truly a shame. The subject could have been endlessly interesting, not because of the man himself, but because of the musical revolution he instigated. Sadly this doc largely leaves it up to Moog to tell the story, producing a diffuse, woefully inadequate film. The man is pleasant enough, and tells one or two amusing anecdotes, but he's terrible at explaining his inventions, and worse at contextualizing them. Interviews with the likes of Bernie Worrell and Money Mark are equally uninformative and uninteresting. Only Rick Wakeman was worth talking to. There's a lesson in here for doc makers-- you actually have to WRITE your film. You can't just slop together a bunch of interview footage, as is done here. (Oral history doesn't work unless the event revisited is familiar to all in most of its details.) This footage should have been placed into the hands of a good general-interest magazine writer and a decent film editor-- from this raw material they might have made a decent film. All in all, a really frustrating watch.
