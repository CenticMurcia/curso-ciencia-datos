I see a lot of movies and Viva is way out in front of the herd. Naked star-directors should be given extra points but Anna Biller has nothing to make up for. This woman is a major talent in a sea of lackluster Sundance-want-to-be's. Viva VIVA! The level of humor in this Seventies send-up is way beyond the average lowbrow laughs one might expect from your typical film comedy. Sexual mores are tossed about by the characters in this little shaggy dog script much like the original foot soldiers of the Sexual Revolution fell on those Seventies "naughty bits" that were exposed for the world to see. Viva's unrequited need to lose herself repeatedly in her healing bubble bath really had me stamping my feet and fighting back tears.
