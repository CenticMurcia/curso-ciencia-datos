When this was made, MGM was no longer making a serious effort to get Hedy Lamarr good roles. Though while the story isn't all that brilliant, Hedy's infinite loveliness and a few lightly amusing parts make this movie worthwhile. She's just impossibly gorgeous and a very warm presence throughout. And such a charming voice she had! Her and William Powell made a pretty good on-screen couple in this their second and final film together. He supplied most of the humor while she supplied all of the heavenliness. This movie certainly isn't a monumental classic, but it's quite entertaining.
