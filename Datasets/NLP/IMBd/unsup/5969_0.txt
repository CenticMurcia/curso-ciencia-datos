I have said, I don't how many times, that if the movie were exactly like the game, we would see one person walking around a mansion for an hour and a half and solving puzzles. And the complaints would roll in about how boring it was. This movie and it's sequel, were what inspired me to play the games. And since I have played all of them, at least part way through, so many scenes in these movies make more sense to me. I can see where the director got the ideas he used. Also, if you have played the games, you can see that elements from the games have been used.<br /><br />Movie - Game *Alice's "husband" Spencer - Spencer Family Mansion *Matt's sister Lisa - Lisa is a character from RE 1 *The dogs *The Hive and most of the action takes place under the Mansion - Under the Mansion is where we find out why the STARS members are in the house in the first place<br /><br />Granted, that's a small bit that I can think of, and yeah, Anderson could have had the original characters used, but if you saw the interview with him on the DVD, you would know that he said that he created the movie this way for people who had never played the game, but used things that the game fans were used to.<br /><br />Personally, I think the game series is awesome, and I can't believe that I had never played it before, but I thank Anderson for making this movie and bringing this series to my attention. It's easy enough for non-gamers to understand and enjoy; and there are plenty of game references for fans to see, even if some are not noticeable right away.<br /><br />P.S. - See this movie. And gamers, stop complaining so much. No adaptation is ever going to go the way we want it, and it just makes it harder for gamers to be taken seriously by non-gamers. Non-gamers already think we are losers. Let's not give them any reasons to think so.
