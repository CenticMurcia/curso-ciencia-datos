Never in my life have I watched a movie where I cared so little for the characters. Never in my life have I watched a movie where I guessed the ending so quickly (in the video store, looking at the cover!).

Please!<br /><br />1 star out of 5 and that is only because of Ren√©e Zellweger. She's just so darn cute ;o)
