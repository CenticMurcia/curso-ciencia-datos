What a wonderful movie, full of quiet passion. "The Widow of St. Pierre" is a beautful and haunting film that tells the story of a man committed to death on a small French fishing island that does not have a guillotine and how he learns to repent his crime and becomes a useful member of the community. the judge obsevers, "We committed a murderous brute and we're going to top a benefactor." There is another story of the marriage of Le Capitaine (Daniel Auteuil) and his wife Madam La (Juliette Binoche). Of their love and understanding for each other. The play between these two actors is something to see, they just look at each other and you can see their feelings for one another. She feels for the prisoner and her husband sympathizes with her feelings and understands her. The director Patrice Leconte has done an admirable job portraying the time, place and atmosphere. Emir Kusturica who plays Neel, the murderer, Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil all play their parts with a quiet understanding for their characters. I think this must be Juliette Binoche's best performance. This is a beautiful, disquieting movie and I highly recommend it to those who like an intelligent story, well told.
