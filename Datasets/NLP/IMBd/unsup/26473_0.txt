I think nobody else could have played the role of Richard Gere so good as himself. Richard Gere delivered again a great performance as in THE FLOCK. My wife liked RED CORNER a lot because of the romantic touch and the nice music. But I warn you that there are some slow paced scenes keeping anyway high the importance of this message to the audience. Perhaps the running time is a little bit too long. The story opened my eyes again very wide and showed me how the human rights in other countries as in China aren't respected. I hope that this situation will change very soon!<br /><br />Then I am impressed how many details were integrated in the sceneries to create a real Chinese atmosphere. I saw in a french TV magazine a documentation of the making of RED CORNER. In reality it was filmed in the Californian film studios.<br /><br />Final vote: 7.5/10.<br /><br />If you liked it I recommend you to see TEARS OF THE SUN or HOTEL RWANDA.
