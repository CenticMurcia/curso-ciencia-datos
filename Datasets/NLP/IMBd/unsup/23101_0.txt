Yes, I saw this movie long ago in a time when the Science Fiction channel was one of my favorite channels. The showed lots of violent anime, classic horror movies, Godzilla movies, and my favorite show Mystery Science Theater 3000. Now I virtually do not watch the channel at all, sometimes pausing to roll my eyes at their newest giant computer generated monster movie. When movies are compared to the film "Alien", most are unfairly criticized for copying that film. In fact other than it is a horror in space a lot of these films have very little else in common with that film. This one, however, is very comparable to that film and to that of the underwater film "Leviathan" which itself does a bit of copying of the film "Alien". This one even more so as it has a kind of android in it that turns against the crew. In fact, the title of the movie refers not to the creature, but rather the android which is in the shape of a cat. Basically, a creature is going on the attack fusing itself a bit with those it kills and then you have your characters that are your normal rag tag group including a couple with hidden agendas. Unlike a lot of animes I have seen this one is more like an American cartoon in that it has a rather short run time which hinders the plot a bit, but all in all it is a fast pace sort of horror in space anime.
