Witless, trendy twaddle and psycho-babble of the most annoying variety. This may well be the worst film ever made. It is difficult to believe that anyone has ever made it through this movie in one sitting. It is hard to decide which element of this film is the worst: the acting, which is stiff, yet glistening with the desperation of young, hungry actors trying to find meaning in this piece of dreck; the writing, in which the aching banality is broken up only by the sense of irritation that is the inevitable outcome of listening to the ill-considered opinions of dullards; or the cinematography, which is flat, insipid and unattractive.<br /><br />There are a few people involved with this film, such as David Cross and Maura Tierney, who have shown real talent in the past. One imagines they intensely regret their association with this piece of tripe.
