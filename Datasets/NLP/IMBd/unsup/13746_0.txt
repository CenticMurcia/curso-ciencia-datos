Whitesnake singer David Coverdale has received more than his share of criticism over the years for letting his band be a revolving door platform for talented musicians who come in for an album/tour, then ride off into the sunset only to be replaced on the next tour. Well I dare say that anyone who sees this performance by the 2004 Whitesnake lineup live in London will be thankful that Coverdale hand-picked this group for the tour and DVD. Lead Guitarist Doug Aldrich (fresh from his stint with Dio) shines on every riff and solo, combining technical skill with real heart and soul. Reb Beach (formerly of Winger) takes a back seat to Aldrich while capably handling the rhythm guitar duties here. Tommy Aldridge returns to remind us that he's still an 8-armed octopus on the drums, truly the master of the double-bass kick...and Coverdale himself can still go from a whisper to a scream with all the power, soul and technical accuracy you remember from 1987. He works harder than ever to prove that, at the age of 53, he's still one of hard rock's most dynamic front-men. The video and audio quality are superb here...a must see for any Whitesnake fan, Coverdale fan, Rock fan!
