I have seen a lot of bad movies. However, I suspect "Vulgar" was intentionally bad. The film plays like a drunk nihilistic comedy that demonstrates an absolute vile contempt for humanity and life in general.<br /><br />Brian O'Halloran is not a very talented actor and should especially steer clear of serious roles. Of course, "Vulgar" falls into that genre of "other". It tries to be a comedy, but there is no comedic value in rape, even if the raped is dressed as a transvestite clown.<br /><br />Everything about the film equates to "vulgarity". Its mixture of sexual violence with children's television shows, its poking fun at psychological anguish suffered by a son mentally abused by his mother, and its apathetic attitude towards murder and death.<br /><br />Films like "Vulgar" cause me to feel unclean, a filth that only the buffer of several days can rinse away. Even then, the film leaves a permanent residue.
