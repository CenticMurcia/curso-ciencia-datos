"Like Mother, Like Son" is a study in the degeneration of the potential of a child due to the influence of a narcissistic and soul sick parent. We have to believe that even if the son Kenny had exhibited some personality problems at an early age (I believe that initially he was as normal as any other kid), they need not be cemented into his character as they would eventually be under the misguidance of the psychopathic Sante. Sante is a master at manipulation, which to quote the Bible: "....is as the Sin of Witchcraft",bending husbands too, to her will. You wish that one of her unlucky lovers could have really cared enough about the sons to try to free them from her grasp. The elder son does eventually break free; it comes at a point where he is mature enough to discern that Sante's endless scheming guarantees that a productive life is impossible for anyone connected with her. Mary Tyler Moore has clearly shown us her true range as an actress here because in this film SHE IS Sante Kimes in all her ugly glory. Good acting all around in this disturbing film based on the real like Kimes and her unlucky, lost son.
