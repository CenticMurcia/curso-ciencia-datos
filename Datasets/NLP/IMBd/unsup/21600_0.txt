You would expect a little more effort from Fred Williamson, but this one just ain't happening. The fact that it looks like it was shot on someone's home video recorder doesn't bother me. That fact that Jim Brown, Jim Kelly, Richard Roundtree and Joe Spinell show up while the movie still sucks does. What went wrong? It starts off very good, with a real life karate match that was probably shot in Madison Square Garden. After that, it's all down the drain. As for the most absurd scene? A wounded Jim Kelly being taken to a hideout while a love song plays in the background. That song by R&B singer and keyboardist Rodney Franklin is the only highlight of the movie.<br /><br />Score, 2 out of 10 Stars
