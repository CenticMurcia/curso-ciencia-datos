For a movie I had never heard of, this movie was a very enjoyable surprise rental at the video store. There are hints of Pulp Fiction humour, a touch of low budget El Mariachi, nods to Lock, Stock or Snatch, and a real crappy Toyota station wagon. Considering the violence of the film, there is no real gore or blooded to be seen. Think of it as a crime caper comedy that doesn't take itself seriously. <br /><br />Some film students/critics may not love it, but ordinary people with open minds that enjoy a laugh with their crime caper will likely find it worth the time. It is reasonably polished for the reported $50K budget, throws in a twist or two, brings the laughs, and doesn't try to overwhelm you with it's "art".<br /><br />I bought a DVD copy and recommend it often. I am looking forward to what they do with the sequel when they have a few more dollars to play with.
