How Meryl Streep beat out Jessica Lange for the Best Actress in 1982 is beyond me. Once again, Streep pulls out one of her phony-baloney accents with the emotional range of a stuffed tortoise. What do people see in this claptrap? Stingo was well-cast, but as usual Kevin Kline was annoying, loud, pretentious, while eating the scenery. What is with this guy? <br /><br />The fact that this was even nominated shows how bad the Academy had slipped by the early 80's. Junk is junk. Streep and Kline are portrayed as intellectual fun-loving free spirits, when they're really just a couple of neurotic con artists. Forget this one! I gave this a 3 because of the cinematography and Stingo.
