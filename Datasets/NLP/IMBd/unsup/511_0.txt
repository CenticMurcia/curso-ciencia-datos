Hollywood suits should be forced to see STRICTLY BACKGROUND to understand the honor, pathos and love of craft as evidenced by the background players featured in this film.The film has humor, desperation and hope.You will grow close to these individuals through their honesty and determination.In many ways the film mirrors life. You try to find something that fits you and you do your best. But your fate is in the hands of the movie gods. They hire and fire and if you're lucky they promote you.This film is for everyone. You do not have to be a movie fan to enjoy the stories the film unfolds. As someone who has been an extra, director and producer I highly recommend STRICTLY BACKGROUND.
