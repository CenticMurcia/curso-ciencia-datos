Not good. This movie is not cool at all. I barely gave this a 4- rating. I was thinking maybe 2 or 3, but no. 4 is better because the first story was awesome, at least better than some episodes of Are You Afraid of the Dark?, unlike the rest of the stories. The first story actually had gore, which I didn't expect much of. Now, I'll tell you a little bit about the stories.<br /><br />The first one is OK. Unlike the others, I got into this one, and watched the whole thing without twiddling my thumbs, or eating out of bordism. If I rated this one individually, I'd give it a 6 with generosity. I thought this was cool how the old guy was getting pounded on, then broke that punk kid's arm, then destroyed the mess out of the kid's ear. After that, he was taken away and... OK, I'll stop there.<br /><br />The second story sucks. It's a 2 on my rating scale. A lot like the second story in Creepshow 2. I won't tell you about it, because I honestly didn't pay any attention. So get a move on.<br /><br />The third story is kinda cool. It seemed like an 80's horror film, and you know, some of those are the best horror movies. But for 2001? My thumbs are down. I hated this one in a way, but i also kinda liked it. Well, whatever, watch the movie and have your own opinion. All I know is that this movie wasn't that great, but what do you expect? It's based off a comic book!
