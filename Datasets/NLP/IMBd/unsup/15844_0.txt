Saw this at a festival last year, looking forward to its DVD release in '07. It's all about the struggle, really, and if you're an in-the-trenches, do it yourself indie filmmaker you'll absolutely appreciate it. But it's worth checking out even if you are NOT making films. The struggle to push through the odds and reach a goal is one every viewer can relate to, and the group of artists focused on is always entertaining to watch.<br /><br />The director focuses on several people in various stages of production in their low or lower-budgeted horror films, and speaks to some key industry folk(Tony Timpone from Fangoria, Sid Haig, Joe Bob Briggs, HG Lewis and others) for perspective. What's cool about this documentary is it has its own distinct personality, it tells its story clearly but with its own visual flourish that most docs don't even attempt. It's got a central vision and a warm heart that shines through it, it never goes off on tangents. I was into it from the great opening sequence where a young boy puts on his monster makeup and joins his friends in making their first creature epic in the backyard, with their little film cameras.<br /><br />American Movie fans will get to check out what Mark Borchardt has been up to since "Coven", and you'll see up and coming directors like Dave Gebroe sweat through a grueling day of shooting on "Zombie Honeymoon"(which turned out great). Very inspiring and worth checking out, looking forward to part II.
