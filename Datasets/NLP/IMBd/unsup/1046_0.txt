The problem with this movie for me, watching it with my 6-year-old daughter, was that this absolute jerk running the show clearly has no idea about what rock and roll is as I know it. It's about individuality, not conformity. It's about DIY, not this-foot-here-that-foot-there. I kept thinking about Dana Rohrabacher or some other such conservative jock-fascist chameleon, using their obvious rock/pop music knowledge to advance the most un-rockin' conformist agenda possible. Or Sonny Bono. Sure, there are those of you who think that musical rebellion knows no politics, but when you aren't at least a libertarian, when you're truly in the conservative jock headspace, your attitude and danger are as safe and salable as mayonnaise. Zappa would've known this asshole for what he is. A mean dick-head coach, whose only concern was that championship. Listening to this jackass put down '3-chord flannel' rock, I can only assume he meant Nirvana. A band whose converse he wouldn't be worthy to lick if they would have ever allowed anyone to lick their shoes.<br /><br />I still get my mailbox money from my music days--we had a lot of fun and I'll always be grateful for the recording and tours. But to see everything I love polluted down to a competitive sporting event--really turns my stomach. I said it years ago and I'll say it again now, "F*ck you, coach!"
