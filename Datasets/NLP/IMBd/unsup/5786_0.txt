it made me laugh and it made me cry. but it's strange.<br /><br />I started this documentary with a feeling of 'hey, I already saw this in the movie 'Titanic', so why must I watch this again? probably it will be exact the same story, but not so good as the original with Winslet and Dicaprio. why should someone make two times the same movie, or worse: why should a director want to make his first movie another time?' (I still haven't got an answer on that question) and I was right: it was boring and annoying as hell, I was eating my nails, it was a stupid documentary. but I wanted to watch it out, because some movies, as La Vita e Bella, are at their best in the ending. and I was right...<br /><br />the second part made me totally emotional, I even had to cry a little. it was so beautiful, documentary, movie and reenactments mixed with each other. it was sometimes tender too, so I had to laugh.<br /><br />I am a bit puzzled here, but I am going to give this movie 10 points. long live the Titanic!
