Even for someone who loves old movies as much as Tim Allen's character, the oh-so-not-threatening hit man Critical Jim, I have to emphatically pan this movie. Obviously trying to mimic the classics in film style / plot formation (Critical Jim actually breaks it down for you every 15 minute, in case you forget), the main difference between the painfully predictable plot of ...Cletis Tout and, say, Breakfast At Tiffany's is that at least in Breakfast..., the acting is decent, costumes are memorable, and you actually care what happens to the characters. The only benefit I derived from seeing this movie was the air conditioned theater during a heat wave, and I'm not sure that having 2 hours sucked out of my life was worth it.
