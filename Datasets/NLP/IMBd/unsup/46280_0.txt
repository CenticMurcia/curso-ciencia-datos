...and I don't think that I needed to. What I saw went nowhere. If "Nothing in Common" was supposed to be a jab at the corporate world, then it didn't work. If it was supposed to be a look at relationships, then it didn't work. If I had seen this when it first came out, then I would have thought it unfathomable that Tom Hanks would ever win even one Oscar, much less back-to-back Oscars. How could Garry Marshall, having created something so great with "Happy Days", create something so idiotic with "Nothing in Common"? As for Jackie Gleason, I heard that "The Honeymooners" was actually a rather cruel show, so it's not really any surprise that his role here is a piece of drudgery. And how could a magnificent actress like Eva Marie Saint get herself mixed up in this crap? The only reason that I stopped short of giving this movie just one star was the presence of Tom Hanks and Eva Marie Saint (plus Hector Elizondo), who can make almost any movie seem really good. But even here they have trouble doing that.<br /><br />Oh, and in case Eva Marie Saint is reading this: Happy Birthday, Eva! You were one of my grandfather's favorite customers in Superdrugs down in Los Angeles!
