Another light hearted romp from the 30's. Who doesn't like Cary Grant? This is an early glimpse into the comedic side of the Cary Grant we loved in so many films he made afterward. Miss Moore lights up the screen with her singing. Grace Moore was an opera star from the Met that found her way into film. She was nominated for Best Actress for her 1934 film "One Night of Love". Here an Australian opera singer needs to get to America but cannot get over the border and agrees to a plan. This movie has quite a bit of charm. I love the scenes of Mexico. One song in particular is a bit overdone but, all in all this is a nice romantic film. It may not be Shakespeare but it's a lot of fun.
