This movie looks like a bunch of comic book artists decided to make an animated feature, but without bothering to learn how to animate first. It's just a series of junkily animated shorts (adapted from good comic books) held together by a nonsense frame story. Each short is either poorly animated, completely boring, or both. By the end, you won't understand the plot and you probably won't care to.<br /><br />If you're really desperate, you could probably squeeze a little entertainment out of this movie, but you're likely to have more fun taking a nap.
