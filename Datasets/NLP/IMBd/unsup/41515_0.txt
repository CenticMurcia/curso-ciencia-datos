I don't know if it was the hand-held video feel to the movie or it's pointless droning on, but this was horrible.<br /><br />******************SPOILERS*********************(If you care.)**********<br /><br />Watch out people because as we speak, the K-17 virus may actually exist...<br /><br />this is the knowledge they start you off with so you'll feel like the plot could be possible... riiiight. What's with the Aussies and the synthesizers? This film was made in 2002 and yet it contains an almost porno soundtrack. I think they actually spent the whole budget on the title sequence, where everybody's credit came before the title. Too many thoughts to organize them properly, but here goes: humans have developed an immunity to vampire bites so they can't reproduce, in fact just breathing our air may kill them, which is why the few remaining vampires have a 4-stage air filtration system in their lair. Scary. These vampires also don't want their food source (humans, apparently they never thought of raising pigs, or cows) dying off from aids. So they get Michael Dorn, don't forget the name because they say it like 5000 times during the movie, to create a vaccine to cure HIV, but it also turns the subject into a vampire?? It makes just as much sense as an airline pilot being afraid of heights. Throw in an unresolved sub-plot featuring a renegade vampire killing humans, a guy trying to be a crazy Texan, an unresolved issue with Michael Dorn's sword(?), his dead wife, his amazing tactile skills, (apparently he can come up with an idea and then just make it)some badly casted parts, a 5 minute speech to cure insomnia and you've got yourself a blockbuster... in Melbourne, Australia.
