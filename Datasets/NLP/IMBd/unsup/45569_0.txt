Well, I'm sure within seven days I'll forget the fact that I've even seen this film. The actors are awful (even Dylan Walsh), the script is written by primary school students, the action scenes and visual effects are laughable (with extensive use of stock footages) and yes, the story. I don't see any single point in the whole storyline that has a minute trace of originality. There are numerous clich√©s and predicted sequences.<br /><br />The film would be worth watching if there could be some Erica Eleniak nudity... seriously. Otherwise I don't see why one should watch this type of films anymore.
