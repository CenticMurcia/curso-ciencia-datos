In the past few years i have rarely done reviews of films or TV on here for one simple reason, abuse, abuse from people who think you are wrong or are thinking you have been unfair on something they love/hate and i grew sick of it. BUT and it is a big BUT i decided for something this special i had to pull my head out of the sand, tonight i watched the season finale and i have to say i had my eye on the clock out of fear of when it would end.<br /><br />This show has brought me nothing but happiness from the first episode to the last. Every character is written and cast to perfection, every shot is done brilliantly, ever episode is funny, clever and most of all enjoyable and will keep you baited until the next week.<br /><br />In essence this is probably the greatest import from America i have seen in recent years. Now don't get me wrong, i love Friends/the Simpson's/family guy/Scrubs/South park/dirty sexy money/pushing daisies/west wing etcetc<br /><br />but nothing quite compares to the originality or catch of this, certainly it is probably the best show i have seen in years in terms of enjoyment<br /><br />the only negative thing i can dare say about it is the fact the first series is over<br /><br />long live reaper!<br /><br />for those that haven't seen it, it is truly a gem to behold, for those that have and arnt obsessed with it, shame on you!<br /><br />i love this program so much. If you have a complaint with what i've said, go ahead and complain to me, i really don't care anymore, this show is too good to miss out on or miss the chance to explain how unbelievably good it is, so all you nay-sayers do your worst, this show is near perfection and i am more than happy to admit it. I rated it 10 out of 10 on here for a good reason and i stand by that decision completely.
