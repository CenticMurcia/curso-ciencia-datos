The only saving grace (grimace) is that it came before The Core. With much the same basic plot and science but with more "famous" actors and a bigger budget. Similarities: Laser Gatling gun performing the drilling. The core spinning and trying to start/stop it with nuclear bombs, Hero is a scientist, Crew are scientists and mechanics, (Delroy Lindo and Will Wheaton), practically, and they go to the core by digging a hole with: a self-propelled vehicle. The Core was much better done with better special effects while Depp Core looked like it was made on a long weekend in the American southwest. The flames of the oil well, being put out during the beginning of the movie, keep flaming even after it is supposedly put out. This seems to be a premonition of how their endeavors become in making a movie, and saving mankind: another fizzle.
