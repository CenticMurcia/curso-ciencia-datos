The hairdresser, wife and mother Cynthia Kellogg (Demi Moore) is in an interrogation room in a police department being questioned by the experienced detective John Woods (Harvey Keitel) and his partner. Through flashbacks, she reveals how her best friend and colleague Joyce Urbanski (Glenne Headly) married the scum and nasty James Urbanski (Bruce Willis); how hard Joyce's life with James was; and why Joyce became a criminal. The smart detective finds some questionable points in her statement and presses Cynthia, trying to disclose the truth. Yesterday I saw "Mortal Thoughts" for the second time. In the 90's, when I watched this movie for the first time, I was very impressed with such a tight screenplay and outstanding performances of the cast, and I decided to "recheck" my first impression. Indeed it is a great low budget thriller, almost theatrical and having a story with no flaws. Bruce Willis has a very different participation, in the role of a disgusting drug addicted, and proves that he is a good actor. Harvey Keitel in the role of an astute detective, finding the controversies in the testimony of Cynthia, is amazing. Demi Moore has also an inspired acting, in the role of a mother in a dilemma between telling a secret and hiding the truth. And Glenne Headly is also great, in the role of an abused and very unsecured low class woman. Even seeing this movie for the second time, it is very worthwhile and recommended. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Pensamentos Mortais" ("Mortal Thoughts")
