WHOA-HO-HO-HOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHOA-HO-HO-HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Everybody was Kung Fu fighting'. Those cats were fast as lightning. Though it was a little bit frightening..... Man this movie was off the wall! I mean I would have to sing this Carl Douglas song to show my appreciation to "Kung Fu Hustle". The choreography was outstanding, the plot was magnificent, and the characters were out of sight. It's like part-Matrix, part-Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", part-Looney Toons, and all the slapsticks you can get out of this movie. I just laughed my head off when I laid eyes on it. Stephen Chow really did his thing here in this movie. He laid the plans down flat and BAM! A terrific hit! Playing this wannabe member of the "Axe Gang" would be the ticket for him, Nope! The Landlady(Qiu Yuen) would be the person I could just pop her in the mouth. But Pig Sty Alley isn't as bad as the "Axe Gang" thought it would be. Having Sing(Chow) set the fireworks on the gang would be bad enough, his fat sidekick wannabe was even worse. He stabs him, dump snakes on him, and worse yet, annoys Sing all the time. And for the Landlord and Lady, they would be experts in Kung Fu. I was surprised when the Landlady had the power of the Lion's Roar. No one could ever withstand that might. Even the Beast could stand up to that, except when the bell was used as a speaker. Hey! There were no speakers in the 1940's were they? Sing wises up after the beating he endured and I think he should have been more wary of con men, when he was younger. I think he should have been giving a big bop in a few areas. This movie was indeed a lot of fun and it very well made. This would put Jackie Chan's movies to shame, Forgive me Jackie, but this movie is great for all martial arts buffs in the world. WARNING: This movie is not for people with weak bladders. And call 911 IF YOUR SIDES SPLIT. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RATING 5 STARS!
