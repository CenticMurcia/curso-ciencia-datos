Or so says the leading man in the film at one point. Sadly, he's wrong. This might have made a middling 30 minute episode of some TV series like 'Tales from the Darkside,' but doesn't cut it as a full length film. Other reviewers say the ending was the best thing about this but if you'd seen or read a number of horror/mystery films/stories, you can pretty much guess what's going to happen.<br /><br />Still, it's OK in it's own way if your expectations are set suitably low and the idea itself is reasonable. A murder in the past continues into the present.<br /><br />They didn't push the boat out with the special effects though, the journey into the past of the 1940's is portrayed by the radio playing old songs and war news, a newspaper will a war headline and a vehicle from the period. Well...that would convince anyone they'd gone through a time warp....er....perhaps not.
