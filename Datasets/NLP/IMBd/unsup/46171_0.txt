The film portrays violence, low-lifes, and foul mouths that the writers, actors, directors, producers, etc have never once in their lives experienced. It is not entertaining! It lacks both a moral and morals. It is not a film reflecting life. It has no redeeming qualities. It is nothing more than a poorly made film that gives those involved a chance to show gory scenes, unrealistic dialogue, a glimpse of a nude woman in a lewd act (lewd when shown in public) and does very little to connect to the audience. I always love it when a bunch of really bad dudes fire 1000's of rounds of ammo to hit someone a couple of times. Film makers should be required to take a course in the actual use and effect of weapons. I rented the film because it has Ving Rhames name on it. I will not rent another that he is featured in. The next thing you know he will be playing some bald white guy sucking on a lollipop.
