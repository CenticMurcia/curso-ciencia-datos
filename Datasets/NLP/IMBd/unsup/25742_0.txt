Maxwell Bright hates women, but he hates himself even more. He destroys his business, his credit rating, his home and his friendships. Even his body falls apart, seemingly under the great cosmic weight of his hatred. And yet: this movie isn't about loathing; it's about forgiving. Yes, Maxwell is repulsive. But he holds a paradigmatic, redemptive trump card: somebody loves him. If Mai Ling can forgive him, honor him, love him -- then so can we. And ultimately, so can Maxwell himself -- which is precisely what sets him free. <br /><br />I enjoyed the naked shakiness of this movie. Performances by Patrick Warburton, Marie Matiko and Eric Roberts were especially textured and compelling. See this movie. It will test your powers of forgiveness, and you'll be better for it.
