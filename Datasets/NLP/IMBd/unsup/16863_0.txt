I envy anyone seeing this for the first time; I was young when I first saw it and was quite entertained, but couldn't get the most out of it.<br /><br />Now I've watched it many times and realize the masterful integration of plot, setting, characters, sound, scene, pace, etc. that make it a great flick.<br /><br />The Criterion DVD is very nice (should be, at that price), especially the original Graham Greene story and his comments.
