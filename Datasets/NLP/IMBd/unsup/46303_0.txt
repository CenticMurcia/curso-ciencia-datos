When I first heard the idea behind this "urban operetta" or whatever it's supposed to be, I accepted it. I figured R. Kelly was going to try to basically create a sort of R&B "Tommy". But no such luck. Instead, we get a production so ridiculous it would have Ed Wood rolling on the floor laughing.<br /><br />The beat never changes, and it's a pretty lousy beat to start with. It's full of awful forced rhymes that make you long for the Seussian. The story begins coherently, but falls into complete nonsense before then end. Laughably bad, but then again, it does make you laugh.<br /><br />The only thing redeeming about this steaming pile is to use it as a drinking game. Every time someone pulls out a gun...
