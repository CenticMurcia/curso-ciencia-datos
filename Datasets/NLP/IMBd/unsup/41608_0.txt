I seriously doubt that,at the age of 66,I fall within the audience - range that "Kevin and Perry go large" was intended for.However I am an admirer of Mr H.Enfield and Mr P.Whitehouse and enjoyed "Harry Enfield and friends" and "The Fast Show",precursors of the dreadful "Little Britain".Sacrilegious though it may be I prefer Messrs Enfield and Whitehouse to those appallingly over - rated Pythons and I sincerely hope that they do not fall into the trap Cleese and co. failed to avoid i.e.endlessly re - cycling the same old stuff with only the names changed to protect the Swiss bank accounts.With "K & P" the signs were not good,but seven years down the line it remains the sole attempt by Mr E and Mr W to squeeze a few more bob out of their former TV audiences and I applaud them for their restraint. I am disqualified through reasons of age and culture to comment on the Ibiza music phenomenon,the raising to sainthood of disc jockeys,and the apparent ambition of every teenage boy to become one.I do understand - in the form of a distant memory - the urge to procreate that overcomes one at the age of fifteen to the extent that little else is of any consequence.Thus Kevin and Perry exist in an almost permanent state of priapism,their whole object being to divest themselves of their virginity at the first available opportunity.This can be - indeed is - amusing for five minutes but all too quickly palls.There are some gags that actually improve with repetition but unfortunately "Kevin and Perry go large" doesn't actually have any of them. It does have TV performers like Mr J.Fleet doing their overfamiliar schtick,it has the ridiculously over - rated Mr R.Ifans and that cockney geezer from "Eastenders" who has his chance and loses it . For its intended audience - presumably adolescents obsessed with pimples and sex - it will no doubt hit the spot - if you will pardon the pun; anybody in full possession of all their bodily hair and whom the word "spunk" does not cause to crease up with laughter may not find it to their taste.
