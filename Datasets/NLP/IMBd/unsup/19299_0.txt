I watched "Bin ich sch√∂n?", because quite a few people told me it was so beautiful, poetic etc. So I rented it, with high expectations, whether it was a French piece of art or an American blockbuster (both can be great). I've never been more disappointed. After almost two hours of rather incoherent snippets of stories I was waiting for the surprise ending, connecting all the pieces, leaving me with a message: "Don't date", or "Don't like rain? Go to Spain", I don't know. But finally the credits appear and nothing is explained. Some say "it's an open ending!", "the connection is the incoherence!" - but I just feel two hours of my life gone forever. Maybe I didn't get it, because the acting is as terrible as always in German productions or the screenplay was just lousily written out. A second star for some nice shots of Spain and tolerable music.
