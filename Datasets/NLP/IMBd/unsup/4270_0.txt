I've read some posts, I didn't have time to read them all, and I did have some questions, but after writing them down, I've made my thoughts on how this story makes sense.<br /><br />It's a man who dies, and his spirit runs through the scenarios that could of prevented his death, but his ego, spared relevant memories to realize the consequences of escaping his own death, leads the ego to act in order of what actually happened, and this could be said to be in spite of the true nature of his spirit, leaving the spirit to accept that death is the order the ego would take over living, since living with the consequences of escaping death would not satisfy the ego. This can be demonstrated through his struggle to make things right, his struggle to resolve the dissonance of his morality versus his will to live.<br /><br />If this were the intended interpretation, theoretically, what the spirit chooses becomes the choice made by the ego, and this only being realized by the spirit after manifesting the ego in all possibilities. It would seem that the spirit would manifest an ego to learn the ego.<br /><br />It's also interesting to consider that a spirits ego may be capable of realizing its spirit, and maybe it was meant to realize more than just that, maybe it was meant to realize itself as the spirits instrument to experiencing a projection of individuation, which would further assume that the spirit is singular, and this would align with what could be considered as god, or maybe it's just something that couldn't otherwise be explained as the answer to life due to the bounds of our existence.<br /><br />I liked this movie, I give it a 9 in concept, but a 7 in execution due to the lack in originality employed by the director. There are too many clich√© story telling techniques to prevent me from knowing what I maybe should have not known in certain parts of the film.
