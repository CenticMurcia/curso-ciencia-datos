The Jerry Springer show was the tin standard for all these years, but now along comes MY SUPER SWEET 16 to sink lower into the primordial muck of TV.<br /><br />Where to begin? 15-year-olds want sweet 16 parties. Fair enough. And most parents are happy to throw nice parties for their kids. But these are parents and kids from hell. The parents allow unbelievable rudeness by their spawns of the devil, yet lavish these monsters with clothes, cars, etc. that no 16-year-old deserves. Clearly, the parents are paying to be on TV, not realizing that they are not seen as "cool" but as pathetic. I would not do business with these people, and hopefully others won't as well.<br /><br />Most of these kids need a swift kick in the butt. They too play to the cameras, and embarrass themselves in the process. Their friends seem equally obnoxious. If this is America's future, maybe we would be better off under the Taliban.<br /><br />Enjoy your 15-minutes of fame. No one remembers you, other than as the "fat one" or the "loud one." Enjoy the cars because you have little chance of becoming employable. And mom and dad - be proud. Your little monsters will turn out as gluttonous and useless as you are.
