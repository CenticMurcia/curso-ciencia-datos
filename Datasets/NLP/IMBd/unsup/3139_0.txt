"Young Sherlock Holmes" has the potential to be an interesting film but unfortunately seems to be marred in contrived cliches. I did not find any of the characters to be particularly interesting, nor did I appreciate its stereotypical and racist demonizing of middle Eastern culture - as if Egyptian women really behave or look like that! At times, I thought I was watching a series of bad Monty Python sketches.<br /><br />All in all, the acting was reasonably good (except for the scenery chewing villains) and the costumes were great, but I had a hard time staying awake while watching this film. The ending was particularly inane...obviously designed to lead into a sequel, which thankfully never came about. Strictly a movie for little kids or for people who like watching dated special effects.
