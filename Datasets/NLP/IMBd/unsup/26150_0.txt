I felt really sorry for John Abraham in this film. He proved to us all that try as you may, but even being that sexy can't save you when you've gone down the wrong path. Karam is the story of a man (played by Abraham) who kills others for a living and is told in second-person retrospect by his wife (played by Priyanka Chopra) and painfully so. From the minute this film begins, you know that Abraham's character is doomed. When you find out that he's attached to Priyanka Chopra in the film, you just have to know by then that they are star-crossed lovers. Abraham tries to quit the hit-man business after a hit gone awry but finds out the hard way that quitting the underworld is not as easy as it may seem. His pregnant wife is kidnapped, tortured and eventually held captive while the mob demand one last hit from Abraham which involves him taking out a host of people. This hit is the majority of the film and you can only imagine what becomes of him when the job is done. Karam is a very thought provoking and sad film that was very well executed on the part of all the actors. I hated the drug use scenes though because they were a bit too graphic. Abraham looks even more sexy than he usually does in this film and when he is beside Chopra, the screen just begins to melt from their combined hotness. Hahaha! :-D The songs are as excellent as they are haunting. A truly wonderfully tale of love, ambition and loss.
