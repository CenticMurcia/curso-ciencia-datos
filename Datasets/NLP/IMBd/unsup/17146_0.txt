This movie tale brings to life the classic story in a way that makes it the best retelling of it I've ever seen. Music, a handsome wolf, and a depth of plot that is hardly ever seen in a story that was once so basic.<br /><br />There are a bunch of great songs in this movie: <br /><br />So good at being bad <br /><br />You should never talk to strangers <br /><br />Blue in the green <br /><br />You won't be there in the morning <br /><br />The man without a heart <br /><br />My favorite quote:<br /><br />"King: You don't love anything, do you? <br /><br />Dagger: I love hunting with the pack under a full moon..I love a romantic dinner by candlelight..The two don't seem to go together do they?<br /><br />
