Unlike the first (great) and the fourth (bad) this movie falls squarely in between somewhere. After apparently being retrieved from Andy's mom's fireplace, a greedy play pal's company orders the pint-sized serial killer rebuilt to salvage the corporation's understandably faltering Pr image. Once reborn, Chucky decides to track down Andy and pickup where he left off. <br /><br />Andy is sent to a foster home that looks like the parents rake in billions taking care of foster kids. Given their young age, and the realities of foster parent payment, one can only guess how they got the perfect house that Barbie must have built. It's difficult to pinpoint how many rooms this thing has, but it must dwarf the white house for space, and is too sterile and quiet for a child's haven. <br /><br />Kyle, a perpetual foster kid, is Andy's new sidekick in the film. She is a streetwise young woman who does not take any garbage from anybody and ultimately helps Andy destroy Chucky.<br /><br />Another problem I had with the film stems from the domineering teacher. I never thought I would say this (and please note, I am not endorsing school violence in anyway) but congrats to Chucky for taking out Ms. Kettlewell after she completely humiliated Andy in the classroom in front of his peers. Granted, there is an inconsistency because the whole mess started with Chucky writing bad words on Andy's paper about the teacher, but she was just so unlikeable to begin with.
