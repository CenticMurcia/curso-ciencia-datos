So there I was, standing in best buy with four DVDs in my hand trying to figure out which 'Grindhouse' double feature I'd buy. I looked on the back and was interested in the story of 'Prime Evil'. Sure enough, I bought the sucker. I got home and immediately put the DVD in to start watching. The first feature film 'Don't Answer The Phone' was awesome. A pure slasher flick with loads of nudity and gore. When 'Prime Evil'started, I was pleased. But by the end of the film, I was questioning why this movie was even considered to be part of the 'Grindhouse' dvds. There's little to no blood and the story d r a g g e d on and on until the 'climatic' end. BTW, the end is ANYTHING but climatic. I ~*~LOVE~*~ cheesy b-movies, but this one was so bad, its horrible.
