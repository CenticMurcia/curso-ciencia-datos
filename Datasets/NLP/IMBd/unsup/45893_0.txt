This movie was terrible.<br /><br />I was more than a little tempted to just get up and walk out early in the movie, when it just wasn't funny. I thought maybe it would pick up and really get going soon, it didn't. It tries to be a romantic comedy, and what little chemistry exists between the couple is ruined by Robin Williams trying to be funny while doing unfunny things. Instead he comes off as a creepy, sadistic voyeur with a phony veneer of humor (and a minister having a prepubescent boy sidekick with him at apparently all times day and night is more than a little creepy in it's own right).<br /><br />There isn't a single funny joke in the film that's not in the trailer, not one. There are a lot of gags that fall flat though.<br /><br />The whole thing made me miss the time when Robin Williams in a movie was a sign it was going to be a great film.<br /><br />In retrospect, I should have gone with my hunch and just walked out early, and saved myself the time.
