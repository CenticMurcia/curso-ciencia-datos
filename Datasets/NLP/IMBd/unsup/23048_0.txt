I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The story, although predictable, is interesting enough to keep one's attention. This is good wholesome entertainment, something you aren't afraid to let the kids watch. These types of movies tend to be few and far between. But we must remember that this is a made-for-TV movie, and therefore, it is unfair to compare it to classical holiday theatrical releases such as It's a Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street. Nevertheless, it is a good Christmas story that bears repeat viewing.<br /><br />Neil Patrick Harris is the main reason this is a good movie. He tackles the rather lackluster script, bringing life to the whole film. He also out acts his poor supporting cast. One notable exception is Beverly Archer as the loyal employee Mrs Cook, who doesn't like Harris's plans for his grandfather's business. Harris, however, has obviously matured - in more ways than one - since his days as Doogie Howser. He brings a depth to his character, that is lacking in so many TV movies. I can only hope he will take his talent to the big screen more often in the future. Harris proves that not all child stars have to pass by the wayside the minute they reached adulthood.<br /><br />The combination of Harris' commanding performance and his urgency to find out the identity of the mysterious woman his grandfather visited every Christmas Eve, make the movie enjoyable. Perhaps it is a bit overly sentimental, but after all it is a Christmas story.
