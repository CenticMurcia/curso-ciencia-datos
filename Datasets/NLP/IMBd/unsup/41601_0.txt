I've always considered myself as a big fan of British comedy but then comes this movie to tear my illusions asunder. This inane, tasteless movie is aimed at nervous teenagers with bad acne, no hobbies or friends whatsoever and palms that are so hairy they need to comb them. So if you don't fit into that category you can stop you're reading right here and forget that this movie ever existed. OK? <br /><br />Really, this movie makes "Scary Movie" look like "The quest for the holy grail", it's way of trying to bring forth laughters are at best annoying and at worst really offending. Acting is below substandard, humor is absent in every scene and the script should have been burned after the first reading, after the scriptwriters had been shot that is.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.<br /><br />1/10
