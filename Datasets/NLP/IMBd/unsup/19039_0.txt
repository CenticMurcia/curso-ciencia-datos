"Serial Mom" is a lovely little film about the picture perfect world known as suburbia. Whatever! "Serial Mom" is all about a crazy mother who knocks off anyone who messes with her or her family. Kathleen Turner is wonderful in the title role playing this psycho-mom with such zest that you know she is having alot of fun playing in this movie. Also notable are Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard as the children, Misty and Chip. (It's interesting to see Mr. Lillard pre-"Scream", he wasn't always nuts). Watch this one when you want to turn off your brain for a couple of hours and just have fun. Oh yeah, Traci Lords has a cameo (this is the second movie I've seen in as many weeks with a Traci Lords cameo...). Love it. 7/10
