Bleeder is in all terms a masterpiece.<br /><br />It bites. It bites the viewer throughout. Covering the lives of a group of young Danes it touches you adherently.<br /><br />It`s raw and it`s alive.<br /><br />Subtle yet violent, it gently and beautifully says a million things in single frames, single dialog, single sounds and visions.<br /><br />Be warned; Bleeder is explosive and even gory in parts, but never unjustified. More importantly it is funny and warm and heartfelt - you`d be a lying fool if you can`t somewhat identify with some of the characters or some of the situations.<br /><br />Or be moved by the sheer power and heartbeat of the director and the portrayels of frustration, trauma, loneliness, friendship, stupidity and love.<br /><br />Well done.<br /><br />And no ... this is NOT a "Pusher 2" ... this is something altogether better, richer and wiser.<br /><br />It`s pure movie magic.<br /><br />Here`s to Lenny and Leo, Lea and Louise.
