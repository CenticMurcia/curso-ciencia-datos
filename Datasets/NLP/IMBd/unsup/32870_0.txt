Very disappointed. All star cast yet a let down. The plot drags on and on at a very slow mosey. Very little action for a western. Definitely not to the caliber of tombstone or unforgiven...having had to watch this is unforgivable. Very slow story line there was a slight yet predictable plot twist. Hopefully you are still awake by this time. A few one liners for a chuckle. Some very interesting characters are introduced played by some extraordinary actors and actress. Sadly these follow the same style as the dull plot line and there characters never really explode to life. Several times you feel like you are watching amateurs reading off a cue card in the back ground. Like a piece of tumbleweed blowing through this thing goes on and on collecting dust along the way. There never is any real wow in this movie. Save both your time and money and see the two previously mentioned.
