I've been a fan of the comic series for a number of years, and was delighted to see the treatment given to the X-Men. <br /><br />The film has just the right blend of action and drama to keep you glued to the screen, and the large numbers of students glimpsed in the Mansion are sure to keep folks on the net identifying them for months. Well worth your money even at full price. The only negative comment I would have is that it runs a bit short at circa 90 minutes. <br /><br />Next time let's get a full two hours worth of the Dark Phoenix Saga...!
