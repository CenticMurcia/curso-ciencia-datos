I thought that this movie was amazing. I felt as though it went above and beyond typical surreal movies. To apply such ideas as dreams and to follow forward with this is genius. When watching this film, I felt as though I was actually dreaming. It was amazing to start a story and just as it was about to get very interesting it would transfer to another story. Though, somehow you would keep wanting to watch the movie to see what happens next. I thought that my favorite skit was the one with the toilets in the dinning room. I thought this was hilarious that the director would show this to mock the norms of society. It really allowed your mind to wonder to think what else people just accept as normal and what people feel is unnecessary.
