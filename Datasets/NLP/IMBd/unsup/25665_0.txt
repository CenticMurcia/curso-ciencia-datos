Coneheads<br /><br />Wow! What an all star ensemble cast! Michael Richards and Jason Alexander in the same movie! Dan Ayckroyd making all the right moves in the lead role as a no-nonsense, old school pater familias! Chris Farley, as a car mechanic-cum-Romeo, David Spade as the proverbial suck-up and Adam Sandler in a cameo as a small time crook are perfectly cast and effortlessly deliver a tight performance. It's a Saturday Night dream come true! The story of two coneheaded aliens who later triple knits together with a coherence lacking from most films belonging to the derided sub-genre of dysfunctional earth invaders. Life on earth must surely be as surprising to those aliens up there, as are the habits of these adorable coneheads to the amused viewer: Prymaat (Jane Curtin) avoiding any intermediaries and using her mouth to vacuum those dirty rugs, Beldar (Dan Ayckroyd) using condoms as chewing gums (their eating habits in general build up to a whole cluster of gags that seldom if ever fall flat) Connie's (Michelle Burke) way of kissing and so on. In fact, the most reliable source of amusement is the pretentious-sounding conespeak (and the additional paraphernalia of gnarls, hisses and snores that accompany their emotions) employed by Beldar and Prymaat to express their wisdom and interact with inferior humans. It's on a par with the cavespeak in another wonderful comedy of the same ilk called Caveman. Example: Beldar : - If everyone jumped into a bituminous cauldron would you jump in too? Connie- I am not a little cone anymore, dad. Beldar Â– Maintain low tones with me, maintain low tones.<br /><br />The dialogue is so inspired is almost reaches a tarantinoesque level, kept to a necessary minimum, with a lack of the non-sequiturs common to the genre. Another key to the success of this movie are the endearing characters. This is one of the quirkiest ensemble-casts ever to appear in an eighties-type comedy. Recommended for repeated viewings.
