I LOVE Spaceballs, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. But this show is awful! I've only seen 2 episodes but have no desire to see any more as I can't imagine them being any better.<br /><br />The animation is cheap (flash?)and terrible. I'm not trying to be a prude, but the way every single woman in this series is drawn is disgusting. They're chests are vamped up and jiggling at all times. This is fine I suppose for the triplet "bimbos" that hang out with President Skroob, but they also draw the main female character (Princess Vespa) in the same way. When did her chest look like that in the movie? Oh yeah that's right, it didn't.<br /><br />Dark Helmet is not funny AT ALL and looks like a windup toy from a Happy Meal. I know Rick Moranis is short, but come on now!! Lonestar is by far boring and useless and it seems the writers weren't sure what to do with him.<br /><br />When was Barf all gross all the time? I lost track on how many times he burps, farts, or does #2. His character in the movie didn't even do any of these things not once and was funny. Why resort to the cheap potty humor now? It isn't even funny at all and quickly grosses you out.<br /><br />The ONLY good things are President Skroob, Yogurt and Dot Matrix. They're not very funny, but are drawn to resemble their characters and are voiced by the same actors. (Yeah I know Daphne Zuniga does Princess Vespa, but it neither looks nor sounds like her so I don't count it.) I DVR'd the 2 episodes I saw. ("Druidian Idol, "SpiderMawg") And as i'm sure most of you are already aware, when you DVR something, you have the luxury of fast forwarding the commercials, credits, etc. Even with this added bonus I still found myself checking to see how much time was left in each of these 30 minute episodes. It seemed like an hour had passed when in reality it had only been about ten minutes. That's how awful and dragging this show is.<br /><br />Shame on you Mel Brooks for green lighting this mess and for participating.
