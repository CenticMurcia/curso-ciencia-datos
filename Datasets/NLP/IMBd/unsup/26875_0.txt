I saw a great review of this film a couple of weeks ago when it played in Portland and I thought I would give the film a go... I was a little put off when I heard the director's name was Rusty Nails - a bit odd - but it didn't take long for the film to drag me into a very strange and creepy otherworld that unfortunately looked very much like the America we live in today. I'm a bit of a music fan and I really loved the Devo and Dead Kennedys songs as well as the original 50's style score. The film really defies any kind of categorizing... it's a mixture of many genres - comedy, film noir, horror, science fiction and something all of itself - which was refreshing because the film defied expectations. It's not often that a movie can hold down so many styles for such a small budget... the director (who was quite nice and intelligent) was there and mentioned that the film cost a mere $18,000. I can believe that he made this film for that little money - shot on film - fantastic. This film isn't for everyone - it does get a bit gross - which I loved - but you may not - though it isn't quite as gross as listening to a George W. Bush speech. I hear Rusty is currently doing something with George Romero (Land of the Dead) - that should be interesting.
