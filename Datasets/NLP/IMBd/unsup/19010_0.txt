In 1945, Val Lewton produced a wonderfully creepy film starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi (THE BODY SNATCHER). It was based on a Robert Louis Stevenson novel which was a fictional story based on real-life serial killers, William Burke and William Hare, who were WAAAY over-zealous in procuring corpses for the local medical school in Edinburgh. Apparently they didn't bother waiting until the people died in order to make a few pounds--often suffocating their hapless victims!! <br /><br />Years later, in 1960, another variation of the William Burke and William Hare story came to the theaters, but this one (starring Peter Cushing) was not based on the Stevenson novel but the actual crimes. While the Lewton movie was marvelous and horrifying, this one seems worth seeing as well because it is more realistic and unflinching (with some very brutal murders), plus it sticks much closer to the facts and mirrors the real decisions in the courts. Although whether or not Hare was blinded is a popular account that was never confirmed, this make for a cool inclusion in the film. Plus, I was really impressed by Peter Cushing's performance as a surgeon on a crusade--his speech before the graduating class and impassioned argument with old established "surgeons" was very impressive--some great oration indeed! Very, very interesting as well as well made--this British horror film is well worth seeing--especially since it's true!!
