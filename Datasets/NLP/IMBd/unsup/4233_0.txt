Die Hand die Verletzt the Limerick:<br /><br />Something is wrong at this school<br /><br />When a girl uses a dissection tool<br /><br />To cut her own wrist<br /><br />If you get the gist<br /><br />When you worship Satan you become his fool.<br /><br />Morgan and Wong really should have stayed on the X-Files. But that's really a different subject entirely. This episode is another of the great episodes that these writers/producers gave to us in their run on the X-Files. This is such a creepy episode for me even years after having seen it the first time, which is rare for me as most of the episodes I used to be creeped out by are now pretty mild. The story is based around a school board who are devil worshippers. However, certain crazy things start happening around the town revolving around the death of a teenager and later a girl's memories of ritual sacrifices taking place in her own home and finally Mulder uncovering the truth from a deserting member of the group. The episode takes a turn in which we are led to believe that Mulder and Scully are helpless and will end up as the devil's final victims for the episode.<br /><br />There are a few scenes which make this episode stand out as memorable for me. First the scene with the girl telling her story to Mulder and Scully and the looks on their faces of complete horror and unbelief. I have had personal experience with random strangers telling me stories like this and asking for help and I remember how completely helpless I felt and I can see the same kind of pity and helplessness in Mulder's face. The second scene is that of Jim Asbury handcuffed in the basement crying as the python slowly crawls down the stairs to kill him. Chills. I also love the frogs falling from the sky scene and I love Scully's need to explain it somehow and showing up to tell Mulder about the tornadoes that could have picked them up and dropped them down on top of them. I love the pig coming alive and the girl totally freaking out and screaming bloody murder. That must have been an interesting class to be in you know that? First you got the kid being grabbed by the FBI after trying to escape through the window then the girl screaming her head off during pig dissections and then suicide and a python and the teacher disappearing. I remember when I was in class once and a guy got arrested in class because he tried to run instead of just escorted out to the hall. Anyway what I'm really trying to say is I like this episode. 10/10.
