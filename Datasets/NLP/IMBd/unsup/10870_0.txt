After the success of Carrie (1976), Brian De Palma followed up with another outstanding film about youths with incredible telepathic powers.<br /><br />Government agent's telepathic son is kidnapped and along with a similarly-gifted teenage girl he seeks to save him.<br /><br />Based upon the novel by John Farris, The Fury is a film that could have easily became a mundane action film if not for the splendid direction of De Palma and an outstanding cast. De Palma once again shows his excellent directorial style and his technique for grand suspense. The Fury has some great action sequences, a tremendous climax, and one outrageous conclusion! Makeup FX artist Rick Baker lends his talents to create some good blood-letting, especially for that knock-out closing image. John Williams also deserves special mention for his wonderfully powerful music score.<br /><br />Star Kirk Douglas is great as the government agent searching for his son. John Cassavetes is good as the films cold villain. Amy Irving and Andrew Stevens are both sympathetic as youths attempting to live with their amazing mental powers. Supporting cast Snodgress, Durning, and Lewis are also good.<br /><br />All around The Fury is a pretty under appreciated thriller that firmly ranks among the best of De Palma's films.<br /><br />*** 1/2 out of ****
