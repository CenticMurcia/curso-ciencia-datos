If it weren't for a recent viewing of the American produced version of the local comedy "He Died With A Felafel In His Hand" I would have had to say that 'Red Ryder was easily the most excruciatingly poor film I have ever seen.<br /><br />My nightmare scenario would be to suffer sudden total paralysis in front of a TV when this movie comes on and therefore to be unable to either suicide or destroy the television, rather than watch it again.
