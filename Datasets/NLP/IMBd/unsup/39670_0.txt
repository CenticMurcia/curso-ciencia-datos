Interview with the Vampire opens with a great helicopter shot of the San Francisco Ferry Building and zooms up Market St. After that, everything is wrong. Christian Slater as a journalist? You're supposed to believe him in that role because he wears glasses and chain smokes. Brad Pitt was so-so as a disillusioned vampire, but looked so gorgeous in his fake teeth, who cares? But Tom Cruise was simply ludicrous as Lestat, delivering lines like, "I give you everlasting life and you fritter it away on the blood of poodles." Probably the book, which I found impossible to read, was every bit as bad as the film, but there must have been a way to film this garbage. After all, the sets and costumes were quite good, and the homoeroticism strongly emphasized, probably to Tom's intense annoyance. Seeing him with his mouth full of incisors pretending to be a bored with eternal life fop was more than anyone should be expected to bear. There may be some roles he can perform (Jerry McGuire), but god knows why anyone would believe him as a vampire. I tried to watch this twice, but the whole catastrophe was too embarrassing, not to mention dull.
