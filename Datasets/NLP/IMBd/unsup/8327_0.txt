I just finished watching the DVD and can't wait to see it again! Jeremy Kasten does a great job for his first movie. He creates an atmospheric, unsettling, and at times just plain weird journey into subjective reality. The film has a certain insecure tension -- just when you think you're putting it together, Kasten throws in another piece of the puzzle and you have to re-think what you thought you knew. I enjoy films that don't spoon-feed me the answers, but rather allow me to draw my own conclusions. I also like the use of the unreliable narrator...the last 20 minutes is a roller-coaster ride! Jeffrey Combs is absolutely perfect as Doctor Ek, and Seth Green is hilarious yet unnerving as the mysterious Douglas. Seth always brings multiple levels to his characters, and I rate this as one of his best performances. Don't be put off by the fact that this movie may be referred to as "low budget" - in my opinion, that fact makes the production all that more sincere. The DVD will give those with a home theater system a good workout and add to the overall experience...and watch it after the sun goes down with all the lights out too!
