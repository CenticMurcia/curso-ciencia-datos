If you're looking for real comedy and humor, this is the movie to watch. Especially if you like the previous movie, Jalla,Jalla! by the same director (and many of the same actors) this one is a must. However don't be disappointed if the quality is not as high as Fares's debut.<br /><br />It's more filled with stupid jokes and the characters are not as thoroughly deepened as you would like. On the other hand, the plot (paper thin as it may be) very original and you feel good by it. Moreover the special effects are unexpectedly good for a swedish film. It may be clear that I liked this one very much and I can really recommend it! ...
