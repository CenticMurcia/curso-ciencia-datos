What a Great and Wonderful a Gift from God is this phenomenon of Motion Pictures. Thanks to The Lord and those of his Earthly collaborators like Edison, Lummiere, Melies, et al., for persisting in their individual and collective struggles to envision, establish, propagate and improve what has been called, "the Art Form of the 20th Century. (a Sentiment on Which , I'm sure, that We All Heartily Agree!) <br /><br />Because of the motion picture camera and projector we,are able to record and to preserve the images and people who make our History. We can keep a permanent life-like, nearly living visual and sound record of life and times, which are ever so fleeting. We can a live dramatic performance, which would evaporate into a mere memory in an instant. the Motion Picture camera & its cousin,the projector has made it possible to forever have great films like Of Mice and Men, Hal Roach Productions/United Artists (1939).* <br /><br />When one views the two principal characters, George Milton (Burgess Meredith) and Lenny Small (Lon Chaney, Jr.)** entering into a scene or having one of those now classic dialogs, we are viewing a little piece of Americana. The film starts at a fast pace with the two transients fleeing from their last stop. It seems that there has been some problem with a woman, caused by the misguided attentions of Lenny. We discover that poor Lenny, while being a giant of a physical specimen,being as strong as the proverbial bull, is inflicted with a mental retardation. It has rendered him a truly helpless man-child.<br /><br />George on the other hand, is a more average sized individual. He posses no great strength, but can do the average farm labor job and do it well. George relates that he has known poor Lenny for some years, and that the reason for the big man's mental state is the result of being kicked in the head by a mule when a kid.<br /><br />Through good and bad times (mostly all bad), George remains staunchly loyal to Lenny and his well being. He has kept him entertained and controlled by spinning tales of a sometime in the future, tales of a Utopian existence of a farm of their own with "green alfalfa fields and hutches of rabbits." Lenny's fondness for little rabbits and puppies and all things furry***, do not mix well with his uncontrolled, brute strength.<br /><br />George is very nimble of mind.Possessing an innate, though uneducated, store of knowledge in practical matters. When the two present themselves for hire to a new prospective employer, it is George who does the talking for them. Whether answering simple, basic questions or trying to cover-up any dubious events in their past, he speaks and does his best keep Lenny silent.<br /><br />The two function nearly as one. They have been around together for some time. George displays a tremendous loyalty to Lenny's welfare. In looking out for the usually gentle giant, George finds himself constantly flirting with disaster, himself.<br /><br />After being hired on at the ranch by the owner, the two are caught in the middle of the daily strife of the ranch. The owner's son, Curly (Bob Steels), a small guy, with that nasty, hate the world, little man's complex, which as we all know, turns one into a bully. Curly is especially tough when it comes to any underlings, who rely on their meager, little jobs with even smaller wages. He even picks on Lenny, starting a fist fight with him, the giant Lenny being unable to defend himself until told to do so by George. Lenny crushes an embarrassed, little punk, Curly.<br /><br />Curly is fearful of Slim, the 'Skinner'(Charles Bickford) because of his work skills endear him to Curly's father, the ranch owner. Also, Curly is a coward, who is insanely jealous of his wife's faithfulness, with good reason. The wife, Mae (Betty Field), is free and easy type of girl, who proverbially, "didn't have an enemy in the world." (Get the picture?) She is constantly parading herself around the ranch hands.<br /><br />She even tries her 'charms' on Lenny and even though George warned him to stay away. She screams and when Lenny tries to silence her, he inadvertently uses his super human strength and Mae winds up dead. And, .........<br /><br />Well, see the film. If you haven't done so yet, Shame On You! If you have seen it already, do so again. It will be worth your time.<br /><br />* This is numbered as Hal Roach's one, great dramatic film. Mr. Roach had been branching out from his former staple of one and two reeler comedies. Dating from the silent screen to the talkies, The Roach Studio numbered among its Star Attractions: Charley Chase, Thelma Todd, Zasu Pitts, Patsy Kelly, Our Gang (aka Little Rascals)and a couple of guys named Stan Laurel & Olivert Hardy!<br /><br />** Without this filmed record of this play, adapted from the Steinbeck novel, we would all be familiar with Burgess Meredith as BATMAN TV's Penguin or as Mickey from the ROCKY Films. Lon Chaney,Jr. would be known as, you know! Larry Talbot/THE WOLFMAN(1941), what else? <br /><br />*** There is quite a bit of business revolving around our canine friends, either puppies or an over aged, sickly sheep herding dog. They seem to take on a sort of metaphor for we humans. The incident involving the one handed bunkhouse keeper and his feelings for this old, mutt are heart wrenching, even for a big strong ex-cop like yours truly. Conversely, the hard attitude toward this pathetic creature and his very sympathetic owner, seem to represent a hard hearted attitude that was deeply rooted in this Depression Era, in which our story takes place.(Enough of this. Just see the film!)
