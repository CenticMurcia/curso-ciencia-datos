My all time favorite movie. Okay, one of my favorites... Cary Grant and Irene Dunne lose a baby...then adopt a baby only to nearly lose her in a court battle...then SHE DIES...they nearly divorce...and then (finally) they get the blue-eyed blonde baby boy they'd initially requested from the adoption agency and (presumably) live happily ever after.<br /><br />The chemistry between Grant and Dunne is charming (see My Favorite Wife for further evidence of this) and the supporting cast is excellent with Edgar Buchanan as "Applejack" and the always wonderful Beulah Bondi as Miss Oliver. Eva Lee Kuney, who had no known acting roles after the late 1940's, was adorable as Tina and steals every scene she's in. The camera loved her.<br /><br />Penny Serenade is on my short list of movies I watch whenever I'm having a "girl day" and all I want to do is sit on my sofa with my doglet on my lap and eat ice cream and have a good cry.
