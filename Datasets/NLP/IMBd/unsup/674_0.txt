Is this a horror or a psychological thriller? To me this is a curious study of lust, betrayal and death. The "true story" is often abused term in movie-making. Only, this time there is no abuse, just artistic freedom. Enjoy amazing scenery of a Spain in 1800's and the symbolic details that all have their meaning: the hands, the birds, the nails. The horror is there but in a subtle form and the visuals are very delicate. However, it seems to me that a lot of horror fans are put off by the fact that this movie is a slow-paced one. Yes, it might not scare you even once but it doesn't matter. This time you will be absorbed by the story with amazing visuals and strong cast that turn this movie into a work of art. If you want something unique as an underrated horror movie worth using for studies of photography look no further. Based on that fact alone it's worth 9 out of 10.
