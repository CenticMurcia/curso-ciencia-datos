Yes, the time you spend watching this movie will prove that you are truly a media harlot. Meaning... if you sit all the way through this bomb you are using your video unit as a drug to induce you into state of dismal low brow Neanderthal stimulation. The dialog and plot are so vacant any trace of the suspension of belief is lost in the worthless dialog and amateur acting. Goofey stupid kids who live to drink and water ski do not even do that very well. The alleged sexual content is barely even suggestive past some kind of fourth grade giggle girl whispering and "I dare you" boy humor that would have been better spent on "poot" jokes. I mean any attempt at trying to get an audience response with such short quick stupid teenage uncool blather leaves the viewer so unrewarded that you end up not liking anyone but the alleged killer. But you can't like him because he is not getting rid of the whole cast fast enough. I say this because I was the first guy to die in this movie. If you look really hard you will see me later hanging from some car chains from the rafters of an old shed.
