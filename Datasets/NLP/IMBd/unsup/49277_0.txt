Recently I watched a TV show that stated it was written by Writing credits by M. Night Shyamalan as a bedtime story for his children. He must have seen a rerun of the movie "Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid" with William Powell and Ann Blyth, as this is so similar to the plot that Guy Jones and Constant Jones should be getting credit for the writing.<br /><br />The story is excellent, however, it belongs to someone else as far as credit of the writing goes.<br /><br />For the man to find a narf in his swimming pool is what William Powell found on a vacation in the hotel swimming pool, except it was a mermaid. The man in Lady in the Water protects the narf, just like William Powell does in protecting Ann Blyth the mermaid. The man in Lady in the Water is trying to get the narf back to story land and in the William Powell movie he is trying to get the mermaid back to the other mermaids in the sea.
