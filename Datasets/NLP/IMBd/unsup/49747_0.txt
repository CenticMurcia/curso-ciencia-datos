I had hope that this movie would be a good fall back to the 80's genre horror flicks and that is what it attempted to do, all be it very poorly. This movie was very bad, and bad in a very very bad way not a way in which you want to watch it and laugh at it bad. The biggest problem of this movie is that it is a Swedish film with Swedish actors speaking English. I feel that if this movie was in Swedish the actors probably would have been more comfortable in their roles. Instead it felt like they were trying to remember their lines instead of getting into their parts. I would like to see this movie again in Swedish and preferably with a new soundtrack, the idea is there but the actors are having to work way to hard to remember their lines.
