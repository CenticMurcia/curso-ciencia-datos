After losing her parents in the age of five in a car accident, Laurie Cardell (Deborah Zoe) is sent to an orphanage where she stays for two years, until a fire burn down the place. Years later, she becomes a famous Hollywood actress, but traumatized and haunted by her past. When the small time criminal Nathan (C. Thomas Howell) is released after spending most of his life in prison, he goes to the house of his brother Daniel (Jason Widener), a young man that works in a rental and worships Laurie. Daniel has researched the entire life of Laurie and written a screenplay with her biography. Nathan decides to please his younger brother and asks Laurie to read the script. She refuses and he kills her manager and friend and abducts her. Nathan locks Laurie in the trunk of his car, and calls his brother to go to Saint Claire orphanage to shoot the movie. Once in the destroyed spot, secrets from the past are disclosed.<br /><br />"Asylum Days" is an impressive movie, but in the worst sense: the acting is terrible, and I feel sorry for the once promising C. Thomas Howell. The awful screenplay seems to be written by a moron or for morons, or both, using clich√©s and an absurd and non-plausible story. The cameo appearance of the old lady in the gas station gives the best moments of this forgettable and ridiculous film. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Casa do Medo" ("House of Fear")
