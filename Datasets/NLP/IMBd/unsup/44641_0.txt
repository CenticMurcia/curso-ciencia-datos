So...I've seen Bring it on. Not one the greatest movies of all time, but fair enough; it's mindless entertainment for the whole family. And then came the sequel...I figured it would be a bit lame, a bit cheery and good for an hour and a half of killing time. I was wrong. The only way to see this is to gather all your friends just to make fun of it, preferably while drinking heavily. It's all American, and quite sickening preppy, and I can't imagine why anybody at all would paint such a picture of college-America, let alone watch it! People behind a flick such as this should be ashamed of themselves; honestly, how do you sleep at night?! As for me, I got physically sick just watching it, and will not attempt it again for the sake of my own sanity. Thank you!
