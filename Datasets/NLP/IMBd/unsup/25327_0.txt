"Bergman is dead, long live the movies!" is the best way I can describe this mini seen at the special premiere opening.<br /><br />Finally Swedish movie makers dare to mix a historic event with fiction and make something more fun, beautiful and exciting than just a Bergman drama or a reality show. But of course, when Måns and Björn do something it's done for the public and not just the critics.<br /><br />What really strikes me is the characters, they are so vivid! Excellent acting makes the story feel true. They seem to be living at that time and place and really bring you in to their world. I can't think of one single actor that could be replaced, they all do it so well.<br /><br />A special note on the music (no pun intended), it's by far the best score in a Swedish movie yet. Buy the DVD if you have surround sound in your home, it will be worth it.<br /><br />I think this mini set a new standard for film making in Sweden, showing that it is possible to make beautiful movies in Europe. And we want more.
