(For the record this film is based upon a story by AAV Creative Unit)<br /><br />Bad 1980's ninja film. Its so bad its funny-but not in a good way. The basic plot has a white ninja battling a dark ninja group because the bad ninjas want to take the land where they think their secret wealth was hidden after it was stolen many years earlier (this doesn't take into account the fact the bad ninjas kill the good ninja's wife because she can't tell them where he is). There's black magic and zombies...and the white guy ninja wears heavy eye make-up.<br /><br />Oh,its awful. Bad fighting (you haven't lived until you see the ninja moves behind the candles), bad plot, worse acting, frighting music...and lets not talk about the dub. Its all horrible. And yes, its funny, oh how its funny, but for all the wrong reasons. Unfortunately,after twenty minutes the laughter begins to wane because the movie is just so bad it over whelms any unintentional humor.<br /><br />Words fail me. This is just an awful movie. Funny or no, avoid this movie.
