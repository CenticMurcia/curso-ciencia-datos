we have to wait a long time. several delays with funny stories "why". but finally it's released. everybody want to have the movie. so i give three stars for the marketing. that's it. the movie itself is nothing more than a music video for me. even not a good one. while "come to daddy" is one of my favorite, "rubber johnny" is far from that. no story, only eye candy. but, hey, what do expect from a music video. stop  it's not announced as a music video but as a movie. no go! when i saw the trailer the first time i thought "wow", that will be a crazy movie. now i'm very disappointed. "rubber johnny" starts good and than  no ideas anymore. only fx. dear chris, better not try to do a feature!
