Chinese horror film about an abandoned amusement park where a bunch of kids go looking for a missing family member. Years earlier a series of accidental deaths caused the park to close and for people to stay away. It transpires that an evil clown like entity is taking and stealing the souls of the people who died there and holding them.<br /><br />Good looking but unfrightening and dull movie that really isn't worth bothering with. If it wasn't for the fact that the film has some ghost sequences in 3-D this movie really wouldn't have seen any play dates out of China. There has no tension since much of the spooky action consists of the characters stumbling around looking scared while in the dark amusement park with nothing scary happening. This films ideas of scares or interesting ghost imagery is to trot out every long haired and small child ghost clich√© and use it. If you've seen Juon/The Grudge/The Ring you've seen it all before.The film also uses people with physical deformity for frightening effect for no good reason other than the film makers have broken through the bottom of the barrel. The clown ghost stuff is interesting but because of lousy 3-D you really don't get a good look at it. Its not even worth discussing the illogic of the plot, its twists, or how good the amusement park looks after being abandoned for so many years.<br /><br />Clearly this is going to be the made just for the cash turkey in director Andrew Lau's closet(he did Infernal Affairs and Initial D among others). <br /><br />Stay away from this, even as a rental.I picked this up in Chinatown for five bucks on DVD and feel I was over charged (and ripped off since the DVD only had one set of 3-D glasses in it- then again the 3-D didn't always work) 3 out of 10.
