Unless you count some guy in a cheesy "devil" getup slashing people like Wolverine, there is little horror in "Faust." Like more than a few other unfortunate souls, I rented this based on the presence of Jeffrey Combs, whose unusually stiff performance tipped me off to the long ride ahead. It's low-budget dreck, that is certain--but through its persistent incoherence, it kept my attention, even though the one feeling I had when the credits started to roll was absolute indifference. Director Brian Yuzna's camera angles are inventive at first, but the music-video edits occur so regularly that they become annoying after a while; yet perhaps the one thing "Faust" can hold to its name are the impressive special effects (impressive for such an obviously low-budget production), even though I'm of the opinion that people shouldn't even bother adapting comic books to film. "Faust" turns into a prime example of why that's true.<br /><br />4/10
