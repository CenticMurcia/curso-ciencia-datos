I, too, saw this on my L.A. ABC station as "A Cold Night's Death", when I was a teenager. I was really caught up in it -- the tension, the atmosphere, the mystery. And the ending was great, at least at that time. All of this was attributable to several factors, including the writing, directing, acting, sets, and sound effects. I wonder how I'd react if I saw if for the first time now? <br /><br />By chance, I worked with the director, Jerrold Freedman, many years later. At one point during that harried shoot, I managed to tell him how much of an impression this movie had made on me. Obviously so, since his name stuck in my head over the decades between.<br /><br />Here's another person strongly urging the release of this obscure gem on DVD, perhaps now, while it's still winter!
