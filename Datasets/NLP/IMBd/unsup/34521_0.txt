I just watched loving Annabelle, and i do not understand how it has been rated so highly. It lacks so much a film should be to make it great. OK its a lesbian film, fantastic there should be more of them, but this is not a good film just because its made by a lesbian for lesbians. The plot is thin and obvious, the acting is good and would of been so much better if there had been something they could work with. I have read lots of things about this film watched interviews and clips about how long it took to make and get realised and finished...i was expecting something more, something good. All i got was the film that is out there....throughly disappointed. Believe me i never comment on the internet on films and stuff because, you know, its peoples choice to like it or not to. But this film has let me down in what it claimed to be, so i had to say something for others to read. <br /><br />Ceri
