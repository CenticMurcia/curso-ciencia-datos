OK soi found this in wal mart ...and for fathers day i said hey get me that ...lol... and im glad ... it was a good change of pace for genre ....cursed was cool and a good film because of the changes they made to the idea ... and this film was the same ...a funny p issed off wolf guy ..making jokes while killing people and the gore was pretty good .... better than expected ... im saying a full 10 here it had it all ... a funny bad guy ( not cheesy to much), good gore, naked chicks (can never go wronge there) story line was pretty good and the acting wast bad .... so i say if your into the whole angry wolf guy killing maiming and "touching people in the bad place" ....lol..then check it out (4), vocalist - GOD IN A MACHINE
