I saw this movie for about one month ago, and i thought it was the worst rubbish i've ever seen. If you it compare with the masterpiece "The lion king" this movie isn't eaven worth to be called a follow up. I want to believe that this is different movie, which has nothing to do with the first.In my opinion the film was probably made because of money, nothing else.The kids like it perhaps, because they often like all kind of cartoons, either it is rubbish or not. The story is almost the same.Bad music and boring. Maybe some funny jokes, but that's all.
