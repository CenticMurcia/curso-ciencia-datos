Three groups of people in three unrelated stories occasionally intersect in a trivial manner. There is a massage therapist who cannot touch her daughter, an eye doctor who is going deaf, a prostitute with a deaf daughter, a baker with little sense of taste whose boyfriend cannot talk English, a gay man who is obsessed with odours and who believes that he can smell love. The film also bathes the audience in sights and sounds. The plot is minimal, just sufficient to propel us through three days of their lives. A central occurrence that runs through the three stories is the disappearance of a 3-year-old girl from one of the stories. The pace is slow and the mood is entirely captivating. This is a very unique film.
