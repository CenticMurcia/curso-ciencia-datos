HOLY COW. I have only been around for 13 years now, and that was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I quote that movie almost everyday since I saw it, and hope to own it on video or DVD really really soon. Lines like, "No matter where you goÂ… there you are." and "Give her your jacket" - Buckaroo "Why me" - Tommy Prefect "Because, your Mr. Prefect." Buckaroo "(pauses) You have a point there" - Tommy, still crack me up. I would love to see the sequel the "World Crime League" but I guess some people don't have as good of humor as some of us. I guess it's to late to do that now, but man, It would have been one of my all time favorite movies. If your in for a good laugh, and can fine this rare treasure in some movie place, RENT IT, and if you like it, BUY IT.
