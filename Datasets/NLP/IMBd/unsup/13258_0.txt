People familiar with Charles Bukowski know that much of his work deals with the area he lives in, LA. Therefor it is surprising that the makers of this film managed go effectively translate his stories to an European setting and still maintaining a lot of his philosophy on life. The film consists on three stories about various days in the life of Harry Voss, who is in actuality Henry Chinaski (Bukowski's alter ego). The first two segments take elements from various Bukowski novels, poems, and stories and makes them blend together. The third segment is based on the short story "The Copulating Mermaid of Venice, CA". The film travels Voss from being an innocent and optimistic boy to an acne-scarred outcast teenage to finally a pathetic and perverted drunk.<br /><br />While not a flawless film by any means, its probably the best adaptation of Bukowski, beating out both "Barfly" and the recent "Factotum". The screenplay makes Voss a sympathetic and human character, even when he engages in necrophilia at the end. Apparently Bukowski himself felt that they had improved upon his source material with the new ending to the final segment. Overall, this is probably the best film I've seen from Belgium (out of the roughly five I've seen). Recommended for fans of Bukowski or international cinema. (8/10)
