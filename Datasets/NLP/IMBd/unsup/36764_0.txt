What a shocker, I rented this movie on the basis of the DVD cover and the summary of the story, it seemed like it would be something I could watch (though I don't as a rule enjoy Westerns) with my partner, (who loves Westerns!!) Following the first half hour, we still had no real clue what was going on, we thought maybe it would improve and that we had not lost the plot. SURPRISE, there was no plot to lose!!!! I have never seen such a boring piece of cinema in my entire life. It should carry a hazard warning on the cover 'In Danger of Boring you to Death'. Billy Bob Thornton ,Peter Fonda what were you thinking!!! You did't have cameo roles, or ghost roles, there were NO ROLES. I cannot believe anyone would finance such a pointless, meaningless movie. I think it should be removed from every rental DVD store as the cover and the summary entirely mislead a customer into the renting thereof. My partner has only one opinion...disgusted!!
