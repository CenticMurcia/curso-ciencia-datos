Never before have I been so annoyed by a movie that I felt the need to bitch about it to the rest of the world; to warn potential viewers that to rent this movie is to agree to a waste of a little over an hour of their life. Quite certainly the WORST movie I have sat through, with the exception of some really bad porn, but that's okay with bad-no-plot porn because its expected. If this movie had contained at least some real sex scenes, I may have excused the stupidity of its entirety, but even the "sex scenes" sucked. Pointless: Neve's shower scenes, every character that Neve encounters (i.e. the guys on the street? Mike Tyson? what the hell was that all about?) And as others have pointed out, I too was tormented by the constant piano banging or the incessant score which was always playing louder too loud! Not that we really missed anything like "dialogue", since it was so poorly written and acted anyway. Not one character gains any likability or depth. I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of them. I was so taken back by how bad the film was, I had to watch the "bonus" interviews on the DVD. In Neve's defense, she appears to have a better grasp of the depth of her character when discussing it in the interview, but unfortunately, Mr. Toback doesn't bring any character development to the audience. Terrible. Just absolutely AWFUL, pointless, and BAD!!
