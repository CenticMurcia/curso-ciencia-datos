After seeing Swimming Pool (my first Ozonic experience - his first American-language movie), all of his previous films and now this one, I've come to the conclusion that Francois Ozon is a truly brilliant filmmaker, someone who is capable of foraging deep, DEEP under the surface of things - as only a Scorpio can - to convey what is nearly non-conveyable in films: psychological state and motivation. Charlotte Rampling is superb in Swimming Pool, and in Sous Le Sable (Under the Sand), she creates one of the most stunningly subtle and heartbreaking portraits of grief that I've ever experienced; this film is profoundly sad, a brilliantly accomplished, astoundingly mature piece of work.
