`Swimming Pool' is one of the most chloroful, I mean, colorful films of the year. This ingenious unpredictable fable stars Charlotte Rampling as an impervious British mystery writer. Charlotte's web of mystery guides to her to a French villa where she inhabits for tranquility & inspiration for her next literary project. What Charlotte doesn't know is that she is about to be french fried when she discovers that the young voluptuous sex-crazed daughter of the owner of the villa has also decided to dive into the chateau. The middle-aged writer and the sexy nymph springboard into a few altercations. However, the film does take us to uncharted waters as our 2 main protagonists develop a friendship as a real life murder mystery unexpectedly develops. The villa's swimming pool is the primary centerpiece of the film's irregular occurrences. Rampling's sterling performance is head above water the best by a lead actress so far this year. However, it is Ludivine Sagnier who is the star in the making. Her screen charisma will definitely not drown yourself to boredom. Moreover, her topless swimming pool scenes are deserving of a gold medal for her incredible breaststroke competency. Director Francois Ozon explicit direction is this summer's hottest surprise. So why wait? Dive head first into the mystery and intrigue of `Swimming Pool'. ***** Excellent
