This film starts off well (although the makers clearly 'borrowed' a lot of their ideas from Darren Aronofsky's 'Pi') - it looks gritty, cold, suitable for a film about paranoia.<br /><br />The problem is, Lee Evans can't act, and neither can the rest of the cast, and even if they could they'd have to be superhuman to make a script this dreadful sound good.<br /><br />Overall, it's an interesting idea let down by awful production. The frankly awful plot feels like an afterthought, almost as if someone really, *really* wanted to make a film about a guy who tapes everything he does but couldn't work out where to go with the idea - so they watched an episode of 'Silent Witness' and made some notes on the back of a fag packet.<br /><br />Verdict: rubbish. Better films, please, British Film Industry. And stop giving Lee Evans work. He acts like a Frank Spencer who's eaten too many blue Smarties. Ooh, Betty, the cat's been filming my secret murders!
