I am not going to give a synopsis, many reviewers already did that very well.<br /><br />I ran into this made-for-TV movie in the sellout-bin from the local videostore. I have to admit I am shallow enough to pick it up, just for the nice pic of Miss Banks on the front. <br /><br />Like most reviewers I did not have any high hopes about the acting ability of a former super- model (I did not know, at that time, of her heartbreaking performance in "Higher Learning")<br /><br />I was, however, pleasantly surprised. The chemistry between Lindsay Lohan and Tyra Banks is there. Tyra Banks has great comical&physical talent. Her lanky legs&arms are totally uncoordinated in the beginning, but the longer the doll is human, the better it gets. Small detail, but her initial clumsiness makes a "living doll" even somewhat believable.<br /><br />Miss Lohan is, as usual, very professional and convincing as the shocked girl who got something more than she bargained for. The actor playing her dad? Well. He's somewhat annoying with his constant "smooth lovable talking". On the other hand, the "loving Dad" is something of a standard mainstay in Disney- movies I guess.... Tyra Banks does an admirable job as Eve, the vapid, ever-beautiful doll-girl-with a heart, and her part has some subtle in-jokes about modeling for the grown-ups(f.i. her obsession with food..)and after the initial annoyance with her overdone stupidity in real-life, she started to warm to me. She's utterly charming in the end. But she cannot sing! Sorry to say but there is one little scene that really made me cringe.<br /><br />One thing is obvious. All actors had a great time filming this little for-TV movie, never mind a cohesive story.<br /><br />Yeah..The Story.. Well.. The script is quite inconsistent here and there. (SPOILER ALERT:How come Eve cannot read a Menu OR a computer screen, yet apparently CAN read ingredients on packages when trying to make a cake..with hilarious results...and THEN again is not able to read "The Book" ???) but the flow of the story isn't bad. Even though it seems that the script- writers couldn't really decide were to go: More fairy-tale or more real-life. Magic books?? Come on! This isn't Harry Potter!<br /><br />Little niggles like that do not take away anything from the enjoyment of this rather charming movie though. The target audience(family with kids from 8 to 13)will like it, and it has some nice messages about equality of boys&girls strewn in here and there.<br /><br />All in all it is typical, even "stereo-typical" Disney run-of-the-mill produce with some cringe-worthy moments, but for the price, quite enjoyable. And the ending? Well, a bit different from what I expected in a Disney-Movie.
