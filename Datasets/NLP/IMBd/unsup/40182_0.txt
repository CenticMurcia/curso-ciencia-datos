Jeff Chandler is 'Captain Hawkes' of the 'U.S.S. Belinda' and he doesn't take any crap. <br /><br />Hawkes wants a taut ship and he'll gladly keel-haul anybody who waxes the wrong floors or throws metal objects across the room. If Hawkes has any short-comings, it's when he brow-beats the men and has half the ship's shore patrol laboriously construct a sailboat for the purpose of building 'morale'. A bit silly at times and Hawkes' head injury is a boringly unwelcome subplot, but ultimately an OK World War II naval drama. <br /><br />One of Chandler's better performances.
