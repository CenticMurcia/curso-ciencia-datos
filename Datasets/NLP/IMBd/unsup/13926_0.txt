Surprisingly, I think this may be the worst film I have ever sat through. It is not a horror film, although I do happen to have a horror of things going wrong with water supplies, so I could have well been made to feel petrified under different circumstances. It is not a thriller because it is so lacking in anything interesting for me to be thrilled about. It is not a comedy because it is not funny. What it is, is a very pretentious waste of an hour and a quarter. Unconvincing is the word here. Of course in almost every film there are moments where you are inclined to scream at the screen to encourage the character to do this or do that to avoid catastrophe. Here the lead does nothing sensible at any point during the whole of the film and the plumber who is very annoying indeed comes off as being not quite as silly as her. As for the endingI despair!
