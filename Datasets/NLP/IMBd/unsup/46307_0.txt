I really don't see R. Kelly making this 'series' out of seriousness, actually I think he made it on a dare or something to prove to his friends that his fans will eat up anything he puts out. So R. Kelly drank a bottle of laxatives and squeezed out 42 minutes of a musical. This thing covered EVERYTHING in way to much detail and seems based on a collage of Springer guests.<br /><br />The reason I say all this is because I couldn't take it seriously and I can't imagine anyone else doing the same, each sequence just goes on & on, really, why does it take 10 verses to describe a man opening a closet door? And that's just an example; this sort of things goes on through out the whole series.<br /><br />The best and worst part of it all, the 12 segment ends with a sort of cliffhanger, letting you think that R. Kelly just bought another bottle of laxatives and is stewing up another 6 or 12 segments to this all.
