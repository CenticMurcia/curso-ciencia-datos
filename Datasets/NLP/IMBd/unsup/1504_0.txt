Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid is based on an interesting concept. You have scenes involving Steve Martin as a Private Eye inter-cut with scenes from classics like Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, The Killers and loads of other 40's classics with people like Bogie, Ava Gardner, Cary Grant, Ray Milland, Burt Lancaster (still playing the Swede) and a bunch of other stars. The photography is faithful to the era it tries to re-create and Steve Martin has a 40's look about him. For me, the off-putting thing was the toilet humour in several scenes. They could have remained sober and created a better movie, Instead there is completely immature scenes which mar the sober atmosphere that the camera-work creates. Having said that, it's still interesting to see bygone legends in a completely new movie. By the way, all the scenes are from the movies. There is "lost" footage or anything that was edited out of the original movies. Interesting just for the visual look.
