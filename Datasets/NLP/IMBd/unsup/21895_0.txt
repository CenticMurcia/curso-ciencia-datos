I just finished watching this film and it is beyond words. I am a devout Lynch lover and bought this film the other night, willing to give it a shot. It swept me off of my feet and left me in tears. It's so moving and almost gives you a hope for humanity. This movie will appeal to anyone who does not have a heart made of stone.
