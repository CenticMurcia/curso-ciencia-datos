While the camera shots in this movie are often not clearly focused and the editing is poor with harsh cuts that should have been faded to black or into the next scene, this movie isn't half bad. The soundtracks not bad either, but perhaps with better editing, the featured songs would have fit in a lot better.<br /><br />I have ulterior motives as to why I purchased this movie (it's all Amy's fault) and have been pleasantly surprised recently at how well Scott Baio can pull off the leading man in movies which revolve around the romance genre - he can really make you feel for the characters he portrays, making you cross all your fingers, toes, legs etc, hoping that things will work out for the best.<br /><br />The storyline revolves around Mario, a cocky young up-and-coming photographer from Little Italy who literally falls in love at first sight with with Nicole Yeats (hence the title - I <3 N.Y.), the daughter of John Robertson Yeats(Plummer), a prestigious actor starring on Broadway. After a little persuasion, Nicole agrees to go on a date with Mario and together they start a relationship which ruffles the feathers of her father, his mother and his boss (Orbach).<br /><br />It's pretty much an 80's Romeo and Juliet tale - without the tragic end. He's from a low class background trying to make it big and she's from a high class background where she could have anything she wants.<br /><br />The chemistry between Baio and Kelly Van Der Velden is fantastic. It's this that makes this movie worthwhile, although there are fantastic performances from Plummer as Nicole's tyrannical father and Orbach as Mario's frustrated boss.<br /><br />I pretty much have to say that, even though these type of movies are so clich√©d, I was rooting for the young couple and half expected them to elope together to annoy her their respective parents. There's some great dialogue between characters, particularly Mario and Nicole when they first meet and there's a few funny moments too. <br /><br />If you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend it as it's a great chick flick, perfect for a Saturday night in with that bottle of red and the girls.
