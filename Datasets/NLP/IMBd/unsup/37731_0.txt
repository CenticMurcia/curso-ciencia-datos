Dr. Jason Ward (Jason Brooks) is a highly qualified geneticist. His brother Andy Ward (Robert Floyd) had problems during his birth and is mentally retarded. Dr. Jason is hired by an agency to develop some kind of experience with DNA. What he does not know is that this DNA belongs to the body of a very developed prehistoric man, and his findings are being used by another government laboratory to develop a kind of super-intelligent species. His brother Andy is used as part of this experiment. This movie seems to be a bad pilot of a possible television series. However, the screenplay and the performance of the casting are so foolish that probably the producers gave up with such an investment. However, although deserving a place among the worst 250 films in IMDB, there are movies worst than that. By comparison with other craps, my vote is four.
