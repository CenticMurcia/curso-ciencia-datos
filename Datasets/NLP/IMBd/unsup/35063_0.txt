Today I read some interesting reviews of this movie. I think a friend of mine said it best: Chuck and Buck is one of those movies where, depending on the mood you're in, you'll either rub your chin pensively, brow furrowed, and say "mmm-hmm, I see"; or you'll look at the screen in disbelief and say "what the H**L???" I'm in the latter group. I didn't find anything redeeming about this movie. I believe some people think they need to "appreciate" and "understand" a movie like this to prove that they are the true connoisseurs of independent films. Yeah, okay.
