Somehow, I guess I just don't "get" Chrystal. What is the purpose of its existence? The story was not nearly so compelling as, let's say, Slingblade, nor the characters especially endearing. Individual acting performances were outstanding and rose far above the story. Why did Chrystal need to be written? What was gained from it? Who learned from it? If I had come away with a lesson learned or a moral, Chrystal would have made more sense. Instead, I came away feeling, undone. Shouldn't a film make a statement or ask a question? Chrystal makes me ask" "Why?" Maybe I should write a screenplay. It can be just anything, as long as it has some kind of music, bluegrass maybe, and some good fight scenes, with more slapping and kicking than punching, as a change of pace. Oh, yes, someone will get shot, too.
