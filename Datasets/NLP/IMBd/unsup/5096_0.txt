I remember when I first received that movie. I fell in love with it right away. I could actually say the script word for word. "Keep your shirt on, she's coming!" Sandra was fun and exciting in this film. Her bubbling energy kept me laughing and glued to my seat. I recommend anyone to watch it for some innocent and old fashioned values. For example when Kim Novak was preparing dinner and she had salad and lemonade all sitting there before her family was home. Now, how many people have actually experienced that? It takes me to the time when life was innocent and we could use the word 'gay' to mean happy.
