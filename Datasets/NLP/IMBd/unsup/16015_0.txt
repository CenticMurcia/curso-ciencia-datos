This is one of those films that takes a little while to seem to be about anything, but once it gets going, it really takes you in with it. Griffin Dunne plays a young and mild-mannered New York City professional who is brought into a hellish nightmare in Soho when he loses his cab fare and his thrown out of the cab. As he tries to find the money to take the subway home, he meets several interesting and sometimes very strange people.<br /><br />Dunne's character seems to be the only normal person in this film and that is one of the reasons why it works so well. This poor guy just wants to get home, but problem after problem pops up and destroys his plans. This is really a terrific story about a normal person thrown into weird and crazy situations. The classical music that plays throughout is a wonderful touch as well. However, one of my favorite parts of this film was the cast. I loved Catherine O'Hara as the paranoid vigilante who drove the ice cream truck chasing after Dunne. Cheech and Chong were a nice comic addition as well.
