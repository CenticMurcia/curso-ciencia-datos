Movie's have come to be just like eating chicken. Everybody is serving chicken; Boiled, baked and fried but it just chicken.<br /><br />Where have all the new and innovative ideas gone to. The last truly innovative movie that I have saw was The Matrix. I can't hardly find a movie I can sit all the way through anymore. And with that being said, 7 seconds is just about as watchable an anything being produced these days unless you want to soil your sensibilities in the mire of sadistic garbage that is being pushed at us now. Torture and entrapment, murder and mutilation. Heck they have even eliminated the Sci-fi section at Blockbusters. Why??? As a sidebar when ever I see a Wesley Snipes movie I amuse myself with Wesley's ability to bed white women on screen. He seems to be the only card carrying Black man that is licensed to do that in American Cinema. Without suffering some kind of tragic end before the movie ends. In this movie he had two of them. How does he get away with doing that?
