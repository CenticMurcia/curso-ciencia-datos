First Zorro serial is one of the best. It's a modern story with planes and trains and cars and horses all being used to great effect to tell the story of Zorro (James Vega) trying to stop the villain from blowing up the railroad he own stock in. Its one of the large scale serials that Republic did in the late 30's and early 40's before budgets got tighter thanks to wartime austerity. The large cast of characters is nicely handled and it doesn't have the round and round feeling that later Zorro serials engendered. This has spectacular effects that help elevate things a couple of notches- Where else are you going to see a train try to out run a plane that is trying to bomb it?. If there is a flaw it's that there is a few musical numbers that don't really fit (Most musical numbers don't fit in serials since they slow the serial down too much)
