Well, I give it a 2 for the gore, but otherwise this film is worthless. Heck, I just went back and gave it a 1. With this movie I have finally decided I'm too old to finish movies that start off as poorly as this clunker. SPOILER: For 10 minutes an uninteresting couple with nothing much to say drives around lost in the country. This bit has to be seen to be believed. Were they all on 'ludes when they edited this section? I saw this movie for free and I still paid too much. That silly movie about the giant walking turd monster was like Citizen Kane compared to this bowel movement. Your life will be better if you skip this puppy. Your entertainment dollar would be better spent on gas to go driving around running over stray dogs while dressed as Edna Turnblatt.
