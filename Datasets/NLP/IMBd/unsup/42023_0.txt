I just saw this movie for the first time, and the last time. Now I wouldn't say I was a harsh critic, but this movie really reeked. The eigthies was a confusing era, and this movie was a fart of the eighties era of movies. It lingered around for a while and didn't smell too good. The whole idea of kids fighting monsters, is a idea out of some stupid saturday morning cartoon. What kind of an actor would play a "fish man." And even the idea of a "fish man" is staggering. So if you are thinking of watching "Monster Squad," think it over, and consider the year of 1987, and the crap that came out of the 80's.<br /><br />
