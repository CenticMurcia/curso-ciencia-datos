I had discovered clips of this movie on YouTube and decided that I just had to see it. The very day that the delivery arrived, we popped the DVD in and laughed from start to finish.<br /><br />The guys do great work as the "gals" and part of the charm is that they're in on the joke and never take themselves too seriously. This is, after all, a COMEDY! And one that is very well done.<br /><br />Some of the littlest bits bring the biggest laughs. Coco's flatulence, the out-of-camera lines ("that is NOT her color!"), and of course the catty one-liners from Evie. Even the DVD menus are a blast.<br /><br />All in all, one of the most over-looked, best laugh-out-loud movies ever.
