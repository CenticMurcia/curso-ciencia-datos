Mifune was an entertaining movie. I thought the acting was well done especially Jesper Asholt as Rud. Some aspects of the story were confusing to me like the lottery tickets. Did they win or what? Plus I'm not sure of the ending. I might have read more into it then was expected but maybe that was the goal. Unless you are familiar with Seven Samurai the significance of the pot and gloves is lost. Overall a good movie worth a watch.
