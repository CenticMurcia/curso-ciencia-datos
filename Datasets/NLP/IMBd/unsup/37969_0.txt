Where are the parents who gave birth to these imbicles? Probably all dead from busted livers and car accidents? With as much sleeping and drinking and "couple action" depicted in this film, one or two itsy bitsy youngsters are bound to pop up sooner or later. It would have been a suspenseful scene if one of these oversexed morons brought the farm defending an infant instead of drinking and throwing themselves at the first attractive body. Where's the out of shape beer bellies by the way? The closest we come is a scene with a truly nasty TV-watching twit complaining about his wife who's taken out by "the beast", well in that scene I felt it was doing me public service. And in the following scene there's no realistic follow up to the loss emphasizing how much a jerk the guy was.<br /><br />I could cover one IMDb page with complaints about this flick if I turn to the depiction of the police so it's best that I stop the rant here.
