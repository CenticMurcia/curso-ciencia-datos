This film captures the spirit of America's official pastime, baseball and America's real pastime, romance and combines the two in a seamless, engaging and heartfelt manner. I entered the theatre with guarded optimism knowing this was the feature directorial debut for writer/director Johnson. I left the theatre very pleasantly surprised. This young filmmaker accomplished far more with fewer resources than most seasoned pro's accomplish with far more. But Johnson has succeeded in creating much more than a mere calling card. This film succeeds on it's own merits and deserves to be seen and to live on. A bit longish in spots, the engaging mood will cause all but the most jaded cynic to overlook this fact and give this gem the praise it so richly deserves.
