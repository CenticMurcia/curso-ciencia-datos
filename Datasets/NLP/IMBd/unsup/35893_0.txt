It is a story of an ax murderer that escaped from death row. That is why it says Axe on the DVD cover. I guess that wasn't good enough when it was released in 2004, so they renamed it and brought it out again in 2006 as a story of greedy people after $300,000.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER: Everyone, and I do mean everyone, in the movie is after the money.<br /><br />This coulda been a contenda. I spent the entire movie watching Darlena Tejeiro. I was absolutely enchanted with this beauty. She was a rock climber, but the best mountains in the movie remained covered in clouds, and we never saw the peaks. What a shame! But, I do have to say that she was the best actor in the movie. That doesn't mean I will watch Starsky & Hutch to see her again, but she was good.<br /><br />The actual ax murders were pretty lame. This could have easily been a PG movie. More thriller than horror.
