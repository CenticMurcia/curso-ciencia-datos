Following the old, and sometimes over repeated, Action/Comedy formula THE MAN adds something different to the genre. This combination between the Action Thriller and Comedy was done so many times before but not with a personality like Eugene Levy! He truly is "the man"! I mean this guy is unique in the way he represents the dumb guy, because he's genuine! No offense to the actor but like is said in the film "he can't be any dumber than he looks"! He really represents the dumb guy with simplicity, honesty, and mostly, veracity! I think this duet, Samuel L Jackson and Eugene Levy, worked out very well, because they are both excellent actors, and they represent very well the tough and the dumb guy respectively. And the combination of these two character genres, played by these actors, was amazing. At parts it was hilarious (the "He's my bitch" scene is remarkable!).<br /><br />THE MAN is essentially action and fun but it also has one or two nice messages either. It's an entertaining film, made in Hollywood standards, but it's a very nice one in the genre.
