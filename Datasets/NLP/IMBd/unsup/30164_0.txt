I am sorry to say this but if these comments will save someone a few bucks then good. You would be better off buying soup.<br /><br />I actually know some of the folks in one of the vignettes and while they did a great job with what they were given I must say the first segment was truly - not good. Uninspired, unoriginal, guys is rubber masks and so on. Come on. I suppose there are some folks who will love the "camp" aspect of this but Roger Corman did better stuff, and probably with less money. I like Corman but his time has passed by now, please, for heavens sake, move the genre forward or leave it to others.<br /><br />I was truly happy to see Ms. Kidder acting again and doing a decent job. I was wondering if any self respecting agent should allow her to be part of any production with such low goals/values as this one but, she does pretty good, again, given what she was allowed to work with.<br /><br />Look, I'm no expert and have dabbled in making shorts and so on. I like the scary stuff but this was not it. To slap the sub title on this as being from the "Master of Horror"? Really? Where is the horror? Buckets of blood are not scary, mental scares stick with you - "White Noise" stays in your skull, "High Tension" stays in your head, "Cigarette Burns" has staying power. This will hopefully fade away.<br /><br />Again, it pains me to say all this but save your dimes kiddies and buy some pop-rocks, or better yet, an old MiniDV camera and make your own films.<br /><br />Congrats to Bo and everyone involved for getting this far but really, is this on par with other films that have been commercially released? If it was made for the love of the genre, kudos. If it was made hoping to make a million dollars, sorry. If it was made as a stepping stone and learning experience, that's great. What's next?<br /><br />On the positive side, you can see a definite ramping up of quality from the beginning to the end. I don't doubt that in time this team could do something great. Better stories, NO rubber face masks and better sound and I'll be right in line to see it. Keep at it. We're watching.<br /><br />S.
