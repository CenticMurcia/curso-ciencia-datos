This was a great Sherlock Holmes movie, which will rank as one of the best in the Basil Rathbone series.<br /><br />A man using the name John Grayson is travelling to America with some secret papers which he carries in a match box. On a train, a woman takes the matchbox to light a cigarette and never gives it her back. A criminal group is on the train, who want the information to sell to the Nazi's. So Grayson is kidnapped. Holmes and Watson travel to America to try and solve the kidnapping. An attempt was made on there lives before they even entered America. Then the corpse of Grayson is sent to Holmes. Then the gang find the woman who has the matchbox. Holmes comes to her rescue and has to face the gang himself. The gang leader actually had the matchbox, but he didn't know the info was hidden in it. Holmes gets the better of him triumphantly.<br /><br />It was very amusing stuff when Holmes smashed the vase and he tries to convince that it is worth nothing and he says "Now now my good man" in a really funny high pitched voice. There was a good bit of propaganda in this film, but unlike The Voice of Terror, the Propaganda isn't aimed at Nazi's, but the Propaganda is saying how great Americans are. Holmes keeps saying what great people they are. All the Basil Rathbone films were made in America, but after this movie there was talk of moving the character to America permanently. We couldn't have that, England needs you Holmes, not America.
