I really can't add much to the already illustrative comments that have been posted on this site but I have to say that this movie was SO BAD!! that I actually found myself laughing out loud many times, particularly when both leads were locked up under "arrest" in adjoining cells and touched hands through their respective windows -- now that is cinema!! You should by all means watch this movie if you want a good laugh!!! It appears that low budget was the rule here and I agree with another comment on the site and EVERYONE in the prison was obviously gay, even the staff. This truly is subject matter for gay porn but to have a chance at some believability it helps to cast the film well. Or it could be that the cast worked for free or next to nothing on this project.
