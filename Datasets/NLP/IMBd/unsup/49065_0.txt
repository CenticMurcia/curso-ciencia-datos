A whole bunch of girls have a big slumber party. They dare the driller killer to show up. Guess what? He does. <br /><br />A very slow and boring film. Even the nudity or death scene by vibrator can't liven things up. By far and away the worse in The Slumber Party Massacre series. Avoid it at all cost. My rating: 2 out of 10.
