This isn't exactly a musical, but it almost seems like one because there more singing than much else, but this is obviously one of the hooks. Basically one day in a bar that she used to work in, Ruth Etting (Doris Day) met producer Martin Snyder (Oscar nominated James Cagney) who could promise a new and better paid career on stage. She doesn't get in to it immediately as she is on for a few seconds, but she soon gets the chance for longer shows. She enjoys herself and the critics and producers are throwing offers at her. Later, after marriage Ruth and Martin get even bigger and she has become one of the most successful women on stage, and her career soon comes to Hollywood. It is only she discovers an old friend (near love) is working on the film, Johnny Alderman (Cameron Mitchell) that things go a bit pear shaped for her and the marriage/relationship with Martin. Also starring Robert Keith as Bernard V. Loomis, Tom Tully as Frobisher and Harry Bellaver as Georgie. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Motion Picture Story, and it was nominated for Best Song for "I'll Never Stop Loving You", Best Music for Percy Faith and George E. Stoll, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay. Doris Day was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and James Cagney was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. Very good!
