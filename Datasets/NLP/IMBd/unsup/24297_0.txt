First off, Robot Chicken is the ultimate parody show. There are no real story lines. The episodes consist completely of various parody skits and sketches. The sketches last 6-7 minutes tops. Most of them only last a few seconds to a minute! They animators use only toys and clay figures which, in my opinion, adds to the hilarity. And it's packed with senseless violence that shames even Mortal Kombat. Batman, Robin, the Mario Brothers, Brittany Spears, N'Sync, Hillary Duff, Fred Flintsone, the Little Drummer Boy, The Nutcracker and even Cap'n Crunch and Tony the Tiger have all been brutally killed by the twisted creators of the show. So often the violence is completely pointless. For example, in one skit we see a trio of kids enjoying their "Phillis Diller Spray n Play" sprinkler. Suddenly, the sprinkler goes haywire and kills all three of the kids in completely disgusting manners that left me breathless from laughing so hard. The tentacles on the sprinkler impale one kid's chest, rip the shin off the second kid and tear open the head of the third kid. In another skit, a granny fights her fellow senior citizens in a massive nursing home for absolutely no reason. Nothing is safe from the geniuses behind the show. They even find ways to make children's franchises such as the Carebears and Clifford the Big Red Dog excessively violent. There's way too much to even go to detail on but if you like senseless violence and carnage, this show is for you!
