This movie/series is horrible. It has horrific acting, plot, and effects. If I wanted to teach my children about God, I would, as others mentioned, get Veggietales. Not this stuff. There are so many inconsistencies in the story and ideas; so much of it makes no sense or is completely stupid. The unrealistic situations that Bibleman's little kiddie pals are stuck in don't help either. It also taught me that even if it's bad to lie, cheat, be prideful, or be angry, it's just fine to fight people with lightsabers! I mean, there are so many people commenting on this movie, and we're all saying basically the same thing, but with even more reasons to hate it tagged on. If you actually watch an episode of this stuff, you will see what we are all talking about. Trust me, you don't want to see this, and your kids don't either.
