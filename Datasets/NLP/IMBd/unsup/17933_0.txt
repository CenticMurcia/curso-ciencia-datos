What a wonderful film! Basically unknown actors who can act and write and direct!! This film was a pleasure to watch and it made me wonder why they haven't put another film together? The dialog is superb. Such lines as the lead, Tom Bastounes, who also co-wrote the script, saying to his long lost love, played by Monica Zaffarano, "You've haunted me for 15 years. Why don't I haunt you." I saw this movie on Showtime. If you get a chance to view it, do so. As it did me, it will make you say, Bastounes, Zaffarino. Who are these people? Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!!
