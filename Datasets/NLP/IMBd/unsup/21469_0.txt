To me, this was Joan at her best! Some of the things she says are so true about men. BUT, we are not items you purchase and own and nothing lasts with ALL of her thoughts in this movie. Harriet was insecure to say the least. Her father sat the pace for any other relationships in her life. She could not stand the neighbor or the neighbor's child due to her insecurities. She also had issues with her cousin and went on a mission to ruin her relationship as well. I've seen Ellen Corby many times but Joan made her cry early in the picture and if Ellen was seeking self-esteem, she took the wrong JOB!<br /><br />HOW CAN I BUY THIS. I WANT TO SEE IT WITHOUT COMMERCIALS!
