I admit I wasn't blown away by High School Musical 2's stankocity, especially since they stole the plot from and summer special of Saved by the Bell, (and a word of advice to the writer and producers of HSM2: DON'T GET PLOT IDEAS FROM SUGAR-CRAZED CHILDREN!!!). <br /><br />I was severely disappointed though with the musical score which was jaw-droppingly awful. It was too Britney Spears meats Justin Timberlake. And that's okay, but not in a musical that's suppost to be realistic. <br /><br />And another thing! The only reason High School Musical was such a hit was because it wasn't like a real Broadway musical where they sing to each other and it's so corny. It was more of teenagers who like to perform teenagers. But HSM2 was like a basic whiny musical, except most whiny musicals have good acting and dialog. <br /><br />Also they should not have given Zac Efron his own songs to sing this time. Because frankly, he is a choir boy singer. he has a nice voice when he is singing those remedial notes, but give him some actual soaring notes and he will croak like a frog because he does not posses the range. Of course it sounded like he did in the first movie, (only because they morphed his voice with Andrew Seeley, a very accomplished singer), but then the producer let Zac sing on his own and all the songs were low key because Zac can't hit any good notes.<br /><br />The plot was jacked and stupid and pointless. THe ending was horrific at best. THere was only one good song in the movie and it was too depressing for me to even enjoy.<br /><br />In the end i believe it would have been best to just have a High School Musical Christmas special than this complete-waste-of-a-time sequel. I give this movie one star since it is not possible to give it none.
