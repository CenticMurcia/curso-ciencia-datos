Comment 1: I had to stop watching the movie after i heard the line, 'Do I have to swallow John Stamos's Semen?' i , i, I could not finish this movie and i am mad that i cannot punch Chris Seaver in his throat hole. My movie companion will not let me forget that i picked movie. I am Sorry, Sorry, Sorry. Comment 2:the hideousness of this "movie" will haunt my dreams forever. Was there a director? I don't know. Random scenes of nonsense that couldn't hold the attention of people stupid enough to pay for this movie. Boo to you. All IN ALL, I SHOULD NOT HAVE, and SEAVER, I HOPE YOU ARE HAPPY WITH EVEN GETTING A RESPONSE, GOOD OR BAD. I NOW KNOW WHAT A GOOD MOVIE IS!!!!!!!!!
