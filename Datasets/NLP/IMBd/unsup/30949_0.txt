I read about this movie in a magazine in my country, Argentina. The critics had voted "Gas, food, lodging" as the best movie in 1992 or 1993, I can't remember. As I haven't seen it at the theaters, I had to wait a few years till was shown in cable TV, quite late I must say. I usually agree with the critics that voted it, but I was really skeptic as was not a hit at all... but they were right again. Wonderful movie, a touching Fairuza Balk that appeared to be a future star and ended making small parts or characters too much below her. I became quite a fan of this film, and as I have just registered here I decided not only to vote but to write a few lines about it. Please don't miss it. It is not only another indie film but a great movie.
