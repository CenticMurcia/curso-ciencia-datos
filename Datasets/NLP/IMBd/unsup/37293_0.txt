Now,I'm 14 so I haven't seen many good mondos in my life.But,this is by far one of the best mondos I've seen yet.Traces of Death and Faces of Death are similar,but have one thing different.In FOD,the narrator explains what is going on,whereas the narrator in TOD,doesn't say much.Also,Faces of Death has about 85% of the footage faked.From what I hear about this movie in particular is that most or all of this is real.My problem with these types of movies is if they are real or not.This looks more realistic then Faces of Death.<br /><br />Like Faces of Death there are many "disturbing" scenes and recordings.Animal slaughter,murders,suicides,autopsies.There is just about the same amount of gore and violence as FOd,but this seems to have more of an edge.Faces of Death was a bit too dull.I'm still watching the movie,so something might change.But so far,this movie is very good with keeping me watching,except I'm not at the point of throwing up.But,the only thing that almost got me there was the autopsies.Pretty disturbing and graphic.I think these series would have been a lot better off without the animal slaughters. ______________________________ EDIT:Okay,I'm past the half way mark,and all I have to say is,this is just about as boring as Faces of Death.It's like watching a whole bunch of FOD shorts throw together.A guy blew his brains out with a hand gun,race track accidents,more autotopsies,a sex change operation,brain surgery,crime scene pictures and so on.The final clips shown in the movie,was the classic tourist killed by lions and one last autotopsy.This movie was a big disappointment.It's an okay mondo,but nothing even close to a snuff.If you want a good mondo,go watch the Guinea Pig series.It will make you sick,but keep you watching at the same time.
