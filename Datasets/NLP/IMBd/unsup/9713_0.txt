You get a lot for your money here: about an hour and three-quarters of Bonnie Raitt songs, her hits and otherwise. Just about every song is a winner because her voice fits her blues- rock material extremely well and her band is outstanding. She comments at one point about her band being the "best" their is, and she may not be far off. <br /><br />There is so much music here I often break this up into a couple of viewings, but no matter where I pick this back up in the concert, it's a good starting point because it's simply one good song after another. You'd except a dud here or there, but it's just not the case.<br /><br />The first part of the concert has more upbeat songs, so it you want a 45-minute fast-moving mini-concert, the first nine songs will do well. It's a good workout disc, too! Later on, Raitt goes through several slow songs in a row and the tape ends with the slow-but-dramatic "Angel From Montgomery."<br /><br />Guests include Bruce Hornsby, Jackson Browne, Bryan Adams, Kim Wilson and the old blues couple Ruth and Charles Brown. All of them are excellent, as well. <br /><br />The only thing missing in this DVD is more colorful camera-work. That would have really made this a spectacular concert disc. Hey, the the music is the main attraction here anyway, so I am not complaining. I used to own this on VHS but acquired the DVD because of the better sound. <br /><br />Obviously, this is very highly recommended.
