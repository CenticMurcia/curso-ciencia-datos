I have only seen half of this film and i have to say that I was very surprised at what I was watching. I guessed the ending and later I found I was correct, all the 'laughs' I had seen and heard before and I sat there completely board as though I was staring at a blank screen. However, I've seen plenty of films like that before so why was I so surprised at this one? For the simple fact that had this film been reversed and it was a black man coming into a white family, no one could have gotten away with it. I am a strong believer that racial abuse of any kind is unforgivable, but why doesn't the door swing both ways? Why is it perfectly acceptable in a film for a black family not to want a white person in it but not the other way around. As a young white girl, I find this outrageous and am very surprised that it would seem either many people don't see my view or do and are too chicken to raise the point
