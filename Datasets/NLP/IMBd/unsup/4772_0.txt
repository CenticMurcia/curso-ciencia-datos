The Woods is a solid,eerily effective ghost story,it boasts very good acting,a decent plot and a good setting.there are some special effects, but not as much as you would expect,which is a refreshing change for this genre.this is not a slasher flick.the movie is very character driven,and so is very dramatic,and is a bit slow at times,but not enough to lose interest.the only weak spot is near the end of the movie,but i won't give it away.the movie relies more on suspense and psychological scares than gore,another positive.this is not the best movie of the genre,but it is certainly on of the better.for those who like a little gore in their movies,it may not be your cup of tea.but then again,this is a different type of movie which doesn't require gore to tell its story.all in all a good offering. A strong 7* out of 10
