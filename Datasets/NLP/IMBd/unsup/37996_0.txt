For years, I've read of this soft-porn parody of Flash Gordon since it was advertised as one of several midnight movies listed as being at the (now defunct) Cinema 8 at the (also folded) Bon Marche Mall. While I've had it on tape for years, I've only now gotten to seeing it. The verdict: While there were some amusing scenes and dialogue and maybe some good nude scenes, I found most of it a bore. The acting, direction, and script had such an amateurish feeling that after a while I just simply wanted it to end. I did like many of the stop-motion creatures that recall Ray Harryhausen and his mentor Willis O'Brien at their most creative. I guess overall, this was too silly for my tastes. Worth a look at least once is all I can recommended for Flesh Gordon.
