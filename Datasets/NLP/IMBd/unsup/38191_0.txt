Delta Force 2 (1990) was a sequel that was a little too late. With Cannon all but a memory, the crew decided to make one more Delta Force movie starring an aging Chuck Norris. This time the story deals with drug running and the cocaine king-pins of Central America. Alas, this one is nowhere in the league of part one. It doesn't work, period. I mean why would the U.S. Government care about apprehending drug lords in some tiny country in Latin America? The movie is by the numbers, late 80's/ early 90's Chuck Norris action vehicle.<br /><br />I don't know why the called it Delta Force 2. The movie is unworthy of this title. Maybe they thought they could get a few more rentals by tying this movie in with the original Delta Force. All of the elements that made part one enjoyable are missing. Don't waste your time on such video tripe. Because it's not worth it.<br /><br />Not recommended, best to avoid!
