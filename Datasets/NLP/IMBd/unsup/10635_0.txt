One of Bette's best roles, too bad is not available on vhs/dvd yet. This is her first film after her 18 years contract with Warner Bros. ended, and it proved once again what she could do with a meaty part. Besides her deeply felt performance, the most interesting aspect of the film is the excellent direction by Curtis Bernhardt (A Stolen Life) and great camera work by Leo Tover (The Heiress). Watch the way the flashback scenes were shot, they are among the best ever filmed. This is still, a timeless story about about the devastating effects of a divorce. Great script and beautiful music score, this is a hidden treasure, and one of Bette's best films.
