I can only say that this movie is the result of horrendous research. Even though Dylan, Jason and Korey claim that they have spent 3 years researching 9/11, they still got a lot of facts wrong:<br /><br />1. AA Flight 77 that hit the Pentagon is a Boing 757 (they got that right) - but it does not have a Pratt&Whitney as claimed in Loose Change - it has a Rolls Royce engine. <br /><br />2. The voice morphing technology they claim the government uses for faking the phone calls is not ready for LIVE conversations. The technology is only able to morph recorded voices. It's evident that the conversations that the passengers had with their loved ones were live conversations.<br /><br />3. Most of the calls were carried out on air-phones and not cell phones<br /><br />4. The movie claims that $167 billion in gold was stolen from the basement beneath WTC 7. This is more than 50% of the gold in the entire world at that point. Do you have any idea of the logistics that would be needed to transport that amount of gold?<br /><br />5. It claims that Osama Bin Laden is not wearing rings where in fact numerous photos show Bin Laden wearing rings.<br /><br />And there is probably a lot more. But that's not all - the "documentary" uses every trick in the book called "how to manipulate the viewer":<br /><br />1. They leave out the thousands of facts that speak against the conspiracy <br /><br />2. They leave out the many expert reports that support the official 9/11 report <br /><br />3. They take quotes from witness testimonies out of context <br /><br />4. They leave out testimonies from thousands of witnesses that don't support the claims made in Loose Change <br /><br />5. They make a lot of assumptions and conjecture that fit their purpose <br /><br />6. They never substantiate their claims. They just throw their claims at you as if they were facts.<br /><br />The worst part of the "documentary" is the "fake phone calls" part. It really, really aggravates me to hear them mocking the victims of 9/11 - and then they have the audacity to dedicate the movie to them afterward. That pisses me off a great deal.
