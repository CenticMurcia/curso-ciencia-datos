I expected more of this movie when watching it. Lindsay Lohan is, or more rather was, a pretty decent actress, and there's no doubt she was heading to the top. But this movie was almost unbearable to sit through.<br /><br />The commercials stated this was about a young girl who's blown her drama way out of proportion, but wanted more than everything to become a star. But clearly when watching this movie, you realize, she's just a spoiled teenager, who wants what she wants, and will do anything to have it that way.<br /><br />When Elizabeth Cep moves away from her home city, New York, and moves to New Jersey, (Oh, that's a heart breaker...) she has to make up lies for her to make new friends, and impress the other spoiled people of her new school. She's so dramatic, that she has to change her name to Lola, and the movie never explains why that was. This movie leans toward Lola becoming a actress, but then completely turns off that subject, when Lola discovers her favorite band is going to be in New York, and absolutely has to be back for the ultimate concert, dragging her best friend along with her.<br /><br />This movie completely pulls away from what it was suppose to be about, containing one or two laughs, and a completely preposterous storyline.
