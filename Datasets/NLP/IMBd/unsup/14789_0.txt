This is the only movie in the world that made me cry so much. This isn't your conventional love story, and yet it will leave a mark.<br /><br />Though there are subplots in the movie, it's not as complicated. It blended very well in the main story. The setting of the place also blended very well in the story.<br /><br />Kal Ho Naa Ho is a good combination of drama & comedy, unlike the so-called "dramedy" movies which aren't funny or what at all.<br /><br />Shah Rukh Khan's acting was superb. Wait, he didn't act at all, he let Aman (his character) enter his body and he became Aman. Preity Zinta did an excellent job. Karan Johar made a good choice of choosing her. To be honest, if Kareena Kapoor would be Naina, it would not make an impact at all. Saif Ali Khan blew my mind off! He's amazing! I was impressed, I can totally relate to his character. Overall, the main actors were 11 out of 10.<br /><br />Overall, Kal Ho Naa Ho is the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. A perfect film for everyone. Anyone can relate to this story, even the stone hearted will cry to the highest level when they see this. This movie made me proud that I'm an Asian & that Bollywood is better than Hollywood.
