Although it's been a long time since i actually saw this movie, i have not forgotten the "plot." The movie had a bad storyline to begin with, and the only thing that could've helped it is if they destroyed all evidence that it was made in the first place. I appreciated the whole "guy broods over his lover's murder/death/disappearance" sort of thing (think Josh Hartnett in "Wicker Park") up until i saw this movie. What was with the trial? the death penalty thing? i don't even think that anything really happened in this movie. My vision of Jake Gyllenhall has been completely skewed because of this movie. Now it just seems like all his characters are the same: dark, brooding, mysterious. (and what was with him still living with his girl's parents? can someone say loser?) Whatever. Going to movies will never be the same.
