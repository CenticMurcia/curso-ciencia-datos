I have no idea why some of the reviews I've seen on both IMDb and netflix are positive to this movie. Perhaps it is because friends of the filmmaker wrote in. Because I can only use 1,000 words to denigrate this film, I will try to be curt: First, for this film to be effective on any level (comedy, social satire, politically, whatever) it would have to have some basis in truth. In other words, the filmmaker should have interviewed historians, sociologists, and other intellectuals who could have drawn some reasonable projection on what modern day America would have looked like had the south won the war.<br /><br />The fact that the filmmaker concluded that there would have been one country was so ludicrous, he lost all credibility.<br /><br />Therefore, the mock commercials that ran through this movie were not only unfunny - but totally stupid given that no reality had been adequately established in this movie.<br /><br />The various vignettes (lincoln being a black-faced escapee) were dull, stupid, reaching and clearly designed for the filmmakers hopes of becoming a staff writer on SNL or Mad TV.<br /><br />Spike Lee is a very talented filmmaker and should not be faulted for producing this movie. He probably had little involvement and was busy shooting his Clive Owen, Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster film INSIDE MAN - a movie TOTALLY worth watching.<br /><br />But this is simply tripe. Beware good reviews. They're probably friends of the filmmaker. This movie was not funny in the least, had no real insight to what ACTUALLY would have happened if the south won the war, and is a totally gigantic WHO CARES??????
