OK, first of all. I was searching through all of Eric Roberts movies..wait! Let me finish!....to find out who the Spanish chick was in this movie. (the wife of the badass guy). I finally found out who it was and thank god i did because if i had to look at another terrible movie starring Julia Roberts brother, i was gonna pass out. As you probably already know, this movie is terrible. I mean, its such a joke and basically a spoof off a good crime/action flick. ITs laughable. Why is that no Eric Roberts movie on here has gotten more than an avg. vote of 6? Why is is that almost every movie he does has 3.3 avg? Well, its because Eric Roberts is made out of garbage. No, seriously, he drips empty soda cans and banana peels from his pockets because he literally is garbage. How many c- action flicks is the guy gonna make with the same premise? He's a rebel who still is mainly good inside but he gets in too deep and along the way gets to f**k insanely hot chicks. Why? Because he gets them cast in the movie for himself. How else do you explain all his movies having insanley attractive ladies? He knows his movies are jokes so he figures he might as well have some fun in the middle of making something terrible, which is every movie in which he was the star. If you haven't figured it out by now, i hate Eric Roberts. The guy has no talent, he's a piece of trash and he has never been on the set of a movie worth watching. Richard Grieco thinks this guy is washed up.
