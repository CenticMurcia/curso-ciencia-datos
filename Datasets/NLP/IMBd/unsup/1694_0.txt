For a movie with a lot of silliness, this movie has soul. It's not Citizen Kane but that's not the intention. If you like Pee Wee's Big Adventure or UHF, you'll probably like this. The intent here is to entertain, nothing more...but also, nothing less. And it succeeds.<br /><br />The one word that best describes this film is "whimsical." There is, however, obvious frustration that underlies this film. You can tell that Jittlov is both a fan of watching movies as well as making them, and it's clear that he is fairly exasperated with the things that get in the way of movie-making.<br /><br />Here, he skewers the excesses of Hollywood, most of which film fans are at least passingly familiar with - unreasonable union regulations (and exclusivity), filming permits, shady film executives, and just getting someone to look at your work and give you a shot.<br /><br />From the start, we're on Jittlov's side. And this is why the movie works. Some of the jokes are corny, but again, they're kind of supposed to be. But there's a lot here that's genuinely funny too.<br /><br />Mostly though this is a visual treat. The film is packed with visuals - even the sets (Jittlov's room for example) are interesting to look at. From riding a suitcase through Los Angeles to running pretty much literally around the world at high speed, the uncynical love for "movie magic" shines through.<br /><br />And it would be wrong not to mention the presence of J.R. "BoB" Dobbs, the one true living slackmaster, stenciled on the side of a van. And this is appropriate because this is definitely a film about the film industry as an extension of The Conspiracy, stealing the slack away from the passionate, creative people who just want to make an honest film.<br /><br />Mike Jittlov - I know you must look at the comments here and I want you to know, I'm on your side. Thanks for making this movie. It was a lot of fun. Sorry about the suits. Sorry about the soul-sucking "Con." And I hope you get an opportunity to make something else for us soon! This movie is a pure-hearted anthem for every independent film maker or effects guy ever who just wanted to do it for the love of it. And it's a hoot. If you're looking for something light but entertaining and visually interesting, this would be a good pick.
