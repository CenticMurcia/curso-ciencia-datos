Paul W.S. Anderson doesn't disappoint. Death Race is his goriest film since Event Horizon and definitely right up with his most impressive looking films. Compared to some of the more serious films he's made (Shopping, Event Horizon, Soldier) Death Race perhaps falls behind in its substance but makes up for it in texture.<br /><br />The driving sequences were varied and colourful to watch. The atmosphere is excellent and the fact that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously helps you accept the film's ludicrous setup. The gore definitely also makes the movie stand out but luckily not in a bad way. All the Paul Anderson trade-marks are here: the look, the sound and even the slightly over-the-top dialogue.<br /><br />Where the movie manages to pull through definitely is the closure. The casting also proves interesting and satisfying and the performances luckily have a little bit more colour to them than in some of Anderson's past films.<br /><br />Death Race is an interesting, action-packed film with enough serious weight behind it to keep the film's more ridiculous aspects from distracting the viewing experience. If Anderson was looking to make a great homage to a cult film, he's done it, but he's also managed to crunch out one of my personal cinematic highlights of the year.
