I watched Dracula's Daughter somtime ago and i found it to be a very good film. The film is directed by Jess Franco, who has made many films with sex and female nudity in them. The story is about a young woman(Britt Nichols) goes to visit her very ill grandmother. whilst on her death bed at her family estate, she tells her granddaughter a horrible curse that all the rest of her family are all vampires. The granddaughter decidses to move into the house with her cousin and her uncle.<br /><br />Not long after moving in some of the local village people fall victims to her, the film includes quite a bit of female nudity, lesbianisam, and lesbian sex. I think that it is a very good made film that also features some good actors including (Howard Vernon) who plays Count Karstien. Also Jess Franco plays a part in the film. This film is a very rarely shown much. A very good film though..
