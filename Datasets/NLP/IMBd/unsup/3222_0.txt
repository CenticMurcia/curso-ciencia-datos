This magnificent film about Liza Minnelli is one of the best films showcasing a popular entertainer at her prime. Bob Fosse directed with a keen eye and great panache. He gets the viewer involved in the performance and what the star is trying to accomplish. The music material by Kander and Ebb never sounded to poignant and fresh, as interpreted by Ms. Minnelli.<br /><br />The late 60s and early 70s brought forth an unusual talent, Liza Minnelli. She was at the time at the best moment of her career. She had a voice, youth, and she could move well, following Bob Fosse's choreography, designed to enhance the presentation.<br /><br />The film has been kept in mint condition and just recently released on cable. Fans of Liza Minnelli can rejoice in rediscovering that vibrant entertainer showing her public why she was a star on her own right.
