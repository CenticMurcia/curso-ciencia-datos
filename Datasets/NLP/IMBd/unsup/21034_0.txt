A friend has been insisting for over a year that I see this movie. I finally shelled out my hard earned money and all I can wonder is why bother? It's quite surprising that this film scored a 7.6 out of 10 with viewers. Director Troy Duffy is a film buff but the quality of this work is lacking. The main problem that I have with this film is the meandering plot. The script wanders aimlessly from one incident to the next without any real plot development. The conventional use of flashbacks and slow motion become rather mundane. After the first 10 minutes of the film I began the elaborate process of matching scenes from the Boondock Saints to other films. I think that director Troy Duffy should really consider the script for his next work and ditch the cinematic pitfalls that plague this film. Character and plot development will go a lot further than the use of the F-word 50 times in one scene. After a while it just becomes tiresome. The film ended with some rather interesting faux documentary interviews with the typical man on the street. Unfortunately, as the saying goes, it was too little too late. If you want to see a film that deals with the same subject matter then rent Leon: The Professional. Don't waste yr time with The Boondock Saints.
