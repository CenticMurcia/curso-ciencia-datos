Someone wakes me up when something starts happening. Other<br /><br />than Kathryn Witt's form fitting 80's jeans I see no reason to bother<br /><br />with this stinker. Seems to have been fashioned as an excuse to<br /><br />shoot a bunch of footage with one of those helicopter engine<br /><br />pontoon swamp boats & discussion scenes at a Hawaiian tourist<br /><br />resort during an off-season winter lull. I also love how the<br /><br />hero/heroine are thrown out of the resort one scene & the next<br /><br />they go back to have a drink. THEN they get thrown out again, and<br /><br />are back four scenes later since that was the best set they had.<br /><br />I love low budget horror trash as much as anyone else, but<br /><br />something ought to happen every once in a while, and if you are<br /><br />going to have an attractive woman play a herpatologist in a horror<br /><br />film she had better be seen at least topless & getting far more out<br /><br />of her career than she bargained on, or you have blown it.<br /><br />As for the monster suit, heh, I thought it was kind of fun to see<br /><br />someone not even bother to make something that looked "realistic" -- Kind of like Lamberto Bava's MONSTER SHARK, but<br /><br />without any point to it & lacking that movie's ridiculous<br /><br />entertainment value.<br /><br />Best line: "It takes two to mate."
