I agree about the ending song, "Darkness, Darkness." Best thing about the movie IMO. Here's what I've found out -- the song was written by Jesse Colin Young (of the Youngbloods...wrote the 60s anthem "Get Together" as well). I found a used copy of Jesse Colin Young's Greatest Hits and it's on there, but his version pales in comparison to Lisa Torban's. She's the artist that does the song on the movie. She seems to have vanished. Had a web site, but it's gone. The ONLY place to get this recording that I have found is on the movie soundtrack, which sells for something like $50 on amazon. I guess it's now a collector's item or something.<br /><br />I tried searching for a download, hoping, hoping, but nada. I sing folk locally and would love to do a version of this song. Have the lyrics. Guess I'll have to come up with my own take on the melody. If you find out any more, please let me know! Georgene
