I loved this film! It presents a side of the Katrina disaster that wasn't covered as well as it could've been, and serves as a warning that this sort of thing could happen again if we're not proactive and vigilant.<br /><br />Tom McPhee presents this sensitive subject matter in a very non-sensational way, covering all the bases as he does so. His interviews with those who lost pets, those who helped return lost pets and those who stood in their way were both professional and unbiased.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the music used in the film. Not only is it engaging, it helps tell the story. Now when I hear a song from the movie, I'm immediately reminded of the scene in which it was heard.<br /><br />More than anything else, this wonderful film is a call to action for all pet owners to make sure that they're prepared to include the four-legged, slithery or feathered members of their families in their emergency preparedness plans, and to make sure their communities are planning for pets, too.<br /><br />"An American Opera" is a film I can wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who cares about animals and their welfare. It has it's intense moments, so parents will want to screen it before showing it to younger children. It's a great movie, and an important historical document.
