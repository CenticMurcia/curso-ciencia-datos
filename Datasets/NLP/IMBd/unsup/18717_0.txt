Dear IMDb user,<br /><br />You may have seen trash movies, but u never saw Yor. U may have seen special effects so trashy u wanted to rip your eyes off, but u never saw Yor. You surely did enjoy thrash battle movements BUT you have never seen Yor!!!<br /><br />Man first, there are 2 different moves that Yor, the hero can perform with his stone axe, but guess what..... its one too much :D. Yor perfectly beats dinosaurs, cyborgs from future, etc. with an axe swinger from right to left!!!! This move is so stylish trashy and breaks all film fight rules ever created, one point why i love this movie :D . At one scene Yor changes tactics he performs a axe block, this is very surprising because at this point the Viewer might believe with an axe swinger you will be able to conquer the whole world;) .<br /><br />Secondly, Yors silly smile at different points of the movie... he jumps right in front of the camera, performs his sensational smile, at the beginning beats a dinosaur to death( guess with what move :D:D:D) and rescues a lady, performing again such an lusty smile, i think the lady got the message how to repay Yor for her rescue;)<br /><br />The Story doesn't count much (its easy to follow it) but gets some really thrashy plot changes. The sets are most of the time boring, few are good(indicates that some guys on the set knew their job ;) <br /><br />I recommend this movie to all the trash movie fans out there, but even to Hollywood fanatics with their good film chatter to watch and learn, because its a difference to create a "pro made" 200 million dollar trash film or to create the one and only "Yor" Film which surely has the best trash style ever seen on screen ;)
