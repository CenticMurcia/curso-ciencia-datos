This move is charming, moving, and altogether enthralling... but never does it patronize its audience by trying too hard to egg any emotion out of you. The film's subtlety is brilliant. It manages to be emotional but not sappy. Everyone's acting is just right. The young man who played 12-year-old Vitus might as well be the child prodigy portrayed in the movie, for he actually plays the piano in every scene. If he was cast just for his musical talent, then the director of the movie got lucky, because man can he act! Also of note are the performances delivered by the boys grandfather and his mother. All of these are, once again, pitch perfect and never over done. If you saw "Autumn Rush" and wanted to gag at its cheesiness, this is the antidote. And to think I had never heard of it before I rented it.
