Of course this film could have been better. It explains pretty well the situation of the Umbrella Corporation and it's lethal intentions. The action is okay and the plot is simple enough. However I was slightly unsatisfied. As much as I like Milla Jovovich, I think this could have been a much more successful franchise if Jill Valentine was kept the main character, not some fictitious woman caught in the middle. Jovovich's character adds mystery to the film, it may be gory and concentrated on violence and heavy metal music background, but it is still interesting and you will be curious as to what's going to happen. The only characters I wanted to see live were Alice and her friend who is transformed into Nemesis at the end, and there is little chemistry between characters until the action gets going. A bad side to this film is the CGI tongue-licker creature, paper-marcher anyone?
