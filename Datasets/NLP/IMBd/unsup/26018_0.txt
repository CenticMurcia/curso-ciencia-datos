The far inferior "Hollow Man 2" begins with the brutal slaying of a molecular biologist by a new Hollow Man who is desperately searching of a serum that will keep him alive while invisible. Another biologist, previously working on a secret government project, is being protected by a detective who is forced to battle the transparent assassin while the government tries to track him down. As it turns out, he was a soldier who was meant to be "the ultimate weapon" for the military with a specific agenda but after neglecting to give him the serum, the whole project went awry. This sequel is far less gory than the original with much weaker effects and a very typical premise. Christian Slater plays the Hollow Man, who must have just shown up for a day of filming, some voice recording, and a paycheck. This is just a sucky part 2 and difficult movie to get into, unlike the first one. Lets hope the sequels end here... "Hollow Man" deserved a better follow-up than this...
