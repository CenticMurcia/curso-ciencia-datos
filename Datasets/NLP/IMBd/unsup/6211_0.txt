"Calendar Girls" is an amusing comedy of the sort that the British have done very well during the past 50 years. Helen Mirren (Chris) and Julie Waters (Annie) are excellent as the two best friends who execute Chris' idea of a nude calendar to raise funds for the leukemia wing of the hospital where Annie's husband died. Like many British films centered on areas outside London, it brings in accents that are difficult for these American ears. I've often wished that the British would add subtitles at some points so that I'd know what's being said. That may sound ridiculous but the PBS News Hour and occasionally CNN do it regularly when Iraqis or Pakistanis or Afghans, for example, are being interviewed in English that is hard for viewers to understand. Although the story is easy to follow, there were some scenes where my wife and I lost lines of dialog because of impenetrable accents. Even though I've spent a fair amount of time in England, I confess that I'm often baffled by North Country and Midlands accents. Perhaps in exchange we could provide British audiences with subtitles for regional accents in the U.S.
