All the things that come to my mind, when I think to David Lean, are reunited in this movie:<br /><br />Bigger than life locations (here: Africa, Cambodia, Tchetchenia) Bigger than life love story (here, Lara's song has been changed into a piano theme) Bigger than life actors (Angelina shows another time all her talent) Bigger than life scenes (here, it's not a bridge which explodes)<br /><br />So, if you like Doctor Jivago, Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge upon Kwai River, you will like this movie.... <br /><br />... Except we are in XXI century.... and (American) Movies in XXI century mean digital effects...<br /><br />So, the desert looks like Mars, snow becomes a black and white illusion, and starving babies are real babies "edited" by computers. The director recognizes the production pulled the moral line, and debating more over wouldn't be reviewing this movie anymore.<br /><br />In conclusion, a great movie which succeeds to give its message, all the more crucial actually after the tragedy in Asia....
