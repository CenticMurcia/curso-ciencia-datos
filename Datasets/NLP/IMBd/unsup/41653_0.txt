Ridiculous things occur through the film which is enough to warrant a 1 even if (and it wasn't) the acting/directing/camera work etc was top notch.<br /><br />I must admit the most amusing part was when I correctly guessed the little doggy had something to do with he whole thing, I couldn't believe I was right, I was laughing, that was the first time I have ever laughed at a movie! THere are other random crap this movie tosses around, though I must admit the final scene did have me 'like wt?' for a couple of seconds thinking 'oh god this movie just hit the absolute pinnacle of stupidity' however soon I realized that it was just a twist like ending. <br /><br />If you care to find out the ending read on (you wont be upset if you watch the movie afterward since its going to be hard enough to hate it more than you can).<br /><br />******* crappy spoiler *********************<br /><br />Well basically the bad guy is on top of a train with the protagonists daughter suddenly his sister who died (as you find in the opening sequence) appears, which was pathetic, I mean for a while we thought he was some ghost then we realize he's really a man but now the movie has gone back to ghosts? Thats the part I meant was pinnacle of stupidity, however straight after that you discover its the protagonist with a wig, that caught me off, perhaps i was laughing too hard to notice?
