Not bad action, but Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting is shockingly awful.<br /><br />What "acting skills"? <br /><br />I rarely watch Arnie movies, because they're usually all action and no plot, just one head bad guy against another head bad guy, and his hench-men shooting it out, until Arnie steps in.<br /><br />Tedious, just like Bruce Willis films. But because I was bored I gave this film a shot (pardon the pun).<br /><br />The start is very good. A brilliant shoot-out on a group of plain clothes policemen, protecting a witness against a mafia boss.<br /><br />Then there's loads of dialogue, more action, but ultimately, it's Arnie's acting who makes me give this film a 2 out of 10. It's just bad bad bad. It's also filled with 1980s' pap pop music, which sucks.<br /><br />That said, with say a better actor, such as Clint Eastwood in the role, instead or Arnie, then maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10 for this movie.
