As usual the trailer for this movie was more exciting than the movie itself! There are lot of moments that are creepy! But there also are a lot of scenes that are simply annoying! This is because the plot is very thin! When there are enough scares I don't really care about the plot! And if only the lack of suspense or story would get compensated by drama or action or even comedy than it would be great! But this is not the case! "Colic" isn't very scary! There is lack of drama (and no humor at all)! Example: The mother of the main character dies very sudden! No tears,no crying except for the baby! No funeral! No real conversations between the husband and wife about what happened! There is no show of emotion like nothing is wrong! And this is the main problem! Something bad happens and things go back to normal without any change! Sure you see the parents of the baby searching for help to cure the baby,but that's it! They visit a priest but he is not really helpful! The absence of a real dialog (especially) between the husband and wife makes it difficult to care for these persons! The explanation at the end makes it all worse! At least they could have come up with something better! The only thing that really was outstanding was the sound! The sound is the major reason that this horror is worth watching! But overall it is very average!
