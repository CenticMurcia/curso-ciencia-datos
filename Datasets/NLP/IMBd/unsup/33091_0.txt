Obviously this movie is a bit of a fantasy, which is fine. This movie could have been funnier. There were moments that made us laugh, but then those moments just fizzled out.<br /><br />I realize that the wig has been getting a lot of mention on here, and the thing isÂ… it is just SO bad. Hailey looks better with her real hair. There are so many close ups on the wig that you can't help but notice that it isn't her real hair. It distracts from the movie and makes the viewer ask questions. Was her character supposed to be wearing wig for unknown plot purposes? Will she at any moment tear off the wig Scooby Doo style to reveal she is someone else? Was Hailey a brunette at the time and the script called for a blond? Would it be so bad if the character had dark hair? Why did they choose wig with such BIG hair? Anyway, the lighting was really good and the set designer really did follow the "pink" theme. It does look like everyone had fun making this movie.<br /><br />In conclusion: It isn't good and it isn't "soooo bad you have to see it."
