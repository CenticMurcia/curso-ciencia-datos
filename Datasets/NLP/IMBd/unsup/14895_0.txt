Well ,here is to those who didn't appreciate the movie . In order to really appreciate the movie u need to feel it !!!! I am from India where things like these often happen and i can connect to the movie . Nick's passion to help, Sara's state of silent acceptation and disturbed emotions are what i can connect to. People comment that the director is confused over what he wants the movie to portray as - politically-minded "message movie", or romantic epic .. but its OK for it to be multifaceted isn't it, after all our life is not about dealing single issues at a time...... its a jumble . Thats what the MOVIE portrays !!! Its a beautiful movie .. with blunt and raw emotions that really question u if have done anything as near as what Sara n Nick have !!!! and if cant appreciate the beauty of that then u don't deserve to watch the movie .
