Bad script and writing makes this a sometimes interminable movie to watch. How long will it take the victims to figure out the scheme of the vicious girl friend? And how dense can people be? This sweet young thing in the likes of Jennie Garth is so obvious it would take an idiot or rather horny devil to figure her out. She's that obvious. Garth's performance is a one level pursed lips performance. No chemistry. I'd drop her too. Tim Matheson, usually a good actor, is stuck in a vacant role of a husband who stands around looking mystified. Even to the point of his wife and son losing it all. Peter Facinelli is not too bad as another victim of our shady little ing√©nue. Bears a strong resemblance to Dan Futterman. Nice to see Georgann Johnson back on the tube. Since days of Mr. Peepers. She and Michael Fairman play grandparents, if you can imagine that. Also nice to see Leigh Taylor Young back on the screen. Looking very lovely and playing the wife with a nice quality you can't blame anyone for wanting her instead of the little witch. Rod Hardy (no relation to Andy) directed as best he could with a lousy script. Three stars for Young, Johnson and Facinelli. Sorry Tim. Saw this again and stick by my original critique. Garth is dreadful, even more so second time around. Tim still the loser and the wonderful likes of Johnson, Taylor-Young and Facinelli hold their own. Waste of time.
