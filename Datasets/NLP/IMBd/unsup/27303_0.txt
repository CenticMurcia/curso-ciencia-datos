Oh jeez.I sat down one night and watched this on the Friday fright-mare and what a cheesy movie from the freaky 80s.The acting is just fake that you wonder what on earth they were doing in the 80s wasting money on cheap looking scenes. I personally sat down and watched the last 45 minutes of this terrible wasted space. I can't remember what I was doing that I missed the beginning but I was doing something. In the town people with the right intelligence would lock trespassers up but we don't see that here. Michael Moriarity must have gotten laughed at when he played in this. I can't believe he put up with this. People should know better. The vampires in this movie are unrealistic that you just want to turn away from this bad script of a horror night. Never watch anything like this unless you know it is good. I will never watch this ever again due to I will never get back the time they took from me. Start making better remakes people you just have to put your brain to it.
