I just recently saw this movie expecting it to be good and was definitely disappointed to find out that the killer was nothing more than a crocodile. The really sad part is that the sub-plot (the warlord stuff) was better than the main plot. That's pretty sad in my opinion. It was pretty decent with the gore, but it was still kinda disappointing to me. It was also too predictable. I like movies where I'm wrong when I guess what comes next. This one, my predictions were always right. Everything from who gets killed next to the warlord's true id and everything. I know that I gave this movie a 4 and that I am complaining a lot about it, but the gore was pretty good and the sub-plot was pretty decent, so that's why it gets at least a 4.
