I liked Ringu 0 better than Rasen, it explained more about Sadako's history. Which you don't see too much of in any other "Ring" movies. It helped you build a person to person relationship with the character, rather then seeing her as a 'mean' abused child it portrays her as just an abused child. You sort of take pity on her through this movie, rather then thinking she's an evil spirit trying to raise hell. The actress who played Sadako was, what seemed to me, the only person that could play her. I felt they could've mixed in more suspense, and more thrills. That would have made for a better J-horror movie. It doesn't compare to the movies brought out by Tartan Asia Exteme. Such as Tale of Two Sisters, Phone, (Memento Mori, Whispering Corridors, Wishing Stairs) a trilogy, Premonition, H, Oldboy, and many others. If you enjoyed watching Rasen, Ringu 0, Ringu, and Ringu 2, you'll love the Tartan Asia Extreme movies. 'Phone' was my personal favorite, look at the acting of the little girl and you will see why.
