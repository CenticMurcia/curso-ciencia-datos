I saw this movie when it first came out, and was obsessed with it. Boys, kissing, love and everything else was sooo new to me at the time, and this romance b/w Michael and Jessie became the fairytale that I dreamed of. <br /><br />As, I grew up, I never forgot the movie, and actually had an old copy on VHS recorded off the TV that eventually just fell to pieces. Then, a couple of years ago, I decided to look the movie up online, and found it on Amazon. I was elated and yes, I'll say it...giddy! I bought it and watch it every now and then when I want to escape to a simpler, less complicated time, with slumber parties, "Teen Beat" posters on the walls, vinyl records scattered about, slurping on NON-diet sodas and talking with my friends about boys and music and boys!<br /><br />Yup, I love this movie... and Rex paved the way for a lifetime attraction to tall blondes!!! You know... I hadn't seen the movie in about 20 years when I found it on Amazon, and the first time I replayed it...I STILL knew all the songs. That was a clear indication to me of the indelible impression "Sooner or Later" made on that starry-eyed girl of long ago! I am amazed, yet glad to see that there are others out there who love the movie, as well!
