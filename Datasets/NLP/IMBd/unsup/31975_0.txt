I really liked it, scary and violent at the same time. But I have some goofs I would like to report, in the scene where she is putting her groceries away in the fridge, we see her pull out 1,2,3 vitamin waters and stick them all in the same place but when the camera backs up, there is only 2 vitamin waters. Another goof is when in her vision when she is the only one alive, she is driving home but in the background you see a gold car parked in the street. I recommend this movie to the people out there with an obsession to scary movies. It's one of those movies where, at the moment, it seems like a scary part, but it turns out being alright. It is rated R for drug use and language. It would definitely would not be smart to let any child under the age of 12 see this movie.
