The movie versions of Mission Impossible are complete crap that are nothing like the TV series.<br /><br />The movie versions of Mission Impossible turned the TV show's hero (Jim Phelps) into a bad guy and made a character (Ethan Hunt) who wasn't even in the TV series into the hero of the movies. It would be like making a movie adaptation of the A-Team with Colonel Hannibal Smith turning into a bad guy, killing the rest of the team, and then having a totally new character not in the TV series be the hero of the movie.<br /><br />Moreover, the movie versions of Mission Impossible are just another action movie with fancy stunts and big-budget explosions like the James Bond movies. The TV series wasn't about stunts and explosions. The TV series was about cleverly-devised cloak-and-dagger plots to trick the bad guys into turning against each other. The TV series was about outsmarting the bad guys with brains, not beating the bad guys with brawn. In fact, there were probably less punches thrown during the entire TWO TV series than during the Mission Impossible movie.<br /><br />The producers of the Mission Impossible movie just wanted a way to market Tom Cruise in an action movie with fancy gadgets and big-budget explosions, but there are so many of these similar movies that have already been made. So they called it Mission Impossible to lure in fans of the old TV series.<br /><br />If you're just looking for a big-budget remake of a Rambo-type movie, then go ahead and see this movie. But if you're a fan of the Mission Impossible TV series, then don't waste your time on this crap of a movie.
