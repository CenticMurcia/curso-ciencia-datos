Big disappointing waste of time.Very weird. Starts off great introducing Vin Diesel and the setting and setting up the action and basic plot (lots of money spent on sets, too) so it looks like it is going to be a great epic action movie but gets boring about halfway through because the action becomes pointless because you don't know why people are chasing them and killing each other and then the movie simply ends without explaining. Basically it is hinted that the girl being smuggled in has a super killer virus and/or a computerized brain and/or immaculately conceived super twin fetuses inside her. By the end you still don't know if any of that was true and what were the people after her going to do with her once they caught her. It looked like to me that somebody pulled the plug on the movie when it was only half done and so they just edited unfinished scenes together. But there is a rumor is that the European version is 160 minutes long and this American version was cut to only 90 minutes so that is why it is so confusing. I would have added in maybe 5 minutes of somebody simply talking and explaining what was going on instead of having that last chase scene and then she gives birth to twins and then Vin adopts them and then the end???!!!! I mean so what, were they immaculately conceived? do they have super powers? super computer brains? super killer virus in them too?
