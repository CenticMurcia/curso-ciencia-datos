With El Colombian Dream, Felipe Aljure has once again been able to break paradigms as he has demonstrated that it is possible to produce and direct Colombian cinema on a par with any internationally produced film. Tarantino's, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's (Amelie) and the influence of other well-known directors are somehow present in this movie. If you want to see a cruel, black-humored critique of a dreadful aspect of Colombian society, watch this movie. Worth mentioning as well are the actors and actresses that make the cast of the film, virtually unknown in Colombia, but with a great potential to become Colombia's next generation of exportable talent. Trivia fact: the twins were chosen for the six-fingered foot of one of them.
