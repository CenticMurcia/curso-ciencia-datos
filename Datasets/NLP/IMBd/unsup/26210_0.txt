An engaging film about a British murder mystery writer who spends a summer at the French country house of her publisher and gets involved in a murder mystery. Sagnier plays the publisher's daughter and her perky attributes are often on display as she lounges about the swimming pool. Rampling gives a good performance as the writer and, despite pushing sixty, she has the guts to go full frontal. Ozon unfolds the story at a very deliberate pace, showing us what a writer goes through in creating a book. The success of movies like this, where there is a slow buildup to something, really hinges on what that something is. In this case, it is interesting if somewhat unsatisfying.
