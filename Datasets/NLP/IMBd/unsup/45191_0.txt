Fabian looks an awful lot like Michael J Fox. <br /><br />The film was good and it made you realize how much times have changed. Attitudes about marijuana are not nearly as close minded as they were back then. A teacher admits to smoking pot once in his life and he gets called a "dope fiend" by the chief of police. The principal and the coach won't even talk to this man in the hallway anymore because he admitted this. They hold secret meetings about spying on students to catch the dope dealers. Nowadays, schools could care less if a kid or a teacher has smoked pot. Just as long as it isn't interfering with their work, it's ok.<br /><br />I thought Fabian's character was a little over the top. He had too many things going on. One minute he's an art critic who admits to smoking pot, the next he's driving full speed out to meet some people at a drug deal to save a temper-prone, "sensitive" kid's life. And then he really pushes his luck with the hot lady teacher on a blanket by the ocean by literally forcing her to go on a date with him where he makes his moves way too fast. Then when she bails him out of jail, he doesn't dwell on the fact that she spit out $5000 for him, a guy she doesn't even want to talk to..? In the meantime, his voice remains calm while he keeps this very intense look on his face. This guy is all over the place and it doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />I did like the leader of the pot club, however. At first he seemed too much of a clean cut, white, dorky football star to be the drug dealer he was, but as the movie went on, it became more apparent why this "disguise" made sense. He really was a rebellious, pot smokin' jerk, he just didn't wear the costume. That would be too obvious and he was smarter than that.<br /><br />The outcast, teen angsty kid did a good job acting like an idiot. He even had that idiot look in his eye like he is not taking in anything you are saying. When he gets wasted, he really plays the part well!<br /><br />All in all, the movie is worth watching if you can find it. There are good twists and good characters in this film. Fabian's role has too much going on for me to find it realistic, but the other characters are pretty real. It's a teen drama. I wish there had been trippy pot scenes, but they just barely touch on that.
