This was seriously a bad movie. I didn't get the whole story....I don't even think it made any, any sense, especially with the tornado at the end. Acting was bad, story was bad, gore was bad, just PLAIN BAD. It's another of those movies you dislike for not being what you truly expected, and it's because of these movies that people think that the horror genre is trash. I gave it a 3/10, because it was at least a little bit entertaining and it had a few funny moments. Overall, the cast was good looking, but the continuity of the movie sucked! If you have an afternoon to loose, watch this movie and I will guarantee you will regret it!
