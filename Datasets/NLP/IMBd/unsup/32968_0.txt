It is never a good sign when the audience laughs at a film's most dramatic moments - and it happened several times during the screening that I attended of this film.<br /><br />While the film is based on a genuine local legend, the director's strict adherence "this is exactly how it happened" sometimes detracts from the story, since he seems unable to resist stuffing _Lucy Keyes_ with every possible detail of the legend and the current happenings in the town, regardless of whether or not it contributes to the plot. This leads to a lot of loose ends that are never satisfactorily tied together. Overacting, inconsistent tone and shoddy character development plague this film. There are so many plot points that are introduced as big moments but then never play out to any significance that I left the theater extremely irritated by _Lucy Keyes_.
