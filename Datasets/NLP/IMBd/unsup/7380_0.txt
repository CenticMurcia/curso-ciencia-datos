I saw this film last year at a film festival in Livermore CA and I would like to show it to my grandchildren (with proper guidance about the fight scenes). How do I acquire a copy or a download? I brought my husband to see it since he has a non-commercial pilot's license. We very seldom go to the theater and he loved the film. I hope that others would be able to enjoy this adventure flick. There really are people out there that will support a film without graphic sex. Everyone can remember a time in their youth that they unwittingly ended up in a pickle. This is a pretty good film for youth, especially boys. If anyone knows if this film is going to be picked up in the future, let me know.
