Low budget film-making at it's best. Seriously, this movie is everything an indie film should be. Dark and gritty with plenty of nudity, violence, and drug use. No big name actors, either. Fans of Killing Zoe should definitely check this out. <br /><br />Even though Joe Dekko is obviously a real lowlife, you can't help but like him. Colin Gray O'Hara (whom I have never seen in anything else) gives an outstanding performance. Perhaps we will see more of him in the future.<br /><br />This film has been out for quite a while. I keep hoping that someday it will be released on DVD, but I'm not holding my breath. They don't make movies like this anymore.
