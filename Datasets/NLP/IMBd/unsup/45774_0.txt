This movie got a sad fame, when it was rumored both the two main actors (Wayne and Hayward) and the director initiated their cancers from the work in the New Mexico Desert Fall Out area. If it's true or not, it would seem to be a way too hard punishment for making this movie, however only by a small margin. The story of Gengiz Khan given by Wayne is terrible, almost like him watching Jesus being crucified in the "Greatest Story every told". His only costumes fully fitting him was the Cowboy dress of any kind and the Uniforms of any kind, land, sea or air. It's only digestible if you take it as the Kitsch it is.
