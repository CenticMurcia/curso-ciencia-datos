<br /><br />Let me tell You, Norway is a country that is good in many things, but filmmaking is not one of them. 22 is a movie that sucked big time. The structure of it was awful, the murderer was in about three places within five minutes,<br /><br />or so it seemed. No, I won´t waste my time to write anymore about it. Now You folks have been warned. I hope You´re wise enough to take it seriously. Do not see this movie!!<br /><br />
