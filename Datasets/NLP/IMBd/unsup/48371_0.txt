Diane Keaton stars in "Crossed Over," an overly-sentimental film that does not even make an attempt to become anything more than a giant, television "soap" film.<br /><br />Diane Keaton gives no great performance compared to some of her past work, and the rest of the cast members are boring. The direction is confusing and drags out endlessly. I was enthralled when the credits finally started to roll. So many scenes that should and could have been left on the cutting room floor weren't, so instead we are stuck with a two hour soap-fest. I find it hard to believe that the film stays completely true to the book it is based upon, which in turn is based upon real events.<br /><br />I don't really have to go into how preachy and politically correct this film is. It's kind of a no-brainer. Though, I must say, I didn't expect something like "Crossed Over" to be as preachy as it was.<br /><br />"Crossed Over" is another forgettable television film with good potential but an all-too-familar and boring script.<br /><br /> 1.5/5 stars --<br /><br />
