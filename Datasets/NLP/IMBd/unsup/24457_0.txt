Hey i had a hectic past month and then when i was free today, i thought I had earned the right to chill out with my friends, so I caught the noon show of Dhamaal.Well, how was it? From the word go, the director gets into the thick of the action. Short 'n sweet introduction of all the characters is done. <br /><br />And before you know it, you're on a hell of a roller-coaster fun ride. Some scenes left us all shaking with laughter, like the one in which Arshad 'calculates' the velocity of his car and the angle of projection and then throws a stone to check it, or when Riteish falls right into a luxury coach, which as luck would have it, was being hijacked, or the one in which Vijay Raaz talks about patience and going slow and later learns a lesson. All the actors, especially the trio of Javed Jaffery, Riteish and Arshad Warsi show impeccable timing. Maybe I enjoyed it more because I was with my friends, but believe me, it's good to see such a non-stop laugh riot once in a while, however non-sensical!(Deshmukh makes, rather, crafts a gun and frees himself without the carjackers noticing, Sanjay Dutt jumps off the cliff and grabs the two falling children. Simply preposterous!). I'd suggest you go for it, and you'll enjoy yourself thoroughly, it's the best bollywood comedy this year has produced. Then the talk about this being a rip-off of 'Its a MAD MAD MAD MAD World'and even having scenes from Mr.Bean(the washroom scene in the beginning) and Starsky&Hutch. But hey, as long as they've SUCCEEDED in this rip-off using our desi comic actors, and provided paisa-vasool entertainment,so as to say, then what's the harm?? Go watch it and you're guaranteed, it'll make you laugh!!
