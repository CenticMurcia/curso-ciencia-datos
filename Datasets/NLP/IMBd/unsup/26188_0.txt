This film was better than I expected. Just a delightful film. The acting was top notch. Aunt Claire was a demented, unhappy lady that was left with very little after her husband passed on. Perhaps the most unlikely demographic for a serial killer.. The rules were changed. Along came Aunt Alice. Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon as Aunt Claire and Aunt Alice respectfully, had a chess match for most of the film that was simply brilliant. In the style of Hitchcock this film flowed from start to finish. The intensity through out this film was constant. Twists upon twists, made for an energetic, entertaining film , that one had to pay close attention. The side characters were OK for the most part; Make no mistake , Page and Gordon were the whole film. There was a wonderful dog in this film that truly was an important cog. Overall, a very good film but housekeepers might want to watch their backs.
