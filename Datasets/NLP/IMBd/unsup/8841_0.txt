I can't wait for season 3! Is there going to be a third season? I watched both seasons back to back and loved it. This is much better than Sex in the City. This show is worth watching and leaves you wanting more. I love that it does not just focus on their careers, they have a life outside of the job that you can believe. The dialog is better than good...it's great! The fashion is good and I really like all the characters. The story line is better than Sex in the City because the character are much more realistic. There must be a season 3 in production. I hope the network is not suited up and stupid were they cancel the show because that would be a waste.
