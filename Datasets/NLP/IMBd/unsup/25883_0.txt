Why doesn't this get as much recognition as "The Muppet Movie"? I think it's just as good! This and "The Frog Prince" are the two most underrated Muppet features ever. If you can, see it! It's awesome!<br /><br />Basically it plays out like an episode of "The Muppet Show". With special guest stars Dudley Moore and Lily Tomlin, the Muppets do their own versions of such movies as "The Wizard of Oz", "Casablanca", and "The Three Musketeers". It's very funny!<br /><br />Both Dudley Moore and Lily Tomlin have their moments. Dudley's best is when he plays Ceasar. Lily's best is when she plays four or five people in a parody of a war movie (I don't know which).<br /><br />Like I said before, if you can see it, do so. If you like the Muppets, see it. You won't be disappointed.
