Barbara Streisand plays a prostitute named Doris, who moves in with George Segal's character, Felix (but he claims his name is Fred by the end of the movie.) This movie is an interesting mix of 60's romance, comedy, and psychological study. The dialog is witty and I found the characters believable. The chemistry between Streisand and Segal is what makes this movie, and I liked the way the sex scenes were shot, almost as if we were watching reality TV instead of a film. Nevertheless, the characters develop as the film progresses, until one has the feeling at the end that Streisand's character has softened, and Segal's has matured. I found Streisand's character to be irritating at first, and more and more likable as the movie progresses. This movie illustrates how opposites attract, and then how in a love relationship each partner becomes more like the other as they become a couple. Although the pace of scenes may be a little slow for a modern audience, the quality of the dialog definitely makes up for it. I still felt the film was relevant even watching the video 35 years after I first saw the movie in a theater.
