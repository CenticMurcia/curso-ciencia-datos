Michael J. Fox earned every penny he got from the industry, and it's with films like this that I feel he is vastly undervalued by the movie watching public. This cheeky and funny film is criminally rated low for reasons I just can't begin to fathom, it's got a sharp script with a very honest message driving it on.<br /><br />It's concept of putting a big fish in a little pond is always a tale worth telling, and who better than M J Fox to realise the big fish character here,? he has the quips, the sarcasm, and most of all an aura of believability to the character of Dr. Benjamin Stone. The film pans out as one would expect, but the fun is there to be had by all, and come the finale it's just flipping lovely cinema. Get into the vibe of a big city Doctor stuck in a small southern American town, a place that a big city Doctor can't quite comprehend, a place where big city folk surely can't function properly?? The supporting cast are just fine here, Julie Warner, Barnard Hughes, Woody Harrelson & Bridget Fonda are all in on the fun, and all of them give performances in keeping with this other side of the fence comedy. It's a smart and undervalued piece that deserves a better rating than this particular site gives it.<br /><br />"I'm in the Twilight Zone" 8/10.
