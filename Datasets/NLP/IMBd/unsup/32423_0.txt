Wow, did this short by D.W. Griffith go off in a bizarre direction that I hadn't anticipated!! The film begins with intertitle cards which indicate that a doctor has a spoiled son who spends money like mad. So, to let his son continue living this lavish life, the doctor decides to create and market a narcotic soft drink--"Dopokoke". It's a huge success, as it being laced with cocaine guarantees repeat business!! By the end, you see that the son and his new wife are hopeless coke fiends!!! <br /><br />There's no doubt that the idea of this short was spurred on by the fact that Coca-Cola DID contain small amounts of coke until around the turn of the 20th century. However, it was not in huge amounts, was not horribly addictive and did not leave people shells of their former selves because of drinking it! A bit of an exaggeration to say the least.<br /><br />Despite being a stupid short, it is entertaining!!
