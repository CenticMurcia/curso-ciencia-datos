I watched this the day before going to University. It was one of the most appropriate and moving moments of my film viewing life.<br /><br />First off; this is no complex or intriguing film. Its concept is very simple; various teenagers enjoying their youth with pranks, racing, outrageous flirtatiousness and most beautiful and touching of all the teenage dream of romance. My favourite moment of the film is when Dreyfuss's character sees an attractive, young blond early on - he later tries frantically to contact her - she eventually does, but just says her dues and leaves him - the boy, instead of being heartbroken or dissatisfied is happy and upbeat - at least he gave it a chance, at least he lived, as my father put it 'the teenage dream'. It touched me like few films can.<br /><br />That is what makes his film so good, so classy. It shows youth in all its beauty, without cynicism - the simple joys of life are shown in all vibrance. It also does not contain those elements that are omnipresent in modern versions; unnatural lighting, a unrealistic script, profanity. Lucas and Wexler were the perfect combination, Lucas could hide his shortcomings in dialogue behind Wexler's excellent photography and the great performances of all the cast.<br /><br />The ending moved me greatly, being at the stage of life that I am. Every student must watch this film before going to University because it highlights those qualities of youth so well and so elegantly that one cannot help feel tinges of remorse and sentiment at the sight of the plane soaring into the sky carrying the boy to University and away from his childhood.
