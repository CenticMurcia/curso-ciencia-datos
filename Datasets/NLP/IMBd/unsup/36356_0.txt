After seeing some good reviews on IMDb For this pointless waste of time i decided to watch it with a group of mates. <br /><br />BIG MISTAKE! <br /><br />I want my sat night back, but more, i want the trust i also lost with my friends back, as i will probably never be allowed to choose a movie again.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this movie looked pretty good at the start. Building up characters for the audience to slightly get connected to, Only to lead to absolutely nothing. I was expecting to see another LA riot. But what you get is about as exciting as the dramas in the Brady Bunch movie. This movie dragged on building up its climax only fizzel out just when things looked good. <br /><br />This would barely make it as a mid-day movie. It gets a 3 because the acting was pretty good. <br /><br />But having a black-out in your own home would be just as exciting.
