*La Moustache SPOILERS* <br /><br />Marc Thiriez (Vincent Lindon), a middle-aged Parisian architect, decides one night, before going to some friends' house, to cut his mustache, but neither his wife Agnès (Emmanuelle Devos) nor his friends notice anything, and Agnès is especially adamant about his never having a mustache.<br /><br />There is evidence that he did, though, and somebody outside Marc's circle of friends confirms it, but other things change; his friends seem to disappear, his father (who called that very day) is said to be dead, his childhood home seems to never have existed... what is the truth? If Pirandello (a great Italian writer, who dealt with similar material in his books, especially 'Uno, Nessuno E Centomila') ever decided to write a thriller, this is probably what would've come of it; an intense, disquieting and thought-provoking little jewel of a movie, effectively written, directed and acted, with Vincent Lindon as the best of the bunch.<br /><br />It does not have a definite resolution, though, so anyone who cannot stand that is already warned.<br /><br />Italian Title: 'L'Amore Sospetto' ('Suspicious Love') <br /><br />La Moustache: 9/10.
