Of course everyone knows this film is largely unavailable, and pretty much anyone who has see it (in the UK at least), in the past 20 years has done so without the benefit of the remastering/extras etc that would probably be on a conventional DVD. Imagine what that disc would be like folks!<br /><br />"Liking the Beatles" is to me anachronistic. Most people either love them or hate them. I doubt many really fall into the latter category, with plenty like me in the former.<br /><br />Watching this, you wonder just how long the magic would, or could have gone on. Reading the book "The Beatles Get Back disaster" gives some insight, because it shows that they were running through stuff like 'Every Night' that later appeared on solo albums. So for me the most interesting this is - how would these songs have sounded if they had been Beatles songs? Pretty much all of the initial solo work is lauded in equally stellar terms as 'Abbey Road', 'white album' etc, and it's only when there was no one around with sufficient gravitas to hit the quality control button ('Sometime in New York City' anyone?) that things began to slide. Even then, there is masses of stuff (even from Ringo) that's still way up there, especially from the 1970s.<br /><br />'Let it be' is I suppose a sad film, in a way. I would imagine McCartney was sad to see that there was nothing he could do to keep them interested, and certainly comes across as patronising and bossy. Being feted by hangers on isn't what any of them wanted - Paul just wanted John's attention, and looks quite indifferent to anyone else, apart from Ringo who he clearly loves. Their piano duet is a joy to behold. Interesting to see how different he is with George on the bonus disc of the Beatles Anthology, yet GH still exhibits a wariness that hides lots of stuff I daresay will never now be known.<br /><br />The key thing of course is the music. I daresay there are thousand if not millions of people who would like to have been walking down Savile Row that day. The interviews are also revealing 'we grew up with them, they belong to us' etc, plus the hilarious 'you don't get much for free these days' makes you realise just how human this band actually was. They had everything, and while I would have loved to go and buy their never recorded collective oeuvre from 1970 on, it's probably best I can't. No one would have wanted a Beatles album to be a part of musical inflation - too much music chasing too little demand. Imagine a Beatles single competing with Donny Osmond, David Cassidy or er, Paper Lace? I don't think so.<br /><br />They weren't meant for the 70s, as this film illustrates. Sooner or later you implode, if you're this famous and everyone wants so much from you. Look at a film from 1969, then look at one from 1974 - flowery, chintzy, all greasy and horrible. The 60s had EDGE, credibility, dignity, and so did the Fab Four, God bless 'em. I think they probably passed. We will not see their like again.
