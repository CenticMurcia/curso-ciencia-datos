Detlev Buck's films once used to be fun, in a way of weird and absurd humour and a lot of funny ideas and intelligent plots. To me all this is gone in his latest film. I was not only disappointed to see this film but even disgusted.<br /><br />I would not even call it "bad taste" to use rape as a kind of joke, I would call it "no taste at all". This is only one drastic example in a line of dozen others. <br /><br />It is not my habit to walk out of films but in this case it was close. I do not have a clue what could have been Buck's intention with this movie. I would not suggest watching it.
