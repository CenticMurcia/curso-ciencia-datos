Did the screen writers both to pick up a copy of Janson? Or anything with a basic outline of art history? And what is with the famous Piaf song, La Vie En Rose playing from a café as Modigliani and Jeune walk on a Paris street. A beautifully filmed song, so someone knew a bit about cinematography, but didn't bother to do any other homework. La Vie En Rose was popular in post war Paris, World War II that is. Not in 1914, or whenever the scene is supposed to be taking place because the flashbacks are indistinguishable. The depictions of Utrillo, Picasso, Braque, Stein and Rivera are cliché at best. And Frida Kahlo is supposed to be in this?? Whattt?? Kahlo didn't make Paris until the late 1930s. Certainly there are better venues for Andy Garcia. This is actually worse than the most recent "wild sex in ex-pat Paris" film, Head in the Clouds. I'm giving it a four because 2 is usually reserved for pornos. Although some lush sex scenes might redeem this a bit.
