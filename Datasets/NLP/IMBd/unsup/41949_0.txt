After his family moves into town, Steve starts to notice that there are some bizarre kids at school - pretty much always friendly and smiling... unless they are in a blind fit of blood thirsty rage... When one of his stoner friends, who said that the group is evil, joins it seemingly out of the blue, Steve suspects foul play. Soon, a secret that is only mildly disturbing is uncovered.<br /><br />This film would have fared much better if it were a TV episode and seeing that a TV director is responsible for this film we can see it is so mediocre. The decent premise, perfect for an X-Files episode, is stretched out over an hour and twenty minutes (pretty short for a movie) and the good moments are far in between if apparent at all. The highlight of the film would have to be the admittedly intriguing premise, but the way it is presented is just poor. The DVD has 11 deleted scenes and the director could really have cut more off to make a tighter and story, which like mentioned before, could have fared well on the X-Files. Even the atmosphere and cinematography resembles the hit show.<br /><br />Also the film lacks the element of visceral metaphor (thriller director David Croneberg's specialty) and the conclusion to it all is just laughable and contrived. 2/10<br /><br />Rated R for grim and violent content
