Probably one of the better Spenser Tracy/Katherine Hepburn movies. Hepburn is an all around female athlete and Tracy is determined to be her agent. Tennis and golf are the highlighted sports. Hepburn has trouble making the big finish because she "chokes" when her boyfriend is around. Casual and funny banter; evocative of the classic romantic comedy. Also in the cast are:Sammy White, William Ching, Aldo Ray and smaller roles for Jim Backus; the debut of Chuck Connors and yes that thug is Charles Bronson, then known as Charles Buchinski. Directed by George Cukor this story is no great whoop, but the selling point is the Tracy/Hepburn team.
