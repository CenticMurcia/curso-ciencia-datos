What were they thinking when they accepted this script to be made into a movie? What were they thinking when they agreed to act in this movie? And I use the word act loosely. What was I thinking when I rented this movie? Oh, yeah, I remember. I saw all these names that are supposed to have talent. The acting & script are not stale, more like rotting. Well, at least they got the name right. This is looks like a movie, and calls itself a movie, but trust me, it is not. 2 out of 10
