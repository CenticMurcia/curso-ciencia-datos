A woodenly acted unnecessary remake of a remake of a much MUCH better film, This Kevin Serbo helmed straight to DVD action film sees fit to throw every available clich√© at the audience apparently in order to pummel them into submission. Sorbo plays Nick, a sheriff returning home looking for vengeance after some local thug kills his father. Why this is billed as Walking Tall 2, I haven't a clue as it has nothing to do with The Rock film and even less to do with the classic original '70's trilogy. To make matters worse the acting's more wooden then Buford Pusser's fabled 2 by 4. A sequel was shot back-to-back with this one and I can say with all confidence that i'll definitely be skipping that likely travesty. Even a huge Sorbo fan such as myself does have his limits.<br /><br />My Grade: D
