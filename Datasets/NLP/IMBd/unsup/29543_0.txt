As remarkably bad this film is, somehow there is a certain macabre interest in watching a film that is at such a level. Bela Lugosi is always welcome, no matter how bad the movie may be, but the Martin and Lewis ripoff act, Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo, are nothing more than a glaring example of how show business devours its own. One has to sit through this travesty to believe it. Some side trivia: Martin and Lewis took Mitchell and Petrillo to court for stealing their act, but in court Mitchell stated that while Petrillo looking like Lewis was an act of God, Martin got a nose job to look more like Mitchell! And that comment ruined Dean and Jerry's case! Also, in the 1980s, when Lewis appeared on the Today show, they ran a montage of Jerry Lewis clips from The Colgate Comedy Hour, except one clip was of Sammy Petrillo and not Jerry! Lewis pointed out the error to flustered interviewer Bryant Gumbel. Jerry was not offended, though, he found the whole thing funny. "I was never that good looking," he said. Incidentally, Duke Mitchell actually appears in the Martin and Lewis feature "Sailor Beware."
