Because we live in an age of excess, modern moviemakers seem obliged to reflect this in their overblown remakes of old films. "A Perfect Murder" is an excellent example of this, as the number of devious characters is increased and the body count is higher, and the denouement which in the original saw a wily police detective resolve matters now has one of those endings in which the heroine puts herself in danger. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME.
