TELL ME SOMETHING is one of those rare treats from Asia, as it has no creepy little girls with long black hair, or ghosts, or "rings", or anything like that - instead this film is a straight forward serial-killer horror/thriller, and a pretty damn good one at that...<br /><br />Body parts are turning up around Korea and the only thing linking them is a quiet young woman who used to date all of the victims. A cop who's being watched for possible misconduct is put on the case, and we slowly start learning more about the girl's life - including things about her father, her best friend, and her current boyfriend that casts rays of suspicion on herself and everyone around her...<br /><br />TELL ME SOMETHING is well-acted, well-directed and is an all around well-done film. A little gorier than your average American thriller (which is a plus...) but not an all-out bloodbath either. The strong story keeps you guessing, and the end has a decent little twist. Fans of SEVEN and the like will dig this one. 8.5/10
