**SPOILERS** The movie "The She Creature" seems to have been highly influenced by the reincarnation craze of the 1950's revolving around the past life of Colorado housewife Mrs. Simmons who in her previous incarnation was the 19th century Irish woman Bridey Murphy.<br /><br />The movie instead of concentrating on the reincarnation angle goes all over the place with the somewhat unstable carnival hypnotist and mind reader, as well as prognosticator, Dr. Carlo Lombari, Chester Morris, who's completely obsessed with his beautiful assistant Andrea Talbott, Marla English. Dr. Lombardi is so possessive of Andrea that his trying to get her to be his soul-mate just turns her off to the wild and crazy guy.<br /><br />It's when the handsome and a bit skeptic, of Dr. Lombardi's psychic powers, Dr. TedErckson, Lance Fuller, comes on the scene that things really start to unwind with the by now mad Doctor Lombardi going so far as conjuring up this She, or Sea, Creature to do Dr. Erickson in. The creature has been around for some time in the movie even before Dr. Erickson showed up. It was Dr. Ericksons presence that really brought the worst out of it as the thing, being controlled by Lombardi, went on a rampage murdering some half dozen young people who were enjoying themselves on the beach.<br /><br />Even though Lombardi is on the scene of every one of the She Creature's killings he's totally innocent, to the disgust of police Let. Ed James (Ron Randell), of them. Lombardi is at the scene of the crime but the evidence exonerates him . It's as if Lombardi is pulling the polices, and Let. James, leg in order to both show them up and prove his power as a psychic is genuine.<br /><br />As for the hypnotized and at times completely composed Andera she's in a life and death struggle tug of war between her "master" Dr. Lombardi and "saviour" Dr. Erickson that goes on for almost the entire film. Besides being a woman from 17th century England, Elizabeth Wetherby, It's also brought out that Andera was this 1950's looking spaceman, or spacewoman,in the very distance, about 300 to 400 million years ago, past that came out of the primordial soup and was to become the precursor or mother of the human race;The She Creature!<br /><br />The film has money hungry entrepreneur Timothy Chapple, Tom Conway, make a deal with Dr. Lombardi to manage his carnival act and make millions for both himself and the mad doctor. What Chapple doesn't know is that whatever Dr. Lombardi is doing is not and act but the real McCoy and in the end he's to get the shock of his life finding that fact out. The She Creature her, or it, self takes care of business by finally putting an end to Dr. Lombardi's obsession with both it and Andrea, whom it supposed to have been way back then in prerecorded history. Finishing off the crazed Dr. Lombardi who wanted it to instead finish off Dr. Erickson the bumbling and hardly able to walk She Creature stumbles back to the ocean with the cops, who are unable to see it, being directed by Dr. Erickson, who can, to shoot at it as it finally disappears under the waves.<br /><br />Were given to understand that It, the She Creature, will come back in the very near future to both shock as well as put it's audience to sleep, the thing was about the least scariest monster in movie history,in a new film sequel. As far as I know that happily never happened which was a blessing to everyone, the cast crew and those watching the film, involved with it.
