A rare find. 10 out 10 in my estimation. Apparently Flynn later in life wanted to be considered a talented actor rather than simply a ladies' man or "matinee idol". I think he was an excellent actor, a characterization borne out in his performance as Don Juan in this film.<br /><br />The cinematography is brilliant, the dialog, though typical of films of this genre, is tongue-in-check and thereby hilarious as well as highly entertaining. The acting is superb across the board.<br /><br />The film, true to the studio system protocols of the era, is stylized, but the stylization works brilliantly. I am certain that any contemporary aspiring director, writer or actor who is serious about his or her craft can learn an immense amount from this film.
