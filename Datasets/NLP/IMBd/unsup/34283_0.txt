Starts off with a sex scene, of which there were eight total I think, three of them in the first half hour. The movie really comes to a standstill with them, so they should have done some talking during those scenes to dispose of some exposition! Or maybe some split-screen action.<br /><br />Anyway, the plot is that at a fashion pajama party, one of the models trying to win a contract is found dead in the pool. An alcoholic ex-cop private investigator is hired by a friend of the model to investigate it as a murder when the police decide it was a suicide. The whole PI investigation is really stale, right from the "you don't want to hire me" to the end. The head of security at the party is an ex-cop friend of the PI, and the PI also has a friend still in the department.<br /><br />The ending didn't make too much sense to me. He might as well as never been hired in the first place.
