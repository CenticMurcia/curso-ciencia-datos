This was my first experience with one of those Japanese Godzilla movie, but I wasn't too exhilirated about it.<br /><br />The monsters such as Godzilla escape from Monster Island because of an alien force trying to take over the world, and enslave the people. This results in an attack from the monsters on all major cities in the world... but Godzilla knows who his real friends are...<br /><br />Silly story, silly effects and an ending which power rangers would be ashamed of... but then again, laughable at times (is that a good sign?).<br /><br />4/10 for some moments of fun.
