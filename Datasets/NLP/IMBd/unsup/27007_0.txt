In it's early years, Big Brother was fresh, original and fascinating, but I wonder how many watch it now for reasons other than duty, habit and so they don't feel left out at work, similarly, I wonder how many housemates appear because they aren't hopeless attention-seekers. Big Brother has singularly and spectacularly failed to guard against people playing the format, it is terrifically embarrassing how the bland identikits stand in exactly the right spot and say exactly the right things. The only consolation being that, Jade (RIP) aside, they sink without a great deal of trace within weeks of each series ending, sure, they may be recognised in the supermarket for years to come, but sleep with your next door neighbour and you'll be recognised in the supermarket for years to come. BB3 was the last great year and it's been a grim downhill tumble ever since, my only surprise is that anyone remotely contacted with it has the energy to drag themselves out of bed.
