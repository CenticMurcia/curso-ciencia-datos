(spoilers..within)<br /><br />My first of kukunoor and a great experience. The starting scenes are great..the dripping blood scene..and "Naseer in bank " scene....cinematography is great.<br /><br />The storyline is good ..though a few things are adopted from "shawshank redemption"..movie has it's own identity.<br /><br />A few scenes will leave u thrilled ...like the flashback scene in which Naseer noticed that Juhi was also in the court room....and the starting scenes b4 casting.<br /><br />jackie, juhi are good...and Naseer, wat can i say??..Nagesh is ok types,,but a good director.<br /><br />Nice work...a must see.........Bollywood is learning junta..cheer up!!!
