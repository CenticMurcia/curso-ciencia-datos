I didn't start watching this gem until late, and I kept forgetting it was on. But, this is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I cried when they showed the last episode. It was just perfect. It had humor, drama, awesome characters, good music, and It was just perfect. I will miss this show deeply, and hope they will show re-runs on USA or some other network.<br /><br />100000 out of 10<br /><br />
