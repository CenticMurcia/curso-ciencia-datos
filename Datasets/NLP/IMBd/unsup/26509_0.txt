Depravity doesn't begin to describe just how atrocious this film is. I like my share of bad films, but this has no redeeming qualities: poorly written, poorly acted, and not at all in a fun way. This movie crosses you from the Yellow, into the Red, and then the guy from that 70's Show makes ZED have the computer gun explode your stomach, so you're left with only a gaping hole in your torso, where your soul used to be. Christpher Lambert would have done you a favor by just letting you fall off the moving platform. Best of all: our heroes are sent to prison while attempting to flee the country at a heavily manned border. At the end of the film, they escape to Mexico by crashing through a chain-link fence at an unguarded border. So essentially they could have saved themselves (and us) the whole movie if they'd just done their homework on US border patrols. Good work guys!
