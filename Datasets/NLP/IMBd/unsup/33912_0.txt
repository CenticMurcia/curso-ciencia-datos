OK, lets face it, if you're not a humble, faithful (and probably voting republican) American, craving to be choked on continuous moral lessons so obvious and predictable, I strongly advice you to skip this crappy non-original TV-show. <br /><br />Actually I think u would do more good in church or read the story's in the good book; they're way better in a moral sense and offer at least some excitement so your brain gets activated. <br /><br />This show is a total waste of time Ã¡nd money and I can only applaud it got cancelled, it was the only right thing to do. So to all of you out there who claim this show is great; get real, get a life and use your spare time in a better way
