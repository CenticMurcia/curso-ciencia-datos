I have just seen this movie and I personally think it is the worst disaster movie of all times! **SPOILER WARNING** The plot was interesting at the beginning, but at the part where the supposed "volcano" erupted the plot became a kind of the film Volcano, specially the part where the plan to save New York was to "guide" the lava to the ocean. I was not expecting a super production as "The Day after tomorrow" if not a kind of 10.5 or something like that. The special effects were so lame that I laughed every time the "lava" appeared. In the part when the lava began to "burn" the city it looked like I was watching a cartoon.. To sum up I wasted 2 productive hours of my life watching this movie personally, this film may deserve a score of minus 4.
