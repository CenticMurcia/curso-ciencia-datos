This movie was very good. I'm surprised that the discussion board is so dead, along with the votes. It deserves a lot more publicity. It had fantastic acting, special effects, action...basically everything you want from a movie. When I saw this movie, I thought that IMDb would be full of users discussing it, but I realized that it wasn't as well-known as I thought. Well, that was a shocker for me. The movie was great, way better than I had expected when I saw it on the shelf at Blockbuster. Buy it, or at least give it a chance and rent it. You wont regret it.<br /><br />Go see the movie, it rocks!
