:Trust Me, Its Paradise<br /><br />'The Beach' is a kinda of movie the feel of which surrounds you slowly and completely.<br /><br />I'd say Danny Boyle has done complete justification to the book. The movie captures the essence of the book. I watched the movie first and then read the book. The beach can be better experienced thru the movie. The music (by Angelo Badalamenti) is excellent, but unfortunately not popular( which is why I believe popular is not always the best ;-)). DiCaprio proves how versatile and powerful he is as an actor. A must watch for DiCaprio fans. Purchase an original DVD and you'll get to see alternate beginning and alternate climax of the movie with director's comments. You will like this movie especially if you are a crazy traveler and like to explore unseen and untouched places.<br /><br />Direction, location, music and DiCaprio are the strengths of the movie. 'The Beach' is not just a movie, its an experience.<br /><br />:never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar. Just keep your mind open and suck in the experience........
