What can I add to the eloquent and comprehensive praise that this film has garnered from fellow reviewers? Not much more than to add my voice in agreement. Swimming Pool is a fabulous film. Not for everyone, sure, but for those of us who love intelligent, beautifully acted films with wonderfully unpredictable plot lines, it's a gem. <br /><br />I loved Under The Sand and 8 Women. Swimming Pool combines the best elements of both. The lead actresses are equally superb just as they each were in the aforementioned. And I would go so far as to recommend any film by this director. He exhibits a unique talent and is definitely one to watch.
