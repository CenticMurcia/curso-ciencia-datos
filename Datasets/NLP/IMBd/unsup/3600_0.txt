STRIP NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER (Andrea Bianchi - Italy 1975).<br /><br />Evelyn, a young fashion model, dies during a backstreet abortion in Milan. To avoid an investigation, the gynecologist arranges for her body to be taken home and places in a bath of running water. Within hours, the doctor is brutally murdered by a mysterious figure wearing a crash helmet and motorcycle leathers and soon more grisly murders follow among the employees of the Albatross modeling agency, where Evelyn worked.<br /><br />This is a very amusing piece of trash by Andrea Bianchi, probably best known for his ultra-gory zombie flick BURIAL GROUND(1981) and the casting of Orson Welles in his second film TREASURE ISLAND(1972), but he also made this entertaining little Giallo, the only one he made, to my knowledge. From 1974-75 onwards, most ways of murdering had been done, so in order to shock and entertain audiences, many Italian filmmakers increasingly added ever larger amounts of gore, sadism and erotic comedy to their films. This one mainly goes for the latter. Starring three Euro-babes, Edwige Fenech, Femi Benussi and Erna Sch√ºrer, "Strip Nude" is well supplied in that department and abounds in '70s style sexism and politically incorrect humor.<br /><br />When voluptuous Femi Benussi parades along the swimming pool in tight-fitting bikini, she is spotted by some mustached hairy Italians wearing ridiculous swimming gear. One of them, Nino Castelnuovo, is a fashion photographer who immediately follows her, woes her, and within minutes - naturally - she sheds her clothes without further hesitation, after which Castelnuovo can go for some 'in-depth interviewing.' Soon, the clothes are back on again, but most of her screen time, she just walks around naked. When she is judged fitting for Albatross modeling agency by Castelnuovo, he introduces her to her future colleagues as 'first class merchandise', after which a not amused Edwige Fenech sniffs, 'how we're gonna photograph all that. We're gonna need a cinerama screen.' <br /><br />The film benefits from stylish cinematography and a pleasant funky score, but when the killer appears, we hear the strange sound of a knife thrown into a piece of wood. I don't know of any other way to describe it. It's rather silly, you can make up your own associations. Clearly, there's plenty of nasty bloodshed, but it's all a bit subdued by the casual comedic tone set early on in the film. In the last half hour, the plot elements are being pieced together and the fun wears out a little, but the pace is brisk, the cinematography great and there's enough humor and nudity in between to make this some very agreeable entertainment. Irresistible fun for Giallo lovers. <br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 7/10
