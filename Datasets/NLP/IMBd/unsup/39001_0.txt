I'm from Chicago and go to school in Michigan and found this movie offensive. Although not from the South, I thought this film was very unsympathetic to and caricatured Southern culture and history. It's also very questionable that history would look anything like they're portraying it if the South had in fact won. I don't think world agriculture or sentiment would have made slavery viable for more than another 50-70 years even if the South had won its independence or conquered the northern states. Also, this movie was simply poorly made. Its actors, commercials, and PBS-style program all seem to be aimed more at making fun of the South than at providing a realistic attempt at an actual documentary and commercials on what would be modern Confederate television.
