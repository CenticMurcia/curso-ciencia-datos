I can try to be articulate. I can try to be witty. I can try to be funny. All of these things are usually easy for me. I've never known what it was like to be so attached to another world through a television show, much less what it was like to feel so empty after it was all said and done. This was, by immeasurable standards, the greatest show on television.<br /><br />The last episode started like any other. If anybody tuned in, not knowing it was the last, they likely wouldn't have noticed. The last ten minutes tied off the loose ends in an ominous, but casual way. I was able to hold myself together until the very last scene. I'm not going to spoil anything for anyone, but those who have followed the show and developed the same attachment to the characters that I have will also find themselves with watering eyes.<br /><br />It is now Tuesday, roughly 36 hours after the show ended. It truly is an empty feeling. Anyone can identify with the show. Things about it hit so close to home because they are things that all of us have to deal with on a daily basis. It's not an emergency room, it's not a desert trench, and it's certainly not a plastic surgeon's office. It discusses real issues with real scenarios, and even more real (if not terrifying) resolutions.<br /><br />But more than all of this it reminds all of us that the people we elect to office are only human. They make mistakes just like the rest of us. They are haunted by memories and demons just like we are, yet they keep on because they know more than anything that the minute details of their day to day doings affect millions.<br /><br />There is a saying they are sure to throw around just enough that it is remembered.<br /><br />"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has." I'd vote for Jed Bartlet.
