That film ha a really horrible camera work! I saw other films with lots of dialog but none of these films had a camera work which was that bad. Like in a bad south American soap opera there wasn't much going on with the camera. The only nice picture in the film is when they move to the house on the beach. But since the house was looking very nice, even a tourist would have been able to get a nice movie of this house with his cheap camera. So that rather should be a radio play. But not even that - the characters are so stereotype that this film is not half so wise like it pretends to be. Also acting and cut are bad - especially the scene where the gay finds the women drowned in the pool. I thought "what the hell was that"? The actor doing just something and/or the cut was so bad in this scene that you have the feeling that something went completely wrong there if you see that.
