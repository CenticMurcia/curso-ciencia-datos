Route 666...highway of the beast. Here is a film that had some great desert locations and some decent gunplay. And that's about all. <br /><br />****SPOILER****<br /><br />In this ghostly action thriller, Jack (Phillips) is a--get this--Federal Marshall, who used to do under-cover work for the CIA, and before that was a Navy SEAL. How's that for background? Of course, he has an unspoken love for his partner, played by Petti. They're attempting to deliver a witness to trial along a closed and dangerous stretch of old Route 66. This highway is haunted by the souls of four convicts who were murdered by the guards set to watch them. In an amazing coincidence, one of the convicts was Jack's long-lost father. <br /><br />This sluggish film was more entertaining in the beginning, as an action film, than later, when it became a poorly-executed tale of family redemption, ghosts and secrets from the past.
