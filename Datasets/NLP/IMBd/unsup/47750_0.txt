Seriously. I've seen a lot of low budget, no budget films. I've seen a lot of horror, gore, slashers, and generally nasty films. This is pretty close to bottom of the list. Yeah its violent, but you cant see any actual gore due to poor camera work and disastrous editing (mostly that pixelated effect that the filmmakers must've thought was SO cool). The film is an immature compilation of bad special effects, annoying and generally pointless characters, and buckets of thick pink foamy blood.<br /><br />The storyline (ok so not technically a STORYline) follows a German man in a plaid shirt shambling aimlessly around the countryside murdering people with a large cleaver. Unfortunately the same effect is re-cycled many times as he overpowers his victims, slam them repeatedly on the ground, cuts off one of their arms at the shoulder, and then beheads them. There are some great concepts for a gore scene, but they're ruined by dark/pixelated shots, and stop-frame slow motion.<br /><br />If you want to see a gore-fest, this isn't the film you're looking for. After all the hassle it'll take you to track this film down, i ASSURE YOU that you will be disappointed. If you want something German and disturbing, go get yourself a copy of Nekromantik.
