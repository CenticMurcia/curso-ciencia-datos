The funniest parts in this movie are 1) Joan Crawfords painfully obvious underarm SWEAT STAINS!!!!!I mean obvious...this movie was apparently done before Joan's unpublicized sweat gland operations(just kidding)...... 2)The scene where Robert Montgomery has a boxing match in the living room during a party. He looks absolutely juvenile in his little tank top and his childlike rabbit punches. He was, of course, a married man by this, albeit a puny one. He obviously didn't possess a home gym. I recommend this movie.... Great example of an early talkie. Crawford was one of the few silent stars to make the transition to talkies and thrived. Montgomery was one of those actors recruited after the change from silents. Men who could speak while they gnawed at the scenery.......
