Has a big fan of the series I was very disappointed in the movie. It was as if it was completely something else. Not much from what made the series a hit was use in the movie, except the hip.<br /><br />The music, the jokes, the stories where all simplified to accommodate the newbies, so it lost all it's charm and originality.<br /><br />Even if I didn't new the series before seeing the movie, I wouldn't of give more then 4 out of 10 for this piece of ...<br /><br />Everything is very predictable, nothing is really funny or new, nothing to push me to the limits. <br /><br />I wish I've never seen it!
