Ah, yes the 1-line summary is what I would describe the film.<br /><br />Considering the U.S. child pornography laws, I'm surprised U.S. government has let this movie to be produced.<br /><br />Looks like the Louis Malle had the guts to make a movie that has nude scene of a young girl named Brooke Shields.<br /><br />Perhaps that is why this movie must be significant.<br /><br />It's not surprising to see a lot of reviewers bashing this movie because of the nudity scene.
