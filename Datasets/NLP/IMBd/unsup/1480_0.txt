This is one of those movies that 5 years from now you will see on WTBS in the middle of a rainy Saturday afternoon and you will think, "hum, I don't remember that one". Leelee was good. Not many strong female parts out in the movie world for young women. She made the most of a predictable script and a bad back from the presumed dead villain scene. Her little brother, Rhett, was played by the same kid that played Scott Anspaugh for 5 episodes of ER. They basically had the only two good parts in the movie. It is a good diversion from the worlds events and served its purpose to kill 2 hours during tropical storm Gabrielle.<br /><br />Leelee will likely win awards in the next 5 years but not for this one.
