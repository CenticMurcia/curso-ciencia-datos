I rated this movie a 10 just for fun. I would actually give this an 8. The story is very creative and very funny. I don't know why people have rated this so low. The movie is sort of kiddish, but it is funny and everybody should like Farley. Chris Farley always gives me a smile and it is sad he died. I will say this movie is one of my favorites of him, even if he plays the same role like he does in the other movies. The isn't exactly for children either even though it looks like it. If you are looking to enjoy a movie with good laughs and a good feeling, I would watch it, but if you are very critical of these types, I would most likely recommend a different movie. But Farley fans aren't fans unless they see this. I give this an 8 out of 10/ PG-13-Crude Humor and Nudity
