I rented this movie to see how the Sony pd170 camera shoots, (I recently purchased the same camera) and was blown away by the story and the acting. The directing, acting, editing was all above what I expected from what appeared at first glance to be a "Low budget" type of movie.<br /><br />I learned a lot from the film as an actor and a Director of Photograpy. Thanks for making a great movie. As an indie film maker (Currently shooting "Bank+Shot" in New Orleans Louisiana and surrounding areas I also recommend "Peices of April" with Katie Holmes.<br /><br />Gary Desroche
