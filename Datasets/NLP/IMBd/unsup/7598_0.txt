The cinematography on this film is outstanding; it really showcases Ottawa beautifully. The director was excellent. Although the female lead actor was not always believable, most of the other actors were. The plot of this film was a balance between the predictable and the unexpected. The ending is great. All in all, I was very impressed with this low-budget Canadian-made film. The producers should applaud themselves. You do us Canadians proud. We need more good Canadian films.<br /><br />The leading boy in the film was great -- very cute, adorable, and a good actor too. The plot had interesting undertones and provided a glimpse into new Canadians' lives.<br /><br />I would recommend it for families, the young and the young at heart. Go with minimal expectations and you will be delightfully surprised.
