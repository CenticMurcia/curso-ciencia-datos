This is a great TV movie about a single mother who is dying of cancer. Scott Bairstow is especially convincing as Michael, and he gives the impression of an older brother. Jaime Renee Smith shows herself to be a very mature actress. She lightens up the film, and really makes you get to know her character. If this movie is playing again, I would encourage you to see it!
