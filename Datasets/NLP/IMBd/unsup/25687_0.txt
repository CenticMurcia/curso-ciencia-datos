I'm not a person who will usually step out on a limb and call something the "best" or "worst" ever, but it's simply impossible for any movie to be worse than this one.<br /><br />The effects were horrible, the plot was a silly attempt at exploitation that never worked out, the acting couldn't have been worse and the ultimate playoff was a major hoax.<br /><br />Grade A trash!! Rent this movie for an incredibly amusing evening!
