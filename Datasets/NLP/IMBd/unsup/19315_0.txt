This movie started out as something half exciting, but the other 80 minutes of the film was a complete waste. There was no story, nor connection in anything. What shook me the most was how a film made in 2005 could have so low special-effects. I mean, the spider, looked like a doll. Seriously, the movie Anaconda could be considered having better special-effects then this one. The tribe thing? Made no sense at all. The characters were terrible. The classic screaming and running were to me, just a laugh. Though if you're a huge fan of King Kong and monster movies from the 90's, it might be good. Also, it contains a short shot of nudity. Might be worth it for that. One mans opinion.
