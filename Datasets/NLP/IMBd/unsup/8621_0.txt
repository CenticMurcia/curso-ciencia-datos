I have fond memories of the original 'Cinderella'. I remember sitting in the theatre when the movie was re released in New Zealand cinemas at the age of ten and falling in love with the story then.<br /><br />So when the sequel 'Cinderella 2 Dreams come true' came out( and I was a teen ) I was eager to see where the writers would take us next in Cinderellas life,unfortunately I was very disappointed. <br /><br />But finally any prayers seem to have been answered in 'Cinderella 3 A twist in time'. <br /><br />This movie was Excellent. <br /><br />It seems Disney has decided to put a lot of love and care into our much loved Cinderellas story. The animation was top notch ( No Little Mermaid 2 Animation here),and the story was well told,inventive and very creative. The movie was entertaining and fun.I was impressed and I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />It seems the department that makes these Disney DVD Sequels is set to close. That's a real shame, because when they get it right it's great.Also I know many people simply state that these DVD's are simply trying to ride the coat tails of there originals success and are made for "a quick buck"and obviously that's true. But when they are not cheap and rushed but well told and polished like Cinderella 3, then it is a true joy to see the continuation of these beloved characters lives when they have been a part of so many wonderfully fond childhood memories.
