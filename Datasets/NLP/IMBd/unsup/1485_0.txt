This thriller was better than i thought. It was a real breathtaking and gripping story. Congratulations to Leelee Sobieski, Trevor Morgan and to the director Dan Shepard for this top performance! I rent the movie on dvd and i will buy it of course for my best of dvd collection. If you liked this one donÂ´t miss "Joy Ride" starring also Leelee Sobieski, trust me you won't be disappointed. I gave 8/10.
