I loved this film and always will love it. I got the complete sets on video until the recent release of "Herbie Fully Loaded" I love that Tennessee Steinmetz, as portrayed by Buddy Hackett. He knows how to "love" a car. I like the antics of David Tomlinson, who portrayed Thorndyke, Havershaw, as portrayed by Joe Flynn is Thorndyke's stupid servant, . I loved the words of wisdom by Mr. Wu, as portrayed by Benson Fong. Herbie, as portrayed by the VW Bug, "hates" Thorndyke. The most dramatic scene was when Herbie "attempts" suicide. Jim Douglas, as portrayed by Dean Jones develops the love for the little car. I hated when Thorndyke beats Herbie and gets the car drunk. I had an aunt from India and she loved this film.
