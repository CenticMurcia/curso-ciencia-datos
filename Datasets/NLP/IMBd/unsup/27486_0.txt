Bette Midler was fascinating in this movie which you can pick up at Target for ONLY $5.50! I agree with the earlier reviewer that there is 20+ minutes of footage that could've been axed like her singing in the gay club and the side story with the old lesbian lover which never truly developed. Another stale, uncomfortable scene was her in the phone both trying to get through to the stadium. Great idea but way too long.<br /><br />I watched (listened) to some of the director's comments and he OR the film NEVER explain the beginning/ending of the movie with people looking horrified at a big montage of photos including her and other males. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? Was that her parent's house? Was it a stalker/obsessed fan? Why are they disturbed? That really irks me as I'm confused about this, if ANYONE can explain this please do! Am I going to have to contact the director? I saw this for the first time since I was 7-8 years old, I had a fuzzy memory that she took the downward spiral, went into seclusion and then came back with a roar singing THE ROSE in concert ending the movie. Obviously I was wrong in what I remembered but the touching song was played in the end causing me to cry as it did when I was a child :-( I'm also curious why she didn't sing it as "her" song in the movie? This might've seemed cheesy to some but it would've bee more powerful to me.<br /><br />Sincerely, Noah Tempe, AZ
