I remeber my brother playing this nonstop on our Original Nintendo and then we sold it... 5 years later we got it on our computer and I played it for awhile. It is a great game and even better on computer because the computer won't screw up every ten seconds like the original Nintendo did. Who needs good graphics? When you've got non-stop adventure there is no need. 10/10
