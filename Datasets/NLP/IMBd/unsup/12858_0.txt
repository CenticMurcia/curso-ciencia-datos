After summarizing this movie in the Summary, I find little else to say except to repeat, to wit, this movie is a slow 97 minutes, but interest never flags, especially if you're hot for Marguerite Moreau, as she's in a large majority of scenes.<br /><br />The action, as it were, moves forward less on plot than on slice-of-life vignettes while our heroine -- who had a history of poorly-chosen paramours, of men who didn't appreciate her, leaving break-up messages on her phone machine during the opening credits -- copes with the ups and downs of dealing with two who finally do. Watching Moreau's portrayal through these transitions lends a real-life atmosphere to the proceedings, and is the primary delight of this film. All in all, an easy watch.
