Four college kids (2 girls, 2 boys) must spend the night in a haunted house to get into the sororities and fraternities they pledged. What they don't know is the house IS haunted by a seemingly unstoppable killer. Who will survive? Sound familiar?<br /><br />A very by the numbers horror film utterly devoid of chills or imagination. It was one of the crummy films that everybody was making back in the early 1980s in the wake of the inexplicable success of "Friday the 13th". This film DOES have Linda Blair in it...but she's pretty bad. The only good acting was from handsome, hunky Peter Barton who actually gave us a sympathetic character (despite the lousy dialogue). The worst acting was by idiotic Vincent Van Patten. Apparently he was no joy on the set either. He was supposed to do a nude love scene with his costar (not Blair) but refused at the last minute--he didn't want to tarnish his "image"! Like being in something called "Hell Night" was going to give you a good reputation!<br /><br />The movie has no nudity, very little swearing and next to no violence, blood or gore---how did this get an R rating? Very dull--not even good enough for laughs. Avoid.
