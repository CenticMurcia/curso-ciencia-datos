This, quite simply, is the worst film ever made. It's hard to say whether the almost entirely stolen story line, the horrific plot holes, the embarrassing special effects, or Alec Baldwin made this movie so ruinously poor. Probably all of those factors are very important, but mostly, the film is crashingly, achingly dull. Even the occasional random dip into soft core pornography with the lovely Lisa Bonet does not raise even the slightest flicker of interest, neither when the buggies come and circle round our "political prisoner" (He was imprisoned for writing a slogan on a wall, oh yes...).<br /><br />Watch it, because this is a landmark.
