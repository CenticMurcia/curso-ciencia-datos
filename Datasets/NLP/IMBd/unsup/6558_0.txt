This movie is one of the worst Hitchcock movies I've seen. It is boring and unfunny. Only good thing in this movie are the actors. Too bad this movie is so unfunny, because the plot could have made it funnier. But now "funny" scenes only include the characters burying, burying the body over and over again.<br /><br />* out of *****
