Best feel good movie ever - please bring back the spirit of Woodstock - come back to heaven.You never get tired of it. We may age - the spirit of Woodstock will not. It was /is the best rights of passage movie/event ever. Everything came together - it was meant to be. Magic was in the air. People were more Spiritual. Call us naive - but at least we could smile at you - and you understood. Can you do that today? This is what life is/was without our current mood of doubt and cynicism. People were open to spirituality. They knew the good Guru's - the one's you could trust. Where is our guidance today? I could swim nude with your girlfriend and it would be happy,fun,natural and non threatening. Woodstock showed us for a brief moment what life really always already is - before the decline of Altamont. This movement set in motion something that will return - when we are truly pure enough to live co - operatively.In peace and tolerance. Co-operation + tolerance = peace. That's what Woodstock was showing us....
