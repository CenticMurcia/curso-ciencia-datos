It's a cheesy classic, it's a great soundtrack draped around a fun movie, it's a piece of nostalgia already viewed through rose-tinted glasses. It's . . . it's . . . it's . . . . well, it COULD just be a decent little movie.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon plays the young lad who moves into a small town and is both disgusted and angered to learn that it doesn't allow any real music or dancing. The reason for this comes out as the story unfolds but, suffice to say, it's up to Bacon and the kids (some of them played by the likes of Chris Penn, Lori Singer and Sarah Jessica Parker) to butt heads with the local enforcers of these rules and to particularly pit themselves against a local preacher (a stellar turn from John Lithgow).<br /><br />Yes, there are dollops of cheese in this film (especially Lori Singer's bratty, rebellious turn and the likes of Bacon's "angry" dance scene) but you may just be as surprised as I was to find how well most of it has stood the test of time. Whether it's the toe-tapping soundtrack featuring that titular classic from Kenny Loggins, the chicken race, the sight of Chris Penn learning to dance or just great, great scenes between John Lithgow and the superb Dianne Wiest . . you'll find that there's still a LOT here to enjoy.<br /><br />See this if you like: Kevin Bacon, Hairspray, Flashdance.
