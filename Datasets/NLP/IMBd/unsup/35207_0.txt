Okay.This is gonna be just another "this movie SUCKS ASS" comment but I just have to write it down otherwise my soul will die.<br /><br />This is by FAR the worst movie I ever saw in my entire life.I saw many bad movies and terrible movies but this is just something unbelievable.I use to watch movies without any pre-judgements and I give a chance to each movie I watch.In this case it was hard because I've read all this comments here but nevermind.So I watched it.Dear God.I did.<br /><br />Troll 2 is so bad.So bad that I think people who created it wanted to do such a piece of crap.Plot,acting,music,effects,wannabe spooky moments...everything just everything is bad.No,I think bad is not enough.I don't think there is a word in this universe that can describe what Troll 2 is.<br /><br />Joshua the main hero is so annoying that I hoped something will happen to him.Something gruesome.The actress of Joshua's mother is beyond terrible but no one is so bad as the main villain Creedence Leonore Gielgud.That character is written and played extremely bad.<br /><br />I am really sad that someone gave to this movie 10 because I think this is king of bad movies and it should be at 1st place in top 100 bottom.
