What is wrong with people today? The comments already placed cite MJ as a 'freak' 'weirdo' and sexual deviant and yet these comments come from people who lives in areas where guys are now permitted to marry other guys, men change sex to women and George Bush to get another term as president.<br /><br />Some people, I believe, who have not yet been forced to accept the bitter corporate pill of PC behaviour may suggest that MJ is not so weird and freakish as the above.<br /><br />The film is a stupid and ridiculous attempt by a quite basic journalist to snake his way round someone to may him look even worse than a thousand tabloid newspapers have already achieved and for what exactly? I guess MJ chose Bashir after his fame-chasing interview with Lady Di had hit such heights (did we really want to hear that the future King and Queen of England were both unfaithful to each other). Bashir himself is the sort of weasly character that no-one at school liked as he garnered the truth from the weak to sell to the strong (probably for protection purposes from the school bully). MJ is again let down by himself, so has time arrived that no man but no man can show any genuine care or concern for children without being deemed a paedophile or in Jackson's case and some of the other comment writers here a monster without responsibility.<br /><br />Get a grip World it is not Jacko we should be concerned about it is the likes of Bashir and the Kid who really worry me.<br /><br />Living as a boy, so are all men now men, I still enjoy the sound of my own wind is this classed as Manish? I still yearn for the field I used to play football in is this classed as Manish.<br /><br />In commenting on this pile of dross I am left hopelessly wandering why we bother looking to the lives of these celebs, there lives are so, so different to ours how can we relate to it? Unadmitted envy obscures our will to watch without looking for chinks in there armour.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favour next time you want to watch this stuff turn it off and pick out a movie doc like 'When we were Kings' now that is art
