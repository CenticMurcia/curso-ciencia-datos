Gulzar's most controversial film made. This film was released in 1975 during "The Emergency". Supposedly inspired from the life of India's late prime minister, Indira Gandhi. The film was stuck and also banned by political activists of Indira Gandhi's Party. Suchitra Sen gives a powerful performance as a housewife who marries a common hotel manager (Sanjeev Kumar)against her father's wish. She then joins Politics against her husbands wish. Sanjeev Kumar got the best actor award for this film. So did gulzar. The best scene in the movie and one of Indian Cinema's most touching scene is the scene picturised on the song " Tere Bina Zindagi se Koi..". This is a Classic movie. It is a must see. This movie was a hit when there<br /><br />were 2 giant movies in competition.. "Deewar" and "Sholay".
