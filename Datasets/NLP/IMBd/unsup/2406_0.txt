16 Blocks is a thought provoking movie. Should Cops go on the take or maintain their honesty? I think that Police Officers should maintain their honesty. In one scene the secretary of the Detective played by Bruce Willis gives him some breath mints to hide the alcohol on his breath. Another Jack once said to never trust a man who has no alcoholic drinks to serve you when you come to his house. That is why for American Shadow President Jack F Kennedy I keep Heinekin beer in my house. <br /><br />A lot of people do not believe me when I say that there is a Care Rank Ki Alien American Secret Service Elizabeth Regina alliance but I am telling you truthfully that there is as the American Shadow Vice President Brad HD Morgan. My Grandfather King George VI Windsor is the Care Rank Ki Aliens Creators of Humans chosen Messiah. The efforts to stop global warming will be painful but they have been ordered by the Creators of Humans and we all must support the Care Rank Ki and Apophis-God. All of Bruce Willis other movies are worth watching even Hudson Hawk.
