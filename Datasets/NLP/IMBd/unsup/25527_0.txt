I like this movie a lot. It doesn't have the most original plot in the world but what it does with it is dynamite. This reminds me a lot of those old movies they call "filmes noir" nowadays, the ones with the weary cynical cop, played by someone like Mark Stevens or William Lundigan or Dana Andrews who gets mixed up with the dangerous dame who may or may not be a killer. And there's the likable but menacing loony (William Bendix, Elisha Cook), is he the guilty one? This is a real whodunit, folks, & it had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The three principals are terrific. Gershon is a pure pulp lusty female, right off the cover of an old Signet paperback. Michael Biehn has grizzled nicely since Terminator. Maybe he'll morph into today's Sterling Hayden. And Sean Patrick Flanery is fine as the charming psycho who evokes Michael J. Fox as Hannibal Lechter. It's a great-looking film, never static, with lots of dynamic camera work, great pace and good writing. A very professional and satisfying film. In a way it is what The Man Who Wasn't There should have been.
