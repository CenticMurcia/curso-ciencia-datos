STRIKE 3 - YOU ARE OUT!! I thought that for sure this movie would be an instant comedy classic because the prince of comedy, Martin Short, was going to be the evil villain. Boy, was I ever wrong.<br /><br />NOTHING was funny in this movie. I'd hardly classify this movie as a comedy. The farting reindeer wasn't funny the first time and then they had them fart AGAIN about 20 seconds later like it would be funny that time, and it wasn't. None of Martin Short's lines garnered laughs. Just awkward "was that supposed to be funny" reactions. And Mrs. Claus in stirrups and 9 months pregnant? That is just too much, let alone for a kid audience. Kids don't need to see that kind of stuff.<br /><br />Martin Short and Tim Allen did not have ANY comedic chemistry. Every scene and each dialogue just seemed too over-rehearsed and predictable.<br /><br />And the kid actors SUCKED big time. You'd think with such a large budget they could get some decent kid actors. The kid that played Santa's right arm man that knows the secrets and clauses was the worst kid actor I've ever watched in my life. How did THIS kid get to be in a BIG movie like this? He must have a good agent.<br /><br />I give this movie a 1 out of 10 because I was not entertained or amused by this holiday comedy. I predict this movie will be on DVD by the time Christmas rolls around.
