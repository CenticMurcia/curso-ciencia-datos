First of all I do not know how I landed up to watch this unbearable movie...<br /><br />The characters are really weak, The plot nothing great. And certain moment seem to have been stolen from other movies like Chocalat!!!<br /><br />The script and direction are weak and did not hold me for more then 15 minutes.<br /><br />However I still watched the film till end.<br /><br />How do such filmmakers get financed? I guess there are brave people like me around who make up the audience -maybe thats how.<br /><br />please avoid. Save your money and spare your being...
