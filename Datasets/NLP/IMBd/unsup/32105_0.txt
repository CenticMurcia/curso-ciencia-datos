A great cast like the one assembled for this film is often a warning<br /><br />sign. How many movies have you gone to see because of the cast,<br /><br />only to see their talents wasted? 'Gun Shy' breaks that curse; it is a<br /><br />great, imaginative and fun film. At first the storyline may seem <br /><br />disjointed, but wait; the threads are woven together and culminate<br /><br />in a lovely ending which I found refreshingly sweet. <br /><br />Liam Neeson's is one of many great performances--he must have<br /><br />loved this role as an antidote to the turgid mess that was 'Phantom<br /><br />Menace.' Oliver Platt and Richard Schiff are fine as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended to those who look for a little intelligence and<br /><br />humanity in their entertainment.
