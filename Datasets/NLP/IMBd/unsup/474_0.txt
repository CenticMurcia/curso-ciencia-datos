I can't believe I watched the whole thing. Polycarp aka Kinky Killers will bore your senses to death.<br /><br />You know those movies that look and feel like someone took a pickup truck down to the Sunset Strip and rounded up a bunch of prostitutes and whores, gave them scripts, drugs and money, and then said: NOW ACT! Well, this is one of 'those' movies.<br /><br />After about two minutes into this cheese-fest, you start feeling like you are watching a really bad porno flick. The directing, the lines, the cast, just give it away that the movie was governed end-to-end by the porn industry.<br /><br />Then (since they rounded up a lot of prostitutes off of the Sunset Strip), there is that problem where too many characters look alike - white, dumb and blond. You quickly become confused as to which dumb blond is getting hacked on now, but you resign yourself to not really caring since the movie is just so bad.<br /><br />The story is completely inane. The acting is so bad you can't believe God made people this stupid. There is no Good versus Evil, since everyone in the movie is evil; so does it really matter which evil wins? At the 30 minute mark you get the overwhelming feeling to just stop watching and try something else, but you decide to see it through. Next time remember to not be so heroic. At around 4/5 into the movie it actually does become a dedication to pornography, witchcraft, Satan and sex-magick. Everyone just starts having sex with whoever, I kid you not.<br /><br />The ending is as bad or worse than the beginning, leaving you with the typical WTF?! puzzlement. With a title of Kinky Killers (which by the way is meaningless) I suppose you should expect something sexual in nature, but this rode right over to the pornography arena in the last 20 minutes making it unfit for children and teens to view.<br /><br />A polycarp is a talking fish. A polycarp is a plastic fish. Polycarp is short for: polyester carpeting.
