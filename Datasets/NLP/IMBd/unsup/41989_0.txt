"Cat's Eye" is one of the several Stephen King written horror anthologies, and quite likely the weakest. If you are looking for some campy thrills, there is little charm to be found with in this film, with the exception of the excellent first section.<br /><br />"Quitters Inc.", the first of the three stories, is superbly acted by James Woods (but what doesn't he superbly act in?) and a pretty funny section at that. Basically, James Woods is a smoker trying to quit, and enlists the experts at Quitters Inc. to help him. Little does he know that he is getting a little more help then he bargained for... All and all a decent segment, it does fall a little flat in the shock department. If they had taken things farther (and I mean much farther), this would have been a really great and memorable section. As it is though, it is merely good King/Woods entertainment, but that ain't bad in it self.<br /><br />The second segment, "The Ledge", is a pretty drastic drop in quality. The story is unbelievable, which is hardly a problem in a horror anthology, but it is also poorly acted and very dull, which is a major problem. Although I doubt it is much longer then either of the other segments, it seemed to drag on forever. There is no real suspense or humor, and in the end you are just glad it's over.<br /><br />The final part of the film, "The General", is pretty bad but also entertaining. The obnoxious Mother is fun to get annoyed with and the troll creature is very awesome, although the blue screen scenes it is in are some of the worst I have ever seen. In fact, the special effects throughout the film are horrible and unimaginative; I enjoyed them for pure camp, but if you want any realism steer far away. A young Drew Barrymore appears and gives out a good performance as an actress, actually superior to both her parents in many ways.<br /><br />The tie together story of the wandering cat is stupid and pointless, and only enjoyable if you love to watch cats. Id rather watch a real cat sleep then watch this stupid cat wander into another Stephen King short story though, so go figure.<br /><br />The first segment is definitely worth watching for any Stephen King / Camp Horror / James Woods fan, and the third if you really like trolls or Drew Barrymore (they are basically the same thing). The second should be used for insomniacs or King completists only.<br /><br />A star and a half out of five.
