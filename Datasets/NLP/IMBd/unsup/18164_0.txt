First off, I love the opening credits of this film, with the stylized animation and the music. As for the rest of this, well, it is beautifully filmed, for the most part, with wonderful sets and yes, somewhat of a creepy story, tempered by Dean Stockwell's somewhat hammy performance as Wilbur Whately. Some "dream sequences" (as dreamed by the still-lovely Sandra Dee) are kind of silly, with people in makeup, who actually look fairly sinister but on the other hand they look like a bunch of hippies who ate acid for breakfast. But in the Whately house, there is a room that houses a secret, and I have to say when that door is opened that it may actually provide one of the better depictions of one of Lovecraft's "unspeakable, unnameable, un-whateverable" creatures than any other film that I've seen. Lots of color reversals and busy movement, as in, maybe, tentacles? I've read a lot of Lovecraft in my time and haven't seen a film yet that "accurately" portrays any of his "monsters" very well, except for perhaps this film. A lot of what one sees after that as this "thing" moves about the countryside are nothing more than color reversals and nothing great, though. I've seen this film only twice now but I like it a lot, despite Stockwell's somewhat goofy performance as a low-key but "sinister" Wilbur. If you're a Lovecraft fan & you've not seen this yet it's worth checking out. A classic 70's film. 8 out of 10.
