Ann Miler (as Eve) is a popular radio singer who wants to vacation after a successful season; but, her handlers want her to film a movie. She leaves anyway; then, her handlers give chase, forcing the star to hide out with William Wright (as Ward), a traveling newspaperman. A series of misunderstandings threaten their chance for romance.<br /><br />This film was re-made as "You Can't Run Away From It" (1956). It does compare favorably to that version; I think the situation works better in an older, black and white film from ten years earlierÂ… and, this version is a re-make of an even earlier version, "It Happened One Night". This one, "Eve Knew Her Apples" is really just okay. Ms. Miller is pretty. The production is weak, with the editing its most obvious distraction. <br /><br />**** Eve Knew Her Apples (1945) Will Jason ~ Ann Miller, William Wright, Ray Walker
