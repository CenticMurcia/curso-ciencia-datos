Sure, there's nothing redeeming here but I still love this movie. I have a fetish for truly bad cinema and this is one of my faves. We're all allowed our guilty pleasures, don'cha know? Would I recommend this to anyone? Heck, no. But I have to give Mae West credit for still marketing that same image at that age. You have to admire her chutzpa. And how can you NOT love the line referring to Timothy Dalton as England's number one spy who is "even bigger than 007". Pure camp, kiddies. That's all it is. It's like listening to Barry Manilow: don't expect anything and you'll be very satisfied! I first saw this movie when it came out. I was in high school at the time and I have not been TOO emotionally scarred by the experience. So, it's not really ALL that bad... or dangerous. LOL!
