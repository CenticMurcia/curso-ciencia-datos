Aaja Nachle A Musical Review:<br /><br />Madhuri Dixit!!! Man She Can Dance!!!!!<br /><br />This might be her Best since (Chane Ke Khet mein and Ek Do Teen) The main theme of this Movie is Dancing! The Songs were Smashing! The Story line is Pretty Original!!! Im Proud of saying Im not Disappointed.<br /><br />The Music by Salim - Sulaimaan Merchant Really Paid off!!!! Aaja Nachle Sung by Sunidhi Chauhan (what a Beautiful Voice She Has) I would give this Song 9 on 10 Somewhere i don't feel the Josh nut Somehow Madhuri Manages to Give this Song the Josh it Needs!<br /><br />Now Coming to Show me your Jalwa! Sung by Richa Sharma and Kailash Kher The Song Turned out to be Good Enough to Enjoy in Homes, Parties, Cars, Even the Junkies who like RAPS and stuff! They EVEN LIKED IT! so i would say 7/10<br /><br />Soniye Mil Ja! Sung by Madhuri herself, Sukhwinder Singh, Sunidhi Chauhan and Shreya Ghoshal! A Celebration Song Want to Dance to a Perfect Song or you just want to Celebrate Choose this Songs It Suits both 10/10<br /><br />O Re Piya! Sung by Rafaqat Ali Khan Smooth! Slow! Sweet! Sensual! Great! Soothing! A Great song for All Dynamic Song Lovers!!10/10<br /><br />Dance With me! Sung By Sonia Sahgal! The Song Is Somehow a Mixture of M. Jackson Music but still feels like Bolly! Enjoying 9/10<br /><br />Ishq Hua! Sung By Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal! The Song is Really Romantic! Nice One Good Score for All Heartbroken Guys and Girls! 10/10 Not Including me<br /><br />Koi Pathar Se Na Maare! sung by Sunidhi Chauhan and Shreya Ghoshal! A Sad Song with Poetic Lyrics by Piyush Mehra Very Well Done but its Simply makes you really Sad! so Not going to Work NAAAH Don't Think so I liked it SO ill give it 9/10<br /><br />Is Pal Sung again the Dua Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal!
