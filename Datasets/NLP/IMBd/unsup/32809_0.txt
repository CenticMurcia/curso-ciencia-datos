To use one of the many off-placing one-liners seen within the film, the simplest way I know to describe Broken English is, "Barf." This confusingly written film focuses on the dysfunctional life of a prescription drug addict and slightly psychotic female, played by Parker Posey. The usually fascinating Posey seems utterly boring, for the lack of a better term, throughout the entire film. This might be due to the fact that her character remained underdeveloped and emotionally ambiguous the entire time. The acting, cinematography, storyline, and soundtrack within Broken English all feel despondent, uncreative, and forced. Broken English completely failed to grab my attention as by the middle of the film, I was actually yawning and counting the number of tiles on the ceiling. (148, if you were interested.)
