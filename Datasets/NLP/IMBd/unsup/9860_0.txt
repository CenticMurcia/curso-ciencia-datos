Greatly enjoyed this film and the wonderful photography of New York City and beautiful scenery in various Historical Towns in Virginia, namely: Charlottesville, Culpeper and Orange, Virginia. Jessica Lang,(Martha Baring),"Big Fish", '03 played the very over powering mother-in-law to Gwyneth Paltrow,(Helen Baring),"A Perfect Murder",'98, who is very much in love with her husband and there are many scenes where they are making love most of the time. Jessica Lang is very protective of her son and even goes through their luggage looking at Helens method of Birth Control. Nina Foch,(Alice Baring),"A Song to Remember",'45, a great veteran actress, gives very important information to Helen Baring concerning the Baring Family past secrets. If you look close, you will see Hal Holbrook,(Dr. Franklin Hill),"Purpose",'02, giving advice to Martha Baring concerning prescriptions for horses. If you love Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lang, this film will greatly entertain you from beginning to end.
