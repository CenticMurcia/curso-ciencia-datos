Aljure provided a fresh look at Colombian cinema on "La Gente de la Universal", but it is on this masterpiece that he exploits all that his "cinephilia" has done to him over the years. He takes on a video-clip rhythm and shoots on film allowing a colorful yet moonlit cinema that goes on with the drug-related parody and gloomily joyful characters in which not one is secondary. It's lighting and editing contrast any other Colombian film and it's sweet artistic joy and euphoria carry it's audience through a ride of ecstasy just like the "pepas" of the movie carry it's characters. "El Colombian Dream" has arrived and we can only celebrate along with it.
