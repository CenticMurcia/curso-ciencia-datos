I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this movie when it came out, but my first warning should have been when it went straight to video and not in theatres like its former installments. I'm not a big fan of the films period, but I was excited about the story of bloody mary hitting the screen. First off, the acting is atrocious. I mean, are these actors or puppets? They just all seem to be way too dramatic, and you get the sense they're acting like they know they're in a horror film (if that's what you want to call it) and are acting out the clich√© reactions. Mary herself was not scary, but probably more cute and cuddly. Seriously, I felt when she came on screen she was the fairy good witch, not scary at all. I respect Mary Lambert for pet cemetery, but after even watching the behind-the-scenes, I'm afraid she may have lost it. Hopefully her future endeavors won't be the likes of this.
