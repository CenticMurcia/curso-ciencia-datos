i loved this movie very much. i say this because in the original Cinderella is all goody goody and has dreams of getting away from her step family and all she does is sit around just waiting for something to happen. seriously people when kids see the original they will think that some random magical person will come and solve all their problems. although when you kids see this and also the first sequel (cinderlla 2 dreams come true) they will learn that something might happen to their magical person and that when you sit around doing nothing you wont get anything near of what you want (ofcoarse friends would also be helpful) also in both sequels Cinderella is much more independent and you learn a lot more about the other characters like the princes mother and the kings past and the stepmother is countless times more evil. and you also learn that one of the stepsisters want what Cinderella also wants. i love the songs epically "just a dream" and "at the ball". their is so much more comedy and more sweet moments with a lot of the characters and not just Cinderella and the prince. also you get a lot more information about the prince except for his name. i would give this about an 8/10 because i wish that Disney would put Cinderella's dead mother and father figure in the clouds or something watching her live happily. so to sum it all up watch this movie and your get a much more magical feeling.
