Not only the best hogan film but one of my fave films of all time.<br /><br />when i first watched this with 2 other people i was slightly tipsy....but that just made it better...for 1 and a half hours we were on the floor laughing it's that funny....and the best part is it's funny for all the wrong reasons it's so bad it's great, the dialogue is hilarious and hogans acting is even better.<br /><br />if you have some spare time and a couple of mates over don't be afraid to watch this.....4/5 stars<br /><br />"ANTIFREEZE"
