I should have immediately known this was a bad movie when the biggest names in it were washed-up sitcom co-stars. This was by far, the worst thing I have ever seen. I could tell it would be a stereotypical teen comedy, and in fact I only watched it because it had Winnie Cooper in it, and I've been in love with her for as long as I can remember. Not anymore! I cannot believe anyone would sink so low as to make this movie. Every character is a stereotype, it has terrible acting, an atrocious script, and the most predictable plot I've ever seen in my life. There where characters that just stopped showing up halfway through the movie, scenes that contributed nothing to the plot and never went anywhere, and every sort of gross-out gag you can imagine. I could only suggest this movie if you feel like torturing yourself for an hour and a half.
