If you love classic horror, this movie is a truly obscene experience. Milton Subotsky was the producer of some of the finest British horror in Amicus productions like the flawless "Dr Terror's House of Horrors", while Price and Carradine are two of the greatest actors in the genre.<br /><br />So to see them all together here in the twilight of their lives trashing the memory of great monster films and their own careers is simply miserable.<br /><br />Amicus films had plenty of humor, but it never overrode the creepiness. The anthologies took themselves seriously, so we, the audience, suspended our disbelief and bought into the thrills.<br /><br />In this last gasp of a once-proud tradition, Subotsky apparently slipped his gears and decided to play it for yucks, but the result is simply idiotic. The music is the worst...efforts to portray fake rock bands in movies always have as much depth, credibility and coolness as The Archies or the Partridge Family. The actors, despite decent performances, come off looking like senile has-beens scrounging for a paycheck by savaging the genre that brought them fame.<br /><br />This film belongs in the bin with such gems as "Abbot and Costello meet (insert overexposed Universal monster here)" and "Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders".
