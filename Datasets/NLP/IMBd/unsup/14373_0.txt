The prior reviewer is right about one thing and that is that the lead actress just doesn't carry this off. FYI to that reviewer...she DIDN'T survive. Didn't you notice that the cab driver's name is Peter (as in SAINT PETER) and she for no apparent reason starts telling him all her sins on this ride to no where in particular? Then in the end Peter just says it's "time to go" when all along they've been going no where and in no hurry. She's dead dude and that's supposed to be the big "revelation" at the end as to why "Peter" talks her through her sins and gets her to admit them and feel bad about them so she can enter heaven. Anyway it's pretty corny and let's face it the plot is just downright odd with far too many over reactions by all the characters within the story to be believable. I don't care how much that woman wanted a baby, one look at these people should give anyone pause about whether those are the genes you really want in a child you raise. Hate it, though, because Jeffrey Donovan definitely should get better uses of his skills than this wreck.
