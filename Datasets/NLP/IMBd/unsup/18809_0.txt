After seven years of his wife, Ellen, presumably being lost at sea, Nick Arden marries his latest flame, Bianca. Only to get on his honeymoon to find that Ellen has in fact survived, and spent the seven years on a tropical island with another man called Stephen Burkett.<br /><br />My Favorite Wife is based around the Alfred Tennyson poem entitled "Enoch Arden". Numerous adaptations have been made, but few, if any, are as frothy as this Cary Grant and Irene Dunne starer. Grant and Dunne are re-teamed here after their massive success with the quite marvellous The Awful Truth in 1937, and tho the role of Ellen was touted to Jean Arthur, it was Dunne who grasped the role and created sizzling comedy once again with the fabulous Grant. The Awful Truth director Leo McCarey, was all set to direct this piece but a car accident put paid to that and the reins passed to jobber Garson Kanin, who aided by a firing on all cylinders cast, weaved a splendidly delightful picture.<br /><br />Tho the movie's obvious charm lays with it's two main stars, it would be a big disservice to forget the contributions of Randolph Scott as Stephen Burkett and Gail Patrick as Bianca. Scott's laid back persona is perfect foil to Grant's more batty approach work, while Patrick in the tricky role of the neurotic second wife is fabulous, and it remains a mystery as to why she didn't go on to better and brighter things. Tho the ending is never in doubt, and the last quarter dries up on the gags front, My Favorite Wife still stands the test of time as a screwball picture of note, see it if you get the chance, it should brighten your day. 7.5/10
