i love this movie. it's classic film-noir. the storyline is superb. all of the characters are compelling to watch. Joan Crawford truly does an excellent job in the role. there is a darkness in many of the scenes that adds to the feel of the movie;you feel as if you're right there on the scene. Joan's performance was academy-award worthy.the movie gives you the feel of the 1940's...the dress, the furniture, the cars; even the hospital-medical atmosphere and thinking of the times. the architecture of the homes and waterfront cabin speak of a time when things were built with detail, style, and authentic woods. the movie totally takes you back in time, and i know i can watch it again and again.this movie should always be kept available. as good a performance as Mildred pierce; in the film-noir aspect possessed exceeds Mildred pierce; for film-noir, story and acting it get,s a 10! you just have to believe that she eventually recovers from her illness and goes on happily married to that gem of a husband she had.
