Thank you! t.v. cable cheap channels that have the courage to air this direct to video horror cheese flicks! When there's nothing to do at midnight on the week, these flicks air and believe me it's a pleasure for me to watch as I'm a lover of the low budget.<br /><br />"Butchered" follows the same plot as in "HellNight", "The Initiation", and many more slasher flicks from the early 80's. The problem is that this flick from the year 2003 doesn't offers anything you haven't seen.<br /><br />The "killer" kind of reminds me of the Garth Manion monsters from "HellNight" but not as near as scary. Ugh. This is a flick to booth from the trash can!.<br /><br />The flick has cheap gore effects, scares, and a dull direction even for a direct to video mess! Watch it if you're like me, a hardcore fan of low budget horror flicks.
