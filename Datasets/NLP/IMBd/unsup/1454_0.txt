Jeremy Piven and Sherilyn Fenn are sane lovers trying to find one another in an insane world. They make a very charming screen couple -- why aren't they doing more films together? Piven's role as a tour bus driver keeps him putting on an act he despises to maintain an unlikely relationship with Fenn, who plays the part of a rising movie star. Just Write is a fresh, charming treatment of an old storyline, made enjoyable by memorable characters.<br /><br />To balance the niceness of the two leads, Jo Beth Williams and Alex Rocco give outstanding performances as cynical supports. Williams delivers some great lines as Fenn's forever-on-the-phone agent, and Rocco, as Piven's lame father, provides an entertaining obstacle for his son to nudge aside so he can shoot for the moon.<br /><br />Wallace Shawn, Jeffrey Sams, Yeardley Smith, and Stephanie Miller keep the laughs coming in minor support roles, and Costas Mandylor is the Hummer-driving, GQ- reading soap star boyfriend Fenn can't shake loose.<br /><br />Relax and give it a try. I think you'll end up watching it more than once.
