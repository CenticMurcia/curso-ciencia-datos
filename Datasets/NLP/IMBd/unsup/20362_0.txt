MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!! well I had my mind made up for this movie to be just plain horrible, according to the reviews, but since I had no choice but to buy it I did and wasn't REALLY disappointed.<br /><br />I totally agree that the movie isn't really funny as it may seem in the trailer. I mean the fact of making ur rival fat and turning ur friend orange MAY seem funny 'but' they don't crack me up. But there was SOMETHING about it that made me keep watching it.<br /><br />Let me make myself clear, this movie is NOT outstanding in my opinion. There are little things that are really little, but they are very important.<br /><br />Emma (Anne Hathaway)is the quiet and caring, while Liv (Kate Hudson) is aggressive and strong willed. But this experience makes them realize that it's not who the REALLY are. First off Liv has a lot of moral support from her fianc√© while Emma doesn't. And at the end of the film we see them as opposites from who they were at the start.<br /><br />It may seem silly but if you watch carefully, you will see what I mean. So if your looking for a good chick flick comedy, maybe this is ideal. But if your just looking for a movie on a rainy day, it isn't that bad.
