Seua khaap daap (aka - The Tiger Blade) is a fast paced martial arts and gun fight action film set in modern day Bangkok. Yosthana ("Yos") is a smart young "Special Agent" who uses technology, a magic sword, guns and a healthy dose of martial arts skill to vanquish dozens of bad-guys, some of whom are protected by magic. Along with a team of sometimes comical special agents they chase and fight the henchmen of notorious rebel Commander "Kao Yod". Plot holes and twists are plentiful but the well scripted action scenes and high (for Thailand) production values make the film enjoyable. Don't expect as slick a film as a modern Hong Kong production and you won't be disappointed. Think more like along the lines of an early 90's Jackie Chan or Chow Yun-Fat action movie and you'll be thoroughly delighted.<br /><br />*Note - The version I saw contained some sort of fuzzy pixelization censorship of a) cigarettes when in someone's mouth but not in their hands, and b) guns when pointed directly at someone in the same frame. Bloody scenes of bullets striking heads and chests, a body exploding, and faces being punched were not!?!?! Â…go figure.<br /><br />Finally, this film contains no nudity but it is filled with violence, a bit of sex and a sexual assault. I don't have kids but I would think this warrants PG-13 treatment.
