Is this a horror movie?Are you sure!I could not see so cheap scares, so cheap directing, and so cheap acting.'Araf' is look like a very simple and very bad student short movie!This film totally sucks the life out of his story with an incapable cast and acting, horrible dialog, and poor production values in every area.The digital effects are look like the movies of 50 years ago.<br /><br />Editing is ridiculous' Directing is very amateurish' Producing is unprofessional' SO How can we say that is a movie! 'Araf' doesn't even minimally seem to care about accuracy or authenticity.it is like some awful inside joke played upon the audience.I could slap myself silly for wasting my money. I could have bought a good cup of coffee and read a good book instead.In turkey there is ver very good movies.Please don't forget 'Araf' is not a sample of Turkish movie!
