My God, could this movie get ANY MORE bleeding heart? Wonderful - a story of illegal aliens who sneak into the US and then complain that they're not getting enough from their illegally held jobs. Argh...<br /><br />Sorry, Ken. It didn't work for me with working class Brits in _Riff Raff_. It's even worse when you try to do the same movie again in the US.<br /><br />
