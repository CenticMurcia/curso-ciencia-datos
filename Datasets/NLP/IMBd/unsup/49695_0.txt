Drew Barrymore & Jessica Lange, two of our better actresses portray two exceedingly selfish, spoiled rich women who through their own stupidity fall on very bad times.<br /><br />If the mother & daughter they portray were not related to Jacqueline Kennedy-Onasis, we probably would probably never have heard of them.<br /><br />There was a documentary made about these two in 1976,which was popular.<br /><br />Why I do not know, except that if I had seen it I would not have seen this very long 104 minute bore from HBO.<br /><br />It won a few Emmy's this year, Ken Howard & Jeane Tripplehorn won for playing the husband & father to the 2 women. Jeanne won for playing Jackie Kennedy-Onasis. Again why I do not know.<br /><br />Both Jessica & Drew play such unlikeable women,why would any one even care what happened to them. Daniel Baldwin plays the lover of Drew.<br /><br />This is a well made film that to me became a big bore, because the 2 main characters were such hateful selfish nasties,I could not care for any of the film.<br /><br />The only decent guys in the movie were the 2 sons & brothers of Big & 'Lil Edie. & they disappear after there scene..<br /><br />HBO missed on this.I just cant figure why this has such a high rating on IMDb<br /><br />Ratings: *1/2* (out of 4); 42 points (out of 100) IMDb 3 (out of 10)
