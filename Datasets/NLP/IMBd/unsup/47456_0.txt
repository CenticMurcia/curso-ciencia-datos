An old man travels back in time to save John Kennedy from being hilled, meanwhile in the new present day, Bruce Campbell is making a movie on another conspiracy that transpired on the day Kennedy was supposed to get shot. Low budget crap where none of the actors look or sound anything like who they're supposed to be portraying. It might be a good 'what if', but in execution it's extremely lacking and even the insanely great Bruce Campbell can't save this turkey that comes off as a sub-par episode of "The Outer Limits" <br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Eye Candy: Shelley Marks gets topless
