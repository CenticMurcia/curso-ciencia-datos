Sometimes movies about the military are so bad it makes me want to put on a turban, this is one of them. Air Strike is a story of how a US Air Force team loses two great pilots on a mission and spends the rest of the movie bombing the shyt out of the drug cartel responsible.<br /><br />Every clich√© you can think of is in this movie. Guy's brother dies so he comes out of retirement to take his place (even though he hasn't flown in years and can just simply hop a plane) and avenge him, female pilot gets heckled for being a female and calls them on it, guy falls in love with female and everyone sees it coming, and my favorite....guy breaks out of prison and proceeds to take out 30 guys single handedly armed with barely anything.<br /><br />The movie has some decent flight patterns from the different type of planes, but the overall part is so horrible that not even the actual air strikes within the movie could wake the crowd up. Lastly, I din't know knocking off drug cartels was a major accomplishment, so why did they chant USA! USA! at the end? I don't see police officers chanting USA after giving someone a speeding ticket. That mission was purely personal and no one was going to read about it so why make it seemed like they dropped the A bomb on Hiroshima? <br /><br />There are no highlights to this movie, that's how bad it is....1 out of 10
