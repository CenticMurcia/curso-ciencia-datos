Avoid this piece of crap at all cost. I just sat thru this awful film in a local theatre. I wanted to leave after 15 minutes due to panic attacks and nausea. But i was there with a friend and felt obligated to stay thru-out.<br /><br />The story is non-existant, the plot is nowhere to be found. There is no conflict (or problem) to be solved. The actors are bad e.t.c....<br /><br />We follow a little girl called ELINA, her sister, her mother and<br /><br />a strict schoolteacher (Bibi Andersson). This is a parody on film-making, and a mockery of interesting stories about life.<br /><br />If the "bad teacher" vs "good student" interests you, I would strongly recommend watching: "Hets", "Ole, Dole, Doff", "Zero de Conduite", instead of this awful movie.<br /><br />My rating: 0/10 AVOID AT ALL COST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
