Where should I start? It's not like I watch Sci-Fi channel for its important and life-affirming programing...but every once in a while, some good t&a is integral to one's developmental health, and this movie was full of it. Definitely not a great movie, but entertaining nevertheless, especially with a pint or two of Moose Drool, or any brew of choice.<br /><br />First of all, the Hawaiian scenery is quite impressive, not quite Jackson Hole, but spectacular nonetheless. I didn't quite get the ending, but the girls were hot, especially that Bianca Lawson chick, she's pretty hot.<br /><br />The CGI was passable for your standard Sci-fi channel B-flick, but what can you expect, they're not spending the 100 million dollars that Michael Bay spent on Transformers. The acting was fairly decent, but by no means Oscar worthy. It's a fair exchange for the Playboy centerfolds that ran around half naked in pink g-stings.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this film, and would probably watch this film again. Since Roger Corman has launched the careers of everyone from Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Jack Nicholson, Jamie Lee Curtis and Brad Johnson, I hope the actors in this movie will follow in the footsteps of these fine examples instead of the Candice Railson and Mary Woronov's of his company.
