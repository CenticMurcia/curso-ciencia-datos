When I found out this movie was on fancast.com and knowing about it's reputation of having Ms. Lynda Carter topless, I had to watch this right away. While we do see her having sex with Marjoe Gortner twice and in a skinny dipping scene and she does undress in front of her mother, not once does she display both in front on screen at the same time in all its glory. Needless to say, I was very disappointed! And the story itself, about outlaws on the run with Lynda willingly going along for the ride, is pretty exciting in a trashy kind of way for a while but then gets too repetitiously redundant by the end. In other words, I don't regret watching this, but I don't think I want to see this again. Oh, and that was a nice song Ms. Carter sang.
