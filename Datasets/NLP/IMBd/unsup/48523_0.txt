OK, I know that my rating is very hard(it deserve a 3/10), but it's just to lower down the global rating, coz this movie deserve a 3/10. When I watched it, I didn't know it was an Araki film and didn't guess till I watched the poster. I don't care if he decided to do a comedy, but this one is so lame, boring and vulgar that I'm shocked.Some people seems to argue about the fact that this film is pro or anti drug, but that's not the point. It's a just a silly comedy and that would be OK for me if it was not so slow and bad directed. It look like the work(?) of a young filmmaker trying to be shocking (but not too much) to be noticed, but it isn't a film from the heart for sure. Few jokes works but that's not enough to make a 90 min film. So I better enjoy "Trainspotting" or such dumb (but fun) comedy as "Hey dude where's my car" or "Harold & Kumar" which at least provides laughs and don't make you fast forward after half an hour.Last thing, the story is more about a stupid girl than a stoner, if someone know where she can find pot with so much effects and that last so long just tell me where.At least be honest and do a real film about drug and not a retarded teen movie, so long Mr Araki!
