This movie is beyond bad. It is legendarily bad. I highly recommend watching it after an obsessed friend of mine (who actually owns a t-shirt with a picture of one of the movie's goblins he calls googly eyes, because it has weird eyes) made me watch it drunk. I'm not sure what this movie would be like sober, but I bet it wouldn't be pretty. It might make you doubt life in a way that suicidal thoughts would be induced into your head. I'm going to save you all the wonderful quotes from this movie, which you have probably already read from previous reviews. I'll just tell you this, because I think it truly summarizes how equally terrible and hilarious this movie is: There is actually a scene where you can see one of the tech crew, or someone else who's not supposed to be there running off the scene in the background (I rewound and watched it this part three times with friends because it was too unbelievable for words).
