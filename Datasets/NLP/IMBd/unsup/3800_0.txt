I remember a fun energetic guy who tricks and plays jokes on an old buddy. There is a woman that works for his buddy. He ends up falling in love with a her and at the same time he changes her reputation as an actor to be a real star.It turns out that his buddy plays a joke right back and well.... you should watch it.
