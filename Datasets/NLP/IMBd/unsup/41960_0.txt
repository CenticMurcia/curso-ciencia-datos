Seems as though the director got stuck watching Bend it Like Beckham too many times as this movie created too many instances of deja vu. A stale screenplay that never attempts to rise above itself coupled with stumbling dialogue dooms the movie long before the viewers try to grasp a plot that's really not existent.<br /><br />While it's not difficult to associate with some of the problems that flash on screen they never really stick into your mind long enough to leave a lasting impact.<br /><br />The acting laurels rests firmly on the husband and wife and it is through them that some of the warmer and emotional moments are enjoyed. The kids are pretty useless- ignorant, petulant, spoiled and unappreciative they elicit no sympathy whatsoever, especially after the turning point of the movie. If the director wanted the younger cross cultured audience to empathize and associate with the three kids then he got it horribly wrong.<br /><br />In one scene Raj responds to his wife's query of not adding cream to the Indian food that they're making by stating "We don't Americanize our Indian food, darling." By Americanizing this movie far too much the director lost sight of the vision he started out with and ended up with a confusing, stumbling movie that might have been interesting with the presence of a decent plot. But we shall sadly never know...
