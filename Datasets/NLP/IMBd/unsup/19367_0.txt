I've only watched two Charlie Chaplin films as of this date, this one and the outstanding CITY LIGHTS. However, they alone are already enough to convince me that Chaplin was a genius, and a very funny man. Here he plays his famous tramp character, who is first involved in a hilarious chase sequence with the cops throughout the circus. When his physical antics prove funnier to the paying crowd than the clowns already acting in the show, the mean and abusive ringmaster hires Chaplin as a funnyman for the circus. There are consistent funnies all along the way, but also an endearing story of his affection for a female horse rider from the show, who's sweet on someone else.<br /><br />I often say that silent films are not my favorite type, and I don't care for the silent Laurel and Hardy films like I do their early talkies, because I love hearing their verbal exchanges (especially Hardy's). But when it comes to Charlie Chaplin I can't imagine his work being as entertaining any other way than silent, with him relying on pantomime over voice. I was also struck by how creative and interesting so many shots were in this film, even more so than some early sound movies.
