Nate (Richard O'Neal) goes off on a cattle drive, not before having sex with his wife,Sarah (Barbara Bourbon), of course. After 3 escaped convicts rape her, steal her three nubile daughters and then flee, leaving her strung up by her hands, she of course wants revenge. So when a rag-tag posse chasing the convicts rescue her, she insists on traveling with them. This is a curious film, as a porno/western hybrid, it's the first of it's kind that I've seen. Some may be put off by the highly exploitative showing of rape and incest. But I found myself actually drawn into and interested in what would happen next. The film is a further example of how porn films now shot on video, just don't seem to cut it (barring, of course, the way above average output of Directors Micheal Zen, Brad Armstrong, and few others) My Porn Grade: B-
