And they had released such gems as Yogi bear, Top Cat, Magilla Gorilla and this effort, Quick Draw Mcgraw. Quick Draw was a horse from the wild west,whose sidekick was the Mexican donkey, Baba Louie. Quick Draw was dopey at times but he was a good character and had a dog called Snuffles who'd only react once he got his dog biscuit! Sometimes, he'd dress up as his alter ego, El Kabong- the Zorro-like marksman and instead of wielding a sword, he smashes the bad guys heads with his acoustic guitar-thus it makes a 'KA-BONG' sound, which was frankly, hilarious.<br /><br />Quick Draw McGraw like many of Hanna Barbera's classic gems was a great cartoon and one that would be remembered as one of the best produced. Fun, enjoyable and a good laugh too also.<br /><br />Recommended
