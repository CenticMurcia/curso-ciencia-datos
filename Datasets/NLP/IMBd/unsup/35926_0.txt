This was an awful movie. James Woods should have paid the studio to not release this film. He must have been desperate for money. It's the worst performance of his career! I can't believe anyone viewing this disaster could consider his performance "brilliant!" I was embarrassed for him! What was he thinking when he agreed to be in this horrible movie??!! I was shocked that Michael Rappaport was in this film. He's a pretty credible actor and his appearance in this movie was surprising. It was a terrible role. He must have needed the money too. The writing is so bad. Although, upon retelling some of the "plotlines" to my husband, as I recounted one of "pops" speeches, we laughed out loud. So, it may play well as a really good, bad movie for some of you. For me, a waste of time.
