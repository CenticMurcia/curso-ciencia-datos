Ok. You do not expect much from a 1994 movie you have never heard of and is being given for free with the purchase of a bad magazine. Least while for strange developments in your life all of this happens to take place in Bilbao, Spain.<br /><br />But this is a fine movie. A very good one. The plot flows very ...well... very fluidly. It goes surprising you on and on, but in a subtle, soft way.<br /><br />At the end, you feel a lot of empathy for the naive Japanese guy, and, in my case, a deep love for Shelly... I canÂ´t tell you more about it without spoiling it.<br /><br />Watch it.
