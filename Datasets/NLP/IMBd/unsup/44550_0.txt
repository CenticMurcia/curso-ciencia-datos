"Til Death" is not one of the better crypt episodes, it simply doesn't have any known stars, and the plot is too predictable and I really don't care for the voodoo theme. Well anyway you have two people I've never heard of that being Pamela Glen and D.W. Moffett who star with the setting taking place at a land plantation. But a new secret plan this tricky new developer who needs money to buy the new land can only get his inheritance from a millionaire princess. Well now you guessed it that's right voodoo time! Just go to the old potion and witch doctors for help to land Mrs. right! And the voodoo works only to end up being terrible with the bride as a never ending occult! Really a pretty weak episode of "Tales" with a predictable plot and little action or drama and it really hurts not having any star power. So pass on this episode.
