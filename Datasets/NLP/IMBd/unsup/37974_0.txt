I have to wonder what movie some of these other reviewers watched.<br /><br />This story in this movie was terrible, actually confusing Bigfoot with werewolves. One bit of dialog for the purpose of exposition was a wooden little piece where a deputy tells the sheriff, (para-phrased) "Must be the beast of Bray Road. A monster in the 1800s wiped out everyone out there." <br /><br />"Is this true?" asks the sheriff.<br /><br />"Oh, absolutely" confirms a nearby nurse. ROFL <br /><br />Its not quite funny bad, just bad and wooden.<br /><br />I have to admit that I didn't watch this entire movie. It chased me off soon after the wretched conversation just recounted. Save yourself and watch a Murder She Wrote rerun instead. LOL
