*** May contain spoilers. ***<br /><br />Certainly, serious talent and skill came to bare in producing SCANDAL - JOSEON NAMNYEO SANGYEOLJISA (UNTOLD SCANDAL). The photography and direction are far above average. Set design, costumes, acting and music are all blended together with polish and flare. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the story does not ring true. Surely in his life the seducer would have come across young ladies far, far, more innocent and sincere than the lady he sort of comes to love. There was nothing unique or special about her. In fact, she was so distrustful that she seemed more worldly than many. And that the seducer left her to seek sex with his kissing cousin points more to him never loving her at all.<br /><br />Another problem is that all of the seduced young people in this film are always exactly dumb enough or inert enough to be tricked at every turn. The seduced people were boring puppets.<br /><br />The story is introduced from a fictional book, and is told from the dead seducer's point of view (using his voice over at the end). The story is clearly presented as a unbelievable fantasy. Professional reviewers see UNTOLD SCANDAL as being a comedy? I agree with the amateur reviewers -- UNTOLD SCANDAL is a comedy for sadists. The fantasy is ugly and unpleasant. It is entertainment for the cruel.<br /><br />Apply the photography, direction, acting, set design, costumes and music to a better story, and then we could have a world class movie.
