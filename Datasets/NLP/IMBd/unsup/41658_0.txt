Or "Horny Fish-Men From the Deep". A very silly monster film, about twenty years BEHIND its time. What can you say about a film that drew its "inspiration" from such silly crap as "Creature From the Black Lagoon" and "Horror At Party Beach". About as scary as a five year-old wearing a vampire mouth-piece. Quite stupid, too. Dogs get butchered, people disappear, a boat blows up - and yet nothing seems to wake up this small (and probably quite jaded) fishing community. Only when bodies start appearing all over the place do brains start activating: "Hey...! There's something fishy here!". And even then they conclude that it was probably just the fish. Some very stupid dialog. The creatures are your typical zombie-like amphibian fish-people, with the difference that they like to rape women; the idea that mutated fish have the "urge to mate" with human females is just too much - even for a dumb horror film. The absurd set of coincidental circumstances that lead to the (first) boat's explosion are an early indication of the dumb things to follow. The last scene is a shameless 1:1 rip-off of the (in)famous belly-burst scene from "Alien".
