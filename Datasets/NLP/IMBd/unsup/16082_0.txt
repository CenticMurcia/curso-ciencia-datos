Godzilla 2000 Millennium is the dark, but eerily beautiful updating of the Godzilla saga. It features stunning SPFX, passionate performances by a well assembled cast and great action. Takehiro Murata as Yuji Shinoda and Hiroshi Abe as Mutsuo Katagiri give inspired performances as men in opposite camps regarding Godzilla. In fact, the drama between the human characters is just as satisfying as the effects scenes- which are great. The score by Takayuki Hattori is moving and effective in conveying the various moods of this well-made kaiju eiga (Japanese monster movie). Godzilla 2000 Millennium also has moments of humor as well as scenes which give us insight into the lives of the people tracking Godzilla and who must then deal with an even greater threat. The scenes between the father/daughter team of Yuji and Io Shinoda who head the Godzilla Prediction Network (GPN) are entertaining and moving, especially at a very dramatic moment in the story. The monster battles are well done as are the confrontation between Godzilla and the Japanese Self Defense Forces. Godzilla 2000 Millennium also vindicates the traditional Japanese way of making giant monster movies. Made with a fraction of the budget for the American Godzilla movie of 1998, it delivers a more authentic, satisfying product. Godzilla 2000 Millennium is probably the second greatest movie in the entire series, exceeded only by the original "Gojira."
