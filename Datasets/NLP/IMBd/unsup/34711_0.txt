This movie made me cringe in my seat and at times I was forced to look away... but not for the reasons the filmmakers intended.<br /><br />Disgusting and pathetic acting topped with the most stupid story and direction by an idiot.<br /><br />Hated every millisecond of it.<br /><br />At times I thought the writers had supernatural powers...<br /><br />When the main 'thing' (I wont disgrace anyone and use the term actor) starts ranting 'Someone help me!' I was taken aback as that is exactly what I was thinking at the time.<br /><br />When they discover an old newspaper that reports the closure of the asylum they are in and she quips 'This doesn't make any sense' I could only agree.<br /><br />If there is a film god, then everyone on the project will never work again. I'm hoping the reaper gets them.<br /><br />Amateurish rubbish at its finest! Just who slept with who to give this crap of a production the green light.
