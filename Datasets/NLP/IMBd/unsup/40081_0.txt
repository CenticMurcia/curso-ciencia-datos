I haven't read the book, but unfortunately I saw this film, being a big Cate Blanchett fan. Well, I still remain a fan and don't blame her for this 'spy game' drek, but still, what were they thinking? How can they make a story like this boring? Variety called this movie "bland and dour", I'd have to add silly. Billy Crudup's weird little attempt at a french accent made me giggle at times, and there is absolutely no chemistry between the leads. I liked the villain, Anton Lesser, and some of the camera work held my interest, but for the most part, wait for the video.
