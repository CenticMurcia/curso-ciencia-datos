Genocyber is one of the most repulsive, ultraviolent examples of anime I've had the misfortune of watching. With unsympathetic characters, low-budget animation, and an eerie fascination with blood and gore, Genocyber loses any moral message it tries to express in a bloodbath of proportions matched only by fellow Ohata Koichi titles such as MD Geist.<br /><br />Many people think that titles like this are what makes anime worth viewing. I thoroughly disagree with that opinion. Genocyber has precious little coherent plot to go with the scenes of carnage it presents, and gratuitously adds sequences (for example) of children being little blown apart by helicopter gunships in slow motion.<br /><br />Sure, it's not real, but should we be encouraging this kind of stuff by buying or renting this sort of sludge?<br /><br />Granted, violence is a fact of life, and a fact of entertainment, but I can't possibly with any sense of conscience support or endorse this much glorification of violence for entertainment's sake. Especially in a title as pointless and overwhelmingly bad as Genocyber.
