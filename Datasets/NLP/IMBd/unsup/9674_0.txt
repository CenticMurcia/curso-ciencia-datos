I wanted to like this film. Yet, even with the significant eye candy, I couldn't find anything else enjoyable about this film. It wasn't funny. It didn't have any sexuality and nothing in the film was executed properly. <br /><br />For a film that features women on the run, the director of this film did not put any strain on these actresses. The lead actresses were not instructed to do anything strenuous. I was suppose to believe that they did all this running around, with their stilettos still intact. <br /><br />The supporting cast was weak. Only Paul Rodriquez did his role justice. I was surprised how well Sofia Vergara did in this movie. In the preshowings I saw, she looked like the weakest of the women casted. However, it turns out she was the strongest of the women and provided a solid performance. I thought that Roselyn Sanchez would be the main focus of the film. But, she consistently ruined her lines and she didn't seem comfortable at all speaking the dialogue. Jaci Velasquez did a fair job, being this was her first film. I can't see why the "Christian Freaks" were so hard on her for taking this film. I mean, she kept her clothes on. She didn't swear. She wasn't even playing a negative role. She was playing a character. Get over it, Y'all. Overall though, I thought the three women together were mediocre. Then, to top off this unsatisfactory film. They have this whack ending about female independence. Whattttt!!!??? Most of the movie was about female dependence and they try to sell it as a tale of liberation? Please!!! <br /><br />Like I said before, I wish I could say I liked it, but I can't. It was very disappointing. I hope the next time they bring three lovely latinas together on screen, they will support them with a decent plot, well rounded characters and make them perform their tails off. As well, as suppling great eye candy. Unfortunately, Chasing Papi isn't that movie. <br /><br />2 out of 10.
