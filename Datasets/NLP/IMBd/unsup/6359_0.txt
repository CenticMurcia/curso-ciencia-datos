Bad film seekers rejoice! Rent or buy this film on video and marvel at its sloppy tackiness and sheer badness. There have been a lot of Grade Z horror films made over the years, but few are as enjoyably awful as this one! Its one of my all time favorites! Yes, it's sad to see Lon Chaney, Jr. and J. Carrol Nash in their last roles, but what a way to go out! Director Al Adamson's wife, the busty dim witted bleach blonde Regina Carroll is used to great effect in her best role! We are treated to her incredible bad night club song and dance routine which is mind numbing! She's said to be a star in Las Vegas, but we only see one table of people in the audience, and sitting right in the middle is the director Al Adamson himself! Jim Davis, of Dallas, is a silly police detective who endlessly babbles his philosophy about the "freaks and weirdos." Great Grade Z supporting cast. Lots of tacky circa 1970 fashion, language, and situations (like Regina's acid trip). Zandar Vorkov is certainly filmdom's best-worst afro headed Dracula. His voice is processed through an echo device so cheap it makes Mexican radio sound realistic! Some of the Frankenstein effects are 40 year old original Universal props! Wonderful schlock from master crap film maker Al Adamson. Don't miss it!
